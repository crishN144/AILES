Her mother has been married before and has two daughters from that relationship. The oldest (Q) is at university here. Her relationship with the mother is very strained at the moment and they do not see each other. The next daughter (R ) is about to go to university and has a good relationship with the mother. Their father sadly died in 2022.  The sisters see each other and have a good relationship with P, taking into account their different ages.</p>

Until about 2007 (the exact timing is not clear) the mother was a Japanese national. It is not possible to have dual nationality under Japanese law so when the mother became a US national through her marriage to her first husband her Japanese nationality was formally lost.  In fact the mother did not notify the authorities about this and kept her Japanese passport and travelled on it. P obtained Japanese nationality.  The parents submitted their marriage certificate (they married in another country in the far east) to the Japanese Embassy in that country and it was accepted (apparently in error).</span></p>

A nanny from the Far East accompanied them and still lives with the family in England.  In 2017 the mother returned to live in the Middle East leaving the three children with this father. In 2018 the mother went to live in Japan with her partner.  In the years that followed she spent time in England with P and her older daughters, returning to the family home in England where the father still lived.</span></p>

The father was willing to discuss this but reluctant. Quite soon after this he expressed a strong objection to this.  Proceedings were started. The parties went to mediation but it was not successful.</span></p>

The father became concerned that the mother would remove P without his consent and took her passports out of the house for safekeeping. The mother attempted to get a passport from the Japanese embassy but states that she quickly withdrew her application (it seems likely that this was around 23.6.21).  A prohibited steps order was made by Peel J on 25.6.21, without notice.  The day before that, the mother called the police and made allegations that the father had been violent to her. He was charged with causing Actual Bodily Harm and coercive and controlling behaviour.  Those charges were later dropped.</span></p>

The mother came to a decision not to pursue her application for P to live in Japan, and the parties came to terms about her visiting for holidays. The intention was that they would enter into a conciliation agreement in Japan which could then be registered as a court order, effectively a way of achieving a type of mirror order as a safeguard against P not being returned.</span></p>

This prompted the father&#8217;s Japanese lawyers to check the Japanese family register (known as the Koseki) for details.  This led to the discovery that the mother had unilaterally submitted a notification of divorce in Japan on which there was a forgery of the father&#8217;s signature. The document declared that the mother had sole custody of P and the father&#8217;s contact details were left out.  The mother had used the document she obtained to then make changes to the Koseki.</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The discovery of the divorce document caused the father grave anxiety about the mother&#8217;s motives, and the risk she would seek to retain P in Japan. In those circumstances he refused to go ahead with the conciliation agreement and the proceedings stalled for several months.  The father&#8217;s solicitors then suggested that the single joint expert should be instructed again to answer questions about the impact of the divorce document.  In May 2023 the mother applied to vary the order of 29.4.22, and in July 2023 the father applied to discharge the provision providing for P to spend time with the mother in Japan.  Those applications culminated in the hearing before me.</span></p>

A Child Arrangements Order made by an English court is very likely to be recognised in Japan as long it is not against public policy and the proceedings were properly served.  Although there is no system in Japan by which a foreign court order can be registered automatically, the mother and father can make an agreement in conciliation regarding child arrangements which mirrors the order here, and that is enforceable in the courts of Japan.  In those circumstances if a child is retained, the parent living in the foreign country may seek a handover in adjudication proceedings or for relief under the doctrine of habeas corpus.

ADR is available too.  As in this country the application is made to the Central Authority, and the court will apply the principles as set out in the Convention.  The burden on the taking parent to show grounds for non-return is high. Most of the arguments in such cases are about habitual residence or whether the grounds for the exercise of a discretion to refuse a return order are satisfied.  The Hague Implementation Act was passed in 2014 and amended in 2020 to address issues of enforcement and to make it easier and faster.  If an appropriate order is obtained enforcement officers visit the place where the taking parent and child are present to pick up the child.  For the year 2020 to 2021 the court ordered such an enforcement process in 5 cases and in 3 of those the return of the child was effected.

Nonetheless, standing back and considering it overall, I take the following from it.  If the parents make a conciliation agreement which reflects the English court order and also provides that the Japanese divorce notification is invalid, then the father is very likely to obtain a return order in proceedings in Japan. The mother is very unlikely to be able to argue successfully that the father does not have custody rights and that the order that P should be returned at the end of any Japanese holiday should not be enforced, whether this is achieved through proceedings under the Hague Convention or otherwise.  Under the Convention defences would be available to be argued, just as they are in this country but the mother would not be able to rely on the divorce notification or Koseki to show that she has sole custody.</span></p>

There are many occasions in which the mother has changed the contact arrangements and failed to return P home on time after contact. In doing so she has prayed in aid P&#8217;s wishes to stay longer, and has relied on P to ring her father to make such requests. For the most part these amount to an hour or night here and there, but on occasion it has stretched to several days.  In June 2023 the mother sent a postcard to P which said that &#8216;I try to work very hard so that mama and mama&#8217;s lawyers can make you come to Japan to be your home country&#8217;.

Nor did it appear to be at all logical.  Her behaviour and timing drive me to the conclusion that she deliberately and dishonestly submitted the document, with the father&#8217;s forged signature on it, in order to obtain sole custody of P in Japan without him knowing. She must have done it in the hope that it would obtain some advantage for her under Japanese law (in particular if she decided to keep P after any periods of holiday) whether or not that was correct.  It is highly significant that she did not include the father&#8217;s contact details on the document and she informed no-one involved in the proceedings here even though the expert report was produced only a few weeks later, and the hearing took place a week after that.

As Mr Jarman reminded me, this is an international family. P has spent time travelling abroad growing up, and her older sisters still do.  Her Japanese heritage is a very important part of her identity and she should be able to experience being in that country as she grows up.  There is also the simple fact of being able to enjoy her time with her mother in her mother&#8217;s own home and environment.  That matters for the development of their own relationship.

In this case there would be clear orders preventing the mother from trying to apply to make last minute changes to orders here and in Japan.

Despite all the safeguards in place, if she retains P the mother is likely to challenge any application for a return order forcefully through the court. This is likely to be time consuming, stressful and costly. It would be extremely disruptive and distressing for P, something that I am not at all sure the mother would be able to recognise.  The likelihood is that it could take several months for matters to be resolved.  There is also a risk, which I cannot ignore, that the mother will bring emotional pressure to bear on P to say she does not wish to return, or even to refuse to return. In those circumstances there is an obvious risk that enforcement of a return order would not be successful.  P has shown herself able to resist her mother in the course of the messages I have seen and the Guardian has noted that she is a resilient child, but she has never been so far away from her father, or for so long. It is difficult to say how she would respond to emotional pressure placed on her if she was in Japan.</span></p>

I think that is unlikely, but not impossible.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Therefore in assessing the magnitude of the consequences of a breach,  at the very least P is likely to suffer from disruption by being kept in Japan for a number of months and being subjected to legal proceedings and all the stress that surrounds it. She would miss out on her schooling in England and from seeing her father and other relatives, although not one of her sisters.  It would be a difficult episode for her although likely (but not definitely) resulting in a return.</span></p>

The benefits are outweighed by the risks. There is a limit to the level of security which can be achieved by building into the arrangements all available safeguards.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I come to this conclusion with considerable regret as I know that it will upset P, and the mother too.  Whilst I know that finances are tight, P has been able to have good quality contact with her mother in this country and I believe that there is no reason why this cannot continue.  P can see her sisters here as well. There are relatives in Japan who she will not be able to see for some years, but her maternal grandparents are no longer alive and the mother has no siblings.  In his evidence the father suggested that there should come a time when P would be sufficiently mature for the risks to lessen, and placed this at around the age of 14.  I would agree with this, although this is difficult to gauge at the moment. Subject to any further submissions I would propose to extend the Prohibited Steps order until 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 2028.  Discharging it on that date would leave time to organise a summer holiday in Japan that year, although that does not prevent any earlier application to discharge the order, or an application (although I hope it will not be necessary) for it to be further extended.  Any holiday dates should be agreed well in advance, with details of the itinerary. </span></p>

As the effect of my order is there will be no summer holiday in Japan, my suggestion is (if the mother is willing and able to spend time in England) that P spends five weeks of the seven week holiday with the mother, and two with the father.  P should always be returned two nights before the start of any school term following periods of holiday contact.  If there are any other issues between the parties, I invite them to be brought to my attention and I will determine them on the papers.</span></p>
