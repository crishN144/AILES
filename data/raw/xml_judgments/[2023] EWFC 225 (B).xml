	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The Applicant is the Local Authority. This Local Authority first applied to the Court on 17 February 2022 seeking a Care Order with concerns that the children were both suffering or were at risk of suffering significant harm in the form of physical harm, emotional harm and neglect, arising from the mother&#8217;s poor mental health, including suicidal ideation, and the impact of the mother&#8217;s mental health on the children. Further, the Local Authority had concerns about &#8216;B&#8217;s complex behaviour at home. The Local Authority was concerned that the mother&#8217;s engagement during a Child in Need plan was very limited, not making herself available for appointments and that attempts by professionals to ascertain the wishes and feelings of the children was largely unsuccessful. On 9 February 2022, both children were placed under police protection and taken to their maternal grandparents.  The children returned to the care of their mother during the proceedings.  At final hearing, the Court, having the benefit of independent expert evidence from Dr Ratnam, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist and Dr Willemsen, Clinical Psychologist, made a Supervision Order on 16 December 2022 for 12 months, with the plan that the children remained in the care of their mother. That outcome, advanced by the Local Authority, was supported by the Children's Guardian and by the mother, albeit that the mother took issue with the Local Authority&#8217;s support plan. Each of the professionals, and the Court, acknowledged that the plan was not without risk. A robust package of support was put in place.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0in">These current proceeding began on 17 March 2023, three months after the first proceedings concluded. The Local Authority expressed concern that, despite the professional support in place, the mother was not able to meet the needs of the children consistently, with concerns around volatility in the relationship between the mother and the children. The Local Authority reported that on <span style="color:initial">17 February 2023, the mother told the ARC Rapid Response Team that she could not cope with &#8216;B&#8217;s behaviour and that she would leave the house and leave him there. On 24 February 2023, it was reported that an argument occurred between the mother and &#8216;B&#8217;, witnessed by &#8216;G&#8217;. It was reported that the social worker was required to intervene as neither the mother nor &#8216;B&#8217; were able to regulate themselves. The mother is said to have informed &#8216;B&#8217;s boarding school on 6 March 2023 that she could not cope with &#8216;B&#8217; when he returned home at weekends. &#8216;B&#8217; is reported to have become extremely dysregulated. The Local Authority was concerned that the mother struggled to manage the behaviours of both children and reported that she could not cope. The Local Authority was concerned that the mother was unwilling to put into practice strategies suggested by professionals working with her. Further, the mother was reported to continue to express suicidal ideation, including thoughts about harming the children. </span></p>

The mother is reported to have refused to attend hospital, against advice. Further, concerns were expressed by ARC about the amount of medication in the home.</span></p>

That application, opposed by the Local Authority and opposed by the Guardian, was made extremely late in the proceedings. The application was unsuccessful, for reasons given by the Court in a full extempore oral judgment at the conclusion of the first day of the Final Hearing.  In short summary, the Court was satisfied that &#8216;G&#8217; had a solicitor appointed to represent her under Family Procedure Rule 16, who receives instructions from the Guardian. Whilst &#8216;G&#8217;s wishes to return to her mother&#8217;s care immediately conflict with the Guardian&#8217;s recommended welfare outcome for &#8216;G&#8217;, the Court found no reason to depart from the conclusion reached by the child&#8217;s specialist, experienced solicitor that &#8216;G&#8217; was not competent to give direct instructions, having regard to the child&#8217;s understanding. The child&#8217;s solicitor, in reaching that assessment, had the benefit of independent expert evidence from the recent previous proceedings, from Dr Willemsen, who had assessed the child as lacking competence. Further, the solicitor undertook her own competence assessment at the start of and towards the end of these proceedings.</span></p>

What is sufficient understanding in any given case will depend upon all the facts. The Court recognised that caution needed to be exercised before allowing a conclusion to deny a child of &#8216;G&#8217;s age (she will turn 16 years old in two months) her own solicitor on the basis that she lacks sufficient understanding. The Court took into consideration the checklist of factors derived from the authorities, including, (a) the level of intelligence of the child, (b) her emotional maturity, (c) factors which might undermine her understanding such as issues arising from her emotional, psychological, psychiatric or emotional state, (d) the child&#8217;s reasons for wishing to instruct a solicitor directly or to act without a Guardian and the strength of feeling accompanying the wish to play a direct role, (e) her understanding of the issues in the case and her desired outcome, (f)  any matter which sheds light on the extent to which those are authentically her own or are mere parroting of one parents position and (g) her understanding of the process of litigation, including the function of their lawyer, the role of the Judge, the role they might play and the law that is applied and some of the consequences of involvement in litigation, with care taken not to impose too high a level of understanding in this regard. Further, the Court took into consideration the risk of harm to the child of direct participation, compared with the risk of harm arising from excluding her from direct participation and her appreciation of the risks of harm, noting that the child will obviously need to comprehend enough of what the case is about, without being expected to display too sophisticated an understanding and must have the capacity to give her own coherent instructions. The Court took into consideration the fact that the assessment will not be driven by welfare factors or by a theoretical comparison between protection and autonomy but by a practical assessment of the child's understanding in the particular context of the case, with care being taken not to over-value any particular feature.</p>

She has consistently shared those views over recent months. Those strongly held views have been shared with the Court through the Children's Guardian Further, &#8216;G&#8217; took the time to write a letter to me setting out her views and furthermore, prepared an audio recording reiterating her strongly held wish to return to her mother. The Court is grateful to &#8216;G&#8217; for taking the time to express her views and for making her wishes and feelings very clear indeed. Her wishes, as expressed in that letter and audio recording to me, are entirely consistent with the wishes she expressed through her Children's Guardian. The Court notes with regret that, whilst &#8216;G&#8217; also made a request to meet with me, it was not possible for such a meeting to be arranged. This Court always takes very seriously any request for a child to meet the Judge who is making important decisions in their lives in proceedings of this nature in the Family Court. This Court will strive to make time available to meet with children who express such a wish, in accordance with the guidelines for Judges Meeting Children who are subject to Family Proceedings, produced by the Family Justice Council and approved by the President of the Family Division, to enable children to feel more involved and connected with proceedings, to give them an opportunity to satisfy themselves that the Judge has understood their wishes and feelings and to understand the nature of the Judge&#8217;s task.   Regrettably, &#8216;G&#8217;s request to meet me was made very late in this case, only after the Issues Resolution Hearing. Even then, the Court did not receive the information the Court was entitled to respect, as required under the guidelines, in a timely manner. The extreme and unrelenting pressures on the Family Court system presently are such that in this case, there was simply, and highly regrettably, no time available at all for suitable arrangements to be made to meet with &#8216;G&#8217;, either during or outside ordinary Court hours. This Court acknowledges the fundamental importance for children of having a voice in proceedings of this nature. Through her Children's Guardian, through her mother and through &#8216;G&#8217;s written and audio messages to me, this Court is entirely satisfied that, not only has &#8216;G&#8217; been consulted in respect of the decisions the Court is required to make  regarding her welfare, she has had the opportunity to be heard in these Court proceedings through her highly experienced Cafcass appointed Guardian in accordance with the Family Procedure Rules and has exercised her right to express those views freely in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Court has heard &#8216;G&#8217;s views, voiced in the strongest possible terms. Those views are perfectly clear to me.</p>

Moreover, the time taken to hear that preliminary application directly impacted on the ability of the Court to determine the final hearing within the three days set aside. As a consequence, the Court was not able to reach a final welfare determination on the last day of the hearing, namely 17 November 2023, meaning a further delay for the children in their case being determined.   At the conclusion of the third day of the Final Hearing, there being insufficient time for oral submissions, the parties agreed, and the Court directed, written submissions by Wednesday 22 Nov</span>ember 2023. This reserved written judgment was circulated to the parties in on Monday 27 November 2023 in advance of formal hand down on 30 November 2023.

He struggled to regulate his emotions, he was often rude, used derogatory language and presented as angry and upset. Since being looked after, there has been a significant change in his presentation, which the social worker described as being, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">almost instantaneous</span><span style="color:initial">.&#8221; Despite being upset about becoming looked after, &#8216;B&#8217; did not present in a rude aggressive or angry way to his carers and while there have been instances of this, the majority of the time &#8216;B&#8217; is described as presenting as stable and settled. The Local Authority and Children's Guardian are both concerned that if &#8216;B&#8217; was to return home without his mother having the opportunity to engage with an appropriate treatment plan, there is a risk that her mental health will deteriorate again, and the family will find themselves back to where they were before.</span></p>

I take those wishes and feelings into consideration. The wishes and feelings of a mature child do not carry any presumption of precedence over any of the other factors in the welfare checklist. The child's preference is only one factor in the case and the Court is not bound to follow it. The weight to be attached to the child's wishes and feelings will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. In particular, having regard to the words of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref>(a), it is important in every case that the question of the weight to be given to the child's wishes and feelings is evaluated by reference to the child's age and understanding. Within this context, and on the face of it, the older the child the more influential will be their views in the decision-making process. However, ultimately, the decision is that of the Court and not of the child. Once again, it is important to recall in this context that children's best interests are the Court's paramount consideration. On the specific facts of this case, &#8216;B&#8217;s specific needs are not capable of being met by his mother at this stage. That is so, whether &#8216;B&#8217; was placed in his mother&#8217;s care as the only child at home or whether &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;G&#8217; returned to their mother&#8217;s care together. &#8216;B&#8217; requires highly attuned parenting to meet his complex needs. His current foster carers are providing that level of care. The foster carers also have a positive working relationship with &#8216;B&#8217;s mother. In the context of the mother&#8217;s own ongoing challenges with her mental health, it is plain that at this time, the weight of concerns now means that &#8216;B&#8217;s wishes are not capable of being realised, without causing him further significant harm, for the reasons articulated by the social worker and the Children's Guardian, which I respectfully endorse. </span></p>

There are differences in nonverbal communicative behaviours used for social interaction, and restricted and repetitive behaviours. These behavioural differences were present in the early developmental period and became more apparent as social demands increased and peers presented as better equipped to navigate the unwritten social rules of different environments. [&#8216;G&#8217;s] less well-developed ability to intuit expected social transactions leaves her feeling anxious and distant. The functional impact of this experienced anxiety translates into [&#8216;G&#8217;] being passive and looking blank, possibly in an effort to manage the environmental demands. Her need for support and adaptations to be able to function is significant as she also presents with significant executive functions deficits: disorganisation, lateness, unkemptness and a general lack of planning ability.&#8221;</span></p>

A fourth placement is proposed by the Local Authority, if the Court approves the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan. Following the making of the Interim Care Order, &#8216;G&#8217;s placement by the Local Authority with approved interim foster carers was not satisfactory. &#8216;G&#8217; disclosed to professionals, supported by audio recordings, that the foster carer was verbally abusive to another foster child. &#8216;G&#8217;s action in disclosing this information to professionals was entirely the right thing to do and was very brave. The Court approved &#8216;G&#8217;s immediate removal from that foster care placement. &#8216;G&#8217; moved for a short period to live with her maternal grandparents. Regrettably, it was known that such placement could only be a short-term interim placement as the maternal grandmother had caring responsibilities for her ill husband. Family Friends were nominated by the mother to care for &#8216;G&#8217;. I will refer to them as &#8216;F&amp;F&#8217;.  They were approved by the Local Authority and the change of interim care plan for &#8216;G&#8217; to move to their short-term care was approved by the Court.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Whereas the social worker and the Children's Guardian had completed their respective welfare analyses on the assumption that &#8216;G&#8217;s placement with &#8216;F&amp;F&#8217; could proceed on a long terms basis and provide &#8216;G&#8217; with stability, that situation changed significantly at the start of this Final Hearing when it became clear that &#8216;F&amp;F&#8217; gave notice to the Local Authority of termination of the placement with effect from 30 November 2023, such that the current placement is no longer a viable, realistic option for &#8216;G&#8217;. A change of placement for &#8216;G&#8217; will now be necessary. The options before the Court are either a return home for &#8216;G&#8217; to her mother&#8217;s care, to an environment which is familiar to her or moving to another foster care placement with people who are not known to her and who she has not met, in an environment that is unfamiliar to her. The change in circumstances for &#8216;G&#8217; must be considered also in the context of &#8216;G&#8217; having been exposed to emotional harm in her first foster care placement, where she experienced an abusive Local Authority foster carer. Furthermore, such change of circumstances must also be considered in the context of &#8216;G&#8217;s diagnoses, including ASD. Relevant also to such change in circumstances is &#8216;G&#8217;s strongly held wish not to stay in foster care. Indeed, &#8216;G&#8217; has expressed clearly an intention to leave any foster care placement as soon as she reaches the age of 16, in two months. Further, a change of circumstances for &#8216;G&#8217; of the type proposed by the Local Authority and supported by the Children's Guardian is in the context of a Local Authority care plan which envisages an undefined point in time when &#8216;G&#8217; would begin a managed transition back to her mother&#8217;s care, the effect of which is that &#8216;G&#8217; is not likely to invest emotionally in a change of placement. Furthermore, the change of circumstances for &#8216;G&#8217; that will follow at the conclusion of these proceedings next week must be considered in the context of &#8216;G&#8217;s education, coming at a time when &#8216;G&#8217; is preparing for her &#8216;GCSE mock examinations in January 2024 and final examinations in the summer term of 2024. The disruption consequent upon a change of placement will impact &#8216;G&#8217;, again, in the context of her diagnoses including ASD. This must further be considered in the context of &#8216;G&#8217; vocally expressing the wish to have educational support, in addition to emotional support, from her mother, who is a qualified teacher, working with children of &#8216;G&#8217;s age who have special educational needs. </p>

Dr Ratnam confirmed the mother&#8217;s diagnoses of recurrent depression, generalised anxiety and trichotillomania, being a form of self-harm, consistent with ASD and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. Dr Ratnam considered that, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">when depressed [the mother] could present as an emotionally remote figure to her children due to a preoccupation with negative thoughts.</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; Dr Ratnam considered that it was impossible to quantify the risks of the mother acting on thoughts of extended suicide involving her children but considered that the mother&#8217;s impulsivity and emotional dysregulation heighten the risks. Dr Ratnam informed the Court that, &#8220;a </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">parent with emotionally unstable personality disorder can have difficulty making sense of a child&#8217;s feelings&#8230;The parent may experience self-loathing in response to a child&#8217;s behaviour or the child&#8217;s distress and in turn, this could be projected into the child by hostile denigrating behaviour.</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; Dr Ratnam recommended that the mother continues with prescribed anti-depressant medication for at least six months following resolution of mood. In Dr Ratnam&#8217;s expert opinion, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (&#8220;DBT&#8221;), Mentalisation Based Therapy (&#8220;MBT&#8221;) or Cognitive Analytic Therapy (&#8220;CAT&#8221;) were appropriate treatments for Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, on a long-term basis lasting at least 12 months. Dr Ratnam considered it crucial for the mother to have an ASD assessment, noting that, if the mother meets the diagnostic criteria, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">this could impact on her engagement with the initial steps before therapeutic intervention because she does not view this as the therapy she needs.</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221;</span></p>

The judgment records that the parenting assessment was finely balanced but recommended that, with clear commitment from the mother to engage with recommended support and encourage the children to do the same, the children could safely remain in the primary care of their mother. The risk factors included the mother&#8217;s deteriorating mental health featuring self-harm and suicidal ideation, her psychological needs, a lack of insight and minimisation of professional&#8217;s concerns, the length of professional involvement and a lack of sustained positive changes, all being poor prognostic factors for change within the children&#8217;s timescales. The positive factors identified include the mother&#8217;s ability to be a forceful advocate for her children. The Local Authority identified a positive shift in the mother&#8217;s thinking and a further commitment to attending support services identified.</span></p>

[The mother] has certain expectations of the kind of life she would like, and expectations she has of her children, and there is a hiatus between these expectations and the possibilities for her children. The current situation, which she describes as overwhelming, and which to some extent is also driven by [&#8216;B&#8217;s] special needs, is a consequence of not feeling able she can relate fully to her children. It is difficult, I think, for [the mother] to &#8216;read&#8217; her children&#8217;s minds. This affects the children who may be left with a feeling that they do not do the right thing and, in turn, they do not feel understood, emotionally. The mother thought her comments relating to her suicidal ideation were taken too concretely by social services. She considered she would not act on these fantasies, but as Dr Ratnam pointed out, there is the concern about her impulsivity and the concern that she feels at the end of her tether. She feels people and professionals are not hearing her and are not providing adequate support. It seems to me that, irrespective of the actual level of risk, the mother underestimates how anxious professionals become when they hear about her suicidal ideation, and that the detail of her ideation frightens them. On the one hand, she wants professionals to notice her, but when they do, she rejects them. In other words, perhaps [the mother] is not aware just how anxious she is herself, although she is aware of her anger. Professionals are concerned about her, which does not mean [she] may not criticize the route social services choose to take, but that does not take away their level of concern.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.2in;margin-right:0in">Dr Harris considered that the mother&#8217;s <span style="color:initial">presentation over her adolescence and adult life is consistent with the notion that she is more susceptible to stress. In this state she can experience levels that lead to her not knowing what to do and how to problem solve. She finds it particularly hard to express her emotions in appropriate and adaptive ways. She can become stuck in these moments, then behaving in ways that reveal a felt desperateness to others, which understandably causes significant concern and worry to those around her. Dr Harris observed that the mother, with support and clear direction, can generate and consider new ideas in relationship to her children. Dr Harris considered that the mother will need to be supported to develop a toolkit of stress management and problem-solving processes to make use of in times of stress. Learning calming and psychological grounding strategies will be useful as will a template of problem solving which involves the identification of the problem and review of all the possible responses/solutions. </span></p>

She must work harder in her emotional regulation, mentalising abilities, flexibility of thought, and ability to proactively connect with her children and their interests. As such, episodes of increased stress and demand will lead to these abilities and behaviours being further compromised.&#8221;</span></p>

She is more open to the support of services and is more reflective when she attends. The appointments are being used more appropriately and over the past 6 months or so have been less a case of managing risk and more about [the mother] wanting to have an understanding of why she finds certain things difficult as well as her wanting to find appropriate ways to manage her distress. A good example is that the need for an autism assessment has gone from something that she expressed anger towards and didn&#8217;t want to complete, to something that would enable her to have an understanding of herself and has now become something that she is able to reflect on and see the positives in spending time to answer this question. I have found that [the mother] is taking more responsibility for her past and present actions. She continues to find the system frustrating and the rules that have been put in place for her. I am sure that her autism has some impact on this. Despite this she seems to be happier to go along with these suggestions and often sees that there is a point to this at a later date. She has been reflecting about things that she hasn&#8217;t done well with regards her parenting. She has also been more accepting of things in her past which have and continue to impact on her presentation and behaviour. [The mother&#8217;s] suicidal thoughts have now improved and there have not been any thoughts of her wanting to end the life of her or the children using the car over the past 4 months. She is much calmer and more reflective and her self-harming has almost disappeared. [The mother] is more able to speak about her past and the traumas that she has been subjected to in the past. It has understandably taken her a long time to build the trust to speak about these things but it seems that this has been increasingly easier for her to do. She has had a big reduction in her suicidal thoughts and has reflected on these, recognising that this behaviour has come from a place of her feeling overloaded with everything she has to contend with and perhaps these were a way of showing her distress and not her wanting to end her life. She has been able to reflect that these weren&#8217;t helpful behaviours and can see that this led to the concerns that Children&#8217;s Social Care had regarding her children&#8217;s wellbeing and safety. [The mother] has also had a reduction in her self-harming thoughts. She has self-harmed once since the children have been removed. I have been surprised how well she has coped with the upheaval of losing access to her children and she has been able to use her time appropriately; filling this with activities that allow her to care for herself and improve her wellbeing and this is a very positive change. [The mother] has recently started work with one of our psychologists, Dr Dean, in order to complete an assessment of her need and willingness to work with psychology&#8230;she is engaging well.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother and &#8216;G&#8217; have had unsupervised contact since April 2023 with no reported concerns. They communicate by telephone three times each day and by text up to twenty times each day. The assessment concluded that the mother&#8217;s capacity to provide robust and consistent parenting to the children is dependent on her achieving and maintaining good mental health.

There is a need for the mother to engage with appropriate package of support to increase her emotional wellbeing and develop coping strategies and stress management tools.

In that case, Peter Jackson LJ </span>proposed that when analysing the risks likely to arise if a child is, on the one hand, placed with the birth family or, on the other hand, placed for adoption, the Court should consider (1) the type of harm that might arise, (2) the likelihood of it arising, (3) the severity of the consequences if it did, and (4) what could be done to reduce or mitigate it. (5) The Court should then compare the overall welfare advantages and disadvantages of rehabilitation and (6) ask itself whether adoption is ultimately necessary and proportionate. In my judgement, the approach recommended by the Court of Appeal has the same utility in a non-adoption case where there are competing realistic welfare options for the child that fall to be considered. </p>

Even on the Local Authority&#8217;s own aspiration of future reunification on an indeterminate future date, the Local Authority is not recommending long term ongoing intervention. It is difficult to understand why the Local Authority did not address its mind to immediate support services being put in place now to bolster immediate reunification. Moreover, the social worker&#8217;s evidence that the Local Authority&#8217;s own inhouse support by way of a Life Coach through its Building Bridges Team could only be made available if a Care Order was made, was particularly troubling. Each of the professionals considers that a Life Coach is necessary to support the mother if &#8216;G&#8217; returns to her care. The Local Authority has that resource in house. If that support is necessary and the resource is available as inhouse service, it would be wholly wrong for the Local Authority to require the carriage of a Care Order to put that resource into effect. </p>

The social worker was taken by the Court to the welfare analysis in her final statement where the social worker set out her analysis of the strengths and weakness of a Supervision Order with &#8216;G&#8217; returning home.

The analysis of the advantages of this option did not include the benefits of &#8216;G&#8217; being supported by her mother in her education during this crucial period leading to GCSE mocks and final exams, in the knowledge that &#8216;G&#8217; seeks the support of her mother in her education and in the knowledge that her mother is a Secondary School teacher with specific current experience of teaching to GCSE level.</p>

It is wrong to make a Care Order in order to impose duties on a Local Authority or use it to encourage the Local Authority to perform the duties that they have to a child in need The protection of the child is the decisive factor, but proportionality is key when making the choice between a Care Order and a Supervision Order for a child who is placed at home.

There are, in the specific circumstances of this case, no clear safeguarding features consequent upon a Care Order being made, over the protections afforded by and features of a Supervision Order.  The existence of Care Order would not, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, place the Local Authority in a significantly different position with regard to removal in an emergency situation than would otherwise be the case. </p>

Whilst the making of a Supervision Order is a clear interference with the Article 8 rights of &#8216;G&#8217; and her mother, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, a Supervision Order of six months&#8217; duration is necessary and is made in accordance with law and with the legitimate aim of promoting &#8216;G&#8217;s welfare. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, that interference is necessary and is a proportionate response, having regard to the risks and having regard to the welfare evaluation. On the facts of the case, the interference in the Article 8 rights of &#8216;G&#8217; and her mother that would result from a Supervision Order is a necessary interference and one that is proportionate to the essential end of promoting &#8216;G&#8217;s welfare, having regard to Article 8(2) of the European Convention. </p>

However, the full four hours of available time is not utilised by her. &#8216;B&#8217; is generally returned to his foster carer by the mother after two hours. The mother tells the Court that &#8216;B&#8217; enjoys activity-based contact, including swimming or bowling. The mother tells the Court that contact takes place in a rural location where activities are limited. Presently, she is not permitted, by conditions imposed by the Local Authority, to drive &#8216;B&#8217; in a car during the contact time, limiting her ability to travel to another activity. Further, having regard to &#8216;B&#8217;s particular needs, he does not like crowded places and does not like to travel by public transport, including by bus or train. The mother submits that &#8216;B&#8217; would benefit from her being able to drive him to a second subsequent activity in another area, whereby she could spend longer time with him. She proposes spending a whole day with &#8216;B&#8217;. She wishes to be able to take him to the family home. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">The Children's Guardian submits that she would wish to see the mother utilise the full four hours of available contact before moving to a longer period of contact. The Children's Guardian agrees to the mother&#8217;s proposal to remove of the restriction on the mother driving &#8216;B&#8217; in her car, subject to the mother&#8217;s mental health remaining stable. The Guardian considers that removing this restriction will allow the mother to spend her time appropriately with &#8216;B&#8217; at more than one contact location. The Children's Guardian is clear that the mother should not take &#8216;B&#8217; to the family home during contact. In this regard, the Guardian agrees with the Local Authority that it would be emotionally harmful for &#8216;B&#8217;, who will remain a &#8216;looked after&#8217; child, to be taken to his former family home for the purposes of contact with his mother. The Guardian considered that it would be really difficult for &#8216;B&#8217; at the end of contact to have to leave the family home and return to his foster care placement, having regard to his complex needs and the historical difficulties experienced by the mother in early 2023 in getting &#8216;B&#8217; to leave home in order to attend school. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">In this regard, I find no reason to disagree with the reasons expressed by the Children's Guardian. First, there would appear to be no solid evidenced-based reason to conclude that the current restrictions imposed by the Local Authority on prohibiting the mother from driving &#8216;B&#8217; during contact should continue. Second, the existing permitted contact arrangements of four hours are consistently being brought to an end by the mother after two hours. There is no solid welfare-based reason to conclude that the mother could manage &#8216;B&#8217;s welfare needs for one full day, when presently she terminates contact early after two hours. If, with the benefit of being able to drive &#8216;B&#8217; to another activity, the mother could consistently engage &#8216;B&#8217; in four hours of contact, without it impacting negatively on his welfare, the Court would expect the Local Authority during its ongoing reviews, to consider an increase in the contact time &#8216;B&#8217; spends with his mother, having regard also to the impact on &#8216;G&#8217; of the mother spending longer periods of time with &#8216;B&#8217; away from the family home. There are patently very strong welfare reasons for &#8216;B&#8217;s contact not to take place at the family home, for the reasons articulated by the Children's Guardian and by the social worker. Contact for &#8216;B&#8217; at the family home would inevitably cause him distress, knowing that &#8216;G&#8217; could remain in the home but he was required to leave to return to his foster care placement. The Local Authority would be expected to keep the matter under review as part of its ongoing Looked After Child review process. The Court invites the Local Authority to amend its care plan for &#8216;B&#8217; in so far as the plan prohibits the mother from driving during contact. In other respect, the Court endorses the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan for &#8216;B&#8217;. A section 34 contact Order, as sought by the mother, is not necessary. </p>
