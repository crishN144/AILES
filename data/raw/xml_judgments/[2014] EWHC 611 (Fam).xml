	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband and wife met in 2005 and started living together in April 2009. He is American having been born in Los Angeles; she is English having been born in London. Their daughter was born in London on 21 June 2008.  The husband and wife married in California on 20 August 2011 following the making of a premarital agreement on 18 August 2011. On 21 January 2014 Mrs Justice Hogg found that by February 2012, at the latest, the family was living in California. Their son was born in California on 21 August 2012. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 October 2012 all four members of the family came to England. Mrs Justice Hogg in proceedings under the Hague Convention found that when the wife refused to let the children return on return tickets on 30 October 2012 the children were wrongfully retained in England and Wales. She ordered that they be returned to California on 17 February 2014. On that day the wife, the husband and the children duly returned to California. No member of this family is now present in England.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Meanwhile on 10 May 2013 the wife issued divorce proceedings in London. She filed a Form A seeking financial remedies on the same day. She also issued an application for orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. On 3 June 2013 the husband filed for divorce in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The parties attempted mediation about all issues here in September and October 2013, but without success. They filed voluntary Forms E setting out their then respective financial positions prior and for the purposes of that mediation. In the financial proceedings the wife incurred costs, some of which were paid by the husband but of which &#163;7,268 is unpaid.  On 10 January 2014 she applied for a LSPO to seek this sum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 January 2014 the husband applied for a stay of the wife&#8217;s divorce proceedings pursuant to Schedule 1 para 9 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973</ref>. This application came before Deputy District Judge Elliot on 28 February 2014 for directions. He decided to deal with the substantive application, which was perhaps an unusual course as, at any rate in my experience, applications for a stay on the ground of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> are usually, and should be, heard by a High Court Judge. He granted the stay but excepted from his order the wife&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s22</ref>ZA for a LSPO. He made no order as to costs. It is the exception order which the husband seeks to appeal. He argues that the Deputy District Judge had no power when ordering a stay of the main suit to except a subsidiary interim financial application from its application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 February 2014 (the day after her return) the wife filed a response to the husband&#8217;s divorce petition in California, seeking dissolution of marriage, a determination of the enforceability of the parties&#8217; pre-marital agreement and an order allowing relocation of the children back to England. She also issued interrogatories and demands for production of documents at her attorney&#8217;s office on 28 March 2014. There is a case management conference at court in Los Angeles on 11 June 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I revert to the Hague Convention proceedings here. These were issued by the husband on 31 July 2013. The final hearing date was fixed for 21 January 2014. On 14 January 2014 the wife applied under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s15</ref> and Schedule 1 para 1(2)(c) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for a lump sum to cover her costs of the final hearing. Although no payment was ordered or voluntarily made prior to the hearing the wife&#8217;s lawyers appeared and she was represented. At the hearing the husband agreed to make a gratuitous payment of &#163;6,000 to cover counsel&#8217;s brief fee. The wife&#8217;s overall costs were however &#163;21,700. Therefore after payment of &#163;6,000 the sum of &#163;15,700 remained owing. The wife seeks to recover this amount by means of a lump sum under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s15</ref> and Schedule 1 para 1(2)(c) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

Her order made no order as to costs. However in a separate order made in the Schedule 1 application she recorded the husband&#8217;s payment of &#163;6,000 and gave directions for the application to be heard by me.</p>

The father himself remains, as he is entitled to do under the convention, in Lithuania. But, he is very well represented by his non-means-tested, fully publicly funded lawyers. The mother appears in person. She speaks negligible English. An interpreter has been provided by the court at the expense of public funds. The adult daughter, who speaks much more fluent English, is kindly here to assist her mother, but does not need to be. The father's solicitors have also necessarily engaged their own Lithuanian interpreter, also at the expense of public funds, so that they can communicate from the court here with their client in Lithuania, who I infer speaks no English.

On the one hand, this is a blatant case of wrongful retention after an agreed short holiday here. On the other hand, on the alleged facts as I have summarised them, there is clearly a properly arguable case, with at least a realistic prospect of success, that there is a grave risk that the return of the child forthwith to Lithuania would expose her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation; and, separately, that she does object to being returned (having identified 10 on the scale given to her) and that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. The mother is simply incapable of presenting and developing her case properly. She does not know the complex law. She has to communicate through the interpreter. The father has all the resources of state-funded lawyers. This is not equality of arms, as the fair trial provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights require. The father's own very experienced barrister in this field, Mr Nicholas O'Brien, said that he did not resist an adjournment "since there is a considerable risk of unfairness to the mother and the child if the case proceeds today". </p>

Mr Hames was not able to tell me of any case where a costs allowance had been sought, let alone awarded, in Hague Convention proceedings whether under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s5</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>. I am sure that one will arise, probably in the near future. How the tension will be resolved will have to left for decision when such an issue actually arises. </p>

Such an application is dependent for its existence and validity on the continuance of the main suit. This is why in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> financial relief is described as being &#8220;ancillary&#8221; to the main suit.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that Deputy District Judge Elliot had no power to except the application for a LSPO from the stay that he ordered of the wife&#8217;s divorce suit. Accordingly I grant the husband permission to appeal from that order and allow the appeal. That ought to lead to the LSPO application being stayed and therefore technically capable of revival. But for the reasons I have given the application is fatally flawed and meritless. It will therefore be dismissed. I reach the same conclusion in relation to the wife&#8217;s application for a lump sum pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s15</ref> and Schedule 1 para 1(2)(c) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>
