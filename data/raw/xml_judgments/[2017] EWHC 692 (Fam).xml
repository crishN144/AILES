	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Events since the December hearing require discussion given that the sense amongst the parties to the care proceedings is that the SSHD&#8217;s action or inaction has led to avoidable delay. As Ms Morgan QC (on behalf of the local authority) points out, the SSHD has not complied with disclosure orders made as long ago as 4 October 2016. The order consequent upon the judgment of December 2016 required the SSHD to make any application for PII and / or a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18/section/6/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.6 (2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18" uk:canonical="2013 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Justice and Security Act 2013</ref> (JSA), on notice to all parties, by 20 January 2017. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 20 January, the SSHD provided an &#8216;open gist&#8217; document which summarised the facts and the chronology leading to the refusal of the father&#8217;s application for a passport. In an accompanying letter, the Government Legal Department (GLD) confirmed that it did not intend to invite me to make a declaration under the JSA or seek to introduce evidence into a closed material procedure (CMP). It was said that the SSHD continued to &#8220;make preparations for a potential PII application&#8221; but there were &#8220;a number of complications&#8221; that the GLD had been unable to resolve. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The letter referred to the listed hearing on 25 January, stated that the GLD was &#8220;mindful of the need to progress the proceedings&#8221; and requested a CLOSED hearing of an hour and a half to enable Counsel for the SSHD to make submissions in relation to sensitive material. It was anticipated that some CLOSED material would be made available to me in advance of the hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response to that letter, I received and read a very small bundle of CLOSED material on the morning of 25 January prior to the OPEN hearing. With the benefit of hindsight, I should not have done so prior to hearing from the parties. It rapidly became apparent that the father&#8217;s legal team, then headed by Ms Cover, objected to a CLOSED hearing, questioning under what procedure one was sought. A similar challenge was raised by Ms Fottrell QC who then represented the local authority. The suggestion was that by sending CLOSED documents to the court, the SSHD was attempting to &#8220;initiate a closed material procedure notwithstanding that no application for one had been made.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other limitation of the hearing on 25 January was that for reasons of over subscription it would not have been possible to convene a CLOSED hearing. There was no available court room. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response to the submissions of Ms Cover and Ms Fottrell, I adjourned the hearing on 25 January and requested written submissions from Ms Wheeler QC as to the basis upon which a CLOSED hearing was required. The parties were given an opportunity to respond in writing. The case was listed again on 15 March 2017.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Wheeler&#8217;s written submissions of 6 February made clear that the holding of a CLOSED hearing and consideration of CLOSED documentation is an inevitable and unexceptional vehicle to air disclosure issues used routinely in all types of legal proceedings. Without such a facility, Ms Wheeler suggested, there would be no means for those seeking to withhold material to explain the legal basis of their doing so. Of necessity, it was said, these are <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> hearings where the handling of CLOSED documentation requires special facilities. The situation at the time those submissions were prepared was that the SSHD was considering whether to make an application for PII.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties provided detailed written submissions in response from which, in varying degrees, there was palpable discontent that the SSHD&#8217;s position continued to be obscure and failed to adhere to established processes. To take but one example, Mr Twomey QC, on behalf of the father, complained that the SSHD was seeking &#8220;to set aside, vary or render nugatory the order of 4 October by an approach which lacks rigor, fairness and / or any prior agreed planning.&#8221; He continued by suggesting that the process I was being invited to adopt was &#8220;neither the well-established process where PII is asserted nor the closed material process under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18" uk:canonical="2013 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">JSA 2013</ref>.&#8221; Any consideration of relevant material, said Mr Twomey, must fall under one or the other; or the GLD must disclose the material as directed. He also submitted that any process adopted by the court must comply with the basic principles of natural justice and respect the parties&#8217; rights to a fair trial. It was said that the SSHD&#8217;s approach was neither fair nor based upon principles of natural justice.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whether as a direct result of the parties&#8217; written submissions or not, the SSHD issued her application for PII on 7 March. Ms Wheeler argues, and the parties agree, that the majority of the points raised in objection to a CLOSED hearing were answered by the filing of the PII application. In particular, there was no opposition from any quarter to the suggestion that the application should be dealt with in a CLOSED hearing; and no party pressed for the appointment of a Special Advocate for the purpose of resolving the application.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I quite accept that the courts and the SSHD are even now in the relatively early stages of grappling with the problems consequent upon proceedings of this kind. I would be the first to accept that I have been engaged in a learning exercise. I suspect the same may be true for those advocates who have not hitherto had much experience of dealing with cases where PII might be asserted in circumstances such as these.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At all events, there are some obvious conclusions to be drawn from events in this case. The first is that where the SSHD is faced with disclosure orders relating to material which is or may be sensitive and where the likelihood is that PII will be asserted, it is incumbent upon the GLD to set up a process for early and definitive decision making. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The spectre of a potential PII claim was manifest in this case from as far back as 3 November 2016. On that day, I received an urgent letter from the GLD, indicating there was material which for reasons of national security the SSHD was not at liberty to disclose. A further period of 28 days was requested to further consider the information with a view to either effecting disclosure, advancing a claim for PII or seeking a declaration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.6</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18" uk:canonical="2013 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">JSA 2013</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the 2 December hearing, the indications were that if the SSHD was unsuccessful in her bid to revoke the 4 October 2016 disclosure order, she would claim PII. As I observed towards the end of the December judgment, until there was a PII Certificate containing the SSHD&#8217;s judgment as to the harm to the public interest that would be caused by disclosure and the weight to be given to competing public interests, there was no appropriate mechanism for action.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is disappointing to say the least that the PII Certificate was not issued until 7 March 2017, some three months later, and at a time when no fewer than four distinguished legal teams had spent a great deal of time and effort considering a landscape which did not comprise a claim for PII. Had the claim been made sooner, those endeavours would have been largely unnecessary. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Doubtless the GLD is an over-stretched organisation with many competing calls upon the time of those who work within. However, with an eye to the future and other similar cases, it seems to me that there must be mechanisms for significantly swifter specialist advice and consequent action. Had there been an application for PII in the autumn of last year, it would have been resolved before Christmas; the hearing of 2 December would have been superfluous to requirements; and the care proceedings would not have been mired in procedural argument for more than three additional months pending resolution of these issues.</p>

The earlier there is (can be) precision the better. The stop / start approach of the last four to five months has been distinctly unhelpful. By some mechanism or another, strategies for avoiding anything similar should be devised as a matter of urgency.</p>

As he correctly identifies, on 25 January I met briefly with two members of the GLD to take possession of a bundle of CLOSED material; and I concluded that a hearing in CLOSED would be required. Mr Twomey maintained that the parties were unaware of what was said on behalf of the SSHD on that occasion and what I was shown. In fact, as Ms Wheeler related in her submissions of 6 February 2017, the documents I had read were CLOSED submissions and a Sensitive Schedule (also known as a damage assessment) explaining why the SSHD contends material should be withheld, the nature of the damage were disclosure to be ordered and the reasons for delay in progressing a formal claim for PII. But I was not provided with the material over which a claim for PII is being considered.</p>

There is obvious force in the submissions jointly made that such strategies would only become available if the parents were to agree. Without a consensus, there could be no mandate.</p>

On any view, the material could not be provided to (and therefore be used by) the local authority for the purpose of legal proceedings, whether to inform its assessment of risk or for the purpose of commissioning any expert intervention. Moreover, the material does not advance an understanding of the parental relationship or contact with or intentions towards the child.</span></p>

I do not believe that the orders were couched inappropriately widely. It was made clear that the SSHD was being asked only to reveal material which she was at liberty to disclose. It was difficult if not impossible to avoid seeking disclosure of material which may be subject to PII when the local authority (and I) had no basis for concluding that it did. Equally importantly, the GLD&#8217;s indications as to likely applications were imprecise and when timeframes were imposed to establish a concluded position, more often than not they were missed. </p>
