	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This judgment concerns the decision as to whether to proceed with the lay evidence in this case remotely or whether to adjourn the case having heard the medical evidence. I have heard five days of medical evidence remotely through the Zoom platform and, as is explained in more detail below, I adjourned the trial at that point to hear submissions as to whether the hearing should continue with evidence from the parents and other lay witnesses via Zoom. An issue then arose as to the Father&#8217;s mental health and, ultimately he asked for an adjournment on the grounds of ill-health rather than specifically the remote hearing aspect of the case. I will deal with that adjournment application later in the judgment.  </p>

In April 2019 his two month old sister, AX, died at home of unknown causes. When a post-mortem and subsequent investigations were carried out it was established that AX had sustained 65 fractures to various parts of her body including ribs and long bones, as well as a subdural haemorrhage, axonal injury to the brain and retinal haemorrhage. The local authority were granted an Interim Care Order and SX has been living with foster carers since then.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For reasons that are not relevant to this judgment there have been considerable delays in getting this matter to a full hearing. It was listed for a three week fact finding hearing commencing on 15 April 2020. Because of the delays in obtaining some of the forensic reports the LA decided not to seek findings in respect of cause of death but to proceed on the basis of the specific injuries shown in the medical evidence.  The LA threshold document alleges that the injuries were inflicted by one or both of the parents and that each parent knew that the other had caused injury or was likely to have caused injury to AX. No other person is in the pool of alleged perpetrators and neither parent has suggested that any other person looked after AX for a period which would have allowed them to inflict the injuries.  </p>

The Mother through Ms King has not disputed the medical evidence in respect of the injuries or that they were inflicted non-accidental injuries. Her position is that she did not cause the injuries and thus they can only have been caused by the Father. She says that she had no knowledge of AX having suffered any injuries. She alleges that she suffered domestic violence from the Father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The timetable of hearing was set for the medical witnesses to go first. I have heard evidence from Professor Al-Sarraj, Professor Mangham, Dr Marnerides, Dr Oates, Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow and Dr Cartlidge. I heard that evidence with all parties and witnesses appearing via Zoom. In my perception those hearings, over 5 days, worked reasonably smoothly. There were some technical problems but all the days&#8217; hearings went ahead with a limited need for breaks or gaps. On the first day both parents were </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">present and I was told that both had followed the hearing satisfactorily. However, on the second day I was told by Mr Tughan that the Father had been to hospital on the Tuesday night saying that he was suicidal and that he had decided not to participate for the rest of the week. I will return to this below. The Mother has heard and seen all the medical evidence (except that which she found too upsetting) and I was told by Ms King that she had been able to follow it to a satisfactory degree. I note here that some of the medical evidence was extremely technical and any lay person, whether in court or remotely, was at times going to find it hard to follow.  </p>

It was subsequently agreed that I would hear submissions on that issue on the afternoon of Monday 27 April and then reserve any decision until 28 April given that the Court of Appeal was due to be giving a judgment on another case concerning remote hearings on the 28th April.  </p>

Mr Tughan on behalf of the Father said that the Father was &#8220;desperate&#8221; to continue and to tell his side of the story. However, over the weekend the Father&#8217;s position changed. He informed his lawyers by email that he had gone to A&amp;E on the night of 21/22 April feeling suicidal and that since then he had felt unable to participate in the hearing. </p>

Dr McEvedy records that it may be appropriate for the Father to be placed on some anti-anxiety medication, although it is important that this does not impede his ability to concentrate and give evidence. The Father records that he has been able to communicate with his lawyers, but has not felt able to participate in the hearing in the previous week. My understanding of what he said to Dr McEvedy was not that the Father was not capable of participating, in terms of the technology, but rather that he felt too emotionally stressed by participating at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Covid 19 pandemic has come upon the world, and the UK judicial system in particular, in a sudden, unexpected and entirely unplanned manner. Courts and users have had to adapt very quickly to a totally unexpected situation. There have had to be extremely difficult judgements made about the importance of proceeding with cases in order to achieve the welfare of children whilst protecting the fair trial and broader interests of the parties and witnesses. </p>

However, there would be significant disadvantages to many children if all such cases were simply adjourned. This is particularly the case where it is becoming increasingly apparent that the impact of Covid 19 is likely to continue for many months, and this may make it very difficult to hold some of these cases in a normal court setting for a significant period of time.  </p>

In that case the President was considering a case involving a 7 year old child whose mother was alleged to have caused harm to the child by fabricated or induced illness (FII). It had been set down for a 15 day hearing. The child had been under an interim care order for 11 months. Initially all parties had accepted the need for remote hearing [8] in the light of the advice produced by MacDonald J on remote hearings.  </p>

I was told that all parties and the court had been influenced by the publication, shortly before 3 April, of advice produced by Mr Justice MacDonald on the conduct of remote hearings which gave an account [at paragraph 2.2.1] of a number of remote hearings that had been successfully accomplished in the early days following the lockdown. It would seem that those involved in this case read that advice as indicating that all hearings must now proceed as remote hearings and, I was told, the discussion during the hearing was about how the remote hearing would be conducted and not whether it should be heard remotely. If that was the understanding of MacDonald J&#8217;s document, it was a misunderstanding. MacDonald J&#8217;s document is firmly aimed at the mechanics of the process; it does not offer guidance, let alone give direction, on the wholly different issue of whether any particular hearing should, or should not, be conducted remotely. Establishing that a hearing can be conducted remotely, does not in any way mean that the hearing must be conducted in that way. </span></p>

The Father supported that position. The Mother&#8217;s counsel argued that the case must be adjourned. She did that largely on the basis that the Mother was not well enough to proceed. Given the nature of the case this was obviously a particularly problematic situation. The President at [20] referred to the possibility in some cases of the parent going to another place such as local authority offices to give evidence. However, this was not an option given that the Mother believed she had Covid 19.  </p>

A range of factors are likely to be in play, each potentially compelling but also potentially at odds with each other. The need to maintain a hearing in order to avoid delay and to resolve issues for a child in order for her life to move forward is likely to be a most powerful consideration in many cases, but it may be at odds with the need for the very resolution of that issue to be undertaken in a thorough, forensically sound, fair, just and proportionate manner. The decision to proceed or not may not turn on the category of case or seriousness of the decision, but upon other factors that are idiosyncratic of the particular case itself, such as the local facilities, the available technology, the personalities and expectations of the key family members and, in these early days, the experience of the judge or magistrates in remote working. It is because no two cases may be the same that the decision on remote hearings has been left to the individual judge in each case, rather than making it the subject of binding national guidance. </span></p>

I make the decision also being aware of the impact that this will have professionally on all of those who have had this fixture booked in their professional diaries for a long time and who are now ready for the hearing to take place.

The judge who undertakes such a hearing may well be able to cope with the cross-examination and the assimilation of the detailed evidence from the e-bundle and from the process of witnesses appearing over Skype, but that is only part of the judicial function.  The more important part, as I have indicated, is for the judge to see all the parties in the case when they are in the courtroom, in particular the mother, and although it is possible over Skype to keep the postage stamp image of any particular attendee at the hearing, up to five in all, live on the judge&#8217;s screen at any one time, it is a very poor substitute to seeing that person fully present before the court.  It also assumes that the person&#8217;s link with the court hearing is maintained at all times and that they choose to have their video camera on.  It seems to me that to contemplate a remote hearing of issues such as this is wholly out-with any process which gives the judge a proper basis upon which to make a full judgment.  I do not consider that a remote hearing for a final hearing of this sort would allow effective participation for the parent and effective engagement either by the parent with the court or, as I have indicated, the court with the parent.  I also consider that there is a significant risk that the process as a whole would not be fair. </span></p>

From week to week the experience of the courts and the profession is developing, so that what might, or might not, have been considered appropriate at one time may come to be seen as inappropriate at a later date, or vice versa. For example, it is the common experience of many judges that remote hearings take longer to set up and undertake than normal face-to-face hearings; consequently, courts are now listing fewer cases each day than was the case some weeks ago. On the other hand, some court buildings remain fully open and have been set up for safe, socially isolated, hearings and it may now be possible to consider that a case may be heard safely in those courts when that was not the case in the early days of &#8216;lockdown&#8217;. </span></p>

As will be seen, one important and potentially determinative factor was the ability of the father, as a result of his personality, intellect and diagnosis of dyslexia, to engage sufficiently in the process to render the hearing fair. Such a factor will, almost by definition, be case-specific. Another element, and one that is likely to be important in every case, is the age of the children and the degree of urgency that applies to the particular decision before the court.

That is because it has increasingly been recognised that it is usually unreliable and often dangerous to draw a conclusion from a witness's demeanour as to the likelihood that the witness is telling the truth. The reasons for this were explained by MacKenna J in words which Lord Devlin later adopted in their entirety and Lord Bingham quoted with approval:  </span></p>

Is that the mark of a cautious man, whose statements are for that reason to be respected, or is he taking time to fabricate? Is the emphatic witness putting on an act to deceive me, or is he speaking from the fullness of his heart, knowing that he is right? Is he likely to be more truthful if he looks me straight in the face than if he casts his eyes on the ground perhaps from shyness or a natural timidity? For my part I rely on these considerations as little as I can help." </span></p>

I have no doubt that immigration judges do learn much in the course of their work about different cultural attitudes and customs and that such knowledge can help to inform their decision-making in beneficial ways. But it would hubristic for any judge to suppose that because he or she has, for example, seen a number of individuals of Tamil origin giving oral evidence this gives him or her a privileged insight into whether a particular witness of that ethnicity is telling the truth. That would be to assume that there are typical characteristics shared by members of an ethnic group (or by human beings generally) which can be relied on to differentiate a person who is lying from someone who is telling what they believe to be the truth. I know of no evidence to suggest that any such characteristics exist or that demeanour provides any reliable indication of how likely it is that a witness is giving honest testimony. </span></p>

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence.

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision-making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the manner in which it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Goodwin and Mr Verdan also referred me to the fact that it is by now fairly common in Family and Criminal courts for lay witnesses of fact to give evidence remotely by video link where those witnesses are considered to be vulnerable. The procedure for doing so is dealt with extensively in PD3AA. It therefore must follow that the giving of evidence in this way does not undermine the fairness of the process either for the individuals concerned or other parties. I do however inject a note of caution here. If it were a case that a vulnerable witness were likely to be subject to complex cross examination, perhaps with references to a large number of documents, it is highly likely that they would have the assistance of an intermediary to assist them in managing the process. Therefore, the fact that evidence is given remotely is not itself sufficient to necessarily protect that witness.  </p>

One of the reasons that vulnerable witnesses often give evidence remotely is to protect them from the stresses of the courtroom. It may therefore be that a compromise is made for that category of witness, in order to balance fair process with the interest of the individual. However, as Mr Goodwin argued, it may also be the case that the vulnerable witness is more likely to give truthful and complete evidence if allowed to give it remotely, rather than in the witness box. So the benefit is not simply to the witness, but also potentially to the judicial process. </p>

However, the Mother&#8217;s position makes that course very difficult. She has indicated that she is not prepared to leave home and come to court at the present time.

I appreciate that I could order her to do so. However, to order someone who has a health condition and is particularly concerned therefore about Covid 19 to come to court against their wishes is not a course I would take lightly. I would also be concerned that if the Mother was very anxious about the risk to her health if she came to Court, then that would be likely to compromise her ability to give evidence.  </p>

The impact of the nature of the evidence on the decision as to whether a remote hearing is appropriate is perhaps the most complicated element of the assessment. It is in my view relatively straightforward to proceed remotely with professional evidence, here the medical evidence. It is very common to hear such evidence via video link in court. I note here that the technology in the courts, certainly in the Royal Courts of Justice, is less high quality and less reliable than my experience of proceeding with 5 days of remote evidence, by Zoom in this case. As long as the lay parties could follow the evidence, which they could in this case, I was entirely satisfied that it was fair to all concerned and met principles of natural justice to proceed with the professional evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In respect of the lay evidence there are a number of different factors. The first and most important must be whether it is just to the parties to proceed with them giving their evidence remotely. They must be able to follow the questions and be able to give their best in the answers. If the technology works, and they are in a position to understand the documents, then in principle a remote hearing is capable of being fair. As Mr Goodwin and Mr Verdan have pointed out, vulnerable witnesses routinely give evidence remotely in the family and criminal courts. Subject to all the protection in PD3AA, the assumption must be that such a process is capable of being fair and meets the requirements of Article 6. A judge will have to be astute in a remote hearing to ensure the witness is following the question and where appropriate has the relevant document. It is easier to do this in a live hearing because one can see more easily what the witness has in front of them, and sometimes tell by their body language if they are completely lost. However, it is perfectly possible with a little sensitivity to do the same task remotely.  </p>

This hearing was listed for nearly 15 days, although in normal circumstances it would not have needed to take that long. The Mother and Father are both likely to be giving evidence for at least a day. If they give evidence remotely it will undoubtedly be necessary to give a number of breaks. This will be a gruelling process, and I have little doubt that they will both find it difficult. It is important however to bear in mind that parents being accused of very seriously harming their child are likely to find giving evidence in the courtroom also intensely gruelling. My concerns in this regard divide into two parts. Firstly, whether the process would be fair, in terms of seeing the documents, understanding the questions and having breaks when needed. In this case I have reached the conclusion, for the reasons set out above, that there can be a fair hearing. Secondly is the issue of whether the psychological impact of giving evidence can be properly managed in a remote hearing.

I consider the Father&#8217;s emotional state below in respect of the adjournment application, but overall the view I have taken is that the Father is likely to find the whole process intensely stressful whatever course is undertaken. It seems likely that he has relatively little support, only as I understand it having his mother as a close family member, whenever he gives evidence. I therefore do not consider this to be a factor which prevents proceeding with the hearing at this stage.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Finally, on this factor, I do note the Court of Appeal&#8217;s concern in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> about the increased strain placed on the court by remote as opposed to courtroom hearings. There is an intensity to a remote hearing and the concentration on a close screen which is different from sitting in a courtroom. It is necessary to be conscious of this and again take breaks as needed. However, I do not consider the position of the judge in a case such as this, as being as stressful as that of the Judge in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> who had to face some 10 hours of different hearings, and a very urgent case with multiple late papers. I have had the luxury of considerable time to prepare, as well as excellent counsel.  </p>

We have had five days of evidence to test the technology and so far it has worked reasonably smoothly. All participants have largely retained connection and the quality of video and sound has been very good. It is easy to forget that courtroom hearings have their own logistical problems including the exigencies of public transport, the challenges of poor heating systems and uncomfortable courts. One advantage of Zoom is the facility for private breakout rooms so it is easy for the parties to speak to their legal advisors during the hearing in a way roughly comparable to being able to give instructions whilst sitting behind a solicitor or going into a conference room. In my judgement the technology itself has not, at least so far, impeded a fair trial. </p>

The court, so far, has managed the technology to an acceptable level. There is an overly large electronic bundle (over 5000 pages), but all parties have managed to find the relevant pages surprisingly easily, largely thanks to the hard work of counsel, including the juniors. The ability of the parents to manage the technology whilst giving evidence has not yet been fully tested. The only way to deal with this is to be astute to the potential for difficulties and to be prepared to review the situation as the hearing continues. </p>

I asked whether the Mother had access to a car so that she did not need to use public transport or go out onto the streets, but apparently neither she nor anyone in her household has a car. I cannot tell when she would consider it safe for her to come to court, nor can I assess at what date it would be reasonable for me to make an order for her to attend. I am also now faced with the report from Dr McEvedy saying it would be better for the Father&#8217;s mental health to be giving evidence remotely.   </p>

I have carefully considered all the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span> factors set out above. To summarise the position, the technology has been proven to work in this case and I am confident that the Mother can use it effectively. The Father has the technology available to him, and on the day that he was in the hearing he seemed to cope with it fine. I will keep this matter under very careful review. In terms of managing documents, it has already been agreed that all references will be read to the Father.  </p>

His report says; &#8220;F was an appropriate and cooperative interviewee who was not noticeably anxious or depressed at interview.  He spoke coherently, and was able to provide informative responses to all questions asked.&#8221; This provides a good, though not perfect, guide to how the Father will cope with cross examination, although I am likely to give breaks more often than 2.5 hours.  </p>

Most parents in the situation these parties find themselves in would find the prospect of giving evidence and being cross examined extremely stressful. That alone cannot be a reason for not going ahead with a trial such as this. Also, there is no guarantee, indeed it is quite likely, that if I were to adjourn and the trial resumed in some months, the Father would again find the situation highly stressful. Adjourning this case is not going to make the causes of the stress and probably the low mood disappear. </p>

The fact that I have decided to go ahead today, starting lay evidence tomorrow, does not mean that I will not continually revisit the issue of the fairness of the proceedings. </p>
