The latter part of that explanation introduced a change in the case of the husband and his family, and I rejected it, and found that the intention was that the husband remained the beneficial owner.  It follows that the expressed intention to reduce tax on dividends, by purportedly dividing the ownership of the shares, was an unlawful purpose.</p>

The decision was based on the pleadings as they then existed and a commonly used (but arguably limited) description of the way in which a resulting trust can arise (see paragraph 54).  Baron J struck out the claims in relation to beneficial ownership made by the wife in respect of (a) the share(s) in Properties, (b) the garage and (c) 19A SJR, insofar as they relied on express or resulting trusts.  So, she allowed the claim, as then pleaded, to proceed in respect of those assets on the basis of constructive trust.  She also allowed the claim in respect of the shares in AA, as then pleaded, to proceed, namely that the husband&#8217;s mother and sister (S), who were asserted to be the registered owners of the shares in AA, held the shares on an express, resulting or constructive trust for the husband.  That pleading makes no mention of, and so is not based on, the position relating to the ownership of the shares in Southend and the transfer of part of Southend&#8217;s business to AA, when it was incorporated.  </p>

Counsel for the wife supported that stance, if her argument that the Official Receiver&#8217;s claims were statute barred, or for any other reason, failed.

But, in my view, any further analysis of the source of the moneys, or the common understanding of the husband and the wife as to the ownership of the property is unlikely to be necessary, save possibly in determining the tax that is payable.  My finding of fact is that 136YR was regarded as the property of the husband and the wife and that Properties was regarded as his property company (82).  This does not constitute a finding as to the common intention of the beneficial shares in which this property would be so held and, if this becomes relevant, it will have to be further considered.  But, to my mind, the starting point should reflect the percentage entitlements to the declared dividend (i.e. 25% wife and 75% husband) because the underlying theme is that the wife, like other members of the family, left decisions as to the persons in whose names shares and properties should be put to the husband.  However, the present law on constructive trust introduces the possibility that such initial shares could be changed, or found a conclusion that the property is held on constructive trust in equal, or different, shares, not least because 136 YR was the family home (see Snell 32<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> edit para 24 &#8211; 046).</p>

My findings, see in particular (36), (80), (82) and (83), found the conclusion that the parties to the trust intended it to give to others the appearance of creating rights that were different to the substance and reality of the true position as they understood it to be (see Snell 22-067/8 and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1967] 2 QB 786" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1967">[1967] 2 QB 786</ref>), and so, that the trust is sham.

This potentially creates a strange situation if the claim can only be based on resulting trust, based on the finding that the purchase price was provided from moneys debited to the family loan account kept by Properties (the type of resulting trust referred to by Baron J).  But, in my view, it is not clear whether the order of Baron J prevents a claim that the property is held on a resulting trust for the company, Properties, being made on the basis that 19A SJR was bought with company money (the less likely conclusion on the present evidence).

Indeed, it would be surprising if a claim based on constructive trust, which is one directed to providing a fair result in equity, was so restricted by reference to a strike out decision based on the way a case was pleaded.  This view is supported by Snell 32<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> edit at para 24 &#8211; 046, which, if anything, supports an argument that an approach based on resulting trust may, in some circumstances, be now subsumed in or replaced by one based on constructive trust.  So,  in my judgment, the restriction placed on the wife by the order of Baron J, and the availability to the wife of a claim based on resulting trust, does not mean that the wife cannot found a claim on constructive trust that the husband&#8217;s mother holds 19A SJR for either the husband or (and less likely) the company Properties.</p>

Both the husband and Properties acted to their detriment by providing the purchase price.  Further, if the whole course of the conduct of the husband and his family, as found by me, is looked at it founds the basis of a constructive trust of this property in his favour as its purchase is a continuum of the process of assets being put in the names of family members, on the basis that they held them for him, and at his direction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already indicated, in my judgment, the concepts of resulting and constructive trusts are not mutually exclusive and so the wife can, as she did, advance a claim based on constructive trust.  In my judgment, that claim succeeds on the findings of fact that I made in particular in (38), (48), (54), (75) and (77) which establish that the common intention and understanding was that both IQ and Mrs B were intended to hold the share for, and at the direction of, the husband.  The husband has acted to his detriment in reliance on that common intention and understanding by causing moneys and assets to be transferred to Properties, and by using Properties as his company. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A problem arises in respect of the transfer to Mrs B, if a constructive trust has to be relied on, because I found that the purpose of that transfer was an unlawful one namely to seek to obtain a tax advantage on a false basis, namely that the beneficial owner of the share was resident and domiciled abroad (see the citations in paragraph 37 above).  However, that purpose has never been carried out and, in my judgment, although it was not directed to a constructive trust, the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Tribe</span> founds the conclusion that the wife is not precluded from establishing the husband&#8217;s beneficial interest in the share of Properties now in the name of Mrs B because of that unlawful purpose (see in particular paragraph 134 of the judgment of Millett LJ).  The same applies to any unlawful purpose underlying the transfer of the share into the name of IQ</p>

My findings at (70), (72) and (74), and my conclusions herein that the husband&#8217;s mother and sister had no beneficial interest in the shares of Southend, and that the common intention they assert did not exist, mean that the husband&#8217;s mother and sister cannot rely on the alleged trust deed, and that they have failed to make good their claims to 642 SR and its proceeds.  I dismiss their claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the alternative basis referred to above, and so leaving out of account the claim of the Official Receiver, as the purchase price was provided by dividends declared by Southend, and there was no allocation of those dividends, the wife can rely on the presumption of advancement to claim ownership of 25% of the shares in Southend and the relevant dividend.  One of the reasons that the property was bought outside the company was to protect it from a claim by a creditor against the company and the husband, but that purpose was never carried out and, in my view, <span style="font-style:italic">Tribe </span>founds the view that the husband would not be precluded from rebutting the presumption of advancement in favour of the wife, or advancing a constructive trust argument in respect of the ownership of the property, because of that purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That leaves an argument as to the shares in which the beneficial interests in the property were held.  This is potentially relevant to the impact of the charge and sale of this property.  My findings on the discussions between the husband and the wife do not include findings as to the beneficial shares in which they would hold this business property.  As with 136YR, my present findings do not warrant a conclusion that the husband and wife discussed the shares in which they were to hold this property but, in my view, the starting point should be the 75 / 25 split of the shares in Southend (and see my comments at the end of paragraph 99 hereof, albeit that this was a business property).</p>

The dilution of the wife&#8217;s shareholding took place after the last declaration of dividend and so does not affect the entitlement to, and in respect of, declared dividend.
