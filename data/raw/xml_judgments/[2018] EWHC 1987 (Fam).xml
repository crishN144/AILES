The father&#8217;s (F) Appellant&#8217;s Notice is dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018 Cohen J issued directions for the filing of appeal documents. The mother (M) seeks to resist the appeal, inviting this court to restore the matter for further directions before the Family Court in Canterbury. </p>

F applied on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017 for a Child Arrangements Order enabling him to spend time with L who lives with her mother. The matter was listed pursuant to the order of District Judge Green on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2017 for a fact-finding hearing. It had been determined necessary to conduct such a hearing before the court could reach conclusions on F&#8217;s substantive application. I have been told that, conscious of the delay that there had been in the proceedings, District Judge Green arranged for the matter to be listed before His Honour Judge Scaratt when an available date emerged in the Court diary. Prior to the hearing Judge Scaratt had no previous involvement in the case nor, inevitably, any opportunity to shape the scope of the hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M&#8217;s lawyers had prepared a Scott Schedule setting out six core allegations which the court was invited to resolve. By the hearing F had dispensed with the service of his solicitors and was acting in person. He was at the time a serving police officer, facing related proceedings in the Criminal Court. He told Judge Scaratt that he had concluded that he should focus his available funds on his own defence costs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before hearing the case Judge Scaratt had obviously read the papers carefully and had come to two significant decisions. Firstly, he considered that only two of the six allegations identified in the schedule required to be tried; secondly, he had formed the firm view that F should not be permitted to cross examine M directly. It requires to be identified that the allegations Judge Scaratt elected to try were of the utmost gravity. The first alleged strangulation and rape of M; the second concerned attempted strangulation, which was said to have taken place in the presence of the child. </p>

It plainly took F by surprise. As a serving police officer F had planned his cross examination of M and was very clear about the material he wished to raise with her. The Judge then moved to a short preliminary ex tempore Judgment in which he set out the reasoning for his decision. The Judge did not invite any representations on the point either from counsel or F. In his Judgment the Judge placed considerable emphasis on my own judgment in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re: A (a minor) (fact finding; unrepresented party) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/1195" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 1195 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 1195 (Fam)</ref>. </span>He highlighted the following passages which require to be set out:</p>

A number of points need to be highlighted.  Firstly, F was not present in the Courtroom but cross examined by video link.  Secondly, M requested and I granted permission for her to have her back to the video screen in order that she did not have to engage face to face with F.  Thirdly, F barely engaged with M's allegations of violence, choosing to conduct a case which concentrated on undermining M's credibility (which as emerges above was largely unsuccessful).  </span></p>

M is articulate, educated and highly motivated to provide a decent life for herself and her son. She was represented at this hearing by leading and junior counsel and was prepared to submit to cross examination by her husband in order that the case could be concluded.  She was faced with an invidious choice.  </span></p>

For my part, I am simply not prepared to hear a case in this way again. I cannot regard it as consistent with my judicial oath and my responsibility to ensure fairness between the parties.</span></p>

It was reiterated in Re B (a child) (private law fact finding-unrepresented father), DVK [2014] EWHC (Fam).  Cross examination by a perpetrator is prohibited by statute in the Crown Court, in recognition of its impact on victims and in order to facilitate fairness to both prosecution and defence.  In Wood J's case he called for 'urgent attention' to be given to the issue.  This call was volubly repeated by Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division in Q v Q; Re B (a child); Re C (a child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/31" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 31" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 31</ref> and again in his 'View from the President's Chambers (2016): Children and Vulnerable Witnesses: where are we?'</span></p>

There McFarlane LJ highlighted the very substantial difficulties engendered by a litigant in person whose case needs to be &#8216;put&#8217; to a key factual witness where the allegations are of the most intimate and serious nature and where the litigant and the witness are themselves the accused and accuser. The court made the following observation:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.65in;text-indent:0.32in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Various strategies to meet this problem have been contemplated and attempted in recent times. One such, which no doubt had some impact on the progress of the present appeal, was the proposition that, where there was no other alternative source of funding for the representation of an alleged perpetrator of abuse for the purposes of cross examining his abuser, the Family Court could direct that funding be provided by HM Courts and Tribunal Service ['HMCTS']. The proposition was held to be sound by Sir James Munby P in Q v Q; Re B; Re C <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/31" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 31" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 31</ref> in a judgment delivered on 14 October 2014. The judgment in Q v Q no doubt influenced DJ Mornington's decision in April 2015 to transfer this case up for consideration at a more senior level of judiciary. By that time, in another case (Re K and H), HHJ Bellamy had, on 5 January 2015, made an order directing HMCTS to fund representation to enable cross examination on behalf of an alleged abusing father to be put to his former partner. Judge Bellamy's order was the subject of appeal and, on 22 May 2015, this court (Lord Dyson MR, Black and McFarlane LJJ) held that a judge in family proceedings lacked the power to make such an order [<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/543" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 543" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 543</ref>]. Thus, by the time that the present case came before HHJ Allweis for the first time, the prospect of directing that HMCTS should fund representation for this father had ceased to be a tenable option.&#8221;</span></p>

It is plainly an option that he views with little enthusiasm. If I may say so, I also recoil from that suggestion. It seems to me that it is inconsistent with the 2015 Litigant in Person Guidelines which emphasise an established distinction between the practical and supportive role of the McKenzie friend as opposed to his acting as advocate or carrying out the conduct of litigation. It should be remembered that it is a criminal offence to exercise rights of audience or to conduct litigation unless authorised to do so by an appropriate regulatory body or with the leave of the court.  McFarlane LJ addresses it thus:</p>

The possibility of a McKenzie Friend acting as an advocate is not referred to in PD12J and, as has already been noted, the guidance on McKenzie Friends advises that, generally, courts should be slow to afford rights of audience. For my part, in terms of the spectrum of tasks that may be undertaken by an advocate, cross examination of a witness in the circumstances upon which this judgment is focussed must be at the top end in terms of sensitivity and importance; it is a forensic process which requires both skill and experience of a high order. Whilst it will be a matter for individual judges in particular cases to determine an application by a McKenzie Friend for rights of audience in order to cross examine in these circumstances, I anticipate that it will be extremely rare for such an application to be granted.&#8221;</span></p>

It seems to me to have been an entirely sensible course, bearing in mind that there had already been considerable delay in the case, I can also understand why the Judge considered that he should press on with the hearing in order to reconnect with the child&#8217;s own timescales. The Judge was taking pragmatic decisions in accordance with the avoidance of delay principle. In all this he is unimpeachable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, as Mr Eaton took me through the transcript, it became very clear that the Judge found his role as cross examiner on behalf of F both challenging and, I suspect, rather distasteful. The cross examination of a complainant alleging rape, requires particularly careful preparation, great sensitivity and rigorous forensic discipline. Ultimately, the complainant&#8217;s evidence must be challenged effectively and the alleged perpetrator&#8217;s case put fairly. This cannot be compromised, nothing less will do. The Family Court endeavours to be non-adversarial, investigative, sui generis. It strives to create a forensic atmosphere in which witnesses can give of their best and enable the truth to be identified as effectively as possible. None of this detracts from the fundamental premise that the party bringing the allegation has the burden of proving it and to the civil standard of proof. There is no burden on the accused party.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the authorities, I have set out above, the Judge considered that the only option available to him was to take upon himself the heat and burden of cross-examination. The course that the Judge intended to follow was for F to identify the questions and for him, the Judge, to hone and refine them in a way that did justice to both the parties. I regret to say that the actual technique fell somewhat short of the identified objective. The role was plainly unfamiliar to the Judge, as it would be to many. I have a strong sense that the Judge felt the inevitable brutality of the questions, designed to reveal M&#8217;s account of rape as dishonest, compromised his independent role and lowered him into a fray for which he simply had no appetite. F&#8217;s questions, in so far as they were put to M at all, by the Judge, were rendered superficial, overly simplified and repeatedly phrased in a way as to minimise their impact. Frequently, the Judge&#8217;s questions required little by way of response from M. Mr Eaton has compiled a schedule of some seventy-two instances, highlighting what he contends became the essentially partisan nature of the Judge&#8217;s questions. In addition, the Judge repeatedly summarised M&#8217;s answers and read to her from her own witness statement. Mr Eaton submits that the Judge&#8217;s interventions had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the effect of hindering the effectiveness of the cross examination, purportedly advanced on behalf of the father&#8221;</span>.

The Judge warned F that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I shall control your cross examination very, very severely indeed&#8221;.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>I find myself wondering whether if Counsel had been pursuing the same lines of enquiry the Judge would have been far more receptive. As I have indicated above I consider these were essentially proper questions. In closing them down as he did the Judge had, in my view, become overly protective of M. As F said in his submissions to the Judge, these were allegations of rape, likely to have a profound impact on his relationship with his child and almost certain to result in his suspension or dismissal as a police officer if adverse findings were made.  </p>

A litigant in person is far more exposed than a represented party. The content, focus and style of the questions often reveal the personality of the litigant, long before he enters the witness box. It is clear to me that the Judge formed a very adverse impression of F, he considered him to be arrogant to the point that he regarded himself as &#8220;god like&#8221;.

When analysed, these conclusions proved not to have been rooted in the substance of the factual allegations but essentially predicated on the Judge&#8217;s observation of F&#8217;s demeanour. Whilst the impression a witness makes upon the Judge will always be important and signals the inestimable advantage the first instance Judge has, in assessing the evidence, it is not a substitute for a detailed analysis of those features of the evidence which reinforce the reliability of the allegation. Though the Judge declared himself to be satisfied that there was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;good corroborative evidence&#8221; </span>he does not identify such material within his Judgment with the cogency of reasoning the exercise requires.

Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed. When I made my observations in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re: A </span>(supra) I was indignant that the court had, in that case, been entirely powerless to prevent the replication of abuse in the court room i.e. permitting a perpetrator of domestic violence (as I found) to cross examine his witness directly. This process is an entirely different experience to hearing a witness robustly challenged by an advocate. The latter may trigger in the victim a vivid recollection of abuse but the former can have the effect of replicating the abuse. In simple terms the process itself becomes abusive. That a complainant in a criminal trial should be afforded protection denied to her in family proceedings is manifestly irrational and unfair. As I said in Re: A and I repeat, it is iniquitous and a stain on the Family Justice System. The problem is encountered by Judges at all levels.

I do not in any way wish to diminish the seriousness of a rape allegation but I would observe that the ordeal of being cross-examined by a perpetrator who is found to have inflicted physical and emotional abuse over many years will frequently be just as brutal an experience for the witness.

(see also <span style="font-weight:bold">Carmarthenshire County Council v Y and Others [2017] WLR (D) 534; <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/36" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 36" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 36</ref></span>.

It is important to emphasise that the two, are indivisible in these provisions. Logically, there is not an automatic bar to cross-examination by a litigant in person in such circumstances. The application of these criteria may make it the predominant outcome but that is, of course, quite different. Having been required to confront these issues again in the context of this appeal I consider that they, by parity of reasoning, provide a useful starting point for the Judge in a family case. Thus, it requires to be emphasised that the prevention of cross-examination in person by an alleged perpetrator should not be regarded as automatic. The court must consider the broad canvas of evidence when reaching its decision on this point. Into this wider picture must be factored in, the continuing reality that unlike in the criminal courts, there is no mechanism by which the court can provide for the instruction of an advocate. </p>

The court has at its disposal a number of other possible case management options. These include: (i) a direction that the order that Y should give oral evidence is made subject to the condition that the father questions her through a legal representative (this may not be a viable option if the judge&#8217;s finding about the father&#8217;s inability to pay stands); alternatively (ii) Y should be questioned by the judge himself; (iii) Y should be questioned by a justices&#8217; clerk; or (iv) a guardian should be appointed to conduct proceedings on behalf of K and H. The judge considered that it would not be appropriate for K and H to be joined to the proceedings and a children&#8217;s guardian to be appointed for the same reasons as he thought it inappropriate for the questioning of Y to be conducted by himself: see para [27] of the judgment.</span></p>

In some cases, the first option will be the most appropriate. But in others it will be inappropriate, for example, where the court considers that it is essential to have oral evidence from the witness and to have it tested by questioning. Take the present case where the evidence of Y is of central importance to the Art 8 European Convention rights and welfare interests of K and H. If the court considers that it is necessary to receive oral evidence from Y and have it tested orally by questioning, then the first option may not satisfy the Convention rights of the children.</span></p>

For those of us who have been schooled in an adversarial system, questioning by a judge of a key witness on controversial and centrally important issues may cause unease. I have already referred to the &#8216;profound unease&#8217; expressed by Roderic Wood J in H v L and R at the thought of a judge having to question a witness in the family jurisdiction. He said that it should not be regarded as impossible, but should be done only in &#8216;exceptional circumstances&#8217;. I have set out at para [22] above what Sir James Munby said on the subject in Q v Q. Sir James was, however, careful to say no more than that questioning by a judge where the issues are &#8216;grave and forensically challenging&#8217; may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with the Convention.</span></p>

He did not say why. It may be that he thought that it was inevitable that he would be perceived to be descending into the arena and siding with the father. The use of the term &#8216;cross-examination&#8217; itself lends support to that idea. But questioning by a judge need not be conducted as if by a cross-examiner acting for one of the parties. That is implicit in what Baroness Hale said at para [28] in Re W (Children) (Abuse: Oral Evidence) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/12" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 12</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 WLR 701" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 WLR 701</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1485" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1485</ref>.

Collectively they illuminate the general direction the court should follow but they do not establish a cogent framework. Inevitably, the exercise falls far short of what is required. The case for a regime which replicates the strengths of that operating in the Criminal Courts is compelling. Indeed, as I have said previously, there is no coherent alternative. In recognition of this the Government committed to legislate in the <span style="font-weight:bold">Prison and Courts Bill </span>which I understand to have had cross party support. However, it was abandoned due to Parliamentary time constraints.
