Though he was diagnosed with autism at the age of 5, he received very little support for it. JM&#8217;s mother (AM) has mental health issues too, having been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I do not think it is necessary to burden this judgment with JM&#8217;s childhood experiences other than to say it was characterised by trauma. The combination of trauma, which JM has been unable to address, and autism, confounds his efforts to process his experiences in life and thwarts reasoned decision-taking. In relation to the issues before this Court, which I will set out below, there is a consensus that JM lacks capacity. A psychological report prepared by Dr Steven Carnaby, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April 2023, provides a helpful insight into JM&#8217;s functioning. </span></p>

The CAMHS Consultation report dated 26.2.14 captures this phenomenon to some extent, in referring to both [JM] having &#8216;lots of good independence skills,</span></p>

Autism and trauma can overlap in terms of what the individual experiences and what others might observe, and there can be the risk of diagnostic overshadowing i.e the individual&#8217;s presentation being considered only in terms of autism without considering the impact of trauma. [JM] &#8217;s situation could be thought about in terms of autism being the &#8216;lens&#8217; through which he experienced and made sense of the traumatic events throughout his life, affecting his ability to process what has happened to him at the time as well as having a longer-lasting impact in terms of shaping his identity and sense of self.&#8221;</span></p>

Outside the chest, the line is seen to divide at a &#8220;Y&#8221;, revealing the two internal lumens, both of which end in separate connectors. JM does not accept a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease or his need for dialysis. His mother does not accept this either. Though they share the same view, which is irrational, Dr C is persuaded that they each independently hold the same view and JM&#8217;s belief structure has not been superimposed upon him. JM was compliant with treatment when in a hospital setting but frequently refused to attend appointments as an outpatient when living at his mother&#8217;s home. Repeated attempts to explain the need for dialysis and the potentially fatal consequence of not having it, have been unsuccessful, even with significant specialist psychologist support.</span></p>

There is very little doubt that it was JM who cut the line. In consequence, the dialysis line had to be removed and subsequently JM has adamantly refused to have a replacement line inserted.

This would include other active treatment. No attempt to insert a line, or otherwise, proactively treat him, would be made if JM&#8217;s health deteriorated to the point where he was unable to object or, indeed, if he becomes unconscious.</span></p>

JM&#8217;s health then stabilised, followed by a period of him returning to live at his mother&#8217;s property. Whilst living with his mother, JM has been offered psychological support and practical assistance in the form of taxis attending his property to transport him to hospital three times a week for dialysis. JM&#8217;s engagement with this support has fluctuated. He would regularly decline to get into the taxi or simply not be in property (or answer the door). This erratic engagement has, inevitably, put his health at risk of significantly deteriorating, including a risk of death. However, once at hospital JM has, historically, complied with dialysis. During a short hospital admission in September, JM was assessed to lack capacity to make decisions about his treatment for chronic kidney disease. It was identified that JM does not understand his kidney failure is permanent, that his kidneys will not recover and does not understand the purpose of dialysis or the risks and benefits of treatment.</span></p>

At present, Dr F considers that JM is in the early stages of what will become a dramatic deterioration.

It is transient, and usually settles after 24-36 hours. It is not a prominent or common complication when dialysis is done regularly. Clinicians were concerned that this reaction would simply compound JM&#8217;s view that dialysis is not beneficial for him.

In the event of him leaving hospital, JM would continue to receive a package of social care for 21 hours per week (3 hrs x 7 days).</span></p>

It was established that the line has been damaged beyond use and would need to be removed urgently to reduce the high risk of further bleeding from the line. JM consented to the removal of the line but refused the insertion of a new one. He agreed to remain in hospital for a few days to allow the access point of the line to heal over now it is removed but has refused a further line insertion. It was explained to J, in what I am satisfied was clear and entirely unambiguous language, that without further dialysis he will die. He was again told expressly that he will require a new line to be re-inserted if he is to survive. Psychology and speech and language therapist have used communication aids to help explain likely timescales and how hospital will support him as his body dies. They have explained risk of heart attack or stroke. They have explained he can request a line at any time while he is awake. He said he doesn&#8217;t think he will request a line as he believes he will not die and he doesn&#8217;t want dialysis.

Death may be preceded by coma, but there is nevertheless a risk of more sudden death at an earlier stage due to hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). JM is currently receiving medication to reduce his potassium levels, although these are not being monitored as it is felt that it would not alter his management.</span></p>

I remind myself that in early 2023 when JM was clinically stable in hospital, the proceedings were concerned with finding a placement from which he could be encouraged to attend for dialysis three times per week. The situation is plainly now far graver. Restraining JM to reinsert a new dialysis line against his will might in and of itself be justifiable. However, JM&#8217;s objection is not merely to the reinsertion of the line but to the life sustaining dialysis it would provide. It follows, inevitably, that the restraint required for the reinsertion would be a harbinger for repeated and extensive restraint on a weekly basis and indefinitely. JM&#8217;s erratic compliance and distorted thinking, now over many months, effectively discounts him, I have been told, from eligibility for a donor organ. Such transplant would need compliance with a fairly rigorous regime of support which is very unlikely to be complied with. Moreover, that too may involve an extensive period of haemodialysis. </span></p>

However, even though his reasoning is unsound, JM&#8217;s confidence and belief in his own judgment is well-established and as the chronology of the case has demonstrated, unmoveable. The fact that an individual&#8217;s views may be misconceived does not, however, deprive him of the right to hold them. To approach this otherwise would particularly discriminate against the incapacitous, as well as more generally. JM&#8217;s views on dialysis arise from the complex interplay of his psychological functioning and his life experiences. This is no doubt true for all of us but in JM&#8217;s case, both are disordered. The nature and extent of JM&#8217;s autism coupled with the extent of trauma that he has endured, serves to disable him from processing his thoughts and experience in an effective way. Nonetheless, JM&#8217;s own reality, even though it greatly differs from ours, requires to be respected. It is in this way that the autonomy of the incapacitous is respected. That does not mean that their views prevail but it does mean that they must be afforded weight. As I have set out above, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;human dignity is predicated on a universal understanding that human beings possess a unique value which is intrinsic to the human condition&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">For the reasons which I have set out, I am clear that forced restraint either in the face of JM&#8217;s expressed opposition or at a time when he is no longer able to resist, would compromise his dignity. By agreement and because Roberts J had previously met with JM on a number of occasions, I spoke with him on a private video link from which the public and lawyers were excluded. The solicitor for the Official Solicitor took a note. With outstanding efficiency, the note was available to the parties within 20 minutes of my concluding the meeting. Judges, I suspect, vary greatly in their approach to meeting with P. Video conferencing platforms have changed the landscape. It seemed to me, ultimately unthinkable, that I should not meet with JM and tell him the important decision I had made. I found him, as has everybody else involved in his care, to be a very pleasant young man. His conversation with me reinforced Dr C&#8217;s assessment of him. As both Dr F and Dr C have said, JM does not want to die. When I told him of my decision and the fact that he would die, he told me without prompt or question that he did not want to. I formed the impression that he very much wanted to live. Ultimately, all I could do was tell him that the decision was his. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I should like to pay tribute to the doctors and nursing staff. As Ms Roper KC has submitted, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;the clinicians have been exceptional in the compassion they have shown for JM and the dedication with which they have tried to help him understand his situation&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> I agree. I should also like to pay tribute to JM&#8217;s mother and sister. Though JM&#8217;s mother struggles to understand the realities of JM&#8217;s situation due to her own mental health difficulties, she has an impressive and, I sense, strongly maternal instinct that the use of restraint to compel dialysis would be inimical to his welfare. Those instincts, to my mind, are sound and also require to be factored in to this decision. </span></p>
