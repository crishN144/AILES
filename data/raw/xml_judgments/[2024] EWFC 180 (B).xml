	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is the experience of this Judge that applications seeking permission to remove a child permanently from the jurisdiction involve some of the most difficult judicial decisions which fall to be made in the Family Court.  That may seem a surprising statement considering that the general diet of a judge dealing with public law cases often involves ordering the permanent separation of a child from their birth family with the real possibility, if not probability, that those parents may never see that child again.  Permission to remove from the jurisdiction permanently will not usually be granted unless arrangements to maintain that relationship are first proposed by the parent who wishes to remove the child and then rigorously examined by the court to assess their practicality and effectiveness in upholding that existing relationship as well as the genuineness of the intent behind them.  The relocated child is still going to be able to speak with and see the other parent, still spend time with them on a recurring basis and so each can remain involved in the other&#8217;s life.  Furthermore, the connectivity offered by the modern smartphone, tablet or laptop now mean that a child settled even in a far corner of the globe is no longer as isolated from the left-behind parent as once was the case and air travel remains, at least for the next couple of decades, an option which can effectively shrink the distance between parent and departed child.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However public law cases which result in a permanent separation usually involve clear evidence of parental failure, be it neglect, injury, emotional harm or a combination of other deprivations inflicted or allowed by that parent upon their child. The reality is that a decision to impose permanent separation is only made because of harm, whether actual or likely, and where that outcome is necessary to further the child&#8217;s welfare.  What is a harsh decision in its effect is not always a difficult decision to make.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The same is not so in applications for the permanent removal of a child from the jurisdiction.  In these cases there are usually two capable, thoughtful and caring parents who have strong, deep relationships with the child, are committed to them, are caring for them and have done nothing, certainly in terms of causing any harm to their child, which could possibly warrant the loss which a removal will bring.  For despite the availability of cheap flights and regular scheduled services to almost anywhere in the world, despite the advent of the smart phone and the tablet with their free video calling apps and the instantaneous communication which is one of the (few) benefits of social media, the granting of an application to permanently remove a child from the jurisdiction inevitably results not only in a separation between the child and their now absent parent but creates a detachment from one to the other.  The child is now immersed in a world to which the left behind parent has only limited, if any, access.  The people that child will meet, the friends they will make and the adventures and tribulations they will experience can be learned of but not fully shared in.  A once strong and close relationship will inevitably change as the child builds a world in which their now absent parent is far from the centre.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Balanced against that is the understanding that change is a part of life, that people have the right to make decisions about their own lives, to move forward and move on from their past, to embrace opportunity and to make the most of them not only for themselves but for their children too.  More often than not a parent who is making an application to remove their child has done so only after the most anxious thought about the benefits and detriments which such a move will have upon not only their child but on the wider family of whom that child is a part.  For the child to move away means also leaving behind not only the other parent but also their friends, their school, their cousins and grandparents and all the places that they know.  It is a huge disruption to what may have been working well and which has contributed to that child to thrive and, as importantly, to be happy.  No responsible parent would inflict that degree of change and disruption upon their child without taking a very hard look at the pros and cons to reach a balanced conclusion as to what is in their child&#8217;s best interests.</p>

It was the reason why, having heard the Cafcass Officer and each of John&#8217;s parents, both of whom very effectively represented themselves before me and did so with a courtesy, sensitivity and civility towards each other which reflected well upon them both, I rose to reflect upon all that I had read and heard.  It was the reason why that period of reflection extended far beyond my initial indication as I genuinely wrestled with the many advantages as well as disadvantages which each potential option for John&#8217;s future offered.  Minutes turned into hours before I could be clear as to my decision.</p>

Appreciating the magnitude of my decision and the fact of her being both unrepresented and unsupported in the courtroom when I delivered my ex tempore judgment I indicated that I would prepare a written version to enable her to better understand how I had applied the law to the evidence before me.  This is that written decision.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">John is a child of primary school age.  He lives with his Mum and spends most of each weekend with his Dad.  At home with his Mum also lives her partner and John&#8217;s older sister, Jane (not her real name).  Jane is older than John by several years and a different stage of her education.  But John also lives with his Dad. He may spend less time in the company of his father but John is not a visitor to his Dad&#8217;s house, he is a fully integrated member of the family who live in that home.  When with his Dad, John also lives with his Dad&#8217;s partner and Sally, his baby sister (not her name).  The reality is that John is at home wherever he is and whomever he is with. This was captured well by Ms Youds, the Cafcass Officer, in her report where she wrote of &#8216;the homes John shares with both his parents.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">That happy situation has been built despite the difficulties which lead to and followed from his parents&#8217; separation.  Mum and Dad met in 2006, married in 2007, separated in 2018 and I think were divorced in 2020.  Although there were problems between the parents following the separation, Mum, to her credit, did not allow them to impact upon the relationship their children enjoyed with their father.  Those events have no impact upon life in 2024 and therefore no weight in my deliberations about this application.  The breakdown of a marriage and a separation can be difficult and, driven more by emotion than rationality, people can sometimes act in a way which does not reflect their normal nature.  In this case Dad has clearly recovered his equilibrium and the parents&#8217; mutual courtesy towards each other in the courtroom, itself a pressurised environment, properly reflected their true natures and quality as individuals.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">As a consequence of the guidance and stability each parent, but particularly Mum, was able to offer at that time John and his older sister appear to have been able to bear the fact of parental separation and divorce, each a traumatic event which could easily destabilise a child less well emotionally secured, as well as the subsequent re-partnering enjoyed by each parent and, in the case of Dad, expanding his family.  Although I have heard from neither parent&#8217;s partner nor received any written evidence from either of them Ms Youds has had the opportunity to understand how John perceives each of them when she spoke with John in their respective homes.  It was clear from her report that John spoke well of each individual and has a good relationship with them both.  I am in no doubt that John does not lack for people who love him, care for him and want only the best for him.  In that respect, as in many others, he is far more fortunate than most children who are the subject of applications to the Family Court.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This settled state of affairs was only disturbed when Mum informed Dad that she and her partner had decided that they wished to move to the Emirate of X, in the United Arab Emirates.  Following the parents&#8217; separation Mum has qualified as a teacher and successfully forged a new career for herself.  In his own evidence Dad was clear that Mum had always been someone who worked hard and sought to better herself in a positive way.  Bill (not his real name), Mum&#8217;s partner,  also works in education and the couple had identified that career prospects looked promising for them if they were to move to teach in one of the many international schools which have been set up in country X. From her written evidence Mum appears to have had this goal in mind, at least as a possibility, for some time.  In her first statement Mum was frank that the decision to relocate to X had been <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a carefully considered and well-thought process since the commencement of my PGCE&#8217; </span>some years before. That view was buttressed by an exhibit attached to Mum&#8217;s first statement which was a quotation for health insurance provided by a company which describes itself as a leading health insurer in X and is costed in the local currency.  The quotation carries the date of 19 February 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Whenever that seed first planted itself a very significant step forward occurred on 26 October 2023 when Mum received an offer of employment from such an international school as a teacher of primary education. On the same date Bill received a similar offer. In each case the respective employment offers are for a period of two years but with an auto-renewal for a further period of two years.  For the sake of completeness I should add that, having secured those initial job offers both Mum and Bill appear to have received supplemental offers of additional professional responsibilities.  Whilst the initial period of employment is not lengthened by those additional responsibilities, albeit the salaries were increased, their willingness to either seek and/or accept enhanced roles illustrates the degree of commitment being given to this prospective move abroad.</p>

It is reasonable therefore to assume that somewhere between late October and mid-November Dad had not only been informed about the idea but had offered a negative response to the proposal that John leave for X.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">As the proposed relocation involved a country which is not a signatory to the Hague Conventions the matter was allocated to the Circuit Bench and then listed before me as a Judge with experience of cases involving non-Hague Convention state relocations.  Notwithstanding the fact that X is not a signatory to the Hague Conventions the facts of the case did not suggest this to be a case in which a real focus should be upon a risk of non-return from a non-Hague Convention country.  Neither parent in this case is a citizen of X nor has ties to it in terms of origins, culture, faith, established connections there nor available financial resources therein. The issue in this case is about the welfare benefits of a move and not the risk of a non-return. For that reason, as well as reasons of cost and time, no direction was considered necessary to obtain an expert report on the legal framework in place in X, notwithstanding the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">Re R [2013] EWCA Civ 1115</span> as to the necessity of the court having the benefit of expert evidence in such applications.  In my judgement such a direction in these circumstances would have been at odds with the Overriding Objective to deal with cases justly, expeditiously and proportionately.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">What was important was ensuring that the right information was available to best inform the decision-making which would have to be made.  At the initial hearing before me in December 2023 it was clear that each parent was minded not to engage professional legal advisers, despite my inviting them to give serious consideration to such a matter, and therefore it was necessary to ensure that each, but particularly Mum, properly set out their case in a comprehensive manner to fully detail the proposal as to where and how John would live, be cared for, be educated, spend his time and, most importantly, maintain his relationships with those he would have left behind.  Mum was also clear that there was a critical time-factor involved as she understood that necessary formalities for the successful immigration into X had to be completed by 1 March 2024 if all matters were to proceed so as to ensure she and Bill could start their proposed new employment on their contracted date later that summer.</p>

That would not only take matters beyond 1 March 2024 but extend the uncertainty and the worry for all involved.  In an attempt to drive the litigation forward and to ensure that the decision with regard to whether John should relocate was taken purely on the basis of welfare and neither unfairly rushed to accommodate an administrative date nor effectively answered by a failure to be able to comply with that date if it rendered Mum entire enterprise moot I directed the preparation of a Cafcass report which gave particular focus to John&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  I understood from Mum&#8217;s submissions that John was fully aware of his mother&#8217;s plans and in favour of them.  Dad was less certain that John was sure in his own mind of his preferred outcome but accepted that he was fully informed about them.  It was assumed that a more focused report could be delivered within the usual period of 14 weeks.</p>

For reasons which need not be dwelt upon it was not possible for Cafcass to provide the proposed report in the preferred timeframe.  Having given those directions I was informed by Cafcass that their view was that such matters required a broader welfare analysis and that such a wider report could not be prepared within the timescales I was inviting.  The net result, despite the best efforts of all involved, was that the date for the final hearing had to be moved back to accommodate receipt of the Cafcass Officer&#8217;s report. The report, when received, whilst ostensibly focusing upon the views of John, attempted to look further and wider than the wishes and feelings of the child and although the welfare checklist was not expressly set out or even mentioned within the report I was assured in her oral evidence that Ms Youds had reflected upon John&#8217;s welfare in a rounded sense in forming her recommendation. I am grateful to her for her work.</p>

In both his homes John expressed himself to be in favour of moving to X, he rattled off positive comments about the place, not just in general terms (such as the weather and the famous architecture) but also in relation to what he thought life would be like for him. In particular he said that he liked the structure of the school day and the longer length of the school holidays.  Ms Youds paid tribute to the fact that John did not just view matters from his own perspective but had considered the benefits to his mother and Bill.  It was Ms Youds&#8217; view that John&#8217;s was not the voice of a child who had given no thought to the matter, had simply swallowed the view of a parent or who had been directly and deliberately influenced by someone.  </p>

John understood that he would be living in X for two years.  There was no indication that he understood that this might be either a permanent move or one that even if it was not permanent could be of an indefinite duration.  Further, whilst recognising and acknowledging the losses he would suffer in terms of father, family, school and friends, John was clear that he would be seeing his father frequently by reason of accessing social media on the new smartphone he would be receiving, that he would be returning regularly to this country both of which would be in addition to there being opportunities for his father to visit X.  In John&#8217;s mind X was a temporary sojourn during which he would experience many positives from all that he had been made aware about that country but which would be punctuated by regular return trips to England, frequent access of social media and occasional trips to X by his father.  That was an integral part of his understanding in my judgment.</p>

John loves both of his sisters but is particularly close to his elder sister, Jane.  This is a very important relationship to John and one that is reciprocated by his sister.  That is readily understandable.  The children have jointly experienced much, not all of which has been positive but all of which has been borne together, and they have been able to rely upon each other for comfort, solace, companionship and a shared experience which has served to bind them to each other.  This close relationship was apparent to Ms Youds in how each child spoke of the other and which seemed unaffected by the age difference between them and the different outlooks and agendas commonly expected of children of their different ages and accompanying maturities.  It would not have been surprising had each been going through a phase when they barely acknowledged each other, not unknown for siblings at such different points in their development. Instead there was clear evidence of a real connection between the two, of warmth, care and thoughtfulness.  </p>

Jane was therefore removed as a subject of this application but that change in status for her in no way diminished her importance to John nor moved her outside of the circle of interest for the Cafcass Officer.  Ms Youds took the time to speak with Jane about John, their relationship and her understanding of him and his own view of the proposed move.  What Jane made clear to Ms Youds was not only the sense of understanding she has of John&#8217;s views but her confidence in both him being honest with her and her being able to discern what he truly means.</p>

What appeared to tip the balance in favour of relocation rather than refusal was her view that John had thought about this matter and arrived at his own conclusions and then told people of his views, even if it was not what they wanted to hear.  She further expressed the view that John would be disappointed if he was not allowed the opportunity to move to X, which he would perceive as missing out by not now being allowed to go.</p>

Even though Mum acknowledged that it might be the case that the move might not prove to be as promising as it presently seemed; that they may all return home after two years or even sooner, her evidence before me, as well as her written statements, gave the clearest impression that her sincere belief was that this was a move which she hoped would become a long term decision. Living in X was what Mum wanted as the future for the three of them and to return at the expiration of two years would indicate not that they had enjoyed a short term experience but that something had gone wrong because they were not staying.  Insofar as Mum was unable to say that she wished to secure a permanent removal for John it was only because her contract was time limited.  What Mum really sought, as she said in her evidence, was not a limited term permission for two years but something at least indefinite, if not permanent.  Mum was concerned that before two years had passed it would be necessary to go through this exercise all over and she considered that this would not assist anyone.  Better, in her view, to allow now for the possibility that X would be a success and could continue without further court involvement.</p>

This, according to Mum, was an increase in the time John currently spent with his father and would afford more than reasonable opportunities for father and son to retain and even develop their relationship.  The costs of John&#8217;s flights would be met by her notwithstanding that Dad would no longer have maintenance commitments once John had left the jurisdiction and so represent a significant saving to him.  </p>

Dad was sceptical bordering on dismissive about longer term intentions and regarded these proposals as little more than persuasive window dressing for the benefit of this hearing.  The reality, he suggested, was that once in X there would be a significant erosion of these promises either because they were never intended to be honoured or perhaps because continually returning to England for extended periods would conflict with the commitments, obligations and opportunities which would inevitably develop in X as both adults and child made friends, put down roots, involved themselves in the local community and wanted to do other things with their free time than simply get on a plane to England.  Dad, whether through ignorance of the law or his perception of Mum, put little store in the effectiveness of an English court order when a party was outside the jurisdiction and feared a future in which the focus became X-based and the importance of coming to England eroded rapidly. Mum was keen to rebut both of these points.</p>

He did not regard John as a child who was simply speaking with his mother&#8217;s voice.  However John&#8217;s views, he stated, were an understandable reaction to the novelty, the excitement and the adventure which X offered in contrast to simply more of the same in this jurisdiction in terms of his school and his friends.  </p>

Dad believed that John should not have to make a choice between everything and everyone he knew on the one hand and living with his Mum on the other. He was specifically concerned that a situation might arise whereby John, despite his best efforts and those of his mother and Bill to assist him, found himself not enjoying X, missing those who were now absences in his life and consequently being unable to settle.  In that scenario Dad questioned whether it was likely that John would feel able to articulate any unhappiness or, even if he did, would actually be returned if it meant Mum and Bill having to sacrifice their dream move,  of which they could well be making a real success, or his mother having to accept that she needed to separate from John?</p>

Given that Mum and Bill had such high hopes for a future life in X it was his view that they should make their move and try it out during their two year contract period.  If during that period John, who could travel out to X during school holidays when he could spend exclusive and dedicated time with his Mum, enjoyed X and could see how life was being lived there, what it would mean for him should he move too, then when the time came for him to move from primary to secondary school he could move to X.  This, suggested Dad, would result in an altogether  better choice because John would be both older and far better informed.  Despite the chronological and practical benefits which this suggestion, at least superficially, offered Mum, her view was that she could not contemplate a separation from John and therefore despite any apparent logic it was not an option she would entertain.</p>

If an outcome involves an interference in the rights of the child and a parent, even if it is the best option available, does that outcome amount to a disproportionate interference in their human rights?</p>

His relationship with his father is an important aspect of his life as well as being undoubtedly important to John himself.  A move to X would separate him from the majority of his family, albeit preserve his tie to his mother who has been a daily constant in his life.  A refusal of permission may separate John from his mother whilst preserving all of his other relationships.  Either way John stands to suffer loss.

John would most likely cope and possibly thrive in the identified school in X as he would were he to continue in his present school.  Whilst there is always the possibility that a child attending a school where their parent teaches can have a negative impact it must be recognized that the parent will know the school and the child&#8217;s teachers more than well and be well placed to ensure the child thrives.</span></p>

There will be a distance between him and those he has left behind which is not just measured in miles but more meaningfully in the infrequency with which there can be time spent directly in the company of those family members as well as the limits which will be in place which will mediate how he can enable those far away to share in his experiences in X.  Those new experiences will start to feature with increasing importance in his life and space will be made for them where previously time and opportunity had been for those now far away.

It would be wholly unreasonable to expect Mum, in that situation, not to feel disappointed and even downcast. Whilst any discontentment would not be directed towards John it would be equally unreasonable not to assume that it will not reflect within the household and so John will be aware of the sense of loss she is enduring, possibly feel an sense of attribution regarding it, perhaps direct anger towards his father and may be even develop a sense of guilt that, but for him not being allowed to go, his mother could have achieved her dream.</span></p>

All of these could be hugely beneficial to a child.</p>

However it is not the case that the unhappiness of a thwarted parent, even a parent with majority care, is of itself a welfare issue and certainly not one which, in isolation, should tip the balance.  Insofar as this was an issue highlighted by Thorpe LJ in the guidance he set out in his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Payne</span> it is now recognised as only being guidance as to the proper conduct of the necessary welfare evaluation and not a stand-out issue itself.  In any event as referred to above in my judgment even were Mum to feel unhappy with a refusal of permission there is no evidence upon which to base a conclusion that this would manifest itself in any negative manner towards John and certainly not anything likely to escalate to a situation of harm.</p>

It would not be a fait accompli, which would be the reality for Dad.  Mum would at least be able to reconcile her sense of regret with the knowledge that it was her choice not to leave and one that she was able to make for herself having balanced the considerations rather than it being imposed upon her.</p>

John, as acknowledged by Ms Youds, currently <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; has a great life, surrounded by people who love him&#8230;&#8217;</span> and the move to X, despite whatever potential it might offer, would only significantly upset all those arrangements which currently work so well for him.  Separation from both his siblings, a parent, his school, his friends and his neighbourhood aggregates to a significant change and one which potentially could completely undermine all that John currently benefits from.  Whilst change in life is inevitable, upsetting the apple cart in a dramatic and drastic way is not to be undertaken lightly, particularly when there is so much going right for a child which will be lost and may not be replaced.  </p>

Given Jane&#8217;s age and her possible future plans the chance even for a few years of children living together is not to be regarded as unimportant.  Even on that worst case scenario of his mother&#8217;s departure he would be able to visit her relatively frequently as well as maintaining frequent indirect communication, both of which be bolstered by the fact that time with his mother would be specific to her unlike time with his father if and when he returned to England which would have to be shared amongst other competing commitments.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In addition, in my judgment there is nothing in John&#8217;s current arrangements which necessitate a change of this magnitude. John is not dependent upon a particular parent for his care who now has to leave the jurisdiction for personal or professional reasons.  Mum is not in the situation of a person who moved to this jurisdiction for the sake of a relationship which has now failed and finds themselves isolated and without support absent that relationship.  Neither is this a situation whereby Mum has rebuilt her own life through a new relationship with an individual who now must or should return to a country of origin or whose professional commitments require them to relocate in order to maintain employment which offers a particular quality of life.  </p>

That is not an improper nor insignificant reason to seek to relocate but it is important to identify that the driving force is not John&#8217;s needs but his mother&#8217;s wishes.  I acknowledge that in making her case Mum is in no way callous as to her son&#8217;s welfare and may well believe that this move would only be good for John but the reality is that it is a move which will cause loss and create change when there is no need for either.</p>

There is nothing in John&#8217;s circumstances which requires the change proposed and much which would be deleteriously affected by making it.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In going to X now there is, in my judgement, a very real possibility that important parental and familial ties will inevitably be undermined and therefore changed in a way which is unlikely to be positive over the remaining years of John&#8217;s childhood and adolescence.  Dad, in my view, is right to consider that his relationship with John will begin to wither on the vine. It will be crowded out by the reality of a boy living far away from his father and learning to live with that degree of separation.  All the new experiences which would inevitably follow a departure will, just as inevitably, only serve to cement that reality of distance by decreasing his father&#8217;s knowledge and awareness of his son&#8217;s life and creating, to a not insignificant degree, a compartmentalisation of John&#8217;s life into what he does where he lives, goes to school and engages with his friends and what he does when he spends time with his father in England.  The two will become quite distinct and as John&#8217;s centre of interests inevitably changes from England to X so he will move on from the life that he currently enjoys in which his father is present and engaged and instead move on to a life in which his father is a distant onlooker.  That is not a change for the better, it is one which would have a significant impact upon this child&#8217;s welfare and therefore one which requires clear, necessary reasons to justify it.  In my judgement those reasons simply are not there.</p>

By so doing it would emphasise the need for John to maintain his connections with this jurisdiction, to keep up friendships and to continue to look upon his current location as one with which he had a real connection despite being so far away from it. It would make clear that his relationships in England would be continuing through and beyond this two year period.

That is entirely understandable when this move has been her plan since 2021.  The reality is that Mum and Bill already see X as a place in which they wish not just to work but where they will find professional fulfilment.  They both can already see themselves settling in X and are more than ready to embrace all that it offers and therefore to make the sacrifice of separation from family and friends which is required.
