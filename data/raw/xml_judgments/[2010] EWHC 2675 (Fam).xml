	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment is being handed down in private on 25 October 2010. It consists of 9 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge.  The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

I have therefore taken the opportunity both to reserve my judgment  and to put my reasons in writing. This will be a public judgment, although it is being written anonymously to protect the names of the individuals concerned.</p>

The order which I propose to make includes not only a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Harbin v Masterman</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1896] 1 Ch. 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1896">[1896] 1 Ch. 351</ref> at 366 investigation by the Official Solicitor,  but service on the defendants, liberty to apply, and determination by a judge of the High Court of any subsequent on notice hearing. Whether, on detailed investigation the facts prove to be as the applicant plainly believes them; whether  the jurisdiction which I have found <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ex parte</span> to exist (a) does indeed exist; (b) falls to be exercised; and (c) if so on what terms -  these are all matters which are open for debate on an <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">inter partes</span> hearing before a High Court Judge on circuit. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These can, for present purposes, be very shortly stated. Mr and Mrs L are an elderly married couple. He is 85: she is 90. They live with their son, DL, (who is in his fifties) in a house which is owned by Mr. L. Mrs L is physically disabled. She receives support by way of direct payments and twice daily visits from a care provider. However, the local authority accepts, for the purpose of this hearing, that neither Mr nor Mrs L (nor, for that matter, DL) is incapable, for any reason, of managing their own affairs, and, in particular, both Mr and Mrs L appear capable of deciding what their relationship with their son should be and, in particular, whether he should continue to live under the same roof as themselves.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The problem arises because of DL&#8217;s alleged conduct towards his parents, which is said to be aggressive, and which, on occasions, has resulted, it is said,  in physical violence by DL towards his parents. The local authority, which is the claimant in the proceedings, has documented incidents going back to 2005 which, it says, chronicle  DL&#8217;s  behaviour  and which include physical assaults, verbal threats, controlling where and when his parents may move in the house,  preventing them from leaving the house, and controlling who may visit them, including Mrs L&#8217;s carers. There have also been, it says, consistent reports  that DL is seeking  to coerce Mr L into transferring the ownership of the house into DL&#8217;s name and that he has also placed considerable pressure on both his parents to have Mrs L moved into a care home against her wishes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, the local authority wishes to take steps to protect Mr and Mrs. L from DL.  As to status; (1) it  acknowledges that, on the information currently available to it and as I have already indicated, neither Mr nor Mrs. L lacks the capacity to take proceedings on behalf of themselves or each other; (2)  it recognises that Mrs L, in particular, wishes to preserve her relationship with DL and does not want any proceedings taken against him. She, it appears, is worried that if steps are taken to remove DL from the property  he might at worst commit suicide or that, at best, she might lose contact with him.   Furthermore, the local authority acknowledges that whilst Mr. L is more critical of DL&#8217;s behaviour, he, Mr. L, would be unlikely to want to take steps in opposition to his wife&#8217;s wishes.</p>

The local authority is at pains  to emphasise that  at the stage - and certainly not <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">ex parte </span>-<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>it is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> seeking an order excluding DL from the house.

The case concerned a young woman of 17 (SA), who was profoundly deaf and unable to speak. She communicated by British sign language, with some limited ability to lipread English. Communication within the family, however,  was very limited, as neither of her parents could communicate using British sign language and SA had no ability to lipread Punjabi, the language spoken at home. </p>

The local authority was concerned that the family might take her to Pakistan to be married there to some unknown person contrary to her wishes, and applied to the court to invoke the inherent jurisdiction. As she was still under 18 years old SA could be made a ward of court, and injunctions were granted to prevent her being removed from the jurisdiction or married. However, the main issue in the proceedings was what would happen to her once she was an adult. </p>

The expert evidence was that SA had the capacity to marry, having a rudimentary but nevertheless clear and accurate understanding of the concept of marriage and of what a marriage contract would entail, including a sexual relationship. However, she did not understand immigration issues, and would have significant difficulty understanding the implications of a specific marriage contract to a specific individual, such as a change in her country of residence. SA&#8217;s evidence was that; (a) she wished to marry, but not yet; (b) she expected that her parents would choose a Muslim husband for her, probably from Pakistan, but that it would be for her to agree to the choice; (c)&#160;she would want a husband who would speak English, and who would want to live in England, in the same city as her family; and (d) she emphatically did not want to live in Pakistan.</p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">happiness</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span> What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221;</p>

It feared that an application on notice might provoke the very violence it sought to prevent. It also enabled the local authority to arrange service in what it described as &#8220;the safest and most sensitive way possible&#8221; thereby providing DL with an opportunity to comply with the order.
