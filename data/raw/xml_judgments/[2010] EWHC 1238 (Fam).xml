If the evidence has little or no bearing on the investigation or the trial, this will militate against a disclosure order.&#8221;   This is plainly linked to the issue above.  Child Trafficking is a serious criminal offence; it concerns the business of removing children from their homes and families, transporting them elsewhere, whether elsewhere within the country or overseas, to be put to use by others, usually to make money. The purpose of this exploitation is usually child labour, or child sexual exploitation. Besides the harm inflicted by the exploitation, the separation of the children from its family and its environment aggravates the harm inflicted. These offences are difficult to investigate and difficult to prosecute.  The evidence sought here is fundamental to the investigation; it may be said to be the foundation stone of such prosecution.  In the circumstances, the importance of the evidence gravitates strongly in favour of disclosure</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Of Mr. Day&#8217;s arguments, I found his first the most interesting and potentially challenging.  In the end, I am not persuaded that by granting the application I would be &#8211; as he would have it &#8211; licensing the disclosure of evidence of the mother&#8217;s DNA (through the evidence of the &#8216;match&#8217; or &#8216;non-match&#8217; with the children&#8217;s DNA) from the criminal investigation back into the family proceedings by the &#8216;backdoor&#8217;.  This submission is likely to be better directed at the &#8216;second stage&#8217; when the court is considering whether the local authority should succeed in its application (which has been signalled by Ms Tapson and included in the directions order which I am invited to approve at this hearing) not at this &#8216;first stage&#8217;.  It is a point which will need to be argued then, not now.  I make no comment at this stage about the efficacy of the argument, but I resist Mr Day&#8217;s endeavour to persuade me to look at the &#8216;first stage&#8217; and &#8216;second stage&#8217; together.  In my judgment it is right that I should consider them separately.  Different considerations are likely to arise at each stage.</span></p>

As it happens, I do not agree that the inconsistencies between the First Respondent and the children&#8217;s account of their family relationship (point 1 of Trainee Detective Constable W&#8217;s points) is a &#8216;weak&#8217; point; it is in my judgment far from it.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr Day further submits that if I am minded to order disclosure, I should limit the disclosure to the report but not the samples themselves.  I am clearly of the view that I should not limit the extent of the disclosure (as invited) to the DNA report but not the DNA sample; I do not accept Mr. Day&#8217;s submission that the infringement to the children&#8217;s human rights would be less significant if the sample itself were not disclosed; it seems to me that in these circumstances (and where there is no question at this stage of further samples being taken from the children) there is no material difference in the disclosures; either way there is an infringement (albeit a lawful one in my judgment) of the children&#8217;s rights. In any event, as Mr. Little points out, a DNA report is most unlikely to satisfy the &#8216;continuity&#8217; requirements of any possible prosecution, and a further application would then need to be made for further disclosure at which, doubtless, the same arguments which have been raised before me would be marshalled.  It is not in anyone&#8217;s interests that the MPC be required to restore the application for further argument on the further disclosure in order to use the material effectively. </span></p>
