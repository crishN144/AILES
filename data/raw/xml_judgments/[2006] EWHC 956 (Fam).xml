	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the aftermath of ancillary relief proceedings which ended in a consent order made by a District Judge sitting in the Principal Registry. The husband repents of his generosity to his wife and now seeks to escape from the order to which he consented. The issue before me is whether he can.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential chronology can be summarised quite briefly. The husband and wife (as I shall call them even though they are now divorced) are both high-earning analysts in the City. They were both born, as it happens within days of each other, in January 1967. They met in 1996 and began a relationship in the autumn of 1999. They married on 15 February 2003. Both had been married before, the husband twice and the wife once. By his second wife the husband has a son who is now 8 years old. The husband and the wife have a daughter, who was born on 26 May 2003. On 30 January 2004 the husband told the wife that he was having an affair with another woman and that the marriage was over. He confirmed that in a telephone call to the wife on 10 February 2004. He moved his belongings out of the matrimonial home between 13 and 21 February 2004.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22 February 2004 the husband and the wife met at the Lanesborough Hotel to discuss their financial affairs. They reached an agreement. Later the same day the husband instructed solicitors &#8211; not the same solicitors as are now acting for him. The wife instructed solicitors a little later &#8211; the first letter from her solicitors is dated 29 March 2004. Extensive correspondence followed, both between the solicitors and, to a certain extent, also between the husband and the wife.</p>

There was further correspondence and the draft consent order passed through a number of versions, albeit most of the amendments were concerned with minor matters or points of detail rather than matters of substance. The final draft was agreed on 28 September 2004. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife signed her Form M1 on 4 October 2004. It set out that she owned the former matrimonial home (previously in joint names but already transferred into her sole name) worth &#163;2,150,000, shares worth &#163;175,000, and a pension worth a notional &#163;28,000 per annum &#8220;if taken now&#8221;. She said that she had cash amounting to &#163;200,000. Her net income was said to be &#163;81,000 &#8220;before bonus&#8221;. The amount of the bonus was not stated. The husband&#8217;s case before me was that the wife was in fact earning bonuses of &#8220;up to &#163;350,000 net.&#8221; More specifically, reference was made to what the wife had said in a Form E exhibited to her witness statement dated 14 September 2005. In the last financial year (2004-2005) her basic salary was &#163;135,000. Together with bonus it amounted to &#163;853,565 gross, &#163;519,549 net. Also, by then, she said that her shares were worth &#163;513,706 whilst she had, she said, &#163;266,065 in various bank accounts. More recently it has emerged that the wife&#8217;s gross earnings in the year 2001-2002 amounted to &#163;560,035.</p>

It is not clear whether at that stage he had seen the wife&#8217;s Form M1 even in draft. As I have said, it was not signed by her until 4 October 2004 and it was only sent to his solicitors under cover of a letter dated 5 October 2004. On 11 October 2004 his solicitors wrote to him, saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you saw [her] M1 statement of financial information.&#8221; Having summarised its contents, the letter continued &#8220;I thought you would like to know if you did not.&#8221; On 13 October 2004 the wife&#8217;s solicitors lodged the agreed consent order and the Forms M1 with the court.</p>

Neither party appeared before the District Judge, who dealt with it as part of her &#8216;box-work&#8217;. It would seem that all the District Judge had before her were the wife&#8217;s Form A, the two Forms M1 and the signed draft consent order. The order is lengthy, but in light of the submissions that have been addressed to me I think I should set it out in full. Because of its length I have relegated it to an Appendix.</p>

In late February 2005 the wife telephoned the husband to tell him that she was giving up work, that she was being paid until the end of May 2005 and that she wanted him to put in place a direct debit for her maintenance from the end of June 2005. On 3 March 2005 the husband contacted his solicitors and on 9 March 2005 asked them if anything could be done to change the consent order. Leading counsel was instructed and advised in consultation on 13 April 2005. On 10 June 2005 the husband gave notice of change of solicitors. On 17 June 2005 he applied ex parte (without notice to the wife) to Bennett J. He produced to Bennett J drafts of four applications he wished to make:</p>

It is a curious and revealing document, though revealing more because of what it does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>say than because of anything very specific that it does say. The husband describes the &#8220;pressure&#8221; as follows:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Throughout the period of &#8216;negotiations&#8217; &#8230; , I was fully aware that she occupied, quite understandably, the moral high ground. I regretted the fact that the breakdown of the marriage had largely been my responsibility and that I had caused [her] a great deal of distress. I quite simply wanted to make amends as best I could. In hindsight, I realise that the pressure that I felt resulting from my own sense of guilt led me to listen, and agree, to proposals that were unreasonable and disproportionate in the extreme.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Whilst some of the pressure that I felt under was &#8220;self-generated&#8221;, [she] did not hesitate at all to take advantage of the fact that she occupied the moral high ground. She used both subtle, indirect and brutally direct methods to exert pressure on me during the period in which we were negotiating &#8211; she told me for example, on more than one occasion, that I was only a telephone call away from being fired.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Whether directly or otherwise, [she] made it very clear to me that she was in contact with colleagues of mine and that she would not hesitate to let them know if I did not agree to her demands. On a number of occasions, she made references to aspects of my remuneration package (in particular, forthcoming &#8220;special&#8221; dividend and profit share payments), details of which she could only have obtained from people with whom I worked. She often made references to what people had been saying about my behaviour. She invited a number of my colleagues, some of whom she barely knew, to gatherings (such as her house warming party and picnics) and she attended the wedding of one colleague at which, I understand (I was not there), she made her distress very clear to a number of people. The overall effect was that many of my colleagues (and as a result me too) were clearly made to feel very uncomfortable with the position in which they were being placed. Whilst little was said directly to me on the issue, I was aware that they resented being put in the position in which they were and that they understandably blamed me for it. One of my colleagues, whom I do not wish to name as I do not think that it would be appropriate given that I still work with him and hope to continue to do so in the future, told me that I should &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; and I felt that this was a sentiment held by most.</p>

I saw this as important not just for my own sake but for those of both [her] and our daughter &#8230; , and my previous wife and our son, all of whom I saw as likely to be reliant, to varying degrees whether directly or indirectly, on me financially in the future. I took the pragmatic view, therefore, that I had not only to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221;, whatever that might have been, but that I had to be seen to do it. I felt pressured into entering into an agreement which I really should not have in order to salvage what was left of my reputation.</p>

By email, she pressed, I say inappropriately, for me to provide &#8220;a life-long security net&#8221; even after she had commenced cohabiting or had re-married because of the way that I had treated her. As a result of both the pressure exerted by her and my own feeling of guilt, I was pushed into reaching a settlement that I should not have&#8221;.</p>

The wife&#8217;s solicitors wrote on 29 March 2004 accepting that full Forms E were not required but saying that something more than the limited disclosure on a Form M1 was appropriate. Although the wife&#8217;s solicitors pressed for, and eventually received, the disclosure they were seeking from the husband (see letters dated 7 and 20 May 2004, 8 and 10 June 2004, 5 July 2004 and 5 August 2004) it does not appear that the husband&#8217;s solicitors ever in fact pressed for similar disclosure from the wife. Indeed, as we have seen, the wife&#8217;s Form M1 was signed (and, for all I know, prepared) <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the husband had signed the consent order. That said, the husband was well aware of his wife&#8217;s earnings. As early as 25 February 2004 he told his solicitor that she &#8220;earns approximately &#163;800,000 per annum&#8221;, though as he also told her &#8220;he earns a lot more.&#8221;</p>

It is not every failure of frank and full disclosure which would justify a court in setting aside an order of the kind concerned in this appeal. On the contrary, it will only be in cases when the absence of full and frank disclosure has led to the court making, either in contested proceedings or by consent, an order which is substantially different from the order which it would have made if such disclosure had taken place that a case for setting aside can possibly be made good. Parties who apply to set aside orders on the ground of failure to disclose some relatively minor matter or matters, the disclosure of which would not have made any substantial difference to the order which the court would have made or approved, are likely to find their applications being summarily dismissed, with costs against them, or, if they are legally aided, against the legal aid fund.&#8221;</p>

Mr Carden submits that in practice these are not real problems and that a case of bad legal advice is as instantly recognisable as the elephant.

It is a wide test. Justice is a multi-faceted jewel and it is precious even if it has a minor flaw.

The realities of life in the Principal Registry and the divorce county courts are that the district judges are under inevitable pressure and the system only works because the judges rely on the practitioners&#8217; help. I would, therefore, be very slow to condemn any judge for a failure to see that bad legal advice is being tendered to a party. The statutory duty on the court cannot be ducked, but the court is entitled to assume that parties who are sui juris and who are represented by solicitors know what they want. Officious inquiry may uncover an injustice but it is more likely to disturb a delicate negotiation and produce the very costly litigation and the recrimination which conciliation is designed to avoid.&#8221;</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The amount of the lump sum was based on a calculation provided to the husband by the wife (see the letter from the wife&#8217;s solicitors dated 29 March 2004) of &#8220;the cost of providing for [the daughter] during her dependency&#8221; and on the mutual understanding (see the letter from the wife&#8217;s solicitors dated 10 August 2004) that &#8220;at the end of the day, there is unlikely to be any surplus.&#8221; The calculation, which as it makes clear on its face covers the period until the daughter reaches the age of 21, in fact totals &#163;2,366,147.30. Quite apart from the fact, as Mr Howard observes, that this calculation assumes that the daughter will have a nanny until the age of 21 &#8211; so it does, but this would have been obvious to the husband, and he chose not to query it &#8211; there is, Mr Howard submits, a fundamental fallacy in the calculation of the lump sum. Although the payments were to provide for the daughter&#8217;s support over a period of some twenty years, the lump sum was to be paid in full over the first ten years, and the calculation ignores the effect of the accelerated payment. The husband&#8217;s obligation was to pay &#163;250,000 per annum, yet the calculation shows the annual cost of the daughter&#8217;s support in the first year at a little under &#163;70,000 (the sum increases in subsequent years, because the costs are assumed to rise at 5% per annum, but even in the final year amounts to no more than some &#163;120,000). The calculation thus ignores the fact that there will be very substantial surpluses available for investment at the end of each of the ten years during which the husband is making the annual payments. Mr Howard tells me that he calculates the resulting accumulated surplus by the time the daughter reaches the age of 18 as amounting to at least &#163;2,700,000 and perhaps as much as &#163;3,000,000. Mr Howard submits that in these circumstances there was a mutual mistake.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, Mr Howard submits that a lump sum payment of this order of magnitude for a child is wrong in principle and cannot be justified under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53" uk:canonical="1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2) c. 53" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

Moreover, as Mr Howard points out, this nomination, being irrevocable, does not take into account the husband&#8217;s current partner or any future children he may have and means, for example, that if he works until the age of 65 his daughter will be entitled to this benefit until the age of 29.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Fourthly, Mr Howard submits that the combined effect of the order and the associated undertakings is to leave the husband vulnerable to being stripped of his capital assets at any time. The order provides (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of his undertakings and paragraph 1 of the curial part of the order) for the entirety of the outstanding balance of the &#163;2,500,000 to be payable immediately upon the happening of any one of a number of events any of which, according to Mr Howard, may perfectly possibly occur within the next nine years. Moreover, paragraph 1 of his undertakings prevents the husband voluntarily leaving his employment before the lump sum has been paid in full. On the basis, according to Mr Howard, that the husband&#8217;s realisable assets are worth some &#163;4,150,000, the effect of the order is, for example, that if the husband was to lose his job next week he would immediately be stripped of over half his remaining liquid capital. This, says Mr Howard, is a plain injustice, compounded by the fact, as he would have it, that since this is a lump sum payment there is no judicial remedy available, as there would be if the provision was by way of child maintenance. This is, in truth, he says, a periodical payments order in disguise but without the protection that the husband would have if it were in fact a periodical payments order (see <span style="font-style:italic">Corbett v Corbett </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/559" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 559" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 559</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 385" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 385</ref>).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Mr Howard accepts that there can be no objection in principle to the court accepting undertakings even when it cannot make orders.

The order in the present case, he says, falls into the second of these categories because of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/28/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53" uk:canonical="1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2) c. 53" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

Since it is questionable, according to Mr Howard, if the husband would in those circumstance be entitled to seek a variation if his own circumstances had remained unchanged, the proper course is, he says, to discharge here and now what he calls this unsatisfactory and likely unenforceable undertaking and permit the husband, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Dart v Dart </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 286</ref>, to seek a suitable periodical payments order against himself.</p>

That is not, he submits, a necessary pre-requisite to a variation application. He relies in this context upon what Thorpe J said in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B (Consent Order: Variation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 9" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 9</ref> and submits that there are strong public policy arguments for entertaining such an application now, given, as he puts it, that if the court leaves the relevant undertaking untouched it will almost inevitable give rise to complicated and expensive litigation in the future.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to bad legal advice the husband&#8217;s case, as articulated by Mr Howard, is that there is nothing in his solicitors&#8217; file to suggest that the husband was ever advised that the court would be prohibited from making a periodical payments order to continue beyond the wife&#8217;s remarriage, or that his daughter would have a lump sum of at least &#163;2,700,000 or even &#163;3,000,000 available to her as soon as she turns 18 (more, if she were to receive in addition the benefit of the irrevocable death-in-service nomination in accordance with paragraph 6 of his undertakings), or that this was wrong in principle. Most serious of all, says Mr Howard, is that, not merely was the husband never advised that he was not bound to consent to an order in the terms of what had been agreed in relation to periodical payments; he was in fact, as we have seen, given completely the opposite advice. This last, says Mr Howard, must amount to grossly bad advice. In the same vein Mr Howard describes as &#8220;breathtaking&#8221; the fact (see an e-mail from the husband to the wife on 25 February 2004) that his solicitor apparently said that &#8220;she only has one concern&#8221; about what had been agreed &#8211; and that on a technical matter to do with the husband&#8217;s maintenance obligation for his daughter which Mr Howard does not in fact see as a problem.</p>

That, says Mr Howard, provides a safeguard for the party whose legal advice has fallen short of the expected standard. Here, however, he says, the situation was quite different. Not merely was the legal advice the husband had received grossly bad, but the court, he asserts, played no more than a passive role in making the order, receiving no submissions from the parties (who were not present) and, as he would have it, failing to exercise any sort of supervisory role and simply rubber-stamping the order: for the significance of these submissions see the observations of Connell J in <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Manahan </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 205" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 205</ref> at page 222 quoted in paragraph [45] above. So, says Mr Howard, this is a case where a litigant &#8211; the husband &#8211; was failed not once but twice. In this sensitive jurisdiction, he says, divorcing spouses are ordinarily afforded two layers of protection: competent legal advice, followed by the independent scrutiny of the court. In this case, he says, both these safeguards failed the husband. Hence, he submits, the vital importance of not closing off the appeal route.</p>

That, he says, is precisely this case. The availability of an appeal, even an appeal out of time, is, says Mr Howard, a vital protection against injustice in a case such as this. It required no forensic ferreting, he says, to see that this order was, even on its face, &#8220;seriously flawed&#8221;. The order, he says, contained no fewer than seven provisions which should have rung alarm bells: recital (i), paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 of the husband&#8217;s undertakings and paragraph 1 of the curial part of the order. Moreover, he says, even a brief glance at the Forms M1 would have shown that, taking the transfer of the matrimonial home and the lump sum payment to the daughter together, the order awarded almost the entirety of the capital from an eleven-month marriage to the wife and daughter.</p>

It seems to me to be quite unrealistic to say that a family court, when acting under Ord 18 r 19(1)(a)&#8211;(d) and/or under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, cannot apply the authorities to which Miss Baron referred in order to achieve a just result. If, strictly speaking, Ord 18 r 19(1) sits uneasily with the authorities I have referred to, then I see no reason why the authorities cannot, and every reason why they should, be applied when the court is exercising its inherent jurisdiction. In my judgment, it is absolutely essential in ancillary relief cases that the court should be able to put a stop to applications seeking to reopen matters already decided by a court, whether by consent or after a contested hearing, if the court is satisfied that no useful purpose will be served by reopening the matter. I therefore propose to apply them.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Scott&#8217;s starting point, with which I entirely agree, is that it is a fundamental principle of public policy, applicable as much in the context of ancillary relief as in any other context, that there should be finality in litigation &#8211; a principle which, as he rightly says, applies with particular force where an order has been made by consent. There is, as he says, a strong public interest in parties reaching agreement in cases such as this, for an agreed order will save time, costs and stress for the parties and reduce the burden on court resources which unhappily are both limited and at present desperately over-stretched. An order, he says, should be disturbed only for good and clear reasons. I agree. Furthermore, he says, and again I agree, it is no part of the court&#8217;s function to give relief in a case such as this to a husband &#8211; or, for that matter, a wife &#8211; who having initially been generous later regrets his generosity. As Mr Scott rightly says, there is no public policy against generosity and no public policy against the court enforcing an over generous order willingly entered into. On the contrary, as he points out, generosity on the part of a husband who is also a father is likely to generate an easier relationship with the mother that can only be for the benefit of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can start by clearing the ground. There is not &#8211; there cannot be &#8211; any suggestion that circumstances have changed in any material respect since the consent order was made. True it is that the wife ceased to work &#8211; and thus demanded that the husband start making payment of the periodical payments &#8211; rather sooner than the husband had anticipated (though in the event she subsequently returned to work and did not pursue her demands). But this is not the kind of change of circumstance that can justify re-opening the order. It is simply the happening, albeit sooner than expected, of an event for which the order itself made specific provision. This is not the case of an unexpected supervening event. It is, if it is anything, a case where, as the husband would have it, there was a flaw in the trial process. It follows, therefore, and for reasons which I have already explained, that the husband cannot rely upon either <span style="font-style:italic">Barder v Caluori </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] AC 20" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] AC 20</ref> or <span style="font-style:italic">Thwaite v Thwaite</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] Fam 1</ref>. He cannot take advantage of the fact that parts of the order are still executory, nor of the fact that parts of the order are embodied in undertakings. He is, in principle, confined to asserting &#8211; and it matters not for this purpose by what precise means he brings his application before the court &#8211; that the consent order should be set aside on one or other of the three recognised grounds of fraud, mistake or non-disclosure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a matter of law, it is not open to the husband to argue that the order should be set aside because of bad legal advice. The authorities demonstrate, in my judgment, as Mr Scott puts it, that that contention is trumped by the need for finality. Nor can the husband rely upon the fact, assuming it to be the fact, that he was put under pressure. Let it be assumed for the sake of argument that Balcombe J was correct in <span style="font-style:italic">Tommey v Tommey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] Fam 15" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] Fam 15</ref>. Let it be assumed, therefore, that a consent order can be set aside on the grounds of duress or undue influence. But pressure, even unfair pressure, falling short of undue influence cannot, in my judgment, suffice on any view. As Mr Scott says, and I agree, the need for finality and certainty makes it inappropriate to set any lower hurdle. And the simple fact, as we have seen, is that the husband explicitly disavows any allegation of undue influence and accepts that the influence which he alleges cannot of itself suffice to set aside the order. </p>

Quite apart from the fact that the calculation itself suggested that there would be a surplus &#8211; being the difference between the aggregated expenditure of &#163;2,366,147.30 and the aggregate lump sum of &#163;2,500,000 &#8211; the correspondence shows that the parties recognised that there might indeed be a surplus.

It is one thing to say that the court cannot itself award periodical payments beyond remarriage. It is a very different thing to say that, as a matter of public or legislative policy, the court is forbidden to lend its aid to such an obligation voluntarily assumed and embodied in a formal undertaking. And in my judgment there is no such principle. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Mr Scott helpfully pointed out, the relevant public policy is still to be found articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Hyman v Hyman</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1929] AC 601" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1929">[1929] AC 601</ref>, the ratio of which, as he says, is that there is a public interest in ensuring that a wife &#8211; or, I should add, in modern conditions a husband &#8211; does not become an unnecessary burden on public funds. Hence the rule that she cannot contract out of her entitlement to maintenance without the approval of the court. Now it may be, as Mr Scott is prepared to accept, at least for the purposes of argument, that the same principle would apply if a husband was proposing to transfer <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> his assets and income to his wife. But, as he says, and I agree, provided that a husband leaves himself adequately provided for it is not for the court to tell a wealthy man who has had legal advice that he is not to be generous, even very generous indeed. The courts in practice &#8211; and rightly &#8211; give the parties considerable latitude to reach their own agreements, recognising that they may have their own entirely proper private reasons for wishing to be more generous, or, as the case may be, less demanding, than the court might think the circumstances warrant. And the simple fact is, notwithstanding Mr Howard&#8217;s rhetoric, that the husband here has not so stripped himself of either his assets or his income as to bring the case, even arguably, within anything remotely approaching hailing distance of being able to take the benefit of any principle of public policy.</p>

Mr Scott submits that the best measure of fairness is not what a court might have ordered but what the parties have actually agreed. There is force in that, but I prefer to proceed on a simpler and clearer basis. A consent order can be set aside on the grounds of fraud, mistake, non-disclosure and (I am prepared to assume for present purposes) undue influence. It has never hitherto been suggested that in circumstances not falling within one or other of such categories a consent order can be set aside simply on the basis that it is unfair &#8211; even very unfair &#8211; to one party. Unfairness not involving fraud, mistake, non-disclosure or undue influence is not, in my judgment, a ground for setting aside a consent order.</p>

That rhetorical flourish, if Mr Howard will allow me to say so, displays both faulty logic and an erroneous view of the law. A District Judge exercising this jurisdiction can never be required to make an order, however pressing the entreaties of the parties and whatever the eloquence of their lawyers. The District Judge always has to exercise her discretion, even if presented with a draft consent order. The fact that in the present case I have come to the conclusion that the husband cannot have the order set aside on the ground that the District Judge should not have approved it, does not carry with it, whether as a matter of law or as a matter of logic, any implication that the District Judge was bound to make the order. She was not. But she chose to do so, and in what I am satisfied was the proper and conscientious exercise of her discretion. The case, in my judgment, does not fall within the very exceptional kind of case postulated by Ward LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Manahan </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 205" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 205</ref> at page 216. Another District Judge might have taken a different view. Another District Judge might have declined to make the order without first hearing from the parties and, conceivably, even after and despite hearing the parties. But that is beside the point. District Judge MacGregor cannot, in my judgment, be faulted for acting here as she did. </p>

Whether assessed individually or in combination, none of the matters upon which Mr Howard relies provides the husband with any even arguable basis for having the order set aside. And that goes, I should add, whichever jurisdictional route the husband seeks to avail himself of. It follows that each of his applications which seeks the setting aside of the order must be struck out. In my judgment, they disclose no properly arguable cause of action and, to adopt Bennett J&#8217;s phraseology in <span style="font-style:italic">Rose v Rose </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/505" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 505 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 505 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 197" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 197</ref>, it would serve no useful purpose to allow them to proceed. On the contrary, to allow them to proceed any further would be to strike at the very finality which is so very important, not least in this particular jurisdiction.</p>

In the light of the decision to which I have come this is not a matter which, in the event, calls for decision. It suffices in the circumstances if I say that if there was otherwise substance in the husband&#8217;s applications I would probably <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>have struck them out simply on the ground of delay.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can take the point very shortly. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31</ref> entitles the husband to apply for an order varying, discharging or suspending that part of the consent order which constitutes an order for periodical payments. That entitlement is not in any way affected either by the fact that the order was a consent order or by the fact that the relevant provisions are contained in undertakings rather than in the curial part of the order. Nor, and on this point I agree with Mr Howard, is it a necessary pre-requisite to the exercise of jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> that there has been some change in circumstances since the order was made. No doubt, as Mr Scott observes, the court will usually be reluctant to intervene, absent any change of circumstances, where, as here, the order was made by consent and less than a year before the application is made. But that goes at most to the way in which the court may usually be expected to exercise its jurisdiction, not to the existence of the jurisdiction itself. Moreover, as Mr Howard correctly submits, relying for this purpose on what Thorpe J said in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B (Consent Order: Variation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 9" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 9</ref>, the jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> is exercisable on much wider grounds than the very limited jurisdiction to set aside a consent order (see paragraphs [55]-[56] above). It follows, in my judgment, that it is nothing to the point for Mr Scott to complain that the husband&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> is in reality a thinly veiled attempt to appeal. So it may be, judged from the husband&#8217;s layman&#8217;s perspective. But it is not an appeal. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31</ref> is a statutory jurisdiction to vary, discharge or suspend a periodical payments order. The fact that in a particular case some exercise of this jurisdiction may be indistinguishable in its practical effects from a successful appeal is neither here nor there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of the conclusion to which I have come I propose to say little about the merits of the husband&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>. That is a matter for another day. But I have come to the conclusion in all the circumstances, and having regard to the amplitude of the jurisdiction as explained by Thorpe J in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B (Consent Order: Variation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 9" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 9</ref>, that it would be quite wrong to strike out the application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>. It cannot be said to be devoid of arguable merit. Nor can it be said that no useful purpose would be served by allowing it to proceed. His application may or may not succeed, though I cannot help thinking that it may, at least to some extent. Be that as it may, the husband, in my judgment, is entitled to proceed with his application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>. I see no need for the husband to be allowed to pursue his <span style="font-style:italic">Dart v Dart </span>application. The fact is that the court has made provision for periodical payments, albeit by way of accepting undertakings, and any adjustment of the consent order to which the husband is entitled can be effected pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>.</p>
