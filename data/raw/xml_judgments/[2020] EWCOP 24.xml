	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This judgment does not establish any great or new point of legal principle.  It sets out my reasoning in reaching conclusions in a case which has the characteristics of many which come before the Court of Protection: namely, where the subject of the application is believed to have capacity in making decisions in relation to certain aspects of their life, but not in others; where there are, in such cases, inevitably &#8216;grey areas&#8217; in between.  It recognises the importance of treating each capacity issue as decision-specific and time-specific, as the judicial guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">PC v City of York Council</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 WLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 WLR 1</ref><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Some decisions, for example agreeing to marry or consenting to divorce, are status or act specific. Some other decisions, for example whether P should have contact with a particular individual, may be person specific.

A further safeguarding referral followed in 2012, when he moved in with another man who he had met on the Internet.

When these relationships have run into difficulties, or have soured (as inevitably has been the case), AW has often responded aggressively, and has verbally and physically assaulted those around him, sometimes indiscriminately. At Christmas 2018, he assaulted his mother, when she stopped him from using her laptop to access the Internet. He himself has been assaulted, on occasions seriously. He has not been able to assess the ulterior motives of others, and this has rendered him vulnerable to exploitation. He has assaulted staff members at Windmill House. Additionally, he has run up significant debt through his excessive phone and Internet use. </p>

AW&#8217;s vulnerability is further underlined by him sending inappropriate pictures of himself to strangers.

Such is his level of need that he now has forty hours of one-to-one support per week, including specifically times when he is accessing the community.  He is said generally to be very happy at Windmill Lodge, though because he has spent many hours at night on the Internet and on his phone, he tends to sleep all day, missing activities; this has caused him to become somewhat socially isolated. </p>

This follows the recommendations of Dr Rippon (see below). Subject to the outcome of any such assessment, arrangements for direct contact would be made.

This brought into sharp relief the issue of AW&#8217;s capacity to decide on his residence.  However, on 26 February 2020, AW contacted the social worker to say that as Trevor no longer wanted to progress that relationship, he did not want to move; at the date of the hearing that remains AW&#8217;s position. </p>

I note that the development by the Local Authority of a &#8216;sexual relationships care and support plan&#8217; has been premised on the basis that, although AW has capacity to consent to sexual relations, he lacks capacity to make decisions whether an individual with whom he may wish to have sexual relations is safe; it sets out the support which he requires when having contact with an individual with whom he wishes to have sexual relations.  By oversight, I failed to make a declaration in this respect at the February 2020 hearing as I could have done (there being no opposition to it), and will do so now. </p>

In adjourning the case, I was invited also to consider what decisions should be made as to the restrictions on AW&#8217;s access to and use of the internet and social media, and the support provided to allow AW to develop sexual relationships if that is what he wishes. </p>

It was this lack of &#8216;understanding&#8217; of the information relevant to a change of residence, and in change of care, particularly the negative consequences of a change, which caused Dr. Rippon to conclude in the end that AW <span style="font-style:italic">lacked capacity</span> in decision-making on residence and indeed on care.

The consequence is that AW is likely to lack capacity to make decisions about his care and support arrangements in this regard.  This is all the more germane in light of Dr. Rippon&#8217;s evidence that AW does not &#8216;understand&#8217; the negative consequences of his actions. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have already found, on the evidence and applying the relevant legal principles, that AW has capacity to consent to, and enter into, sexual relations. This permits him to establish relationships with others, and it supports his wish to meet other men with whom he may have sexual relationships. I have, of course, also concluded that AW lacks capacity to make decisions as to contact with others, and to access and use the internet and social media. This creates potentially difficult challenges for the Local Authority, and the court, in balancing the positive obligations to ensure that AW is supported in having a sexual relationship should he wish to do so, while also ensuring, as far as possible, that he is kept safe from harm. </p>

AW was unable, on assessment, to understand that those who would be providing him with support at Thornley House (should he move there) would not be familiar with him, and he was unable to predict what would happen if he did not have any support or he refused it.  It is noted that is a degree of overlap in the information relevant to the two questions, and I am conscious that they should not be considered in separate &#8216;silos&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>). </p>
