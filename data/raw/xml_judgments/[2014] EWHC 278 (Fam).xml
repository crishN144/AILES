	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue arising in this judgment is whether I should restrain the local authority from disclosing to the police transcripts of two earlier judgments I have delivered in the long-running care proceedings concerning two children, &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221;. </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purposes of this judgment, it is unnecessary to set out more than the bare bones of the history. The care proceedings started following the discovery that Y .had sustained injuries. A fact finding hearing was conducted by me and led to a judgment (hereafter referred to as &#8220;my first judgment&#8221;). That judgment has been published anonymously. The un-redacted version of the judgment has not been communicated to anybody, including the police. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I was unable to say whether the injuries were sustained as a result of one or more incidents, nor to identify which parent was responsible. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It was probable that one of the parents was responsible for the injuries and the other was knowingly withholding information so as to protect the perpetrator. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I ended my judgment by expressing the acknowledgment that both parents were in many other ways good parents to X and Y. Both wished very much to care for the children again. I acknowledged that all children, wherever possible, should be brought up by their parents and said that I did not regard my findings as the end of the story. I urged both parents, even at that late stage, to be more frank with the court about what had happened to Y so that the professionals and the court could work together with them to ensure that both children were safe in the future. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two days after the delivery of that judgment, the father confessed that he had inflicted the injuries. Following this development, the parents separated. The matter was therefore restored before me and I directed a further fact-finding hearing be listed urgently before me. The father duly filed a statement in which he described in detail the circumstances in which he had come to inflict the injuries. The mother filed a statement setting out her response to the father&#8217;s confession. Two experts filed addendum reports in which they accepted that the injuries could have been sustained in the incidents described by the father. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The resumed fact-finding hearing took place, at the conclusion of which I delivered an ex tempore judgment which has also been transcribed but, to date, not released for publication nor disclosed to the police. In that judgment (hereafter referred to as &#8220;my second judgment&#8221;), I concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that the injuries had been inflicted by the father in the manner described in his statement. In addition, I reviewed my conclusion in my first judgment that the mother had not been truthful. Having carefully reconsidered the various strands of the evidence, I concluded that the local authority had not proved that the mother knew or ought to have known that the father had injured or was likely to injure Y, nor that she had failed to protect the children.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother having been thus completely exonerated, the case was ultimately resolved, following further assessments, by the rehabilitation of the children with the mother. I made a supervision order for 12 months, on the basis that the children would reside with the mother and that the father&#8217;s contact with the children would be supervised. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That order did not, however, completely conclude the proceedings, because the father&#8217;s lawyers had filed an application for an order &#8220;preventing or prohibiting the local authority, or any other party, disclosing any material contained within these proceedings to the police or the Crown Prosecution Service&#8221;. As a result, the local authority has refrained from passing on any information concerning my findings to the police. Following the discovery of Y&#8217;s injuries, the police had carried out an investigation but, having concluded that they were unable to determine which parent caused the injuries, had closed their file under the heading &#8220;no further action&#8221; Subsequently, however, a Detective Sergeant filed a statement seeking disclosure of any information that had come to light in these proceedings indicating the perpetrator of Y&#8217;s injuries &#8220;in order that the decision to prosecute that person can be taken&#8221;. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After a further regrettable delay, a full hearing was therefore arranged (during the Christmas vacation) in January 2014 at which this question was considered. At the outset, I indicated that I proposed to proceed in stages. The first stage would be to ascertain whether un-redacted copies of my two judgments should be disclosed to the police. The second stage would be to consider any application by the police for disclosure of other information relating to the proceedings, which would of course be effected by my decision on the first question as to disclosure of the judgments. The hearing in January therefore focussed on the first question &#8211; disclosure of the judgments. Written submissions were filed by all parties to the care proceedings &#8211; by the father, mother and guardian opposing disclosure and by the local authority supporting it. A short written submission was also filed by counsel for the police who attended at court but did not sit in during the hearing to allow counsel for the father and others to refer freely to confidential information in support of their respective positions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, the fact that a judgment, or indeed any information relating to family proceedings, is disclosed to the police and the prosecuting authorities does not automatically render it admissible in the criminal proceedings. The rules governing the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings are, of course, governed by the Criminal Procedure Rules. In addition, there is the important provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref> of the Children Act set out above. By definition, the question of admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings will only arise within those proceedings themselves.

In particular, it has been recognised by the family court that, while <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref> prevents the confession made in family proceedings being admissible in evidence in court proceedings (save on a count of perjury), it does not preclude the police, to whom the evidence of the confession is disclosed, from using that evidence, in the words of Ward J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Oxfordshire CCl v P</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>at page 561, to &#8220;shape the nature and range of the enquiries they undertake in the investigation of the alleged criminal offences&#8221;. The police may, for example, put the confession to a suspect in a further interview. If they do so, and he accepts the truthfulness of the confession, that response may itself become admissible in the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, it is suggested by Mr Storey QC on behalf of the father in this case that, whilst <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref> prevents an admission made in family proceedings being introduced in evidence in a criminal trial, it may still be possible for that admission to be put to a defendant in the course of his oral evidence as a &#8220;previously inconsistent statement&#8221; pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/44/section/119" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 119</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/44" uk:canonical="2003 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Justice Act 2003</ref>.

The proceedings themselves are confidential but subject to the power of the judge, in appropriate circumstances, to order disclosure. Nothing in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s98</ref> detracts from that power. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 98(2)</ref> gives protection only against statements being admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings except for an offence of perjury. Accordingly, the judge could not give any guarantee for all time as to confidentiality, even had he wished to do so because the law makes no provision which would enable him to do so. It may well be that in fairness to persons giving evidence in these circumstances judges may wish to point this out to a witness to whom the warning is given and, almost certainly, a legal adviser should do so. &#8221;</p>

In that case, the mother had made a confession in care proceedings that she had been responsible for injuries that had led to the death of her older child. Baron J ordered disclosure of certain documents to the police, including the confession. Subsequently, the police applied for permission to disclose the confession to the expert witnesses instructed in the criminal investigation, but concern was raised on behalf of the mother that such disclosure might jeopardize the protection afforded to the mother under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref>. The learned judge therefore ordered that only a summary of information, dealing with the mechanism of the injuries suggested by the mother in her confession, should be given to the experts instructed by the police, holding that, while it was appropriate for the experts in the criminal context to comment upon the mother&#8217;s version of events as a mechanism for the injuries to the first child, they did not need to know of her express confession. </p>

Now the children are back in the care of their mother. But life has not yet returned to normal. The scars caused by the years of separation will remain for some time and possibly indefinitely. Furthermore, although the children are now rehabilitated with the mother, they remain apart from the father, whom they continue to see only in a supervised setting. I accept that the children have a close and loving relationship with their father, and continue to be emotionally affected by his absence from their home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The prospect of a further criminal investigation, and possible prosecution, raises the spectre of further suffering for the children. A criminal investigation by itself will create renewed pressures. If the father is prosecuted, there will be further consequences, whatever the outcome of the prosecution. There will be publicity and stigma for the family. More importantly, it is likely that the father will lose his job and as a result the family will lose their home. There will be a sharp decline in the family income and X will in all probability have to leave the school which X now attends. Whatever sentence the father receives if convicted, he will in all probability lose the access to the important therapy that he has just started to address the psychological causes for his actions in injuring Y. Without that therapy it might be difficult for him to persuade the court in future that he should have unsupervised contact to his children, or be permitted to return to the family home. </p>

He submitted that, as the court had omitted to give the parents any warning that an admission of responsibility for the injuries might not be kept confidential from the police, it would be unfair on the father to disclose the judgment, or any information relating to his confession to the police, and that this factor ought to carry decisive weight in the balancing exercise. He reiterated the points made on his primary submission set out above. In my judgment, however, it will be possible to so restrict the use of the judgment by the police so that no further dissemination of information contained in the judgments can be made without a further full argument as to fairness to the father.</p>

There is a danger that, by disclosing any information to the police, parties in a similar position in other proceedings will be discouraged from speaking frankly about what they have done. </p>

It is in the public interest that serious crimes should be brought to the attention of the police so that they can decide whether to carry out any investigations. The father has admitted to assaulting Y on each occasion with sufficient force to cause the injuries. As has been acknowledged by many judges on previous occasions &#8211; for example, Baron J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M</span> [2008] (supra) at paragraph 18 &#8211; it is the police who have a duty to investigate crime and it is the Crown Prosecution Service which has a duty to decide whether to bring criminal charges. It is not for the family court to decide whether prosecutions should be brought or pursued. Disclosure of the judgment will enable the police and CPS to decide whether or not to pursue the criminal investigation. In carrying out the balancing exercise as to disclosure of the judgments, this court recognises the importance of not impeding those bodies from carrying out their statutory duties. </p>

Equally, it would not take much investigation by the police to discover that the children have been returned to the mother&#8217;s care and therefore to deduce that the perpetrator identified by the court was indeed the father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The assaults inflicted on Y by the father were serious. The amendments for the rules have been carefully crafted to enable the police to be informed of the judge&#8217;s findings and reasons, but to preclude any further use of the information in the judgment without the further permission of the family court. The public interest in the sharing of information between the agencies involved in child protection, and the removal of barriers between different branches of the justice system, have been recognised by the terms of Practice Direction 12G and are underlined by the terms of the 2013 Protocol. There may be cases where other factors outweigh this public interest. In my judgment, this case does not fall into that category. The welfare of the children will not be significantly affected simply by the disclosure of the judgment, provided the police and the CPS are precluded from disclosing it, or any information contained in it, to any person without the court&#8217;s permission. Indeed, in so far as disclosure of the judgment completes the exoneration of the mother, it may indeed buttress the children&#8217;s placement in her care and therefore perhaps improve their emotional security. </p>

The fact that the deployment of those arguments on this application has not persuaded me to prevent disclosure of the judgments should not be interpreted as any indication of where the balance would fall in the event that the police seek permission for wider disclosure, or for that matter for disclosure of further documents or information relating to these proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a short supplemental written submission, Miss Rogers on behalf of the mother argued that disclosure of the judgments would open a gateway to the re-opening of a criminal investigation which has been closed for some time and that, once the gateway is opened, the court will have no means of controlling the steps that may be taken by the police or the CPS, unless it makes orders which binds the information in the hands of one person, hampering the police investigation and thus likely to be challenged. I do not accept that this court will lose control of information simply by not restraining the local authority from disclosing the judgments to the police. The purpose of disclosing the judgment is to inform the police of the outcome of the fact-finding process in the care proceedings so that they can decide whether to pursue their investigation and make a further application for disclosure. Neither the police nor the CPS may disclose the judgments, or any information in the judgments, without my permission. I propose to buttress the clear provisions of Chapter 7 of the FPR by an order making clear the limits of the disclosure I am permitting at this stage. Any contravention of the rules or this order would be a contempt of court.  </p>
