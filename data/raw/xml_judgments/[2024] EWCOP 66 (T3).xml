Every patient, and every case, is different and must be decided on its own facts.

There are cases, such as Bland, where there is no balancing exercise to be conducted. There are cases, where death is in any event imminent, where the factors weighing in the balance will be different from those where life may continue for some time.&#8221; </span></p>

The high level of repeated interventions required need to be considered in the context of a deteriorating clinical picture. On behalf of the Official Solicitor he recognises the presumption of the sanctity of life but, as he submits, the reality is the person XR was has long gone. He submits the important component of the balancing exercise of what XR would have thought is not available here. There is evidence of a picture of XR&#8217;s life but it would be unsafe to draw any conclusions as to his wishes and feelings from that limited information as it carries with it the risks of speculation. The dangers of that were illustrated by the fact that some of the inferences made about XR&#8217;s background have been put into doubt through the limited additional information the Official Solicitor has been able to obtain about XR.</p>

This is because the benefits of such treatment continuing are significantly outweighed by the considerable burdens for XR caused by  the daily care interventions, of which there is detailed evidence, that are required to continue in the context where there is no prospect of any change in XR&#8217;s diagnosis or prognosis. I accept the evidence of both Dr Hanrahan and Professor Wade of a trajectory of decline in XR&#8217;s position where the burdens of such treatments and interventions are likely to increase.  For the reasons set out above XR&#8217;s wishes and feelings are unknown and, as a consequence, cannot be factored in the court&#8217;s consideration of what is in his best interests. The issue between Dr Hanrahan and Professor Wade as to whether XR can experience pain is considered in the context of there being a risk of the possibility that XR may experience pain but it can be no higher than that and in the light of the other considerations that factor, in the circumstances of this case, does not have a material bearing on the balancing exercise undertaken by the court in reaching a decision as to what is in XR&#8217;s best interests.</p>

The decision maker, Dr A, considered the position to be finely balanced. Even though others took a different view that clinical decision and judgment should be respected. It is important that having properly considered the relevant Guidelines/Guidance clinicians should not feel under pressure either way regarding decisions that they have reached. Having said that, it remained unclear what system, if any, was in place for seeking disclosure of XR&#8217;s records, who was undertaking that, and what role the IMCA played. In this case it is right to record that the Official Solicitor was able to gain more information about XR through the third party disclosure orders made once these proceedings were commenced. In the end it made no difference to the information that was available, although it could easily have done, and if the application had not been made would have risked relevant information not being available in reaching a best interest decision.</p>

In his oral evidence, Professor Wade recognised there was a group of patients in PDOC where the clinicians carry on providing CANH by default because there are no friends or family to consult.  Within that group, the Official Solicitor submits, there may be patients who are currently receiving life-sustaining treatment the continuation of which may not be in their best interests.  In the Official Solicitor&#8217;s view even in a specialist setting such as the RHN XR was the subject of annual reviews from 2019 when he was assessed as being in a VS yet no application was made to the court until five years later in April 2024.</p>
