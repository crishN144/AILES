	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a further judgment in proceedings in the Court of Protection brought by G concerning her younger brother E, a young man aged 20 who suffers from severe disabilities attributable to a rare genetic condition called tuberous sclerosis, and as a result lacks capacity within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8220;MCA&#8221;).  On 26 March 2010, I delivered a lengthy judgment dealing with a number of issues that had arisen as a result of the removal of E by the local authority responsible for providing him with support from the care of F with whom he had lived in foster care for a number of years as a child and subsequently under an adult placement.  In that judgment, in which I considered a number of complex legal issues raised by the parties and which is now reported at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/621" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 621 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 621 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 294" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 294</ref>, I held and declared, that the local authority had infringed E&#8217;s rights under Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by removing him from F&#8217;s care without proper authorisation, failing to give any or any adequate consideration to his family life with F at the time of the removal or for many months thereafter, failing adequately to involve F in the decision making process about E&#8217;s future and restricting contact between E and F for several months after his removal.  I further held, and declared, that the local authority had unlawfully deprived E of his liberty and infringed his rights under Article 5 of ECHR by placing him at a residential unit known as V unit, without seeking authorisation under the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards in Schedule A1 of the MCA or an order of the Court of Protection, and by subsequently placing him at another residential establishment, known as Z Road run by an organisation known as X Ltd, without seeking an order of the court.  By the time of that judgment, E had been away from F&#8217;s care for ten months and at that point I thought that it would not be in his best interests to be returned to her care without further assessments.  I therefore directed that those assessments be carried out for a further review hearing and that, in the interim, E should continue to reside at Z Road, with increased contact with F and his sister G.  By May 2010, however, on the basis of evidence by then available, I was able to conclude that it was now in E&#8217;s best interests to return to F&#8217;s care and accordingly I made an order to that effect.  E duly returned to F&#8217;s care where he quickly and easily settled in, and has continued to have regular contact with G and her family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In July 2010, I conducted a further hearing at which more issues were raised.  One concerned the question whether I should lift the anonymity previously imposed on the local authority about which I had made a number of serious critical findings at the earlier hearing.  Having received submissions on this point, including from the Press Association on behalf of the media, I concluded that the anonymity should be lifted and therefore identified the local authority as Manchester City Council.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two further issues were considered at the hearing in July and it is these matters which form the subject of this reserved judgment.  The first is an application by G and F for the appointment of deputies on behalf of E under the MCA.  Specifically, the application is for an order that F and G be appointed deputies, jointly and severally, for E&#8217;s personal welfare, and an order that G and a professional, as yet unidentified, be appointed deputy for his property and affairs.  The local authority opposes the application for deputies for personal welfare but is neutral on the application for the appointment of deputies for property and affairs.  The Official Solicitor, who currently represents E in these proceedings, is opposed to any appointment of a deputy.  The second application is by G (supported by F) for an order that she should be appointed in lieu of the Official Solicitor to act as litigation friend on behalf of E for the purposes of all future legal proceedings, in particular these proceedings and any future proceedings for damages against Manchester City Council.  This application is opposed by both the Official Solicitor and the local authority.  </p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These applications have involved further extended legal argument, and the first application, as to deputyship, requires further consideration of the relatively new and often complex provisions of the MCA which introduced wide-ranging reforms into the legal regime governing the care of persons who lack capacity.  It is becoming increasingly clear that this statute is going to have a profound impact on the social care system in this country as we all face up to the challenges of caring for incapacitated adults, not only those who were born with limited capacity but also those who have acquired it through injury and, more commonly, through the normal process of aging.  The provisions of the MCA, including those concerning deputyship, are of great social relevance and, while they received consideration by experts in the field as part of the reform process, they have not, perhaps, received as much attention from the media and the general public as their importance warrants, and as a result there may be a number of misconceptions about the details of the new law. As will become clear, this case, in my view, illustrates one example of such a misconception.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is unnecessary to recite the background history at any length.  It is set out in great detail in my earlier judgment. Nor is it necessary for the purposes of this judgment to recite in any detail the events that have occurred since that judgment, beyond reporting the following matters.  First, as stated above, E has now returned to live with F in May and all the evidence demonstrates that he has thrived in her care.  Secondly, the plans for E to attend college have crystallised.   At the time of the hearing in July, it was anticipated that he would be starting college in September.  This reserved judgment is being written in that month and I hope that the plan has come to fruition.  Thirdly, there has been a change of social worker team, and relations between the local authority and the family (by which I mean, of course, not only E and G but also F and her own children) have significantly improved.  Fourthly, it has been agreed that E, who has been assessed by the local authority as someone whose needs call for the provision of community care services under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19" uk:canonical="1990 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990</ref> should receive a direct payment to secure the provision of those services in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15" uk:canonical="2001 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Health and Social Care Act 2001</ref> as amended and the Community Care, Services for Carers and Children&#8217;s Services (Direct Payments) (England) Regulations 2009 SI 2009/1887.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is important to note that E has continued to have regular contact with his sister G and her family.  Manifestly, G, who has known E all his life, will continue to play a very important role in his future.  In paragraph 164 of my previous judgment, I acknowledged the very considerable contribution made to the proceedings by G and observed that it is unquestionably to E&#8217;s benefit to have a sister who is so interested and involved in his life.  Subsequent events have only served to reinforce this opinion.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G&#8217;s determination to continue to play an active role in E&#8217;s life is a prime motivating factor in her application to be appointed a deputy on his behalf, as I shall explain in due course, when I consider the factual elements behind the application.  But first, I turn to consider the legal provisions concerning deputyship under the new regime established by the MCA.  In doing so, I pay tribute to the industrious and insightful submissions made by all counsel.  </p>

Subsequently, Miss Street, counsel for the Official Solicitor, supplied a copy of a decision of His Honour Judge Turner QC, as yet unreported,  which does contain such an analysis.  His characteristically wise and perceptive comments have been most helpful.</p>

In theory, many of these actions could be against the law.  Legally, people have the right to stop others from interfering with their body or property unless they give permission.  What happens if someone lacks capacity to give permission?  Carers who dress people who cannot dress themselves are potentially interfering with somebody&#8217;s body without their consent, so could theoretically be prosecuted for assault.  A neighbour who enters and cleans the house of a person who lacks capacity could be trespassing on the person&#8217;s property.</p>

However, section 20 imposes certain restrictions on deputies by providing inter alia that some of the powers particularised in sections 17 and 18 may not be given to a deputy.  Thus, a deputy for personal welfare may not be empowered to prohibit a named person from having contact with P or directing a person responsible for P&#8217;s health care to allow a different person to take over that responsibility: see section 20(2).  Those powers are therefore retained by the court.  Similarly, a deputy may not be given powers with respect to the settlement of any of P&#8217;s property, or the execution for P of a will:  see section 20(3).  These powers are also therefore retained by the court.  Section 20(5) also provides that a deputy may not refuse consent to the carrying out or continuation of life-sustaining treatment in relation to P.  Decisions about such matters must therefore be taken by the court. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">If the only income of a person who lacks capacity is social security benefits and they have no property or savings, there will usually be no need for a deputy to be appointed.  This is because the person&#8217;s benefits can be managed by an appointee, appointed by the Department for Work and Pensions to receive and deal with the benefits of a person who lacks capacity to do this for themselves.  Although appointees are not covered by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, they will be expected to act in the person&#8217;s best interests and must do so if they are involved in caring for the person.  If the court does appoint a property and affairs deputy for somebody who has an appointee, it is likely that the deputy would take over the appointee&#8217;s role.&#8221;</p>

It is likely that E will have to undergo a series of operations at some point in the future.  He has a tumour behind his left eye and nodules on his kidneys which may require surgical treatment.  The decision whether or not he should undergo these operations may not be straightforward.  F said that she would like to be able to sign consent for those operations without going through social services.  She also wants to be able to decide whether, and if so when, E should go for respite care, and whether, and if so when, she should take him on holiday.  She acknowledged, however, in cross examination by Miss Irving QC on behalf of the local authority, that, if E is awarded an individual budget so that direct payments are paid to him under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15" uk:canonical="2001 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2001 Act</ref> and 2009 Regulations, she will, as the &#8220;suitable person&#8221; nominated to receive the direct payment, be able to make decisions as to holidays and respite care without reference to the local authority.  So far as education is concerned, it is hoped that E will be able to attend college for three years although at present funding has only been agreed for twelve months.  When he leaves college, it is likely that he will attend a day centre.  F wants to be able to make a decision about that without reference to the social services.  In addition, F recognises that there may come a time when she will no longer be able to care for E.  She wants to be the one, in conjunction with G, to decide what should then happen to him.  F repeated the observation she had made at the earlier hearing that she sees herself as E&#8217;s mum.  She also said in cross-examination by Miss Irving that one of the reasons why she wanted to be a deputy was to stop the local authority removing E from her care again.</p>

Parliament had declined to adopt the Law Commission&#8217;s proposal that there should be a statutory general authority, preferring to replicate the previous approach of creating a defence, previously derived from the principle of necessity, and now found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref>.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">A provisional reading of those principles might be thought to sit rather uncomfortably with the concept of appointing deputies at all.

It is perhaps important to take one step further back even than that, and for the court to remind itself that in a society structured as is ours, it is not the State whether through the agency of an authority or the court, which is primarily responsible for individuals who are subject or  citizens of the State.  It is for those who naturally have their care and well being at heart, that is to say members of the family, where they are willing and able to do so, to take first place in the care and upbringing, not only of children, but of those whose needs, because of disability, extend far into adulthood.

Notwithstanding the fact that the fundamental decisions about E&#8217;s future have now been taken by this court, rather than the local authority, Mr. Allen submits that there is a risk that the local authority may again exceed its powers and contends that this local authority is subject to the mindset identified by Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local Authority v A and B, the Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/978" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 978 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 978 (Fam)</ref> at para. 50-58 under which local authorities assume and act as if they have complete and effective control over persons such as E.  There is, adds Miss Bretherton, a problem of perception, not only with local authorities such as Manchester City Council, but also other agencies, accentuated by the fact that F is not in fact a blood relative of E, but rather, his former foster carer.  </p>

Miss Bretherton indicated in the course of argument that a claim for interim damages was likely to be made shortly.  It is acknowledged that the appointment of such deputies imposes obligations such as the filing of accounts, but Miss Bretherton submits that the proposal that an independent person be appointed in that capacity alongside G will mean that no significant burden is imposed on her.</p>

It is contrary to the principle of informal and collaborative decision making to elevate an individual into a formal position of decision maker.  Thus it is entirely fitting, submits Miss Street, that a decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy and that, when it is considered appropriate for a deputy to be appointed, the scope and duration of the appointment should be limited to what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.  Miss Street submits that, insofar as Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span> was making a statement of general application as to the interpretation of the statutory provisions as to appointment of deputies and in particular <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(4)</ref>, he was wrong in law.   In particular, she takes issue with his comment that: &#8220;since the principle of appointing deputies is fundamental to this part of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, it must be appreciated that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(4)</ref> has to be read in the context of the fact that, ordinarily, the court will appoint deputies where it feels confident that it can&#8230;&#8221;  Miss Street points out that in that case the principle that a deputy should be appointed was not in dispute and that none of the relevant provisions of the Code to which I have been referred (in particular paragraphs  5.1, 5.2, 5.8, 5.9, 8.38 and 8.39) are cited in the judgment.  In contrast, Miss Street invites the court to accept and adopt the analysis of His Honour Judge Turner QC in the recent decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Havering LBC v LD and KD</span> (unreported, 25 June 2010) in which he said inter alia (at para. 42):</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying these legal principles to the facts of this case, Miss Street submits that the circumstances do not justify the appointment of a deputy for personal welfare decisions.  There are no current issues concerning E&#8217;s welfare which would require the decision of the court, let alone the appointment of a deputy.  Matters such as the arrangement of holidays and respite care will be decided by F as the &#8220;suitable person&#8221; nominated to receive E&#8217;s individual budget under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15" uk:canonical="2001 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2001 Act</ref> and 2009 Regulations.  Decisions about E&#8217;s education should, Miss Street submits, be taken collaboratively by F, G and appropriate relevant professionals, rather than F and G as deputies.  Decisions as to medical treatment should, she adds, be taken by relevant medical staff, who are under a duty to consult with family members, including F and G.  In the event of dispute, issues about treatment can be referred to the court.  Miss Street submits that it is inappropriate to appoint deputies to take decisions about a possible series of operations where the necessity for and timing of such operations is as yet unclear.  Miss Street further submits that a decision concerning the arrangements for E&#8217;s care in the event that F is no longer able to care for him would be properly a matter for the court rather than for the appointment of a deputy at this stage, having regard to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(4)</ref>.  So far as the application for the appointment of deputies for property and affairs is concerned, Miss Street submits that such an appointment would be premature.  The need for a deputy to be appointed to manage any damages that may be awarded to E against the local authority should be considered when that need arises, depending on all the circumstances, including the size of the award.  The Official Solicitor, through Miss Street, further submits that the role to be played by a deputy under the statutory scheme of direct payments is limited, and in effect otiose, given that the local authority is required to satisfy itself (a) as to the suitability of the person to whom money is paid (under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref>(1C)(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/15" uk:canonical="2001 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2001 Act</ref>) and (b) whether the person identified will act in the best interests of P and appears to be capable of managing the direct payment (under Regulation 8(5)(b)(i) and (ii) of the 2009 Regulations).  The Official Solicitor submits that the appointment of a deputy in every case where an incapacitated adult is awarded an individual budget would be unnecessary and costly.</p>

The local authority was less supportive of the proposed appointment of F and G as deputies for E&#8217;s personal welfare, given the narrow terms in which the provisions about such appointments in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and Code are drafted.  </p>

That was the position prior to the passing of the MCA under the principle of necessity:  see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re F</span> (supra) and in particular the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley.  In passing the MCA, Parliament ultimately rejected the Law Commission&#8217;s proposal of a statutory general authority and opted for the same approach as under the previous law by creating in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> a statutory defence to protect all persons who carry out acts in connection with the care or treatment of an incapacitated adult, provided they reasonably believe that it will be in that person&#8217;s best interests for the act to be done.  Crucially, however, all persons who provide such care and treatment are expected to look to the Code.  Certain categories of person are required by the statute, under section 42(4), to have regard to the Code (for example, anybody acting in relation to the incapacitated person in a professional capacity).  In addition, however, as the Code itself makes clear, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> applies more generally to everyone who looks after incapacitated persons, including family carers.

It is emphatically not part of the scheme underpinning <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that  there should be one individual who as a matter of course is given a special legal status to make decisions about incapacitated persons.  Experience has shown that working together is the best policy to ensure that incapacitated adults such as E receive the highest quality of care.  This case is an example of what can go wrong when people do not work together.  Where there is disagreement about the appropriate care and treatment, (which cannot be resolved by the methods suggested in Chapter 15) or the issue is a matter of particular gravity or difficulty, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and Code provide that the issue should usually be determined by the court.

Manifestly, it will usually be the case that decisions about complex and serious issues are taken by a court rather than any individual.  In certain cases, as explained in paragraphs 8.38 and 8.39 of the Code, it will be more appropriate to appoint a deputy or deputies to make these decisions.  But because it is important that such decisions should wherever possible be taken collaboratively and informally, the appointments must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.</p>

As the examples in paragraphs 8.38 and 8.39 demonstrate, it is sometimes impracticable to insist on decisions being taken by the court.  The instances which stand out are those which involve a series of decisions (for example, about medical procedures) and where the assets of an incapacitated adult are of a magnitude that requires regular management.  Common sense suggests that the second of these examples is likely to arise more frequently than the first, and that the appointment of deputies is likely to be more common for property and affairs than for personal welfare.

Since it would be manifestly impracticable in those circumstances for the Court of Protection to make those decisions, the appointment of deputies was unavoidable and indeed desirable.  As I read Hedley J&#8217;s judgment, this was agreed by all parties and the issue to be determined by the court was the identity of the deputies.  The greater part of that judgment is devoted to the terms on which the deputies were to be appointed and, in particular, whether an independent deputy should be appointed in addition to members of the family.

That does not, however, justify the appointment of family members as deputies simply because they are able and willing to serve in that capacity.

Decisions about his education should be taken collaboratively by F, G, his teacher, and other relevant professionals.

If there is any disagreement about any of these matters, an application can be made to the Court of Protection.  Decisions about who should look after E in the event that F is no longer able to do so should equally be considered (when the need arises) in a collaborative way and only referred to the court for endorsement if required or if there is any disagreement.

I recognise that an appointment of a deputy for property and affairs would become appropriate were E to acquire assets of a size that required the sort of management decisions described in section 18.  That might occur, for example, were he to be awarded a significant sum of damages as a result of his forthcoming claim against the local authority.  I acknowledge that it might be necessary to make such an appointment at short notice, for example, as Miss Bretherton suggests, if a significant interim award of damages is made.  In those circumstances, the application can be renewed before me, preferably with the independent deputy, who it is proposed would work alongside G, identified as ready and willing to act in that capacity.

Miss Bretherton submits that it is unnecessary for the court to consider whether the complaints and potential claim have any merits, but it seems to me that this is unavoidable.  I must consider, at least on a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> basis, whether there is any merit in the complaints in order to decide whether there is any strength in the argument that the Official Solicitor has an interest adverse to E.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, these complaints are without foundation.  On the matters raised in subparagraphs (1) to (3) above, I consider that the Official Solicitor has acted with commendable professionalism and diligence in representing E on the main issue at the first hearing before me - whether he should return to F&#8217;s care.  The suggestion that any claim against the Official Solicitor might arise from the circumstances leading to Ryder J&#8217;s order is, in my view, untenable, bearing in mind the terms of that order and the circumstances in which the hearing took place.  The Official Solicitor subsequently carried out a very thorough analysis of whether a return home was in E&#8217;s best interests and indeed argued in favour of a return home at the first substantive hearing, before me in January &#8211; March 2010.  So far as the complaint in sub-paragraph (4) is concerned, Miss Street made the obvious point that it was the court that ordered at the end of that hearing that E should continue to reside at Z Road for the time being.  Miss Street concedes that it was G&#8217;s legal representatives who identified the argument that E&#8217;s &#8220;tenancy&#8221; at Z Road was unlawful, but points out that the Official Solicitor included that concern in the schedule of reasons why E should not remain at Z Road in the interim but rather should be returned immediately to F&#8217;s home.  Miss Street submits that it is not the fault of the Official Solicitor that the court ultimately took a different view at that hearing.  I accept that submission.  As to the point made in sub-paragraph (5) in Miss Bretherton&#8217;s list of complaints, Miss Street points to evidence that the Official Solicitor responded to concerns raised by G about contact.  I am satisfied that the Official Solicitor did indeed take the steps identified by Miss Street, but even if he had not done so that would not have given rise to any potential legal claim against him by E.  So far as points made in subparagraphs (6) and (7) above are concerned, I agree with Miss Street&#8217;s submission that it was not the Official Solicitor&#8217;s function as litigation friend to scrutinise X Ltd&#8217;s conduct in respect of E&#8217;s money or possessions, and there is nothing about the Official Solicitor&#8217;s conduct in relation to these matters that could possibly give rise to any complaint or claim.  So far as the point made in sub-paragraph (8) is concerned, Miss Street reminds me that the criticism of X Ltd&#8217;s care of E was a matter that the Official Solicitor put in the balance <span style="font-style:italic">in favour</span> of an immediate return home to F.  She adds, however, that the court found that the quality of care provided by X Ltd was generally positive (see my earlier judgment at paragraph 150).  I do not see how any claim against the Official Solicitor could arise as a result of that matter.  Equally, I fail to see how any failure by the Official Solicitor to press for a serious case review could possibly give rise to any complaint or action against him, given the purpose and scope of such reviews.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_72">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore my first conclusion on the litigation friend issue in this case is to reject the complaints made by those representing G about the Official Solicitor&#8217;s conduct of the case.  I regard them as without foundation. I accept all of Miss Street&#8217;s points in reply to the various criticisms made by Miss Bretherton.  I take the view that the Official Solicitor has played an invaluable role in these proceedings, bringing his great expertise to bear in representing E and assisting the court in the exceedingly difficult issues that have arisen.  One example of this was the exemplary risk analysis provided by Miss Street at the conclusion of the first hearing.  The fact that, ultimately, I reached a different conclusion from that advanced by the Official Solicitor (and made an order that E should not return home at that stage) was emphatically not something for which the Official Solicitor could in any sense be blamed.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_73">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, I accept the submission made by Miss Street that there is cause to question whether G has the necessary objectivity to act as litigation friend on behalf of her brother.  It is not uncommon for family members to have strong feelings about the misfortunes that befall their relatives.  Indeed, it is entirely understandable.  But there is a danger, in some cases, that such feelings may cloud judgment.  That G has strong feelings is manifestly clear from much of what has been said by her and on her behalf in these proceedings.  There is, I fear, a risk that her feelings may prevent her bringing to bear the objectivity required of a litigation friend.  I repeat, for the umpteenth time, I have very great respect for G&#8217;s care, devotion and commitment to her brother, but the fact remains that G has been drawn into the dispute with Manchester City Council and has to a considerable extent made common cause with F who was in very serious dispute with the local authority.  I sympathise with G&#8217;s strong feelings about the way E has been treated, but I share the Official Solicitor&#8217;s concerns that those feelings would be a disadvantage to someone acting as E&#8217;s litigation friend.  In addition, I regard the unwarranted criticisms which have been levelled at the Official Solicitor as further evidence of a potential lack of objectivity.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, even if I was satisfied that G was capable of bringing the requisite degree of objectivity required for the fair and competent conduct of proceedings on behalf of E, I reject Miss Bretherton&#8217;s argument that that fact would be determinative of the issue.  The Official Solicitor is emphatically not a litigation friend of last resort.  I remind myself again of the terms of rule 143: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><marker name="tab"/>The use of the word &#8220;may&#8221; in rule 143 (and rule 140) demonstrates that the <marker name="tab"/>court has a <marker name="tab"/>complete discretion on the matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">Miss Bretherton&#8217;s argument that the Official Solicitor will be acting ultra vires where there was a family member qualified to act as litigation friend within the meaning of rule 140(1) is, to my mind, simply wrong.  As pointed out in the note to rule 140 in 2010 Court of Protection Practice, at page 717, the Official Solicitor will usually be appointed to act in respect of persons who lack capacity in the Court of Protection.  There are very good policy reasons for this practice.  The Official Solicitor will invariably have the objectivity required to act as litigation friend which, for understandable reasons, family members sometimes lack.  Furthermore, the Official Solicitor has unrivalled expertise in this field and it will manifestly be in the best interests of incapacitated adults for this expertise to be employed on their behalf, particularly in complex cases such as this.  </p>

I am equally satisfied that it is in E&#8217;s best interests to have regular contact with his beloved and devoted sister G, but since that is an issue which can be arranged informally and collaboratively, as anticipated by the MCA and the Code of Practice, it is unnecessary for any order to be made about it.</p>
