It should be read together with my judgment entitled Akhmedova v Akhmedov and Others (Freezing Orders: Without Notice Hearing) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/2561" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 2561 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 2561 (Fam)</ref> which explains the background to Mrs Akhmedova&#8217;s without notice application for injunctive relief and the court&#8217;s reasoning for granting the relief sought. References will be made to this judgment herein and any other judgment will be identified as appropriate.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In summary, there has been long-running litigation consequent upon the breakdown of the marriage of the Wife and the Husband. In December 2016 Haddon-Cave J (as he then was) ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of &#163;453,576,152 in settlement of her financial claims in respect of the marriage. As I said in my earlier judgment, regrettably the Husband has not voluntarily paid a penny of that award and to date enforcement has only been possible in respect of a very small proportion of that sum (around &#163;5 million or so). In a judgment dated April 2018, Haddon-Cave J described the Husband as engaging in an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">elaborate and contumacious campaign to evade and frustrate the enforcement of the judgment debt against him</span>&#8221;. I will not further rehearse the history of the proceedings relevant to this application since it can be found in my earlier judgment. </p>

The Husband did not receive the WhatsApp message probably because he had blocked the sender&#8217;s telephone number and delivery at his office address in Moscow was refused. However, on 22 August 2019 the documents were successfully delivered to his personal email address without any &#8220;bounceback&#8221; and they were also delivered to his son&#8217;s address in this jurisdiction on both 23 and 27 August 2019. </p>

It was delayed because of (a) the need to translate the lengthy documents into German which took about a fortnight; (b) the unexpected requirement for those documents to be verified by another translator who had to appear before a notary in England to swear an affidavit verifying the translations; (c) the transmission of the documents to Liechtenstein, and (d) the time taken for the court in Liechtenstein to grant an order for service and then to effect service.  </p>

No prejudice has been caused to either Counselor or Sobaldo since both were in receipt of the freezing order identifying the hearing return date for over five weeks. Neither entity has asked the Wife&#8217;s representatives to provide any further documents or information and I observe that each has received the minimum seven days&#8217; notice of the hearing required by the Family Procedure Rules r. 18.8(1) [&#8220;FPR&#8221;]. Counselor and Sobaldo&#8217;s failure to give disclosure within seven days of service as required by the freezing order suggests that they have decided to disregard my order. Finally, each received a copy of my earlier judgment by email on 27 September 2019. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The Liechtenstein Financial Intelligence Unit [&#8220;FIU&#8221;] has issued reports on 26 February, 28 February and 2 March 2018 (documents numbers 108-110 on the criminal files). Though the Wife has not seen those documents, the judgment reveals the FIU reports state that (i) Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 were regarded as beneficially owned by the Husband; (ii) the settlor of the Genus Trust, the Longlaster Trust and the Carnation Trust was the Husband; (iii) in autumn 2016 assets were transferred from Switzerland to LGT Bank. Funds were accumulated on the account of Genus Trust and transferred to its account with Bendura Bank. This is consistent with the oral evidence given by Mr Kerman in December 2016 that Cotor had transferred monetary assets from its UBS account in Switzerland to LGT in Liechtenstein; (iv) Longlaster Trust maintains an account with Bendura Bank AG since June 2017 with a credit balance of around US$546 million (though it is not entirely clear if this is a current or historic balance). The Longlaster Trust has the same beneficiaries as the Genus Trust; (v) the Carnation Trust attempted to transfer US$120 million to the Husband&#8217;s account in Moscow but this was blocked by FIU. There were also transfers of US$17 million to the Husband&#8217;s Swiss account and US$59 million to his Russian account. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I accept Mr Willan&#8217;s submission that this information supports the inferences which the Wife invited me to draw at the without notice hearing particularly that (a) the Genus Trust was initially set up to receive the Monetary Assets and (b) those assets were then transferred through other trusts associated with the Husband with substantial amounts being paid back to him. Moreover, this information suggests that there are probably still valuable assets in Liechtenstein given that the FIU blocked the transfer of US$120 million by the Carnation Trust.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, the Wife does not have access to the whole criminal file. Each application to inspect documents on the file needs to identify the documents to be inspected and, as documents are added, further applications become necessary. Each of these applications can be challenged all the way up to the Constitutional Court. Mr Willan told me that the Wife has made applications to access documents 62-282 and documents 283-363. The first application has been granted, in part, by the first instance and the appeal courts but is suspended pending a complaint to the Constitutional Court which may not be determined for another year. The second application has been granted by the first instance report and is presently before the appeal court. Mr Willan submitted that it appears that WalPart and its associated entities intend to exercise every appeal right to delay the Wife&#8217;s access to this material.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I remind myself that the Wife learned of two of the Liechtenstein trusts from disclosure in New York under 28 US Code 1782. On 16 September 2019, the Husband&#8217;s lawyers applied to the Southern District of New York to discharge the orders and to prohibit the Wife from using any of the documents or information acquired in any pending or future proceedings. Mr Willan suggested that the Husband learned of the 1782 relief as a result of seeing the documents related to this application. The Wife&#8217;s lawyers filed a response the following day and a ruling is awaited. </p>

In summary, it recognised the capital element of Haddon-Cave J&#8217;s order and dismissed various complaints made by the Respondents against that order. </p>

This is stayed for thirty days pending an appeal. This is stayed for thirty days.  If there is an appeal by Straight, the judgment will be stayed for longer, but Mr Willan told me that, in those circumstances, Straight is likely to be required to provide security pending the resolution of the appeal in the amount of the summary judgment.   </p>
