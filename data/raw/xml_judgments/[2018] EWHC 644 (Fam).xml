	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2017, following a short hearing on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2017 this court made supervision orders in respect of two children a boy Y ([a date in]  2009) then aged 9 years and 2 months and a girl Z (born on [a date in] 2015 and 23 months old at that time), on the basis threshold criteria pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The agreed facts are set out below. On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2017, the parties who had previously been in dispute as to the facts at issue, the conduct and extent of any fact finding hearing were adamant that they did not consider a trial was necessary as there remained a limited number of factual issues in dispute. The remaining issues to be decided, were, they agreed, better dealt with by way of submissions only. The court considered that, given the concessions made by the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> respondent (FG), the continued non-attendance of, and absence of any instructions from the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> respondent (FR) and the agreed placement of the children at home with their mother under a Supervision Order (SO), the need for a full trial of the remaining issues was not necessary or proportionate.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those issues which remained were; what contact, if any, the 2nd respondent is to have with Y and Z; and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> threshold in respect of FR the 3rd respondent. The parties also sought the courts conclusions as the future risk in respect of the subject children or other children who might be in contact with or be cared for by FG on the basis of threshold document that had been agreed. As the court did not hear any evidence I cannot make any findings; the conclusions about the risk posed by FG will be based solely on the evidence that formed the basis of the parties agreed document and the findings of guilt reached by the jury in the criminal trial. Nonetheless as there was no dispute about the outcome, which was to be the children&#8217;s reunification with their mother to have a full hearing on the evidence as a whole would not have been proportionate or in keeping with the overriding objective as set out in rule1 of the FPR 2010, and the provisions of rule 1.4.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When these proceedings were commenced in March 2016, it was as a result of the local authority issuing an application pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> of the Children Act (CA) 1989 because of the concerns regarding the safety and welfare of Y and Z arising from criminal charges brought against FG. The charges were serious; sex offences committed against his step-daughter (X, she is not a party to these proceedings) and offences of child cruelty in relation to his own daughter (W, she is also not a party to these proceedings) FG and M were living together with Y (who is the child of M and FR) and Z (who is the child of M and FG).  As a result of the charges, and to ensure that the children could remain living with their mother, at the first hearing in the Family Court at Barnet, M and FG, agreed to live separately and for all contact with the children to be supervised by the local authority.  A written agreement to that effect was signed at court. Y&#8217;s father FR has played very little part in the proceedings (although he has been represented since the case came before me in November 2016) and, despite having been given the opportunity to do so during these proceedings, has chosen to continue to absent himself from his son&#8217;s life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FG was due to stand trial for the criminal matters in October 2016, but defence counsel became ill and the criminal trial had to be abandoned. It was re-fixed for June 2017.  It has fallen to the Family Court on several occasions during the proceedings to consider whether the care proceedings should be heard in advance of the criminal trial, being aware of the delay it would cause.  Each time the court concluded that the criminal trial should be heard first notwithstanding the delay because it would not be in the best interests of the children to have the criminal proceedings compromised and to avoid the need for the alleged victims in the criminal proceedings from having to give evidence twice.  Unlike many, if not most, of the cases where the family court has to consider the implications of criminal proceedings, the complainants in the criminal proceedings are not parties to or the subject of these public law proceedings. The local authority wished to avoid the need for the complainants to give evidence twice, particularly as any findings would be tangential, although relevant, to the findings sought in respect of the parties in these proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the parties have agreed to the supervision order and do not dispute the factual matrix on which the threshold was met it is not necessary for the court to set out the history of the family or the relationship of FG and M in full. From the facts that have been agreed it is apparent that FG met M while still under investigation for the sexual and physical abuse of his step-daughter and daughter. His bail conditions required that he did not have contact with anyone under the age of eighteen. The police were not made aware that FG had moved in with a woman and her child (M and Y), still less that he had re-married; nor were any of the relevant child protection authorities. They had met in December 2014 and married in April 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The police and children&#8217;s service first became aware that he was living with M, and married her, on 25th August 2015, when they were called out following an incident when FG had damaged M&#8217;s phone and iPad (this is expressly referred to in the agreed threshold document set out below). He was reported to have become angry when she had a missed call from a former partner. The criminal charges and bail conditions were discussed with the local authority&#8217;s out-of-hours team. FG told the police that X and her mother had concocted the allegations and M would not support any prosecution or arrest. She said she had no concerns for her own safety or that of her son, and the police left. By this time, of course, she was pregnant with Z.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Social workers called on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 but FG, who was recorded as being aggressive and  of being obstructive refused to show the social workers a copy of his bail conditions. He tried to argue that he was permitted to be with children if supervised by an adult, but he has now admitted that he was in breach of bail. He was reported as having said that the police were using social services to harass him. The behaviour of FG, as recorded by social services, is in keeping with the aggressive, controlling behaviour which formed part of the evidence which led to his conviction for child cruelty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A strategy meeting was held on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 at which the officer in charge of the investigation for Greater Manchester Police provided a summary of the allegations, as a result a decision was taken to undertake a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s47</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> inquiry. On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2015 M was seen at home but she made no complaint and voiced no concerns. She and Y were visited by social workers again on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2015, she would not allow Y to be seen on his own. That same day the police were told, anonymously, that arguing and banging could be heard from the family home; there were sounds of adults shouting and screaming and a young child had been heard crying and very distraught. The police called by, the adults appeared in a good mood and the child was said to be asleep. The male, presumably FG, refused to give his name and was reported as saying that the call was malicious and they were in a new relationship.  Later, during a child protection meeting, FG was recorded as saying that it was Y&#8217;s social worker who had made the call to the police.</p>

Y was seen at school but made no complaints. FG was interviewed by the social worker but refused to speak about his relationship, acknowledge the incident when the police were called on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October and denied all the allegations against him. The baby (Z) was born on [a date in] 2015. M, to her credit, informed social services when she was discharged as hospital staff had not followed the child protection plan in place which was that a discharge meeting should have taken place. The baby and her mother were visited at home and written agreement signed that M was to supervise FG at all times with both children. FG was charged that month with the offences for which he was subsequently convicted. He was remanded on bail at Manchester Magistrates Court on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FG failed to attend a Child Protection Conference on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016. Meetings were held by social services regarding the children in February 2016. M was reported as saying FG was innocent and FG refused to accept that there was any reason why he should live separately or why he should have supervised contact. As he has not appealed his conviction for child cruelty, it is clear that he must have been fully aware why he could not be left alone with any child and why M and the two children should live separately from him. </p>

Those concerns were well founded, both in respect of his family containing W and X and in respect of M. He deliberately concealed his marriage to her during the police investigation. It is the view of this court that FG should be considered a dangerous man who has a history of trying to, and succeeding in, the coercion and control of his immediate family and in manipulating professionals by lying and concealing information. In turn the local authority found M&#8217;s responses and lack of insight to the concerns about FG to be &#8220;extremely worrying&#8221; despite the fact that, at the very least, she was well aware that he had a sexual relationship with his step-daughter. The social worker presciently observed in his first statement that he believed that M would allow FG to have unsupervised contact to the children, even if they were to separate.</p>

Again, despite M&#8217;s assertions and assurances to the contrary, Y was never enrolled in school and did not attend school at all during the months he was in Kenya.  The children were eventually brought back to the UK on 27th June 2017 in the care of, and accompanied by, Ms Mwangi. They were placed in foster care and remained there for the remainder of the proceedings. The children have had regular and frequent contact with their mother; over the summer holidays this was increased to a frequency of three times a week, with two of these visits lasting for three hours and one lasting for two hours. They had telephone contact with their mother each day that they did not see her. All the contact was considered to be a very positive experience for the children, who were often observed to be distressed when the sessions come to an end. Nonetheless Y was clearly caused distress by being stranded in Kenya by his mother and has continued to express his anger at her for doing so.  </p>

He pleaded not guilty and was convicted by a jury following a trial in which the complainants, W and X, gave evidence. On 7th July 2017, FG was convicted on all 14 counts on the indictment which consisted of five offences of indecent assault against a child; four offences of indecency with a child; three offences of rape; all concerning X and two offences of child cruelty concerning his daughter, W.  He was sentenced to a total of 22 years imprisonment, by the trial judge His Honour Judge Rudland. The sentence comprised 6 years imprisonment for each of the offences of indecent assault and indecency with a child and 18 years imprisonment for the rape offences which run concurrently and to 4 years imprisonment, consecutive, for the child cruelty offences. </p>

FG became involved with X&#8217;s mother when X was 12 years old. The judge said that X&#8217;s mother was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a needy individual in my view who [FG] met, dazzled and rapidly made pregnant.

The parties prepared a document setting out agreed facts which they put before the court as meeting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> threshold and providing for a supervision order to be made without the need for the court to hear any evidence. The facts which were agreed between the parties are reproduced in anonymised form immediately below: as in this judgment FG refers to the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> respondent and father of Z, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent is M the children&#8217;s mother. W is FG&#8217;s daughter and victim of child cruelty at his hands and X is his step-daughter who he sexually abused as a child and later had a sexual relationship with her, fathering two children. FR is the father of Y.  The evidence relied on is referred to by its location in the trial bundle.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has not heard evidence and the decisions made are based on the matter set out above and the agreement reached by the parties. The threshold is met and comprehensively traversed. On the basis of the convictions for child cruelty and the controlling and aggressive behaviour that FG had already started to exhibit with M, Y and Z, which seemed to follow the path of vicious, violent and abusive behaviour and the treatment he had meted out on his previous families, there is, and cannot be, any doubt that he posed and will continue to pose a serious risk of significant and serious harm to any child of his or any child present in a household of which he forms a part. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the uncontested evidence which formed the basis of the agreement FG is also a danger to any partner or wife, including M. It would not be safe for M to go to the prison where he is incarcerated to allow contact to take place with Z. Given his track record for coercion and control and the total absence of any comprehensive and meaningful intervention with FG, there is no evidence other than that which would indicate that he would, once again, seek to gain control. The local authority did not propose FG should have contact with Z, she is an infant and would have to be taken to the prison by her mother; it is not safe for either of them. In the absence of additional professional support M cannot be compelled, against the interest of her own safety, to take her infant daughter to the prison where FG is incarcerated to see him. There is no discernible need in terms of Z&#8217;s welfare which would justify her being taken alone and by a stranger, albeit a child care professional, allowing for there being such a person available, to spend time in the prison environment with another stranger.  Unless and until he is released from prison and has successfully undertaken a lengthy period of work and therapeutic treatment, the results of which have been thoroughly assessed, it would not be safe or in the interests of Z&#8217;s welfare for any contact to take place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y is not FG&#8217;s child. There is no expectation that he should have contact with FG. FG only lived within the same household for a short period of time, of no more than fifteen to sixteen months at most. If, it is an if as no assessment has been carried out, FG was a part of Y&#8217;s family life at that time, that is over long since as far as Y is concerned. More time has now passed than all the time Y spent with FG and during which Y has endured a separation from his mother, being stranded in Kenya and absence from school and from all that was familiar. There is no conceivable benefit for this child to be reintroduced to a man, who was abusive and controlling when he was, briefly, in Y&#8217;s life. The fact that FG is insistent that he should have contact with Y raises more concerns about FG&#8217;s need to continue to control and dictate terms to any family in which he has played a part. There is to be no contact.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_41">
	  <num>41.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FR effectively abandoned Y and has abdicated all responsibility for his child. His counsel, absent of any instructions from FR, sought to argue that the threshold was not met in respect of FR. On the contrary, the fact FR has failed to provide his son any care at all and certainly not care that it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31 (2)</ref> (b) (i) must have contributed to the harm Y suffered. That the absence of care contributed to the harm suffered by Y, is self-evident. FR has never sought to take any steps to inform himself of his son&#8217;s welfare and well-being far less take steps to intervene when it was necessary. His ignorance of Y&#8217;s situation does not absolve him of responsibility. Moreover, FR was aware of the proceedings and did attend court on occasion but did not then do anything to assist Y or provide him with any care; had he as a parent should have done and provided the care it was reasonable to expect some of the harm that was caused to Y may have been avoided. </p>
