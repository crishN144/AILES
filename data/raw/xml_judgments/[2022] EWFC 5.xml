The reason commonly assigned is that this is the precise question the court has to decide, but, in truth, it is because his opinion is not relevant. Any fact that he can prove is relevant, but his opinion is not. The well recognized exception in the case of scientific or expert witnesses depends on considerations which, for present purposes, are immaterial.

In this case, certainly as to Syrym, he could have been called to give evidence. He was available during the hearing but was not called.

Further, H&#8217;s submission that &#8220;findings of fact by earlier tribunals are inadmissible in subsequent civil proceedings because they constitute opinion evidence&#8221; means that it would never be open to the court to be referred to the prior judgment upon a subsequent enforcement application of whatever nature. Moreover, following the logic through, a substantive judgment including findings as to, for example, periodical payments, could not be before the court upon a variation application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (as amended).

PC Fuller was similarly clear that, particularly as they had not previously served a passport order, they took extra care to read all the paperwork, speak to Mr Cheesley MBE and follow his instructions. In accordance with the order, H handed over certain travel documents. A confirmation of service document was drawn up. PC Fuller said he was &#8220;extremely confident&#8221; that the passport order was served upon H. In his written evidence, H contends that he received not the passport order but a separate document being a Direction to the Tipstaff which it is intended should be retained by the servers of the document. It may be that he was given, inadvertently, that document, but I accept to the requisite high standard that he also received the passport order itself. H did not attend court to be cross examined about this issue. I am entitled to, and do, draw adverse inferences from his silence. In my judgment, he did not give evidence because he well knows that he did indeed receive the passport order. I am quite sure that service of the passport order, followed by service of the first committal application the next morning, led him to leave the UK forthwith. I accept the evidence of PC Fuller and the Tipstaff unreservedly. The first passport order was, I find, properly served. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am satisfied to the criminal standard that H breached paragraph 42 of the said order. It is an in personam order. He has not taken all necessary steps to remove the third party mortgages as ordered, and has taken, I am satisfied, no proper steps even to attempt to do so (which might include writing to the Land Register himself or issuing proceedings against the second and third respondents in Portugal). W has produced evidence that the third party mortgages in respect of the Portuguese property remain on the Portuguese land register. I cannot, it seems to me, ignore the fact that the third party mortgages were, as found by HHJ Gibbons, orchestrated by H for fraudulent purposes. That is a finding which was not made to the criminal standard but in my judgment, I am entitled to take it into account as background material, whilst bearing in mind that for the contempt application I must be satisfied to the criminal standard. Insofar as H in his written evidence says that he has approached the third parties in writing to remove the mortgages from the register, he has provided no evidence beyond his mere say so, and has not taken the witness stand to be cross examined on this assertion. I am entirely satisfied that H has, and at all material times has had, the power and ability to procure the release, whether himself or by instructing others who will do as he bids. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am satisfied to the criminal standard that H has breached paragraph 48 of the order. He has not executed the written instrument as ordered, which requires no more than a signature. The written instrument contains provisions altering the terms of the trust and giving specific directions in ways which are permitted to H under his powers as settlor. The written instrument, if executed by H, would enable the Portuguese property to be sold and the proceeds applied to satisfy the outstanding debt in W&#8217;s favour. I am wholly satisfied that H has the power to sign the document, and has deliberately chosen not to. It is said on his behalf that, according to the Cypriot trustee, the English court has no jurisdiction over the trust. In my view, even if correct, that is irrelevant. The order is against H in personam, mandating him to exercise powers which are reserved to him under the trust deed. Further, it is in his gift to alter the proper law to England such that giving effect to the alterations contained in the written instrument would be lawful. Thus, not only does he have the power to execute the document in accordance with the order, but he also has the power to render the whole process lawful by changing the proper law, should that be necessary. </p>

Since he has not yet complied with paragraph 48, it is an impossibility for him to comply with paragraph 50. W perfectly reasonably says that one flows from the other, but it does not seem to me to be appropriate to commit for a breach of an order which is not yet capable of fulfilment. Rather than dismiss the allegation, I will give W permission to withdraw it so that it can be remade at a later date if necessary.</p>

Indeed, there is nothing under the terms of the trust precluding him from appointing himself as trustee. I am quite sure that as the controller of the trust, it has at all times been within his power to comply; he has simply chosen not to. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">&#8220;25. In making those points I would wish to emphasise that I do so only in the context of family cases. Family cases, it has long been recognised, raise different considerations from those elsewhere in the civil law. The two most obvious are the heightened emotional tensions that arise between family members and often the need for those family members to continue to be in contact with one another because they have children together or the like. Those two factors make the task of the court, in dealing with these issues, quite different from the task when dealing with commercial disputes or other types of case in which sometimes, in fact rarely, sanctions have to be imposed for contempt of court.</span></p>

Having said that, firstly, these cases have to come before the court on an application to commit. That is the only procedure which is available. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court is directing its mind to whether or not committal to prison is the appropriate order. But it does not follow from that that imprisonment is to be regarded as the automatic consequence of the breach of an order. Clearly it is not. There is, however, no principle that imprisonment is not to be imposed at the first occasion: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">Thorpe v Thorpe</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 127" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 127</ref>, a decision of this court. Nevertheless, it is a common practice, and usually appropriate in view of the sensitivity of the circumstances of these cases, to take some other course on the first occasion.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in"><br/><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">27. Secondly, there is the difficulty, as Mr Brett has pointed out, that the alternatives are limited. The full range of sentencing options is not available for contempt of court. Nevertheless, there is a range of things that the court can consider. It may do nothing, make no order. It may adjourn, and in a case where the alleged contemnor has not attended court, that may be an appropriate course to take, although I would not say so in every case. It depends on the reasons that may be thought to lie behind the non-attendance. There is a power to fine. There is a power of requisition of assets and there are mental health orders. All of those may, in an appropriate case, need consideration, particularly in a case where the court has not found any actual violence proved.</span></p>

Thirdly, if imprisonment is appropriate, the length of the committal should be decided without reference to whether or not it is to be suspended. A longer period of committal is not justified because its sting is removed by virtue of its suspension.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">29. Fourthly, the length of the committal has to depend upon the court's objectives. There are two objectives always in contempt of court proceedings. One is to mark the court's disapproval of the disobedience to its order. The other is to secure compliance with that order in the future. Thus, the seriousness of what has taken place is to be viewed in that light as well as for its own intrinsic gravity.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in"><br/><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">33. Eighthly, of course, the court has to bear in mind the context. This may be aggravating or mitigating. The context is often the break-up of an intimate relationship in which emotions run high and people behave in silly ways. The context of having children together, if that be the case, cannot be ignored. Sometimes that means that there is an aggravation of what has taken place, because of the greater fear that is engendered from the circumstances. Sometimes it may be mitigating, because there is reason to suppose that once the immediate emotions have calmed down, the molestation and threats will not continue.</span></p>

Ninthly, in many cases, the court will have to bear in mind that there are concurrent proceedings in another court based on either the same facts or some of the same facts, which are before the court on the contempt proceedings. The court cannot ignore those parallel proceedings. It may have to take into account their outcome in considering what the practical effect is upon the contempt proceedings. They do have different purposes and often the overlap is not exact, but nevertheless the court will not want, in effect, the contender to suffer punishment twice for the same events.</span></p>

Tenthly, it will usually be desirable for the court to explain very briefly why it has made the choices that it has made in the particular case before it. One understands all the constraints in a busy county court, dealing with large numbers of these cases these days, and one would not wish to impose too great a burden on the judiciary in this respect. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate in most cases for the contemnor to know why he or she was being sentenced to a period of imprisonment; why it was the length that it was; if it was suspended, why the suspension was as it was, but only very briefly.&#8221;</span></p>

So, too, has been his behaviour in obstructing the court at almost every possible opportunity, deploying numerous tactical and forensic ploys to attempt to delay the process, and divert attention from his grossly culpable conduct. He expresses no remorse; on the contrary, his written statements continue to present himself as the aggrieved party in this. He has disputed evidence which I have found to be true. He has refused to attend court, including at this hearing, when ordered to do so, and ignored other court orders, for example to supply medical evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I have also found that the second and third respondents have breached paragraph 42 of the order of HHJ Gibbons dated 23 April 2021. They were not present nor represented, and no mitigation was advanced on their behalf. The fact that they have simply ignored the court proceedings throughout is indicative of the disdain in which they hold the courts of this jurisdiction, and I strongly suspect, their complicity with H. I consider that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted but that, in their case, a suspension of the term of imprisonment is appropriate to permit them an opportunity to remedy their breaches.</p>
