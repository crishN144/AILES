In the event that I do so find, the LA seeks authorisation of the deprivation as being necessary and proportionate.</span></p>

After a period of assessment in another residential unit, he was first accommodated at the unit in December 2016, aged 11.  He has remained living there at all times since then.  Initially, his accommodation at the unit was underpinned by his parents&#8217; consent and the corresponding duty of the LA pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8220;the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>&#8221;).  However, in early 2017, both HC and his brother, B, were the subject of care proceedings brought by the LA under Part 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>.

The proceedings concluded on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 2017, when Mr Justice Hedley made a final care order in relation to HC, at the same time finding that HC&#8217;s accommodation at the unit constituted a deprivation of his liberty for the purposes of Article 5 ECHR.  I have not been supplied with a transcript of the judgment of Hedley J, despite my having asked for this at a directions hearing a few weeks ago, and so I know no more of the learned judge&#8217;s reasoning than that it is recorded in the recitals to the order of 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 2017 that:</span></p>

He takes a range of medication to manage his mood and his behaviour and to support his sleeping and bladder problems.  He has exhibited a range of behavioural difficulties over a number of years.  He is described by staff who know him as being very active, capable of being charming, and generally well-mannered, polite and smiley.  On various occasions, however, when his behaviour has been challenging and disruptive, he has damaged property and has placed himself and others at risk.  Over recent months there has been a reported improvement in episodes of acute mental health difficulties, self-harming, attention-seeking behaviour and damage to property.  HC responds well to clear and consistent routines and boundaries and, while he struggles to cope if these routines change unexpectedly, this has been less of a problem over the last few months.</span></p>

A number of those young persons are older than HC.  All will be subjected to at least some of the safeguards and restrictions which define HC&#8217;s life, although, rightly, I know nothing more of the detail of the lives, characteristics or particular arrangements for any of the other residents.</span></p>

So, the typical child of 15 is, in the sense in which the expression is used in the case-law, not free to leave the place where they live. If the 15-year-old child runs away, wanting to live on their own, they will probably not get social housing and, if not taken into care, are likely to be returned home to live either with the parents or with other relatives. </span></p>

Thus a teenager of the same age and familial background as MIG and MEG is the relevant comparator for them. If one compares their state with a person of similar age and full capacity it is clear that their liberty is in fact circumscribed.

As a matter of objective fact, however, constraints beyond those which apply to young people of full ability are &#8211; and have to be &#8211; applied to them. There is therefore a restriction of liberty in their cases.

A comparator for a young child is not a fully matured adult, or even a partly mature adolescent. While they were very young, therefore, MIG and MEG&#8217;s liberty was not restricted. It is because they can &#8211; and must &#8211; now be compared to children of their own age and relative maturity who are free from disability and who have access (whether they have recourse to that or not) to a range of freedoms which MIG and MEG cannot have resort to that MIG and MEG are deprived of liberty.&#8217; </span></p>

DD, the children&#8217;s guardian for C, D1, D2 and E, points to the difficulty involved in the exercise, having regard to the &#8216;markedly differing principles, values, and belief held in society in respect of children of this age [11]&#8217; and that a &#8216;typical&#8217; child may experience different levels of restriction on their freedom depending on whether they live in an urban or rural setting. </span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Linked to the question of freedom of movement is the question of supervision.  A typical 13-year-old will certainly be supervised or controlled in certain formal or dangerous settings.  For example, at school, much of the time is supervised to a greater (e.g. in the classroom) or lesser (e.g. during break-time) extent, and a risky sport or activity will generally be conducted under close adult supervision.</span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">However, a typical 13-year old will also enjoy significant periods of time without any active supervision whatever.  In particular, it is intrinsic to the lives of teenagers that they are able to spend ever-increasing periods of time speaking to and interacting with their friends and peers, and without this being subjected to adult scrutiny.  Equally, it is very much a part of a teenager&#8217;s life that they are able to spend time alone, without the presence of an adult or any other person, whenever they like (and their routine allows).</span></p>

This is likely to be dictated both by school arrangements and by the lives and commitments of those around them, usually their parents and siblings.  Most meal times are likely to be set for them by others and they are likely to have a set bedtime, certainly on school nights (even if this is the subject of constant &#8216;negotiation&#8217; and probably a certain degree of laxity).  </span></p>

For many, this represents a very significant element of their burgeoning independence, sense of self and social life.
