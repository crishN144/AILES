	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MM was born in August 1968. She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Her illness is characterised by prominent visual, auditory and tactile somatic hallucinations and appears to relapse rapidly at times of stress. She has only limited insight into the nature of her illness. She has a full scale IQ of 56, a moderate learning disability and poor cognitive functioning. She has significantly impaired or non-existent verbal recall and is functionally illiterate.</p>

They met in or around 1992 whilst living at a homeless person&#8217;s hostel. KM has in the past been diagnosed with a psychopathic personality disorder and alcohol misuse. Attempts in the past to provide him with support have failed due to his abusive conduct towards professionals. He has led an unstable and nomadic life, to which MM has been exposed. He has been violent towards her and is alleged to have used her benefit money to buy alcohol. He has encouraged MM to follow him to various addresses and to disengage from psychiatric services &#8211; resulting, according to the local authority, in deterioration in her mental health. The extent to which he is at present receiving medical or psychiatric support is unknown.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority issued a Part 8 claim form on 8 June 2006. Earlier the same day it had obtained ex parte relief from Her Honour Judge Bevington (sitting as a judge of the High Court). Interim declarations were granted that MM lacked the capacity to decide where she should reside and with whom she should associate and that it was not in her best interests to be removed from the W unit or to have unsupervised contact with KM. An order was made that she was not to be removed from the W unit. The Official Solicitor was invited to act. </p>

Black J&#8217;s order provided for KM to have supervised contact with MM not less than twice a week for not less than two hours each session.</p>

Bodey J continued the interim relief until the final hearing. His order gave the local authority power to terminate contact at its discretion if KM was under the influence of alcohol, abusive or aggressive or was putting the local authority&#8217;s staff at risk of harm. KM was ordered to assist the local authority and the police in achieving the return of MM to the W unit. Bodey J also gave directions, including directions (subsequently varied by Singer J on 28 September 2006) for the preparation and filing of expert reports.</p>

Wood J was told that the local authority planned to move MM from the W unit to the adult family placement should her placement at the W unit break down. Her challenging behaviour at the W unit continued and on 10 October 2006 MM was &#8216;sectioned&#8217; pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.</p>

MM was due to be discharged on 30 October 2006 and the local authority&#8217;s plan, approved by Kirkwood J, was for her to move immediately into the adult family placement. Kirkwood J reduced MM&#8217;s contact with KM to once a week for up to two hours. KM was prohibited from removing MM from the adult family placement, from approaching within 100 yards of it and from contacting MM&#8217;s carers at the placement. Kirkwood J gave further directions with a view to a final hearing on 7 February 2007.</p>

An emergency placement was found at a residential care home.

I was invited, but refused, to make an order by consent vacating the hearing. The hearing on 7 February 2007 accordingly proceeded as a directions hearing. I reserved the matter to myself, gave directions for further expert evidence, listed the matter for a case management conference on 22 March 2007 and re-listed the final hearing for 5 June 2007. In the event the matter came back before me on 10 May 2007, rather than on 22 March 2007, when I gave final directions.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At interview it was clear that MM understood the nature of sexual intercourse and that she additionally had an understanding of the risks of this including the risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She also would be capable of verbally refusing sexual intercourse although she may not always appreciate that she is in a risky situation. I am assuming here that the legal test for capacity to consent to sexual relations is a general test and is not a question of whether a person could consent to sexual relations with one specific individual, therefore she has the capacity to consent to sexual relations but does not necessarily have the capacity to understand that having a relationship with a particular partner (in this case KM) could be harmful to her.</p>

It is unlikely that she will in the future understand the duties and responsibilities of marriage in the future.&#8221;</p>

She produced a list of words during the interview as if this had been learned by rote. She could not describe even in the simplest of terms the meaning behind any of the words which she mentioned. Asking her to give an explanation produced the same list in the same order followed by a number of excuses in an attempt to divert my attention from the fact that she could not answer my questions. This type of behaviour is very common in patients with a learning disability. Even with leading questions MM could not explain in the simplest of terms the purpose of marriage or the nature of the marriage contract. Many of the words in the list which she produced would also describe the situation which pertains when a couple do live together without getting married. This may reflect the fact that she has lived with KM for a considerable period but does not detract from her inability to understand the nature of either marriage vows or the contract of marriage.</p>

She was also aware that sexual intercourse could result in &#8220;VD&#8221;. This was the term that she used and I note that she has had treatment for a sexually transmitted disease in the past. MM is also capable of refusing sexual intercourse. I noted in my original report that she may not always appreciate that she is in a risky situation, meaning that she may not always realise that someone would respect her refusal to have sexual intercourse but this does not mean that she lacks the capacity to make the relevant decision.&#8221;</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;You have also asked me to further comment on my conclusion that MM is unlikely to acquire capacity in the relevant areas. MM is 38 years of age. She is no longer in the developmental period and therefore her underlying level of ability will not increase. In time it may decrease. The available information indicates that MM&#8217;s level of intellectual functioning is very significantly impaired. She would not be capable of living independently without significant assistance. In addition to her learning disability MM also suffers from a psychotic mental illness. This will have two main effects. Firstly during periods of exacerbation of that illness her intellectual functioning and ability to make decisions will be further impaired. Secondly over time patients with severe mental illness can experience an overall deterioration in intellectual functioning outside of periods of acute exacerbation of the illness. At the time that I assessed MM she was not acutely psychotic. It is likely therefore that at the time of the assessment her level of functioning and therefore decision making ability was at its best. It is for these reasons that I drew my conclusion that she was unlikely to acquire decision making capacity in the relevant areas in the future.&#8221;</p>

Because his behaviour appears clearly to be designed to prioritise his own needs, he has no regard for how his actions impact upon the physical and emotional health of MM. He telephones when he feels low in mood or upset and projects those feelings on to her. At other times he does not telephone and this leaves MM distressed.</p>

He recorded that she had not settled well there and appeared to have already developed a fixed idea that she did not want to live there. That view, he thought, was likely to remain.

MM has strongly held views and has repeatedly stated her wish to reside with and maintain a relationship with KM. As noted by Mr Fowler, MM and KM have been in a relationship for 11 years and there is a high level of interdependence between them. Mr Fowler also noted that MM has a strong emotional bond with KM. For much of their time together, KM and MM have had only sporadic input from statutory services, due to their transient lifestyle. Due to MM&#8217;s lack of contact with her family, KM has been the one consistent figure with whom she has been able to develop and maintain a strong emotional relationship over this period. </p>

However, I question how far it is appropriate for the court to interfere with regard to restricting and regulating MM&#8217;s relationships with others (in this case specifically KM) in circumstances where the expert evidence is that MM has capacity to consent to sexual relations and would wish to continue her relationship with KM.</p>

The current recommendations seek to constrain MM&#8217;s ability to have any contact with KM other than on a supervised basis and as infrequently as once a month. This is notwithstanding MM&#8217;s express and strong wish to see KM, speak to KM, live with KM and marry KM. Decisions made in terms of residence and contact will potentially restrict MM&#8217;s ability to maintain a relationship with KM, including her ability to have sexual relations with him.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is my submission, if the court finds it is in MM&#8217;s best interests that her contact with KM should be regulated, that the court should adopt a cautious approach. In conducting the balance sheet exercise, weight must be given not only to MM&#8217;s need for care and protection but also to fact that her relationship with KM has endured for a significant period of time, that it is a relationship which is important to her, and that the relationship has included a number of lengthy periods of cohabitation. In respect of the periods of cohabitation regard should also be given to all the potential legal and emotional ramifications of such an arrangement. I question whether the court should so restrict and regulate the terms of a relationship, in circumstances where MM has capacity to consent to a sexual relationship with KM, to the extent that such regulation may result in the breakdown of that relationship or impose a change in the nature of the relationship. I further note that to date KM has had no assistance with transport to and from organised contacts with MM, in either financial and practical terms and that this may have been a factor in the difficulty he had in attending contact sessions. I would strongly support such arrangements being put in place by the local authority to further facilitate contacts between KM and MM.</p>

The most recent indication from Mr Fowler is that contact between KM and MM should be reduced to a minimum pending the substantive hearing of the case in February. Any possibility of MM realistically making a decision with regard to engaging in sexual relations with KM is negated by the current arrangements for supervised contact, despite Dr Milne&#8217;s current assessment that MM does have capacity to consent to sexual relations with another person.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both MM and KM gave oral evidence. MM was boisterous and outgoing in the witness box. It was in many ways a bravura performance, though her cognitive, intellectual and other limitations quickly became all too apparent. But she had no hesitation and no difficulty in saying what she wanted: &#8220;to live with my partner that&#8217;s what I want &#8211; anywhere, with [KM] &#8211; all I want is to live with him; I should live with him &#8211; I can think for myself &#8211; I want to live with him.&#8221; She said that she loved KM &#8220;very much&#8221; and &#8220;he loves me &#8211; we both love each other.&#8221; It was apparent that she meant what she said. But she was in denial about KM&#8217;s mistreatment of her (see below): &#8220;[KM] looks after me very good &#8230; he has <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">never</span> done anything to me &#8211; he did <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> stab my leg.&#8221; She said &#8220;I <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">never</span> fall out with him.&#8221; </p>

He was, by his own lights, recognising &#8211; up to a point &#8211; of his own problems, but he seemed genuinely attached to and concerned for MM. He said that he wanted to live with MM as husband and wife in a council house: &#8220;I love her.&#8221; He said he would co-operate with social services. He deserved another chance. In relation to contact, if they could not live together, he said &#8220;I will go with the judge.&#8221; He would promise to the court not to go to where MM is living.</p>

That is why in cases of this kind it has now become the practice to grant separate declarations (for example) as to a vulnerable adult&#8217;s capacity (i) to litigate, (ii) to decide where she should reside, (iii) to decide whom she has contact with, (iv) to decide on issues concerning her care, (v) to consent to sexual relations, (vi) to consent to marry and (vii) to manage her financial affairs. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A question was raised as to what was meant by the words &#8220;When cases come before the court on the above issues, judges can adopt the new definition <span style="font-style:italic">if they think it is appropriate</span>&#8221; (emphasis added). I do not for my part see any difficulty. The meaning of the observation is clear and the sentiment unexceptional. It is not being said &#8211; it could not properly be said &#8211; that a judge sitting in the (new) Court of Protection and exercising the statutory jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> is in some mysterious and undefined way entitled to disregard the statutory test in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>. Certainly not. What is being said is that judges sitting elsewhere than in the Court of Protection and deciding cases where what is in issue is, for example, capacity to make a will, capacity to make a gift, capacity to enter into a contract, capacity to litigate or capacity to enter into marriage, can adopt the new definition if it is appropriate &#8211; appropriate, that is, having regard to the existing principles of the common law. And since, as I have said, there is no relevant distinction between the test as formulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB </span>and the test set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and since, as it were, the one merely encapsulates in the language of the Parliamentary draftsmen the principles hitherto expounded by the judges in the other, the invitation extended to the judges by the <span style="font-style:italic">Code of Practice </span>is entirely understandable and, indeed, appropriate.</p>

It will have been noticed that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> Thorpe J identified, as the second of three ingredients of the test, the ability or capacity to &#8220;believe&#8221; the relevant information, whereas that ingredient is seemingly missing both from the formulation of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB </span>and from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. The answer to this seeming lack of correspondence between the tests in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB </span>was provided by Mr Joseph O&#8217;Brien on behalf of KM. It is to be found towards the end of the passage which I quoted above from Butler-Sloss LJ&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB</span>. If one does not &#8220;believe&#8221; a particular piece of information then one does not, in truth, &#8220;comprehend&#8221; or &#8220;understand&#8221; it, nor can it be said that one is able to &#8220;use&#8221; or &#8220;weigh&#8221; it. In other words, the specific requirement of belief is subsumed in the more general requirements of understanding and of ability to use and weigh information. </p>

In my judgment, the same goes, and for much the same reasons, in relation to capacity to consent to sexual relations. The question is issue specific, both in the general sense and, as I have already pointed out, in the sense that capacity has to be assessed in relation to the particular kind of sexual activity in question.

It is difficult to see how it can sensibly be said that she has capacity to consent to a particular sexual act with Y whilst at the same time lacking capacity to consent to precisely the same sexual act with Z. So capacity to consent to sexual intercourse depends upon a person having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the sexual nature and character &#8211; of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse: see <span style="font-style:italic">X City Council v MB, NB and MAB (by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/168" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 968" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 968</ref>, at para [84].

Mr Sachdeva correctly pointed out that there is no necessary requirement that the civil (family) law and criminal law should adopt the same test for capacity to consent to sexual relations, though plainly the civil law&#8217;s test of consent cannot derogate from the protections afforded to the vulnerable by the criminal law. So it is at least possible to contemplate the civil law imposing a different and more demanding test of capacity.

In this context both the criminal law and the civil law serve the same important function: to protect the vulnerable from abuse and exploitation (see further below). Viewed from this perspective, X either has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse or she does not.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have dealt with this in a little detail because, as we have seen, Dr Milne concluded, applying these tests, that MM <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> have capacity to consent to sexual relations although she does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have capacity to decide matters of contact. It was suggested during the course of argument that there was something inconsistent, indeed illogical, about this: as a matter of logic, it was suggested, a person must have the capacity to consent to contact with a potential sexual partner in order to have capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, because contact, however fleeting, is, in the nature of things, a necessary pre-requisite to sexual intercourse. It was further suggested that there are really only two alternatives: either MM does not possess capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, or she does have some capacity to determine contact with KM and has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I confess that I was myself at one stage puzzled by this. But Mr Sachdeva provided the answer. As always, the question of capacity is issue specific. As I observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v E </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2808" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)</ref>. <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 326</ref>, at para [105], because questions of capacity are issue specific, capacity to marry is not the same as capacity to look after oneself. Someone may have the capacity to marry whilst lacking capacity to take care of her own person. In the same way, someone may have capacity to consent to sexual relations whilst lacking capacity to decide more complex questions about long-term relationships. There is, as Mr Sachdeva points out, no necessary dissonance between the lack of capacity to consent to contact and capacity to consent to sexual relations. The former is a potentially complex concept involving a range of considerations arising in the context of a potentially wide variety of situations, for example, from having a cup of tea with someone to going away with them for a long holiday, whilst the latter is often, and of its very nature, much less complex. MM may well understand what is involved in sexual intercourse with KM &#8211; Dr Milne&#8217;s opinion is that she does &#8211; whilst being unable, for example, to appreciate and evaluate all the possible implications and risks for her of staying contact with KM: the risk, for example, that he will persuade her to leave her placement and go off with him and the consequential risks to her physical, mental and emotional well-being were she to do so.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not of course to dispute that there is a connection between the two. For Mr Sachdeva also made the important point that if a person has capacity to consent to sexual relations but cannot consent to contact, the capacity to decide on sexual relations is a material factor &#8211; in my judgment a highly material factor &#8211; in the court&#8217;s assessment of what is in the best interests of that person in terms of her contact with her sexual partner. And as Ms Roshi Amiraftabi correctly accepted on behalf of the local authority, MM&#8217;s capacity to consent to sexual relations, <span style="font-style:italic">and the exercise of that capacity</span> (emphasis added), become relevant to the determination of best interests in relation to contact issues. They are factors to be weighed in the balancing exercise along with all other relevant factors. Mr Sachdeva, picking up on this point, comments that, ironically, although the local authority supports a general, rather than a person-specific, test of capacity to have sexual intercourse, and indeed accepts Dr Milne&#8217;s evidence that MM does have such capacity, it is seemingly not making or proposing to make any arrangements for MM to exercise that capacity in private.</p>

MM&#8217;s welfare is the paramount consideration. The focus must be on MM&#8217;s best interests, and this involves a welfare appraisal in the widest sense, taking into account, where appropriate, a wide range of ethical, social, moral, emotional and welfare considerations. Where, as will often be the case, the various factors engaged pull in opposite directions, the task of ascertaining where the individual&#8217;s best interests truly lie will be assisted by preparation of a &#8216;balance sheet&#8217; of the kind suggested by Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Male Sterilisation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 549" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 549</ref> at page 560.

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual&#8217;s physical and social identity. Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8. Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Though no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8 of the Convention, the court considers that the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees.&#8221;</p>

But what if X lacks capacity? X may want to have a relationship with Y, and the wish may be mutual, but others concerned for X&#8217;s welfare may take the view that it is X&#8217;s best interests that she does not have a relationship with Y. X may have strongly expressed wishes and feelings which conflict with what her carers believe to be in her best interests. How is such a difference of view to be adjusted? Y&#8217;s Article 8 rights have to be assessed and weighed in the balance against X&#8217;s Article 8 rights and because the principle which, consistently with the Convention, animates the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction is the need to protect and further X&#8217;s best interests, then in the final analysis the question of whether X should have a relationship with Y must be determined by reference to X&#8217;s best interests. The court on her behalf, as it were, decides, and by reference to her best interests, how X&#8217;s right of choice under Article 8 is to be exercised.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The family life for which article 8 requires respect is not a proprietary right vested in either parent or child: it is as much an interest of society as of individual family members, and its principal purpose, at least where there are children, must be the safety and welfare of the child. It needs to be remembered that the tabulated right is not to family life as such but to respect for it. The purpose, in my view, is to assure within proper limits the entitlement of individuals to the benefit of what is benign and positive in family life. It is not to allow other individuals, however closely related and well-intentioned, to create or perpetuate situations which jeopardise their welfare.&#8221;</p>

The State may be obliged to take positive action to prevent or stop another individual from interfering with someone&#8217;s private life; the State may be under an obligation to intervene in the relationship between purely private individuals in order to prevent &#8216;private&#8217; violations of rights protected by the Convention: see <span style="font-style:italic">Botta v Italy</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1998) 26 EHRR 241" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">(1998) 26 EHRR 241</ref>. Thus the State, in the form of the local authority, may not merely have the power but may also be under a positive obligation to intervene, even at the risk of detriment to Y&#8217;s private life and in such a way as interferes with the family life which Y shares with X, if such intervention is necessary to ensure respect for X&#8217;s rights under Article 8. And where X is a child or a vulnerable adult the State, in the form of the High Court, has a positive obligation to act in such a way as to ensure respect for X&#8217;s rights.</p>

It follows inexorably from that, that society must be willing to tolerate very diverse standards of parenting, including the eccentric, the barely adequate and the inconsistent. It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">happiness</span>.

Ms Amiraftabi helpfully attached to her skeleton argument a schedule listing some 23 occasions between August 1997 and February 2006 in relation to which there are records of domestic discord, often seemingly involving domestic violence, some of it quite serious and sufficient to leave bruising or other visible marks on MM&#8217;s body. In the worst, in March 2000, KM stabbed MM in the leg. He tried in the witness box before me to pass this off as an accident; MM, he said, had slipped against a knife he was pointing. The fact, however, is that he was convicted of wounding her and received a sentence of four months&#8217; imprisonment.</p>

In the view of the local authority this has been either at the instigation or under the influence of KM or because of his hostile and abusive behaviour towards support staff. Again, Ms Amiraftabi has helpfully provided a schedule summarising the numerous problems there have been during the period from September 1997 to July 2007.</p>

Moreover, KM has been unable to secure accommodation for himself since the commencement of these proceedings and has had continued periods of homelessness. He cannot currently provide secure accommodation for himself and MM, and no proposals have been put before the court, other than KM&#8217;s suggestion that the local authority should provide them with a council house.</p>

Second, the local authority asserts that MM&#8217;s wishes, though relevant, have to be weighed with all the other factors relevant to her welfare &#8211; principally the risks it says MM will be exposed to if she again lives with KM &#8211; and that the balance comes down in favour of overriding her wishes.

Mr Fowler is of the view that when accommodated and supported by the local authority, MM&#8217;s physical and mental health, and indeed her presentation generally, have improved and been stabilised. The local authority, it says, has shown itself committed to meeting her needs.

And although the local authority has, very recently, come to accept that their contact should no longer be supervised, it is not prepared to do anything to enable MM and KM to continue their sexual relationship. For all the reasons given by the Official Solicitor, that plan involves what is, in my judgment, a wholly disproportionate interference by the local authority both with the family life which exists as between MM and KM and, in any event, with MM&#8217;s private life and, indeed, with KM&#8217;s private life.</p>

He questioned whether one supervised two-hour contact per month could truly be said to be in MM&#8217;s best interests. He suggested that it would constitute a disproportionate interference with her rights to private and family life within Article 8. Furthermore, he said, it was difficult to see how such limited contact would permit the proper exercise by MM of her right, assuming she had capacity, to have sexual relations. So on that ground also it was difficult to see how such limited contact could be in MM&#8217;s best interests.</p>

But he also had the specific concerns to which I have already drawn attention in paragraph [54], commenting in addition that the order I had made on 10 May 2007 requiring the local authority to prepare a final care plan had not been complied with. </p>

He emphasised how important it is that the final order on contact reflects the longevity of the relationship between MM and KM so that it is truly in MM&#8217;s best interests and does not interfere disproportionately with her right to a private and family life. Through Mr Sachdeva he observed that it was testament to the strength of MM&#8217;s relationship with KM, and its importance to her, that it had survived the artificiality of the arrangements to which it had been subjected and the very limited contact which had been permitted for much of the recent past. Furthermore, unless the arrangements for contact are modified sensibly so as to meet MM&#8217;s reasonable wishes and feelings the very constraints imposed upon her may put her placement under such strain as to induce her to &#8216;vote with her feet.&#8217;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first place, &#8216;maintenance&#8217; contact once a month involved, in my assessment, a wholly disproportionate and unjustified interference with the long-standing and mutually desired relationship between MM and KM. It placed too much weight and emphasis on the need to protect MM from various risks and far too little weight on the emotional and other benefits that MM derives from the relationship. It failed to strike the balance proportionately, fairly and, dare I say so, even humanely between the proper need to minimise the risks to MM&#8217;s physical and mental health and safety and the equally pressing need to further her emotional welfare &#8211; her happiness. Even leaving on one side altogether what MM and KM said in the witness box &#8211; and of course I do not &#8211; there is much in Dr Milne&#8217;s and Mr Fowler&#8217;s reports and in their evidence which goes to show not merely how important the relationship is to MM but also how in some important respects it is actually very beneficial to her.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event, both Mr Fowler and the local authority now accept that contact should be both more frequent &#8211; weekly rather than monthly &#8211; and for longer periods &#8211; four hours rather than two hours. That, I have to say, seems to me to be the minimum that is acceptable. Neither Dr Milne nor Mr Fowler nor the local authority is prepared to go so far as to say &#8211; and I can well understand why &#8211; that her relationship with KM is so damaging to MM, so fraught with danger and so contrary to her welfare, that it should be terminated altogether. Plainly, in my judgment, it should not. But after all that has gone before, and given the duration and intensity of the relationship, to reduce it to &#8216;maintenance&#8217; contact once a month is not merely wholly disproportionate to what the circumstances imperatively require but so drastic as to be, in effect if not in intention, almost cruel. What is now proposed is, as I have said, the minimum that is acceptable. Its adequacy will need to be kept under review.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, and for much the same reasons, the proposal until very recently that all contact should be supervised struck a wholly inappropriate and disproportionate balance. It was, if I may say so, a revealing example of the dangers of putting a vulnerable adult&#8217;s supposed safety before her happiness. I accept that there are risks in unsupervised contact. Of course there are. But one has, as I have said, to evaluate these risks in a pragmatic, common sense and robust way. The risks which attach to unsupervised contact between MM and KM are, in my judgment, manageable and acceptable. They are, moreover, risks which in my judgment need to be run if MM&#8217;s welfare in <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> its aspects is truly to be achieved and if there is not to be a disproportionate interference with her rights under Article 8. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, Article 8 protects MM&#8217;s right to respect for her physical and mental health and safety &#8211; that is a vital aspect of the &#8220;physical and psychological integrity&#8221; which the Strasbourg court referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Pretty v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2003) 35 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">(2003) 35 EHRR 1</ref> &#8211; but it also protects her right to an ongoing relationship with KM. And those conflicting aspects of her rights have to be evaluated and weighed by reference to the Strasbourg principles of necessity and proportionality. In my judgment, the risks to MM&#8217;s physical and mental health and safety are not such as to make it necessary (in the Strasbourg sense) for her contact with KM to be supervised. On the contrary, to impose a requirement of supervision is to interfere disproportionately with MM&#8217;s right to an ongoing relationship with KM.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, and the implications of this remain very much in contention, there is the fundamentally important fact of the longstanding sexual relationship between MM and KM. The local authority&#8217;s plan makes no provision for facilitating the sexual relationship with KM which MM desires and in relation to which Dr Milne agrees, and I find, that she has capacity.</p>

Indeed, where the relationship has lasted as long as this one has, especially pressing reasons must surely be shown to exist. In the present case, in my judgment, they do not. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The answer provided by Mr Sachdeva is simple and compelling. It is, he says, because it is the act of the local authority in putting MM in a placement where KM is not allowed to join her, that indeed he is prohibited from even visiting, which is creating the state of affairs which gives rise to the difficulty, which gives rise to the very problem whose alleviation is in issue. MM is not saying that the local authority is, as such, under an obligation to provide her with facilities to enable her to continue her sexual relationship with KM. She would be perfectly willing and able to make her own arrangements if left to her own devices. But if the local authority seeks to interfere in &#8211; indeed, control &#8211; her life by saying where she must live, by placing her on her own somewhere where KM is not even allowed to visit her, and by controlling KM&#8217;s access to her, then, says Mr Sachdeva, the situation is very different. The local authority is by its own acts creating a situation where, if a breach of Article 8 is to be avoided, the local authority must take certain positive steps &#8211; specifically, steps to enable MM to continue, in an appropriate and dignified way, her sexual relationship with KM. </p>

Now that was a case under Article 3, where the duty on the public authority &#8211; in that case the Secretary of State &#8211; was absolute, whereas in the present case it is Article 8 which is engaged, so the duty is modulated by the principle of proportionality. But the general principle, in my judgment, remains the same. If the local authority seeks to impose on MM a regime which in fact involves a breach of her Article 8 rights &#8211; and that, says Mr Sachdeva and I agree, is the consequence of imposing on MM a regime which in practical terms prevents her continuing her sexual relationship with KM &#8211; then the local authority in principle has a choice. It must modify the arrangements so that there is no breach of Article 8. And in the circumstances of the present case it can do this either by abandoning its attempt to prescribe where and with whom MM lives or, if it wishes to exercise that control, by taking appropriate positive steps to enable MM to continue her sexual relationship with KM. If it seeks to do the one without shouldering the burden of doing the other, then its intervention in MM&#8217;s life is, he submits, and I agree, disproportionate. And in my judgment it involves a breach of her rights under Article 8.</p>
