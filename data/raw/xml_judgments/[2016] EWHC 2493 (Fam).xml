	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When he was 19 years old, Clive Jefferies, then in the Royal Army Medical Corps, served his country in the Falklands War. On 8 June 1982 he was with the Welsh Guards on RFA Sir Galahad when it was bombed and destroyed by the Argentinian Air Force at Bluff Cove. On that day the fates smiled at him. Minutes before the attack he had been in a part of the ship where the first bomb exploded, killing many men. In the aftermath of the bombing he saved the life of a comrade who was in difficulties in the water. At his funeral, 32 years later, his commanding officer described his conduct on that fateful day as magnificent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Returning to civvy street in 1987, Clive served the community as a nurse and midwife. He and his wife, the claimant Samantha Jefferies, met in 1999, moved in together in 2002 and married in 2007. Their ambition to have a family was assisted by the Sussex Downs Fertility Centre, a clinic operated by the First Interested Party, BMI Healthcare Limited, and regulated by the Second Interested Party, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither of the first two cycles of IVF treatment was successful. On 1 April 2014 they attended the clinic to plan a third cycle of treatment, using three embryos, created from Samantha&#8217;s eggs and Clive&#8217;s sperm, which had been frozen on 11 August 2013. It was not to be. Fate struck. On 19 April 2014, suddenly and unexpectedly, Clive collapsed and died of a brain haemorrhage, while at home with Samantha. He was only 51 years old. He had previously been fit and healthy. It came as an appalling and terrible shock to Samantha. She was devastated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 March 2015, the clinic wrote to Samantha, telling her that the storage period for the embryos was due to expire on 11 August 2015. On 29 June 2015, the clinic wrote again, saying that, having taken advice from the HFEA, it seemed that the period of storage could not be extended and that accordingly the embryos would need to be used before 11 August 2015. The clinic indicated that it might be possible to obtain relief from the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were commenced on 2 June 2016. The relief claimed was a declaration that it is lawful for the embryos to be stored for a period of 10 years from 11 August 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Put very shortly, Samantha&#8217;s case was that on 20 July 2013 Clive had signed a Form MT (see below) giving consent to the storage of the embryos for a period of 10 years; that although the Form MT was subsequently amended to substitute a storage period of only 2 years, that amendment was not signed by Clive; that the amendment was therefore, as a matter of law, invalid; and that, accordingly, the consequence in law of what had happened was that the original consent for the period of 10 years remained, and remains, effective. This part of the case was elaborated by reference to various other points which I refer to below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a separate and further point (the Article 8 point), it was asserted that limitation of the period of storage to 2 years would amount to a disproportionate interference with Samantha&#8217;s rights under Article 8. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before me for directions on 23 June 2016. The clinic had indicated that it would not take an active role in the proceedings. The HFEA, represented by Mr Harry Adamson, had indicated in a letter dated 14 June 2016 that it was supportive of Samantha&#8217;s primary basis of claim (see below) but that it wished to reserve the right to make submissions on the remaining issues. It appeared that the Secretary of State for Health might wish to intervene on the Article 8 issue. I directed, without opposition from Ms Jenni Richards QC and Ms Rose Grogan, who appeared for Samantha, that the case, <span style="font-style:italic">save for the Article 8 issue</span>, was to be listed for hearing in September 2016. I directed that the HFEA and the Secretary of State were to confirm in writing by 29 June 2016 whether they intended to participate in the hearing and whether they wished to submit evidence. Finally, so far as material for present purposes, I directed that in the event that Samantha&#8217;s application other than in relation to Article 8 was unsuccessful the parties were at liberty to apply for directions in relation to the Article 8 issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By a letter dated 29 June 2016, the Government Legal Department on behalf of the Secretary of State wrote stating that the Secretary of State agreed with the HFEA that it was open to the court to make the declaration sought by Samantha. In those circumstances, and given that the Article 8 issue was <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>going to be dealt with, the Secretary of State did not consider it necessary to intervene in the hearing.</p>

As on the previous occasion, Samantha was represented by Ms Richards and Ms Grogan, and the HFEA by Mr Adamson. The clinic and the Secretary of State were neither present nor represented.</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;On 31 May 2012, the HFEA issued guidance in the form of a Chief Executive&#8217;s letter CE/12/02 under the heading &#8220;Extension of Storage of Gametes and embryos where one of the gamete providers is deceased&#8221;. In issuing this guidance, the HFEA sought to draw attention to risks that may arise when patients are routinely asked to restrict their storage to a period of only 2 or 3 years. The guidance highlighted the fact that this practice gives rise to a higher risk that in the event of a patient dying, the gametes or embryos cannot continue to be stored, causing significant distress, stating: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;If your centre asks patients to restrict their storage to a period less than the maximum permitted by law, there is a higher risk that in the event of a patient dying the gametes or embryos cannot continue to be stored, causing significant distress. We strongly encourage you to consider the impact of this practice, in particular in circumstances where individuals have life threatening illnesses.&#8221;</span> After this 2012 letter was written, particularly in the context of the guidance set out above, the HFEA fully expected responsible clinics to (i) stop the practice of asking patients to limit their consent for financial reasons, or at the very least (ii) explain the difference between clinic policy and the patient&#8217;s right to consent to storage for up to 55 years, and the potential impacts of shorter storage after death. The HFEA was disappointed to learn that despite the May 2012 letter the practice was continuing, and therefore the HFEA took further steps to stop it including those set out below.&#8221;</p>

In her second witness statement she said that the inserted &#8220;2&#8221; does not particularly look like Clive&#8217;s hand-writing but adds, very frankly, &#8220;I cannot be certain.&#8221; It seems likely that the amendment was made (when and by whom being, as I have said, unclear) to reflect the clinic&#8217;s policy at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Samantha&#8217;s primary submission is very simple. The Form MT as originally signed was a valid consent under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>. It authorised storage of the embryos for a period of 10 years, as is plain on the face of the document. Clive gave effective, written and informed consent to the period of 10 years. As set out by Samantha in her first witness statement, the couple had researched the 10 year period and deliberately selected it. The subsequent amendment to a period of two years was not signed, in stark contrast, it should be noted, to every other amendment on the Form MT. The absence of a signature is sufficient to invalidate the amendment, as it does not comply with paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 3. This alone, Ms Richards and Ms Grogan submit, is determinative of the claim. Mr Adamson agrees. So do I. As I said during the hearing, the case turns on a signature. On this ground alone, Samantha is entitled to the declaration she seeks. I make clear, for the avoidance of any misunderstanding that the statutory requirement that a consent, or any variation or withdrawal of a consent, must be &#8220;signed by&#8221; the relevant person does not require a full signature; for this purpose, it is sufficiently &#8220;signed by&#8221; that person if, in his own hand, he initials it.  </p>

Even if the alteration was made by Clive, knowingly and intentionally (and I stress that the evidence does not establish this), it would be quite immaterial. The fact that the alteration was not &#8220;signed by&#8221; Clive is fatal and thus, of itself and without more ado, determinative.</p>

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.&#8221;</p>

The submission, and again Mr Adamson made common cause with Ms Richards and Ms Grogan, was that it can be inferred from the evidence that Clive did not give informed consent to the amendment, as required by paragraph 3. It is said that the Form MT was amended to reflect the clinic&#8217;s funding policy, and not as a result of a change of heart on Clive&#8217;s part, and that in any event there is no evidence that Clive was given any information or offered counselling about the implications of changing the Form MT.</p>

Counsel may be correct, but the proposition is not self-evidently apparent from the language of paragraph 3. Paragraph 1(1), as we have seen, refers to &#8220;A consent &#8230; and any notice &#8230; varying or withdrawing a consent.&#8221; Paragraph 3, in contrast, refers merely to the giving of &#8220;consent.&#8221; There is no need for me to express any view, let alone come to a conclusion, about an important point which, as Mr Adamson observed, requires careful consideration of various other provisions in Schedule 3, but which does not arise for decision.

Ms Richards and Ms Grogan sought to argue that Clive&#8217;s signature to each of these two documents was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 3, relying for this purpose upon the wording of paragraph I of the document, recording his understanding that &#8220;any embryos that are not replaced will, at the discretion of the medical and scientific staff, be preserved &#8230; and stored for a period of not more than ten (10) years from the date of fertilisation,&#8221; and upon the language of the Declaration, at the end of the document, which he and Samantha signed, that &#8220;We will be bound by the acknowledgements, admissions and consents that we have made and given in this letter in the event of any subsequent death &#8230;&#8221; Mr Adamson pointed to the uncertainty of the words &#8220;not more than ten &#8230; years&#8221; and submitted that, in any event, the Form SDFC9, read as a whole, was directed to a wholly different issue and served a wholly different purpose: it was not, he submitted, a consent form at all but, rather, an agreed statement of the terms and conditions upon and subject to which the clinic agreed to store the embryos.
