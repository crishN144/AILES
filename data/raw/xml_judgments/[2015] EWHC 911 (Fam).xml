	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application for parental orders in respect of two children who were born as a result of gestational surrogacy agreements entered into in the USA in 2006 and 2009. The application originated as an application for adoption orders, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (ACA), in respect of A, who was born on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2006 and is now 8 years 3 months old, and his sister B, who was born on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2009 and is now 5 years 8 months old.  At the time the applications were made on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2014 the Applicants had been advised that it was not possible to make applications for parental orders as they had exceeded the six month time limit provided for in s 54(3) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFEA) 2008.  On the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> of October 2014 in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>[2014] EWHC 3135 Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, handed down a judgment in which he made a parental order in respect of a child when the application had been made some 2 years and 2 months after the birth of the child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In one respect the case has a marked similarity with the <span style="font-style:italic">X </span>case which is that the Applicants as &#8220;the commissioning parents&#8221; were not aware of the need to apply for parental orders to provide their children with the same legal status as they had in California where they were born.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute on the facts of this case or on the order that the court is being urged to make; the respondents to the proceedings are the gestational surrogate and her husband and have taken no part in the proceedings except to confirm that they fully support the court making parental orders. The children were joined as parties and are represented through their guardian by Cafcass Legal. The guardian strongly supports the application for parental as opposed to adoption orders on welfare grounds. There is therefore no dispute between the parties themselves. This is not unusual in applications for parental orders, particularly those where there has been a carefully regulated legally binding commercial surrogacy contract in the USA where the children are, as a matter of law, the children of the commissioning parents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicants are D who is the commissioning and biological father and G the commissioning mother. It is not necessary to set out the full background of this case and, in particular, the history of the Applicants&#8217; attempts to have a family without the assistance of a gestational surrogate except to say that they were unable to have children carried by the commissioning mother. Having decided on California, because of the considerable experience and sound regulatory framework in surrogacy, they approached a well established agency in Los Angeles and were matched with the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent. The Applicants took legal advice from an attorney experienced in reproductive law. They were advised that the commissioning father would be the biological father of any child born to the surrogate and that they would be the legal parents of the child in the US. They did not take advice in the UK nor was it suggested they should do so by any of the professionals that they were in contact with in California. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A was born in October 2006 following IVF using a donor egg and the sperm of the commissioning father. Under Californian law and following a court order of the Superior Court of California dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, 2006 A is legally the child of the Applicants. His birth certificate records the Applicants as his parents. A was granted a US passport in December 2006 on which he travelled to the UK with his parents (under US law). He was granted a UK passport on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2007.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A had been born prematurely and was referred to a specialist paediatrician by the family GP. The fact that the history of his conception and birth was openly divulged by the Applicants can be seen from his medical records. Similarly whether a UK passport should have been granted or not it was and all the circumstances of A&#8217;s birth and travel to the UK were disclosed when the application was made. No professional who dealt with A (or indeed with B) ever raised any questions regarding the Applicants&#8217; legal status as parents. </p>

Before she was born an order was made in the Superior Court confirming the Applicants as her legal parents and in accordance with Californian law they were named as B&#8217;s parents on her birth certificate. Once again a US passport was issued and B entered the UK on that passport and was issued with a British passport. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two children have grown up with the Applicants who have been their parents in every sense since the day they were born. I have read about the children not just in their parents&#8217; statements but in the thorough, careful and sensitive report of the children&#8217;s guardian, John Power, the medical reports prepared about both children and the applicants, and the two <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/44" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s44</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>) Annex A reports prepared on behalf of H County Council in respect of the adoption application. The children have been brought up openly in the knowledge and understanding of where they came from and how they were born to a surrogate as their mother could not carry them and that their father is their biological father. G explained to me in oral evidence the sensitive, yet open and age appropriate way, she had told the children about their genetic and gestational history. They know the respondents as both families have maintained a friendship by telephone and email since the children were born.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children are aware of this application and that their parents had applied for an adoption order before the application for parental orders was made as they were seen by the social worker who prepared the Annex A reports. As she said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[D] and [G] are [the children&#8217;s] parents in every sense other than legally. [They] have lived with them since birth and they have met all [their] physical and emotional needs. The referees, the head teacher of the children&#8217;s school and my observations all confirm that the children view [D] and [G] as their parents.</span>&#8221; Their guardian says simply &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">They are palpably attached to their intended parents.</span>&#8221; And &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Observably these children feel loved, secure and wanted by the Intended Parents who less loftily they know as their mum and dad.</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A who as the elder child has a greater understanding of what is happening has expressed a clear preference for a parental order being made rather than being adopted; which he explained as having some stigma attached to it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At my direction the Applicants filed statements about why they came to make these applications so late. I heard their oral evidence. I was impressed by both applicants as witnesses. G in particular came across as a most emotionally intelligent parent who was attuned to her children. Her description of the children and their wishes and feelings was heartfelt and insightful, without being in the least sentimental.  I was most struck by her explanation of the children&#8217;s story and how they understood their place in their family; that their parents had made them travelling half way round the world to do so. G told me that the children had their story and that to make adoption orders would alter it, adding what she called a &#8220;sub-section&#8221;; that it might come up and be an issue at critical times in their future lives and would be in contradiction to who they are in their family and how they came to be here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both D and G described how they found out that the children were not legally their children in this jurisdiction as they had thought. As D said they had no idea that they were not the children&#8217;s legal parents under UK law. I accept that they had researched surrogacy in the USA and that nothing either in their enquiries prior to embarking upon surrogacy agreements, during the process or afterwards had alerted them to the need to apply for parental orders in this country. There is documentary evidence that they sought and took legal advice in the US and that they took all the appropriate steps to confirm their parentage in the USA. The advice they were given by their US attorney did not extend to the UK and as legal parents in the US they believed they would have similar recognition in the UK. That they were entirely open about their position is evident from the documents they filed in support of their application not least from the medical reports. The straightforward way in which they applied for and were given UK passports for the children supported them in their belief.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was not until 2012 when D was reading an article in a newspaper about a family in a similar situation involving an international surrogacy case that the applicants realised that they were not the children&#8217;s parents in law. As their joint statement reads &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It did not occur to us that we would have any difficulty with UK law until in mid 2012 D saw a newspaper article about UK parents who had gone overseas for surrogacy.  The article referred to the fact that in such cases intended parents needed a parental order within 6 months of returning to the UK after the birth of a child through surrogacy.   We were concerned to read this and started to worry that perhaps our legal position was more complicated than we had thought</span>.&#8221; They took steps in early 2013 to regularise the children&#8217;s status by seeking advice and were advised that they could not apply for parental orders because of the time limit imposed in s 54 of the HFEA. They then contacted H County Council as the first step in applying for adoption orders as they were advised that they were the only orders that the court could make. </p>

The effect of that must be to weight the balance between public policy considerations and welfare (as considered in Re X and Y) decisively in favour of welfare. It must follow that it will only be in the clearest case of the abuse of public policy that the court will be able to withhold an order if otherwise welfare considerations support its making... I think it important to emphasise that, notwithstanding the paramountcy of welfare, the court should continue carefully to scrutinise applications for authorisation under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 54(8)</ref> with a view to policing the public policy matters identified in Re S (supra) and that it should be known that that will be so.&#8221;</span></p>

I find that none of the concerns raised by Hedley J are an issue in this case.  The sums paid to the Respondents and to the agency in this case are well within the amount of payments previously authorised by this court for US surrogacy arrangements. It is worth reiterating that the agency fees were lawful in the California which allows surrogacy arrangement for profit, and they represented standard charges.

I repeat in this context what I have already said in paragraphs 54-56 above. There are, without labouring the point, three aspects of a parental order which very obviously and very fundamentally distinguish it from the kind of case which the court was concerned with in Adesina. The first is that a parental order goes not to just status but to identity as a human being. The second is that the court is looking, indeed is required by statute to look, to a future stretching many, many decades into the future. The third is that the court is concerned not just with the impact on the applicant whose default in meeting the time limit is being scrutinised but also with the impact on the innocent child, whose welfare is the court's paramount concern. In these circumstances the court is entitled, indeed in my judgment it is bound, to adopt a more liberal and relaxed approach than was appropriate in Adesina. After all, as Maurice Kay LJ recognised in Adesina, what the court is required to do, albeit it is required to do no more, is to secure compliance with the Convention.

(This situation is now rectified by the British nationality registration applications successfully made last year 2014). The Applicants registered the children with their local doctor and health visitor and were open with them about the nature of their conception and birth. They later applied for school places for them in an equally honest and open way and explained about the circumstances of the children&#8217;s births to all the relevant authorities.

This essential logic is extended to parental orders when birth certificates are issued after the order is made.  A and B are the children of assisted reproduction and not adopted children and they would be denied the rights of privacy afforded to other children conceived through surrogacy and gamete donation if an adoption rather than parental orders are made. </p>

Both children are fully aware, in an age appropriate manner, of how they came into the world&#8230; However, the children feel very secure and display high esteem derived from being A and B&#8230;. When we embarked on having a family in the most responsible and ethical way we never imagined that our children would be subject to adoption.  We are most anxious to avoid any issues that this may raise for them as they grow up</span>&#8221;. G says in her second statement &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was delighted when we received news that it might be possible for us to apply for parental orders rather than adoption orders for the children as I know that this will mean a lot to A and B as they grow up.  Explaining the reason why Mummy and Daddy had to adopt them was a conversation I was prepared to have and would not avoid in keeping with our approach thus far.  However, I know that this fact would crop up at various times in their lives when they might mind it very much and it may put them at a disadvantage at important times for them &#8211; adolescence, marriage, birth of their children, bereavement and inheritance.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Their Guardian says appositely in his report at paragraph [47]: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Whilst I acknowledge that the application made in respect of the children is outside the usual 6 month timescale, it is my view that the alternative i.e. an adoption order, would not be a suitable remedy because it&#8217;s a square peg for a round hole.  D is the children&#8217;s biological father, they were conceived within a consensual surrogacy arrangement and the bespoke, tried and tested legal instrument in this jurisdiction, for regulating the legal status of children born in such circumstances, has been a parental order.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further I was reminded and note that parental orders were created because Parliament, when debating the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, decided that it would be inappropriate for biological parents to have to adopt their own children.  The very existence of parental orders is a testament to the decision of Parliament that adoption orders do not befit children born through surrogacy. Parliament provided for parental orders to be the legal remedy designed for surrogacy situations and it is a contrivance to use adoption as an alternative solution unless there is no other option within the court&#8217;s discretion.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To make adoption orders the court would have to exercise its discretion in deciding possible public policy restrictions contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s83</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/92" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s92</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s95</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>; namely under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 83</ref> the restriction on bringing children into the UK for the purpose of adoption; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/92" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 92</ref> the restrictions on privately arranged adoptions; and, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s95</ref> the restrictions of payments for adoption. All of these arguably apply in this case so the alternative of making adoption orders is not free from complication and issues of public policy; adoption is not a straightforward alternative remedy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The time that has elapsed before the applications were made very considerably exceeds the limit of 6 months provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. I have had regard to the statute, to the purpose for which it was enacted and the impact on the parties, the children in particular, if the application is not allowed despite the protracted delay. It would be manifestly unjust to give a delay that was innocently wrought, even a very long one such as this, greater weight than the welfare of these children. The children know who they are and have been brought up in that knowledge. The jurisprudence in this area is dominated by statute and by case law, some of which I have set out above, which gives emphasis to the child&#8217;s welfare throughout her life. I have decided to make parental orders as the orders which best meet the children&#8217;s needs and meet the justice of this case. </p>
