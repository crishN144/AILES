This principle is, of course, one of three identified by the House of Lords, in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref>, as underpinning the exercise by the courts of their discretionary powers under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">What, then, has led to this stark divide?  The focus of the dispute is the assessment of the wife&#8217;s future financial needs (in respect of both annual expenditure and housing).  It is not infrequent for there to be a dispute between parties as to the fair level of an applicant&#8217;s needs.  It is unusual for there to be a divergence as substantial as in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">Mr Howard accepts that the wife&#8217;s claims should be determined, largely, by reference to the wife&#8217;s financial needs.  I say, largely, because Mr Howard submits that it is necessary to stand back and look at the effect of the award in percentage terms.  The court must &#8220;take into account that wealth was accumulated during the marriage&#8221;.  He also submits that the wife&#8217;s needs, in particular her income needs, &#8220;should not be viewed through the prism of spending during the marriage&#8221;.  The standard of living during the marriage is, he submits, not a ceiling when the court is assessing relationship generated needs.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">The wife seeks the capitalisation of her income needs based on an annual need for life of &#163;500,000.  This produces a Duxbury sum, without amortisation, of &#163;17 million.  Her housing needs are put at &#163;10.5 million.  This would provide the wife with homes in the country (&#163;6 million) and in London (&#163;3.6 million) plus the cost of furnishing and refurbishing these properties (&#163;950,000).  In addition the wife seeks &#163;1.1 million to provide housing for her parents and a sum in respect of costs for proceedings concerning the children.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">Mr Peel submits that the wife&#8217;s award should be assessed solely by application of the principle of need.  He submits that the sharing principle has no effective application in the circumstances of this case and that the wife's award should be based on her housing needs and her income needs capitalised with an amortising, Duxbury, lump sum.  He submits that the standard of living during the marriage is of critical significance.  It is not a ceiling but to exceed it would, in his submission, be exceptional.  The husband accepts, as referred to above, that the award should meet the wife&#8217;s needs for life.  As a result, her needs will be met for some 50 years, a factor which, Mr Peel submits, must be reflected in the court&#8217;s assessment of the level at which to capitalise those needs.</p>

In part to allow for a degree of flexibility and additional security (and based on an earlier offer) the husband proposes the wife should receive a total of &#163;8.2 million.</p>

He owns, or can be treated as owning (because they are held in a bare trust), assets valued at &#163;58 million and is beneficially interested in assets valued at &#163;105 million held in three trusts.  The (now) bare trust was settled in 1984.  The husband has a life interest in the three trusts, which were settled between 1959 and 1971.  He is entitled to the income absolutely with the trustees also having the power to appoint capital.  The origin of this wealth dates back to the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century and, accordingly, reflects the endeavours of his family over many generations.</p>

The family made use of the estate in a variety of ways such as for riding and other activities.  The house itself has been valued at between &#163;2.25 and &#163;3 million depending on how much additional land and how many ancillary buildings are included.  At the maximum this includes 25 acres (excluding the garden) and a number of ancillary outbuildings.  The house itself is approximately 6,500 square feet.  With all the outbuildings, the total is 15,000 square feet.  It also has a tennis court and swimming pool.</p>

This was purchased, for &#163;2.5 million, by the husband at her request.  It is smaller than the former matrimonial home, being in all some 8,200 square feet (the house is 4,700 square feet).  Additional land was then purchased at a cost of &#163;366,000.  Before the wife decided that she no longer wanted to live in this property she had proposed, and the husband had agreed to fund, significant improvements but the scope and cost of these were never agreed.  </p>

The wife has sought to revisit this finding during the course of the hearing before me.  Nothing I have heard persuades me that this finding is incorrect.  Indeed, I am satisfied that it is correct.  The fact that the wife viewed it as a permanent home is demonstrated by a number of factors including the purchase of the additional land and her exploration of the cost of refurbishment and improvements.  </p>

Much of it is treated as his income for tax purposes because of his life interests but, each year, significant sums are retained within the trusts/businesses to provide working capital and for other trust/business purposes.  This is not surprising given the nature of the husband&#8217;s income entitlement and the nature of the assets held by the trusts.  Net of these deductions, the husband&#8217;s average net income for the years 2010/11 to 2013/14 was just over &#163;800,000.  Further, from this income the husband pays significant life insurance premiums and professional fees which, if deducted, would reduce his annual income for these years to approximately &#163;600,000.</p>

It is the obverse of an allegation that one spouse was profligate.  The essence of the wife&#8217;s case is that the standard of living during the marriage should be given less weight because it was kept at an artificially low level as a result of the husband&#8217;s conduct.  I suppose, if I were to exclude the various ways in which the wife alleges that the husband was mean, it would not be conduct to submit that the parties could have spent more than they did on their annual expenditure.  However, if this was all that was being submitted it would not significantly advance the wife&#8217;s case because it could equally be said that they could have spent less.  As referred to above, this is clearly an issue which is central to the way in which the wife sees her case.  I would not normally consider it necessary to do so, but given this, I propose, briefly, to address this aspect of the case in the terms advanced by the wife in her evidence.</p>

This is also a marked increase from the estimated figure of &#163;980,000 given by the wife in her Replies to Questionnaire of September 2014.  </p>

In any event, any such claim could only be made in respect of the husband&#8217;s resources.  The wife&#8217;s case makes no distinction between the trust and the non-trust assets.  The trust assets are not part of the husband&#8217;s wealth (as his interest is limited to an income benefit, as referred to above) as well as not being marital property.  Further, the broad assessment provided on behalf of the husband is more than sufficient to demonstrate that even at the lower level (of RPI) the non-trust assets have increased by only about &#163;5 million (to 2013) in real terms.  If, an alternative and probably more accurate measure, house price indexation, was taken this would demonstrate no real growth.  In the light of even this broad assessment, and even on the figures advanced on behalf of the wife (to 2015), the sharing principle is not effectively engaged in this case.</p>

Of course this wife could never have expected a "meal ticket for life" on the basis of six years of marriage and two years of cohabitation if there had been no children.  Far from it, she would no doubt have continued to work at Selfridges, or in similar employment, and at the point of the breakdown of their marriage and divorce there would have been a fair capital division and a clean break and each would have gone their own way.  But the fact of having children, and their obvious dependence in this particular case on their mother for their care, changes everything, as I have said.

I propose to allow &#163;500,000 in respect of this element of the claim.  The wife&#8217;s schedule of furniture is clearly excessive, even on the basis of allowing for one property only.</p>

What is the asserted justification for such a substantial increase?  Apart from the wife&#8217;s case that the husband was mean, which I have rejected, it comes down to two grounds.  First, that the wife wants a better standard of living and the husband can afford to provide it.  Secondly, now that the children are older there is greater scope for more to be spent on holidays and other, social, activities all of which were more restricted when the parties had four children of a young age.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">In my judgment, the first ground is without substance.  Of course, the assessment of need is an objective one, but this point does not justify an increase above the much weightier factor of the marital standard of living.  The second factor bears some weight in the circumstances of this case and so provides justification for some increase but nowhere near the amount sought by the wife.  In his oral evidence the husband accepted that the wife might reasonably spend more on some items on which less had been spent during the marriage because of the ages of the children.</p>

There would have to be some very significant reduction in the future given that the lump sum will be calculated by reference to approximately 50 years (nearly 35 years after the youngest child will be 21).</p>

I see no justification for enhancing the wife&#8217;s claim on the basis that she might outlive her assumed life expectancy.  This is far too speculative.  Nor do I see any force in the claim for an enhanced sum to enable bequests.  There is more force in Mr Howard&#8217;s submission that, given the following factors in the case - the level of the husband&#8217;s wealth giving him financial security and flexibility and the length of the period over which the wife will be making contributions - the wife lump sum should not be amortised.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">However, these factors have to be balanced against the fact that, as I have just mentioned, the income fund is calculated to cover a period of roughly 35 years after the youngest child will be 21.  A simple Duxbury for &#163;175,000 is approximately &#163;5 million.  Is this the appropriate sum to award in respect of the wife&#8217;s income needs?  I bear in mind that Duxbury is a tool and not a rule (and what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">AR v AR</span>, on which Mr Howard relies) and to the relevant factors in this case as referred to above.  In my judgment, in this case, it is fair to take the sum of &#163;5 million.  To apply a multiplier (which reflects the wife&#8217;s life expectancy) to a multiplicand of &#163;175,000 results in a significant level of flexibility <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> security because of the size of the resultant sum.  For comparison, the non-amortised sum would be approximately &#163;5.5 million.</p>

Would it be fair, having regard to all the circumstances, to deduct the sum of &#163;300,000?  Given the degree of the wife&#8217;s profligacy and given that, on a broad perspective and even after deducting this sum, the wife will be able to meet her reasonable needs as assessed above, I consider it would be unfair to the husband not to do so.  Applying the statutory test, it is conduct which it would be inequitable to disregard.</p>

This was also a case where need was the dominant principle.
