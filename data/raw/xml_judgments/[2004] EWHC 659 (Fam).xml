It is clear that a Personal Representative has a duty to produce accounts &#8211; if the Court so orders. Of course, a delay in making the request is a matter to be taken into account but that is a matter of discretion.  Technically, in this case, I consider that the claimant was only seeking the information to which she was entitled under Statute and she was not seeking to start an administration action. Thus, the Registrar had jurisdiction and the order was properly made.</span></p>
