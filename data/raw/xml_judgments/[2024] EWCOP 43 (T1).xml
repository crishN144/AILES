The ICB support this stating that it is accepted that it is an &#8220;unusual application&#8221;, and it is accepted that we do not have any concerns that the third respondent will use this material in a way adverse to P&#8217;s best interest but, having regard to the granular statements and history, P needs to feel that he can trust his professionals. </span></p>

The position is that confidential discussions should not be disclosed, and the broad framework will be adequate for the third respondent. Those are the grounds relied upon.</span></p>

In making this application they are faced with an unrepresented party who is having to contend with an application whereby medical records and care plans and the like should be withheld from her. This is a serious application which is contrary to the rules of transparency and openness with various witness statements. The social worker for the local authority provides a lengthy statement challenging what is being said by the Applicant.</span></p>

The witness statement on behalf of the ICB is eight paragraphs long &#8211; &#8216;P has consistently expressed over a longitudinal period that he is happy for information to be shared with his mother but does not want detailed information about his treatment shared.&#8217; That is the best that they can do. </span></p>

I am told that P&#8217;s treating clinician goes out to visit him three times. I don&#8217;t need to repeat my judgment but that very statement says when P is asked if he thought he would be at significant harm, the clinician said I do not think he believes that his mother&#8217;s involvement can cause significant harm to him. This feeds into my decision. His mother is not causing him harm, the Trust&#8217;s own witness thinks there is no likelihood of harm, yet they put this before the Court and persist. So, under rule 19.5(2)(c) the manner in which they made this application with its purported evidence is inadequate and less than clear.</span></p>

Looking at the authorities, in G v E [2010] 3385 Baker J stated that on the facts in that case that the blatant disregard for the processes of the MCA and their obligation to respect P&#8217;s rights under the ECHR amounted to misconduct which justified departing from the general rules see paragraph 41. That Judge considered all aspects as must I. I am considering the rights of all the parties. It is an exercise of my discretion. </span></p>

It was a prolonged failure and culminated in coming to court to use two hours of court time just for this application. </span></p>
