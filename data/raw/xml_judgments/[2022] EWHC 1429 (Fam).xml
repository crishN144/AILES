	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter was first listed for a two day hearing on 17 February 2022. That hearing could not proceed as there was a lack of clarity as to whether the six statements filed by the mother had been signed or needed to be interpreted or read to her. The mother required an interpreter at the hearing. In the end I had to adjourn that hearing and direct that the mother filed an additional statement which addressed the way the statements had been prepared. Part 22 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, together with Practice Direction 22A, make it clear what the requirement are for statements in such circumstances, with the need for clarity in the declaration at the end of the statement whether it has been read to or interpreted to the maker of the statement. Inevitable delay will happen in hearing these cases if that basic requirement of the rules is not adhered to.</p>

Those missing messages not only needed to be produced (amounting to 43 pages) but the mother needed an opportunity to consider them, which resulted in a further adjournment until 13 April 2022.</p>

There was a further trip to Germany with just X and the father between 31 October and 24 November 2018, the mother did not accept X went on this trip.

In July there are similar message exchanges, with the mother expressing her increasing frustration at X not returning to Uganda. In the messages the father refers to business reasons preventing him from returning to Uganda. In his oral evidence he said it was also due to his concerns about the implications for X as the father had understood the mother had commenced a same sex relationship in Uganda. In August the mother accuses the father in one of the messages of taking her son from her, the father responds denying this saying the mother will get him soon.</p>

In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance, the judge will have to consider whether, to adopt what Black LJ said in&#160;Re K, "the evidence before the court enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that the allegations give rise to an Article 13(b) risk". In making this determination, and to explain what I meant in&#160;Re C, I would endorse what MacDonald J said in&#160;Uhd v McKay (Abduction: Publicity)[2019] 2 FLR 1159, at [7], namely that "the assumptions made by the court with respect to the&#160;maximum level of risk&#160;must be reasoned and reasonable assumptions" (my emphasis).

This is a broad analysis because, for example, the situation faced by the child on returning to their home state might be different because the parents will be living apart. But, the court must carefully consider whether and how the risk can be addressed or sufficiently ameliorated so that the child will not be exposed to a grave risk within the scope of Article 13(b).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Papazian contends it is agreed, as a matter of fact, that X was living in Germany with the father from May 2019 until he came to this country in September 2020. In those circumstances he lived with the father for an extended period of time, was well integrated into life in Germany, as evidenced by the photos relied up by the father, in an environment that was already familiar to him due to his many previous visits. Ms Papazian submits it is simply unrealistic to suggest X&#8217;s habitual residence was otherwise than in Germany, the focus of the factual analysis should be on the child&#8217;s life which for eighteen months was based entirely in Germany until September 2020. She submits X&#8217;s habitual residence remained there, as on the father&#8217;s case the time in this jurisdiction was only time limited from September 2020. The WhatsApp communications in 2019 between the parents give mixed messages, but when read as a whole are equally consistent with the mother wanting the father to bring X to visit her in Uganda. The reality for X is his life was based in Germany during this time and that is where his habitual residence is. That habitual residence was not disturbed by what the father states was a time limited stay with the mother in September 2020, initially to Christmas 2020 then extended to July 2021 to ensure X was back in Germany to start school.</p>

This is supported by the inconsistent accounts the father has given about the situation in 2018, initially saying that was when X moved to Germany. She submits the letter written in May 2018 by the mother, consenting to a one month trip, and the messages in 2019 do not support the father&#8217;s case about the agreement between the parties. There are repeated messages from the mother asking for X to be returned. In those circumstances, where the mother continued making repeated requests for X&#8217;s return to Uganda, the court should be cautious about concluding X&#8217;s habitual residence was in Germany at the time these proceedings started. Ms Jones recognises that the mother did not communicate to the father when she came to England, and when she did it was not a truthful account as to when she came and the circumstances. Ms Jones submits X&#8217;s habitual residence is in England based on what she says is the agreement reached between the parties in September 2020 for X to move here to live with her.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with the question of habitual residence first. Having considered the written and oral evidence of the parties I have reached the conclusion there was no settled agreement between the parties for X to come and live in Germany with the father in either 2018 or 2019. It is very likely that was what the father wanted and in his own mind considered that was the right thing for X. The messages during the relevant period and the documents signed by the mother in connection with securing child benefit in Germany are not determinative of the position, as the father seeks to suggest. They are equally consistent with the mother&#8217;s position that she agreed to X having dual citizenship. Whilst there is no issue that X was likely to spend some time in Germany, the father thought it would be on a far more settled basis than the mother. The dynamics between the parties in the messages and oral evidence are important to bear in mind. In my judgment they make it clear the father was the more dominant and forceful character, both financially and otherwise. He expressed himself in forceful and resolute terms, often referring to X as his child and had very fixed views about the need to comply with what he saw was the agreement they reached at the time of X&#8217;s birth. This somewhat fixed view was illustrated in his oral evidence about what the arrangements would be if the court did order X&#8217;s return, there was no question in his mind that X would need to live with him and could see his mother. There seemed little room for reflection about X&#8217;s position and the impact on him of such a change having spent such a long period of time in the care of the mother. The father could only view the position through an adult lens. The mother, in my judgment, was more compliant and effectively did what the father asked her to do, which included signing the relevant forms sent to her by the father in German. Economically she was the weaker partner and during the relevant period appeared reliant on requesting and receiving payments from the father. The messages during the relevant period in 2019 make it clear the mother was making repeated requests for X to be returned to Uganda to her care, which is inconsistent with the account given by the father that X living with him in Germany was an agreed plan from birth. It may have been what the father wanted but it was not, in my judgment, one agreed to by the mother. The father ignored those repeated pleas by the mother for X to be returned to Uganda, he did not produce those messages when he prepared his first statements thereby giving an unbalanced picture as to what the actual position was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The intention of the parents is but one factor to take into account regarding habitual residence. I need to consider the position from X&#8217;s perspective. By the time these proceedings had been commenced he had lived in Germany since May 2019. There is no issue that he remained living with the father, was living in an environment that was familiar to him, he was not in school but there is some evidence from the father in his statements of their day to day life, the activities and visits they undertook. The father&#8217;s older child, D, appeared to be part of the network for X as he accompanied the father and X when they came to England in September 2020. There was clearly some integration in a social and family environment. It also has to be recognised that, unbeknown to the father, the mother had left Uganda in early 2020, come to England and had sought asylum here on the basis that it is not safe for her to return to Uganda. She misled the father in her messages in July 2020 when she told the father she had a visa to come to the UK, implying she was still in Uganda which she now accepts was not the case. The mother does not actively assert that H&#8217;s habitual residence is retained in Uganda, a jurisdiction she no longer lives in and does not seek to return to.</p>

In my judgment, whilst a relevant consideration, such a narrow view fails to take into account the wider canvas the court is required to consider, one that is more focussed on the situation of the child.</p>

The order dated 2 July 2021 raises the issue of jurisdiction and records the father <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;submits to the jurisdiction of the Court and the Court ordering the father to confirm this in writing, after taking legal advice if he so wishes&#8217;.</span> The order dated 2 August 2021 records the father stating that he <span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;submits to the jurisdiction of the UK Courts and confirmed this in writing to the Court which unfortunately did not reach the Judge or the Mother&#8217;s solicitors&#8217;.</span> The issues in those proceedings were recorded as being the mother&#8217;s wish for X to live with her here and the father seeking for X to reside with him in Germany. Directions were made for statements to be filed by the parties the completion of a report from Cafcass and the matter was listed for further directions on 5 November 2021. At a hearing on 19 October 2021 the father was legally represented, the order recorded the father informing the court he misunderstood the position regarding jurisdiction when he had not been legally represented and that jurisdiction should be considered in the context of proceedings under the Hague Convention. The court determined the issue of jurisdiction needed to be considered and listed the matter for a hearing on 5 November 2021 to determine jurisdiction. At the hearing on 5 November 2021 the court was informed of the application by the father to the Central Authority in Germany and that solicitors had been instructed here to issue proceedings under Article 12 seeking the return of X to Germany under the Hague Convention. Those proceedings were then stayed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that despite my findings about the lack of an agreement between the parents that X should move and live in Germany as the father suggests, the fact is X did go to Germany in May 2019 and remained living there until September 2020. The father&#8217;s action was unilateral in taking and keeping him there, despite the regular requests for him to be returned by the mother. However, from X&#8217;s perspective his day to day life was in Germany, living with his father and undertaking the events the father has described. Although there is limited evidence of significant integration in the wider community I am satisfied there was some integration. X&#8217;s habitual residence was in Germany and remained so, subject to any defences being established by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the circumstances of X coming to this jurisdiction in September 2020. In the lead up to that trip the messages exchanged between the parties refer to it in the context of being a visit. That is supported by X coming here on a return ticket. Discussions followed once they arrived which led to X staying for a longer period. The father&#8217;s account is that the agreement was until Christmas/January 2021 and that is largely supported by the messages exchanged in the autumn of 2020. The mother suggested a longer period until what she described in some messages as her &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">process&#8217;</span> is done, indicating that she understood the arrangement was for a longer period of time but does not suggest it was a permanent move as her statements suggest. It seems clear that the original agreement was for it to be time limited, probably until Christmas 2020/January 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the period was extended by a combination of the Covid restrictions and the opportunity for X to attend school here. The messages refer to X starting school here in early 2021, with the father maintaining his position that X should attend school in Germany starting in September 2021. The father continued to take steps towards enrolment at school in Germany for X. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For consent to be established the agreement needs to be clear, unequivocal and communicated between the parties. That was not the position here. The initial period was time limited to Christmas/January 2021 and whilst it was extended, it was always in the context that X would return to attend school in Germany. Whilst I accept that was not what the mother wanted, consent can&#8217;t operate in a unilateral way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Jones does not press the defence that the father acquiesced to X remaining here. She is right to do so in the light of the messages the court has seen and the proceedings issued in Newcastle with the recordings about the father&#8217;s position on jurisdiction. The proceedings issued by the mother are inconsistent with her case on consent and acquiescence and more consistent with taking a pre-emptive step as she knew it was a time limited period. The father was unrepresented in the Newcastle proceedings and there is little information that he was made aware of his remedies under the 1980 Hague Convention (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v R (Residence Order: Child Abduction) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 625" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 625</ref>). The messages exchanged between the parties are consistent and make clear the father&#8217;s position was maintained that the end date would be when X should return to Germany in order to enable him to attend school there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the question of Art 13 b, I am satisfied that defence is not made out. Ms Muller&#8217;s evidence has mapped out a way the mother can accompany and remain with X in Germany, which is what she said in her evidence she would do if the court ordered X&#8217;s return. She could make an asylum application in Germany that would not be adversely impacted by her claim here not being determined.  Ms Cronin&#8217;s note stated that if the mother travels to Germany whilst her asylum application here is outstanding, that application will be treated as withdrawn and will be discontinued. The evidence establishes that there would be state financial support for the mother, supplemented by the undertakings the father is prepared to give (as set out in paragraph 39 of his statement dated 27 January 2022) to ensure that she has accommodation and financial support on their arrival. X should remain in the mother&#8217;s care in Germany (as proposed in the father&#8217;s undertaking), with agreed time being spent with the father until the relevant court in Germany makes any order to the contrary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From X&#8217;s perspective he has now spent significant periods of time in the care of each parent. This court having reached its conclusion within these proceedings I urge the parents to re-focus on X and to actively consider engaging in mediation to try and reach agreement or narrow issues between them. If they can&#8217;t reach agreement, court proceedings will need to be commenced in Germany to determine what future arrangements meet X&#8217;s welfare needs to bring about some stability in the future care arrangements for him. This will ensure he can benefit from maintaining his important relationship with both of his parents in a way that prevents unilateral action being taken by either parent again.</p>
