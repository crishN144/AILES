	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute that at the time when N was removed from Poland by her mother on 8 December 2020, the father had, and was exercising, rights of custody. N&#8217;s removal from Poland will only be wrongful for the purpose of Art.3 of the Convention if she was habitually resident in Poland at the relevant time.  It is for the father to prove this essential factual prerequisite on the balance of probabilities.  If N was not habitually resident in Poland at that time, Art.3 is not satisfied and the father&#8217;s application for summary return under the Hague Convention fails.  If N was habitually resident in Poland at the relevant time, Art.3 is satisfied and her removal will have been wrongful. Pursuant to Art.12 where a child has been wrongfully removed for the purposes of Art.3 and at the date of the commencement of the proceedings, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal, the court must order the return of the child forthwith unless it is satisfied that one of a limited number of tightly defined exceptions apply.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">the mother planned to stay with N in Poland for one week only. The mother and N were very used to visiting these family members for family events, holidays, and medical treatment.  N had done so with her mother on a number of occasions over the lengthy period of time (some years) that she had been living in England.  For example: from February 2019 to 13 March 2019, the mother and N were in Poland for one month for medical treatment;  between 17 August 2019 and 1 September 2019, the mother, father, and N were in Poland for a holiday for two weeks; between 22 September 2019 and 27 September 2019, the mother and N were in Poland to attend a funeral; in February 2020, the mother, father, and N were in Poland for a holiday; they travelled out again on 3 February 2020.  (the father, believes they did so in January 2020, not February 2020).  The father returned to England after this holiday on 10 February 2020.  The mother and N returned after two weeks on 17 February 2020.  The mother, father, and N visited Poland for a further holiday for two weeks from 19 August 2020.  By this time, they clearly had difficulties in their marriage.  Mother and N stayed with her parents.  The father stayed with his parents.  The mother, father, and N all returned to England after that holiday.</p>
