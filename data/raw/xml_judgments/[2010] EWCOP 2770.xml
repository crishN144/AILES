	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In this case, the parties are the Claimant ("the mother"), a local authority ("the Local Authority"), the second Defendant (&#8220;the son&#8221;) who appears through his litigation friend the Official Solicitor, a NHS Trust and a Primary Care Trust.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The Primary Care Trust is not represented.  The reason for the non-attendance at this stage of the Primary Care Trust is that they are not directly concerned with the relief sought by both the mother and the son based on the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and, thus, Convention rights against the first and third Defendants (the Local Authority and the NHS Trust).</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Those arguments and claims are founded on events which took place in late 2007/early 2008.  In brief and broad terms, they are that (i) the son was taken to hospital, as I understand it by his mother, and (ii)  he was not, however, returned home from the hospital but was moved from that hospital to a placement, the identity of which was kept from the mother.  There is much more to the events around that time, but that is the nub of what happened.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The son is now in his mid 20s.  He has a complex set of needs and has been the subject of a high degree of assistance throughout his life concerning his mobility and personal care.  It is common ground that he lacks capacity to determine his own best interests in respect of issues relating to where he should live, his general care, his health care, community provision and matters of contact with his family.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">From his birth the son lived with his family.  Up to 2003, as I understand it, his brother was a member of the household.  His brother suffered from autism. After the brother left the household the son remained in the day-to-day care of his mother.  He also, I understand, has a sister.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The son's claim relies on Convention rights. It is advanced by his litigation friend, the Official Solicitor, based on the events I have referred to primarily and unsurprisingly by reference to Articles 5 and 8. The mother's claims rely primarily on Article 8, but also there are aspects of it, relating to consultation, which rely on Article 6.  The same sequence of events is relied on by both the son and the mother in the points of claim that have been directed and served.  Central to the relevant sequence of events, as I have mentioned, is the removal of the son from hospital and his placement away from home in February 2008.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Both the mother and the son identify their claims as being ones that they bring in the Court of Protection in reliance on section 7(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act.  As I have already indicated, the fourth defendant, the Primary Care Trust, has taken no part before me today.  The other three Defendants have and they assert that, as a matter of jurisdiction, the Court of Protection cannot hear and deal with (a) all of the mother's Convention rights claim; and (b) the son's claim for damages under the Human Rights Act, leaving his claim for declaratory relief in the Court of Protection.  So the position is that those three defendants join together in advancing the jurisdictional argument.  As a result of that position the Official Solicitor, on behalf of the son, accepts and asserts that on further reflection and consideration the claim for damages presently advanced on behalf of the son is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection and therefore he invites me to transfer it to the Queen's Bench Division.</span></p>

First, looking at the position so far as the son's claim is concerned, what is sought is a transfer of the damages claim to the Queen's Bench Division.  So far as the mother's claims are concerned, the Local Authority -- and in this the Local Authority is joined by the NHS Trust and the Official Solicitor because this is their jurisdictional argument &#8211;what is sought is an order that the whole of the mother's claim should be struck out.</span></p>

It seems to me that that is plainly the right position for the Local Authority to take given the history of the case generally, the timing of the claims and the stay within the Court of Protection proceedings.  As was accepted on behalf of the Local Authority in response to my enquiry, the practical consequence of success in their application to strike out would be that the mother would issue proceedings in the Queen's Bench Division, seeking a declaration and damages under the Human Rights Act relying on events which would remain the subject of the proceedings within the Court of Protection (a) in the context of the son's claim for declaratory relief under the Human Rights Act (which it is accepted the court has jurisdiction to deal with), and (b) subject to further directions and case management decisions of the court, as being relevant to the best interests decisions to be made by the court relating to the son's future care.</span></p>

Indeed, in this context counsel for both the mother and the Local Authority indicated to me that they both maintain that those matters would need to be ventilated before the court in the context of the best interests decision.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">So, on one level, the dispute before me is academic because it seems to me that on the hypothesis that the arguments of the Defendants are correct, the management of what would then be three sets of proceedings would have to ensure that the public purse and the parties were not put to the expense of litigating the same issues of fact in three different sets of proceedings.  That could be done by hearing the proceedings together. But, in any event and only looking at the position by reference to the son&#8217;s claim, it would be, to my mind, a very strange result if the fact finding exercise in both the Court of Protection proceedings and the Queen's Bench proceedings did not run concurrently. If that is so there would, it seems, be no sense in the mother&#8217;s claim being heard separately. </span></p>

But, in any event, the need to manage and deal with what is relevant to the best interests decision, and whether or not aspects of the Convention rights claimed can be excluded is something which it seems to me the relevant courts would have to grapple with and give appropriate directions in respect of.  So, as I indicated earlier on, it seems to me that the points raised on this application are essentially academic subject to court management, save for the point (which I immediately acknowledge) that jurisdictional points can never be so described. If the court does not, or, arguably does not, have jurisdiction, the court itself would have to take the point. And it is therefore appropriate for the three Defendants (being two public bodies, and the other represented by the Official Solicitor) to draw attention to the jurisdictional points argued before me.</span></p>

I start with the common ground that the Court of Protection has jurisdiction to deal with the son's claim based on Convention rights, and that, in reliance on his Convention rights, the son can seek relief by way of a declaration in these proceedings.  The route to that conclusion is found in sections 7(1)(b) and 8(1) of the Human Rights Act and section 15(1)(c) of the Mental Capacity Act.  These sections identify what has become a well trodden path that is, for example, identified and explained by Munby J (as he then was) in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re L (Care Proceedings) Human Rights Claims</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 160" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 160</ref>.

I ask myself whether in this case the mother is seeking a declaration as to the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done in relation to her son.  The answer to my mind is plainly yes, she is.  The relevant acts were directed to the son.  He was the person who was in hospital.  He was the person who was placed elsewhere in circumstances that are complained of.  I do not dispute the point made on behalf of the Defendants by reference to the relevant primary purpose, namely the creation of a new statutory court which is given jurisdiction to consider and deal with issues concerning the best interests of P.

They often have families who are directly involved in decision making concerning, them and in their day to day care.  There is no doubt that the mother is a necessary party to the best interests decisions that are made in respect of, and on behalf of, her son.  Article 8 rights relate to and introduce a consideration of the impact of events on and between the members of a family and their relationships (see for example in the context of immigration </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Beuko Betts v SSHD</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/39" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 39" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 39</ref></span>,<span style="font-size:12pt"> and cases in the Family courts often raise points in the context of Article 8 that relate to the interplay between the relevant rights and interests of the members of a family).  Can it therefore be said that Parliament was intending that if a set of events occurs that impact the Article 8 rights of the members of the family of a person who lacks capacity, and those events are properly described as being an act or acts done in relation to the person who lacks capacity (P), the Court of Protection should not have jurisdiction to make declarations as to the lawfulness of such acts by reference to the Convention rights of, and on the application of, those members of the family?  To my mind the answer to that question &#8220;No&#8221;, and that consideration of this question indicates that an ability (and thus a jurisdiction) to deal with such issues is within a secondary purpose of the legislation.</span></p>

The point has no relevance in the context of the son because he is &#8220;P&#8221; and does not need permission to make any application.  The point arises in this way: does the mother, if the court has jurisdiction, need permission to make her application?  But it has only been touched on (and so not fully argued) before me and in my view it takes the essential argument before me no further.  This is because, if there is no need for that permission, it seems to me, (and this was accepted to my mind correctly on behalf of the mother), that the court has more than ample armoury to ensure that its process is not incorrectly or inappropriately used for the determination of a freestanding claim under the Human Rights Act, either by P or by, in this case the mother of P, or any outsider.  Within that armoury is the ability to stay, the ability to transfer and importantly the ability to case manage applying the provisions of the Rules and the overriding objective.</span></p>

What that case shows, (and indeed this flows from an examination of section 8 of the Human Rights Act itself), is that damages under the Human Rights Act are not recoverable as of right as, for example, are damages in tort or for breach of contract, but are to give just satisfaction if, applying an equitable approach, the court considers that to be the right result.

They may have been driven to the conclusion that is urged upon me, but the whole force of that court&#8217;s reasoning is that the damages are generally quite small and proportionality issues are ones which drove their conclusions on the procedural approach.</span></p>

A feature, it seems to me, of section 8(2) of the Human Rights Act is that it is looking at the general powers of the relevant English court and, in the context of the Human Rights Act, it would be circular to argue that as a court has power under the Human Rights Act to award damages section 8(2) is satisfied.  </span></p>

In broad terms, it seems to me, that the jurisdiction and power to award damages in those courts derives from the subject matter of cases that the court has jurisdiction to deal with.  Examples are contract, tort, trespass and there are many others, all of which are civil claims.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It was then said that a power to award damages is not ancillary to the making of a declaration or facilitative of the making of a declaration.  I would not quarrel with that, but first it seems to me that &#8220;the making of a declaration&#8221; is not an accurate description of the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection.  The Court of Protection's relevant jurisdiction in this case is jurisdiction under the Human Rights Act.  It seems do me that the natural reading of section 47(1) in that context is that in exercising its jurisdiction (under the Human Rights Act or indeed the Mental Capacity Act) the Court of Protection has the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court would have when it is exercising its jurisdiction (under the Human Rights Act and generally) and, therefore, the Court of Protection has an ability to award damages under the Human Rights Act because the High Court can do so under s. 8(2) thereof because of its jurisdiction to award damages in civil claims.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In my view, that argument does not have the circularity of an argument that section 8(2) is satisfied because a court has jurisdiction under the Human Rights Act and thus the power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> to award damages.  This is because the argument looks outside the Human Rights Act and asks the &#8220;what if&#8221; question set by s. 47 of the Mental Capacity Act namely what could the High Court do if it was exercising the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Protection by the Mental Capacity Act and the Human Rights Act.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">But if that argument is wrong, in my view, an alternative route to the same answer is to consider whether the Court of Protection, by section 47, is given a power to award damages in respect of something other than a breach of a Convention right. In my view it does. For example, to my mind, in reliance upon section 47, the Court of Protection could award damages pursuant to an undertaking in damages given to it when an injunction was granted.  Also, by reason of section 50 of the Senior Courts Act, it would have a power which, probably, would never be exercised in the welfare jurisdiction, and which might only be exercised rarely in the property jurisdiction, to award damages in lieu of an injunction.  That is one of the specific powers of the High Court that listed in the relevant provisions in the Senior Courts Act.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">So this alternative analysis and reasoning for the result that section 8(2) of the Human Rights Act is satisfied looks to, and relies on, powers of the Court of Protection (in connection with its jurisdiction and by reference to the powers of the High Court) to award damages other than under the Human Rights Act.</span></p>

To my mind, for reasons I have already explained in the context of permission to bring such a claim, the Court of Protection and the other parties have ample abilities to protect themselves from such approaches being taken by family members, just as the Court of Protection and the other parties have ample powers and ability to protect themselves from any members of the family seeking to use Court of Protection proceedings as a means of getting around judicial review, for example, in the context of the points that the Court of Protection makes choices between care plans / packages that are offered by, or are enforceable against, the relevant public authorities and a best interests declaration does not compel a public authority to act in accordance with it. </span></p>

Experience in this court, and in the Family court, shows me that when a parent and a Local Authority have fallen out issues relating to the parting of the ways are difficult to exclude from the best interests arguments and, to my mind, there is certainly a risk that if family members of a person (P) who is the subject of proceedings in the Court of Protection are not entitled to air their points under the Convention within the best interests process, that will escalate the problems on the ground and cause those family members to fail to face up to the realities of the situation that choices have to be made for their loved ones between the various options that are available,  usually at public expense.</span></p>

There is no need for me to order a transfer of the son's damages claim to the Queen Bench Division.  I will, however, direct that when the matter comes before me in December I shall treat as being before me proceedings in the Queen's Bench Division, in respect of both the mother's entire Human Rights Act claim and the son's claim for damages, I dispense with the service of any document in the context of that direction and direct that the evidence and pleadings (in the sense of the Points of Claim and Defence) shall stand as pleadings and evidence in the Queen&#8217;s Bench proceedings.  My reason  for doing that is not to indicate any concern or worry as to my conclusion on jurisdiction, but to ensure that if this decision on  jurisdiction is successfully appealed, or in the future in another case my conclusion on jurisdiction is found to be wrong, any award made in these proceedings will have a jurisdictional base.</span></p>

The relevant application that was before me was an application by the Local Authority to strike out the mother&#8217;s Human Rights Act claim.  The NHS Trust were not joint applicants, but the relief sought was to remove the claim of the mother against both of them so that if the relief sought was granted both the Local Authority and the NHS Trust would not be facing a Human Rights Act claim brought by the mother within these proceedings.</span></p>

His concern was the legal points which arose in the context of that application; namely whether or not there was jurisdiction for the court to deal with the son's Convention rights claim for damages, which I have dealt with in the main judgment.  It seems to me that the appropriate order so far as the Official Solicitor is concerned is that the son&#8217;s costs of and in respect of the strike out application should be reserved.</span></p>

I deal with that first as a matter of principle.  It seems to me that there are competing arguments.  One is that the issues raised were jurisdictional and therefore had to be raised in proceedings funded by the taxpayer through different budgetary processes.  The other is that the Local Authority and the NHS Trust took a stance that this claim should be struck out on a preliminary basis without, so far as I can see and I have not been referred to, any consideration whatsoever of what would then happen and how the relevant issues would be case managed if the applications succeeded.  These are points flagged up in the skeleton argument on behalf of the Claimant and are points which I have already made.</span></p>

That approach seems to be the foundation of the Local Authority&#8217;s decision to issue and pursue the application, and the NHS Trust&#8217;s decision to support the application, albeit very sensibly not adding to the costs of the process by themselves putting in a skeleton argument or advancing oral argument.</span></p>
