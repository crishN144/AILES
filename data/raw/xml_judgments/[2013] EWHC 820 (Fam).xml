	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">  This matter concerns an application by the maternal grandmother (N), for the adoption of her grandchildren (T and Y) aged 9, and 3. She originally applied for a residence order jointly with her husband, the maternal grandfather. However, they separated in February 2011 and he has played no role in the proceedings since. He was discharged as a party in February 2012. The Respondents to the application are the children&#8217;s father, (B), and the children themselves, through their Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>

His earliest possible release date is 2023 when the children will be 19 and 14, but he may be eligible for home leave in 2020 when the children will be 16 and 11.

The hearing could not be concluded and was adjourned part heard, in part due to the Deputy District Judge&#8217;s concerns, correctly in my judgment, that there needed to be further specialist assessment. It took six months to return back to the Deputy District Judge, and then only following a specific application to list the matter. He made the children parties and listed the matter before a full time District Judge, with a direction that the parties provide information regarding specialist experts. Directions were made in January 2011 and the matter listed for hearing in June 2011, unfortunately the court of its own volition re-listed the matter in September. </p>

According to the statement from the Service Manager ,for the area, for Children and Young People, the local authority were not notified of this order until early October and a letter was written to the court seeking an extension until December. This was followed by a further request to extension to early January. The report was filed after that. The report did not address the matters it was directed to, despite being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;quality assured&#8217;</span>, and a further report had to be directed and was filed at the end of February, some 4 and a half months after it was originally directed. I am quite satisfied the obligation is on the party seeking an extension of time to apply for one (in the absence of any other direction being given by the court). The court had made an order and the expectation is that it will be complied with.</p>

The statement from the Service Manager addresses the delays. Whilst there was some delay in the Local Authority being notified of orders I am quite satisfied that the main delays have been caused by the non-compliance of the Local Authority with court orders through inefficient or inadequate internal organisation or systems, or the authors of the reports, including those who &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">quality assure&#8217;</span> them, not being of a sufficient calibre or having adequate training to undertake the work required. In relation to incorrect information given to the court regarding the medical assessments of the children, the Service Manager stated the legal representative who attended court in January informed her he obtained the information from the relevant Team Manager, who now works in Australia. In my judgment it is clear up until 25 February 2013 this Local Authority repeatedly failed in its obligations to the court and these children. There were repeated failures to comply with court orders and the information that was provided failed to properly address the relevant issues.</p>

The grandmother&#8217;s brother is the father&#8217;s father; the children&#8217;s parents were first cousins. The children live with the grandmother and maternal aunts and uncles. They have contact with another maternal aunt who lives nearby with her husband and son, and their great maternal aunts who also live nearby. In the event of an adoption order their maternal grandmother would become their adoptive mother. Their aunts and uncles would become their legal half siblings. The paternal grandfather would become their paternal uncle and the father their first cousin. Following the death of the mother the grandmother has severed all contact with her brother and his family. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Another important factor is the concern the grandmother has about the father seeking to exercise his parental responsibility.

However it is necessary to look at the reality of what the father&#8217;s position is. In my judgment it is quite clear from the various reports that, despite the passage of time, the father has not begun to properly accept responsibility for his actions in relation to the mother and the maternal family, or to begin to properly comprehend the impact of his actions on the children. There is a clear thread that runs through his comments to the various professionals that demonstrate, in reality, he can only look at the position through his own interests and rights.

His attitude provides little security to the grandmother, who will be providing for all the children&#8217;s needs in the long term. Whilst it is correct to observe he may not get leave to make any application, his attitude is clear, he is more likely than not to take any opportunity to do so.

In particular the psychiatric report, the pre-sentence report and the sentencing remarks from the Crown Court.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.03in;text-indent:0.09in">The grandmother has carefully considered the consequences of adoption and the lifelong nature of adoption. They have been explained to her by the senior practitioner from the adoption team, as set out in detail in the special guardianship report. She understands the change to the children&#8217;s birth certificate would mean that the mother&#8217;s name and details would be removed. She does not plan to change the children&#8217;s names.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.03in;text-indent:0.09in">In her most recent statement the grandmother deals with the religious objections raised by the father to an adoption order. She sets out very clearly how she sees the adoption of the children by her in the circumstances of this case (where she does not intend to change the names, and where any limited inheritance consequences can be covered by putting arrangements in place). She is satisfied, in the circumstances of this case, with the arrangements that would be put in place by her, that adoption is acceptable under Islamic law. I agree. This is endorsed by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, who says he is confident the family can manage this with sensitivity and support.</p>

For the reasons outlined above it is the order that best meets their long term welfare needs. In those circumstances, I will dispense with the father&#8217;s consent as the welfare needs of each of the children, in my judgment, demand I do so.</p>

The grandmother&#8217;s agreement to the indirect contact can be recorded. The grandmother fears that a defined order would be seen by the father as a green light to his future involvement in the children&#8217;s lives, that would be contrary to their future welfare and stability for the reasons outlined above. </p>

This lack of judicial continuity, combined with a Local Authority that has, in my judgment, failed on repeated occasions in their obligations to these children or to comply with court orders resulted in unacceptable delays that have been detrimental to the welfare of these children. This has caused additional stress to the maternal family who stepped in to care for the children at a time of unimaginable crisis for them all, following the murder of the children&#8217;s mother. </p>
