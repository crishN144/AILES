	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the latest application in a bitterly contested private law (Hague Convention) dispute.

In the first of those judgments I explained why I had dismissed an application by Her Majesty&#8217;s Solicitor General for the committal to prison of the first respondent (the mother) for breach of an order made by Hedley J on 9 October 2012 requiring the mother, amongst other things, to return the second respondent (Jessica) and her younger brother Tomas (Tomas) to Spain. In the second judgment I explained why I was making a further order requiring the mother to return Jessica and Tomas to Spain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The time for compliance with the order I made on 21 August 2013 has expired. Neither Jessica nor Tomas has returned to Spain. The father, by application dated 29 January 2014, seeks the committal of the mother for breach of my order. The mother denies that she is in contempt. Put very shortly, her case, as set out in her statement dated 28 February 2014, is that it has been &#8220;impossible&#8221; for her to compel Jessica and Tomas to return to Spain. As a matter of law, it is not for her to prove this assertion; it is for the father to disprove it and, moreover, to the criminal standard of proof: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Abduction: Contempt)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/1138" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 1138" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 1138</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 FLR 1</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Re L-W (Enforcement and Committal: Contact), CPL v CH-W and Others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/1253" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 1253" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 1253</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1095" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1095</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Jones </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2579" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing of the father&#8217;s application had been listed, in accordance with directions I gave, for hearing on 6 March 2014. Very shortly before the hearing, notice was given by solicitors for Jessica that she wished to take part and be represented at the hearing of the committal application. Mr David Williams QC appeared on her behalf to make that application. His application was supported by Mr Christopher Hames on behalf of the mother but resisted by Mr James Turner QC and Mr Edward Devereux on behalf of the father. After hearing argument I decided that Jessica should participate as a party to the committal proceedings. That necessitated an adjournment of the hearing, which was re-fixed for 30 April 2014. I now give judgment explaining my decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Jessica and Tomas were joined as parties to the Hague proceedings in January 2013 and were represented by CAFCASS legal at the hearing before me on 21 August 2013: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Jones (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2730" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2730 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2730 (Fam)</ref>. This gave rise to a dispute between Mr Williams and Mr Turner as to whether this meant that Jessica was already and in any event a party to the committal application. Mr Williams said that she was: the committal application was made within the Hague proceedings, as shown by the fact that it shared the same number. Mr Turner begged to differ: the committal application was a discrete matter even though brought within the same proceedings. The point, although no doubt of some technical interest, seemed to me to be arid, for if Mr Williams turned out to be correct in his submission Mr Turner&#8217;s riposte would no doubt have been an application to have Jessica removed as a party. I therefore declined to consider this preliminary point &#8211; a point on which, I make clear, I express no views at all &#8211; so that we could all concentrate on the substantive question of whether or not Jessica should participate as a party to the committal proceedings. I turn, accordingly, to the real matter of controversy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The basis of Jessica&#8217;s application was set out by Mr Williams in his skeleton argument and elaborated by him in oral submissions. Her reasons for wishing to participate are threefold: first, she says that it is her own refusal to return to Spain that has resulted in my order not being complied with, and she does not want to see her mother being held responsible for that; second, she says that the impact on her personally if her mother were to be imprisoned at this crucial stage in her education (with GCSEs looming) would be hugely significant; third, she wishes to participate in any renewed attempt the father might make to enforce the order for her return to Spain, for it is, she says, unfair to her, as indeed to Tomas, to continue to seek their return despite what she says are their strong and long-held objections to returning. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Williams on her behalf bolsters the last two points by submitting that use of coercive measures against the mother is coercion of Jessica: she is directly affected by what happens to the mother both because, she says, she bears responsibility for not returning and also because of the impact on her of what is happening to the mother. He points to <span style="font-style:italic">Shaw v Hungary (Application No 6457/09) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 1314" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 1314</ref>, where the Strasbourg court cautioned against the use of coercive measures against children. He submits that the continuing efforts to secure her return (and that of Tomas) have become disproportionate, not least bearing in mind what he says is the cumulative toll the process is taking on her and on her relationship with her mother. He points in this context to what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Abduction: Committal) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/1196" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 1196" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 1196</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 133" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 133</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More generally, Mr Williams submits that Jessica&#8217;s own Article 8 rights are engaged, not merely at the point when her mother comes to be sentenced if contempt is proved but also at the prior stage when the issue of contempt falls to be determined. He points to Articles 3.1 and 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, in particular Article 12.2 which provides that:</p>

I say nothing about FPR 12.3(1), which applies only where the proceedings are for an order under the Hague Convention, but each of the other two provisions upon which Mr Williams relies would appear to be apt.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turner accepts that Jessica&#8217;s Article 8 rights are engaged at the sentencing stage but questions whether they are engaged at any earlier stage in the committal proceedings, referring in this connection to <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 WLR 1911" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 WLR 1911</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 FLR 1075" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 FLR 1075</ref>. More fundamentally, he submits that Jessica&#8217;s proper role in the committal proceedings is as a witness rather than a party. Whether in relation to the question of contempt, or in relation to subsequent mitigation, if that point is reached, Jessica can, he says, be called as a witness by the mother. If for any reason the mother does not call her then, he says, I can call her myself. I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that on this last point he is correct.</p>

It should not, he submits, be a matter of routine (the word used by Lord Wilson in para 53) and in most cases (the phrase used by Lord Wilson in para 47) something short of party status will, he submits, be sufficient. More specifically, he questions whether it is in Jessica&#8217;s best interests to be involved in this particular issue as a party. He points to what Lord Wilson said, para 48:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I entirely agree, but it all depends, of course, upon the circumstances of the particular case. In the present case, most unhappily for all, and most of all for the children, including Jessica and Tomas, it is hard to imagine that matters can get any worse. In January 2013, Theis J had referred to &#8220;this fractured family&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Cambra v Jones</span>, para 54. Positions, including the positions of Jessica and Tomas, are now seemingly polarised and immovable. It may be entirely the responsibility of the mother, who Theis J found to have &#8220;fundamentally let down&#8221; her children and &#8220;abdicated her parental responsibility&#8221; for them, but the fact is that Jessica and Tomas have long since been drawn into their parents&#8217; battles, both their battles at home and their battles in court. That, sadly, is a reality which I cannot ignore.</p>

I must of course consider what is in her best interests. But I have to ask myself whether it can really be in her best interests to shut her out from participating in proceedings which, whether or not they engage her Article 8 rights, affect her very profoundly for all the reasons which she, and Mr Williams on her behalf, have articulated, and which she is so very anxious to be able to participate in.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">I respectfully agree. In all the circumstances, it is in my judgment overwhelmingly clear that Jessica&#8217;s best interests are served by enabling her to participate as she would wish rather than preventing her.</p>

To adopt some words used by Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">In re LC</span>, para 54, Jessica&#8217;s evidence &#8220;is evidence which, although the mother might have a valuable perspective on it, neither of the parents can give&#8221; and Jessica &#8220;has a standpoint incapable of being represented by either of the adult parties.&#8221;</p>
