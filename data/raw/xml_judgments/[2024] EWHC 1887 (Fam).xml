M is a dual British and Israeli citizen. She was born in Israel and move to the UK in 1994 when she was 12 or 13 years old. They are both in their early forties. Both are Jewish. They met in 2001 in England, and married in 2004. In 2008, their oldest child, Z, was born; she is nearly 16 years old and is not a subject of these proceedings. In 2014, X was born.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In February 2023 the family decided to emigrate to New Zealand after 19 years in England, in part because of their deteriorating financial situation.  On M&#8217;s case, she was reluctant to move and leave behind a vibrant Jewish life in England and the children&#8217;s excellent schools, as well as her beloved mother. It also seems that X was not keen on leaving England. Z, by contrast, was very enthusiastic. They put their home in England on the market for sale. F received a registration from the Medical Science Council to allow him to practise as an anaesthetic technician in New Zealand. Schools in New Zealand were contacted. They looked at job opportunities (in M&#8217;s case as a music teacher). They gave notice on the children&#8217;s English schools. They looked online at properties in New Zealand. F (accompanied by Z) undertook an exploratory trip to New Zealand in August 2023.  In October 2023 they shipped their belongings and furniture to New Zealand. They carried out, so it seems to me, all the usual preparatory work for people intending to relocate permanently. As F aptly puts it, they &#8220;packed up&#8221; their lives in the UK.</p>

On 17 November 2023 (only two weeks after their arrival), there was an argument which led to the police being called after what M alleges was a physical assault by F&#8217;s father. Relations between M and F had also quickly become strained, so much so that F says they effectively separated that day (M suggests it was a couple of days later). M left the property for a short time, and went to stay with a Rabbi for two days, then with F&#8217;s mother for five days, although she continued to see the children most days. On 24 November 2023, by agreement M returned to F&#8217;s father&#8217;s home to join F and the children, on the strict condition (incorporated in writing) that she would have to leave by 8 December 2023. </p>

To take an example, the evidence of the Cafcass Officer was directed mainly towards the child objections defence, but I have taken it into account when considering habitual residence and Article 13(b). </p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course, there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F (upon whom the burden lies on this aspect) has satisfied me that at the time of his removal from New Zealand, that is on 19 December 2023, X was habitually resident in New Zealand, and not in this jurisdiction. This limb of M&#8217;s defence fails. I acknowledge that X&#8217;s strong roots were in England; he had lived there all his life with his family, had attended school there, had little knowledge of New Zealand and was fully integrated in England until he arrived in New Zealand on 2 November 2023. But it is inescapable that the whole family emigrated to New Zealand. This was a permanent, not a temporary move. X&#8217;s habitual residence was, at that time, bound up with the family unit. They left behind their life in England including jobs, their home, the children&#8217;s schools, and their social networks. They started a new life in New Zealand. F secured employment and M looked at music teaching jobs. F obtained a long-term rental on 8 December 2023. They attended the local Jewish Centre. Both children attended school. F&#8217;s extended family were nearby. Even though X was only in New Zealand for about 6 weeks, I am not persuaded by the suggestion that X retained habitual residence in England. M&#8217;s counsel relies on what he says was X&#8217;s wish not to move to New Zealand. I am not convinced that this is clearly made out on the evidence, and there is no real indication of the strength of his opposition. Further, I treat any such views with a degree of caution in the light of the Cafcass officer&#8217;s evidence referred to below. In any event, this is one factor among many, and I am satisfied that X&#8217;s habitual residence transferred almost immediately from England to New Zealand.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that the defence of child objections is not made out by M (upon whom the burden of proof lies). X is less emotionally mature than might be expected, and is unable to express autonomous, well-informed views which are not influenced by M. X is clearly aligned with M and expressing views that are in part (consciously or not) echoes of her views. He does have some good memories of New Zealand. His bad memories appear to be associated with the parental conflict there and the effect on M. What he wants is to be with M in a secure, stable and conflict free existence. His views and opinions are shaped more by his relationship with his mother than an objection to New Zealand per se. In my judgment, he is expressing a preference for England rather than an objection to New Zealand within the jurisprudential meaning, and that preference is driven by a dominant wish to remain with M. I doubt very much whether he understand the nuances of a return order, protective measures, and the purpose of the Hague Convention which is essentially to decide where welfare disputes should be litigated. I am not satisfied that these somewhat complex concepts are clear to him. I therefore reject this second limb advanced by M.</p>

What is far more significant, in my judgment, is M&#8217;s own perceptions, recollections and personal experiences, which are acutely negative. What counts is what M internally felt and experienced. It does not matter greatly for these purposes whether it was caused directly by F or whether it was, as I consider likely, an accumulation of factors, including family conflict and isolation which contributed to, and exacerbated, her mental health issues. As a result, her coping mechanisms were placed under enormous strain, and she reacted erratically. It is quite likely that F did not appreciate the impact on M of the time in New Zealand, but I am satisfied, looking at the evidence in the round, that it had a seriously detrimental effect on her. She was vulnerable when she went, and in a very short space of time was experiencing a very high degree of trauma triggered by the circumstances of the move to New Zealand. It is probable that X was aware, consciously or subconsciously, of these events, and, being so close to M, he too was affected.</p>

Thus, she could not, as a non-resident of New Zealand, access social security, welfare services or medical health cover. She did not receive the treatment  for her physical condition which had been available to her in England. She could not open a bank account and was entirely dependent on F financially. This is likely to repeat itself if she were to return on a Visitor Visa. Although the expert refers to the possibility of a good support network in New Zealand mitigating the impact on her mental health, I am not satisfied that such a network currently exists there, and it would take some time to build up. By contrast, she is well supported in England. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Returning would prompt a high level of anxiety and fear. It would likely be a trigger event, exactly as took place in November/December 2023. Even with the proposed protective measures she would return to a very uncertain situation. She would have modest resources. F offers 6 months of financial support but that would not mitigate her sense of dependency which in itself would be a stressor. She does not drive, which reduces her independence. Her access to medical care is dependent on residence (entitling her to private healthcare) or independent finances (enabling her to access private healthcare); both seems to me to be questionable. Her job prospects are uncertain.  The stresses and tension of litigation about X in New Zealand would follow. True, she would not return to live with F, but the anxiety and nervousness of a return to New Zealand would be inevitable. She would, in my view, be highly vulnerable and, in my judgment, her mental health would worsen appreciably. In part, this is all evidenced by what occurred when she was in New Zealand before. As the expert told me, if M returns to New Zealand against her wishes and in the absence of the necessary stabilising factors, &#8220;it could go very wrong&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to the immigration expert, M currently has no immigration status in New Zealand. It is common ground that at present the only practical way for her to re-enter New Zealand would be under a  General Visitor visa, but because of her previous time in New Zealand that cannot take place until 19 September 2024 at the earliest. Thereafter she could apply for a residency visa based on employment but; (i) she would have to secure a job and it is not clear whether she would be able to obtain a job in one of the categories prescribed for a residency visa, and (ii) there is some doubt as to whether she would pass the minimum health requirements. All of this is replete with delay and uncertainty. Without the more permanent residency visa, she would not be entitled to the usual ability to access welfare services, healthcare, housing, banking facilities and the like. In my judgment, this uncertainty and delay would act as an obvious stressor and potential trigger for her mental health. That in turn would likely reduce her ability to care for X. In a sense, the evidence for this likes in the events of the 6 weeks at the end of 2023 when beyond doubt trigger factors caused by being in New Zealand led to (i) serious deterioration on her mental health, (ii) erratic behaviour by M and other profound symptoms and (iii) a consequential reduced ability to care for the children, particularly at an emotional level. True, that period was at a time of family breakdown, but the family conflict has not ended and a return to New Zealand would, in my judgment, be likely to occasion similar episodes. </p>

She would be stranded thousands of miles from her family, in a country of which she has traumatic memories. F does not agree to discharge the interim parenting order. He accepts it should be stayed until the first court hearing in New Zealand, but he expressly says that he wants X to live with him. One of his grounds for seeking transfer of X to his care in New Zealand is explicitly his concerns about M&#8217;s mental health. It is hard to imagine the impact on M of being required to return to New Zealand to embark on litigation where orders have already been made against her, F seeks removal of X from her care to his, and F relies expressly on her erratic behaviour and poor mental health.</p>

He is settled here, and in this case the longer the passage of time since removal the more difficult it is to order a return as the impact on him would be all the greater. By 19 September 2024 (the earliest date for return on F&#8217;s case) he will have been here for ten months. True, he is separated from Z, but a far more important relationship for him is with M and Z, being nearly 16, is rather older and more independent than him.  He does not want to see his father. He wants to remain living with M. I am satisfied that the impact on M of a return would be severely detrimental such as to affect her ability continue the level of stability and emotional security which he currently enjoys. The words of Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re S</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> (supra) </span>resonate. He would be returned to a maelstrom of family conflict, in the knowledge that F would be asking the court in New Zealand to order him to leave the care of M and move to the care of F.

F adds that he and his family can offer support, but in the light of the breakdown of the marriage and the fractious relationship between M and his father, that seems to me to be of no real use to M.
