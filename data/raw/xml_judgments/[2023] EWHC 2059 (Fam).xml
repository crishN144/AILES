I raised with the parties, that given the summary nature of this jurisdiction, it did not appear necessary for either the applicant or first respondent to give evidence. Mr Jubb agreed. Whilst the parties wished to ask questions of the Guardian, it was recognised her evidence would be short. Mr Jubb very properly accepted he had filed and served two thorough position statements, in respect of which he had full instructions. Therefore, considering these matters, and making clear I was content for the hearing to be the subject of regular short adjournments to permit the applicant to retain her attention and participate, it did not seem that an adjournment was necessary to ensure justice to the applicant. Furthermore, I note the letter from the doctor from May 2023 was before Sir Jonathan Cohen and this did not form the basis for his decision to adjourn the earlier July 2023 hearing. Whilst justice is the touchstone of any such case management decision, there is a pressing welfare need to resolve these long-running proceedings for X and Y, without further delay. Moor J identified, with characteristic firmness, the need for no further delay on 2 May 2023 and the imperative that the proceedings be determined before the end of July 2023. I respectfully agree. For all these reasons an adjournment was not necessary; not unjust and in any event contrary to the welfare of X and Y.</span></p>

He said that they: &#8220;feel that their wishes and feelings have not been heard. They are devastated at the thought of being separated from each other&#8221;. He explained he had spoken to them both for around 45 minutes each. In his second statement he sets out how X and Y came to instruct him as directed by David Rees KC (see above). He sets out in detail his background, his understanding of competence and involvement with both children.  His third witness statement dated 28 June 2023 sets out why he considered X became habitually resident in England and Wales in December 2022. X told him she considers England is her home. She talked of her fondness for France but that England was where she wanted to live. She said: &#8220;I would way prefer to run away than live with my mum&#8221;. Mr Skinner also revealed that X disclosed an allegation of sexual abuse by a third person when in her mother&#8217;s care when she was around ten years old. He concluded expressing X&#8217;s disappointment than during her 10 months in England she had not had contact in person with her mother. </span></p>

Therefore, the return of the wrongfully removed or retained child to his or her State of habitual residence not only restores the status quo ante, but it allows for the resolution of any issues related to the custody of, or access to, the child, including the possible relocation of the child to another State, by the court that is best placed to assess effectively the child&#8217;s best interests.

An international Convention, expressed in different languages and intended to apply to a wide range of differing legal systems, cannot be construed differently in different jurisdictions. The Convention must have the same meaning and effect under the laws of all contracting states. I would therefore reject any construction of article 13 which reflects purely English law rules as to the meaning of the word "acquiescence." I would also deplore attempts to introduce special rules of law applicable in England alone (such as the distinction between active and passive acquiescence) which are not to be found in the Convention itself or in the general law of all developed nations. </span></p>

In my view, article 13 is looking to the subjective state of mind of the wronged parent.

In ordinary litigation between two parties it is the facts known to both parties which are relevant.

Again, he may take an active part in proceedings in the country to which the child has been abducted to determine the long-term future of the child.

I hope that it is abundantly clear that I do not intend this and that I discourage an over-prescriptive or over-intellectualised approach to what, if it is to work with proper despatch, has got to be a straightforward and robust process. I risk the following few examples of how things may play out at the gateway stage, trusting that they will be taken as just that, examples offered to illustrate possible practical applications of the principles. So, one can envisage a situation, for example, where it is apparent that the child is merely parroting the views of a parent and does not personally object at all; in such a case, a relevant objection will not be established. Sometimes, for instance because of age or stage of development, the child will have nowhere near the sort of understanding that would be looked for before reaching a conclusion that the child has a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views. Sometimes, the objection may not be an objection to the right thing. Sometimes, it may not be an objection at all, but rather a wish or a preference. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

This analysis must be made for each child individually, without turning into a &#8220;best interests&#8221; analysis. Consequently, the separation of the siblings resulting from the non-return of one child (regardless of the legal basis for the non-return) does not usually result in a grave risk determination for the other child.</span></p>

This is a profoundly important step in her education (particularly given the allegedly peripatetic nature of her French residence and apparent lack of formal schooling) and wider development. Whilst there is no concept of &#8216;detrimental reliance&#8217; in respect of the acquiescence test, X&#8217;s situation in 2023 perfectly illustrates why the Hague Convention permits an exception of acquiescence to the removal. It also vividly illustrates why Lord Browne-Wilkinson explained that it would be unjust for the &#8216;wronged parent&#8217; to go back on their word, when unequivocally expressed. X has settled and integrated into English life from December 2022 in the knowledge of the applicant&#8217;s position.

(CAFCASS report of 9/12/22 at paragraph 24). Allegations of physical chastisement were made.

Any physical chastisement is likely to be harmful and likely to be emotionally.  It is far more than normal teenage-parent challenges.

Looking at all the evidence I have been provided with and assuming a competent level of state protection in France, as I am entitled to, even without expert evidence on the French legal system, and given X&#8217;s age and ability to protect herself from physical harm and report emotional harm, I am on balance satisfied that protective measures are in place to prevent the grave risk of harm I have identified above.   </span></p>

Y is the applicant&#8217;s &#8216;favourite&#8217; and was treated differently.  I do find, however, that if Y were returned to France alone, the separation from his sister would place him at grave risk of psychological harm. I accept the written and oral evidence of Ms Gwynne. As does the mother through her late concession. There are no protective measures that could be put in place to ameliorate this risk. I accept Ms Gwynne&#8217;s evidence that the lack of trust between the parents would result in there being no meaningful means for X and Y to see each regularly if they lived in England and France respectively. There are no effective measures to protect against future risk when seen against the concrete situation Y would face in France without his sister. I have considered the Good Practice Guide, but consider on the facts and evidence as presented in these proceedings, that Y would be placed at grave risk of psychological harm if returned to France without his sister. Whilst I have not carried out a best interests analysis, in this summary jurisdiction, I am entirely satisfied it would be more than just a &#8216;difficult or disruptive&#8217; interlude for Y. </span></p>

She spoke with Mr Skinner on 11 January 2023 for around 45 minutes. His second witness statement sets out the care he takes to assess a child&#8217;s competence to conduct the proceedings and instruct a solicitor. He was satisfied X could instruct him without a Guardian. That has not been challenged in these proceedings. X, through her solicitor and counsel has been entirely clear that she objects to being returned to France. This was foreshadowed in X&#8217;s meeting with Cafcass in December 2022 and Ms Gwynne&#8217;s report. X objected to returning to France. </span></p>

It is a strong, powerful and consistently held objection. She is of the age (nearly 14) and maturity (see the Cafcass reports) that the court must have regard to her wishes and feelings. It would be wholly improper to ignore them. Whilst X is &#8220;in her father&#8217;s camp&#8221; I am satisfied the evidence demonstrates she is making her own decision without coercion or undue influence from the first respondent. Her voice is clearly heard in these proceedings and it is genuinely her voice. Mr Skinner is satisfied of that, as is the court.</span></p>

I find that he does object to being returned to France. He has given his reasons to Ms Gwynne (most recently as 21 June 2023) and she has faithfully reported them to the court. I am also satisfied that he is of age (nearly 11) and a maturity (again see the Cafcass reports and the June 2023 position statement) that I must take into account Y&#8217;s views. I do however consider that Y has been influenced by his fear of being returned to France alone, without his big sister, whom he needs. This has worried him for months. It is likely to have impacted on his thoughts and what he wants the court to hear on his behalf. Whilst Ms Gwynne has been alive to Y being influenced by the first respondent, I am satisfied from considering the written and oral evidence that his views are genuine ones, albeit with the underlay of motivation not to be separated from his sister.</span></p>

The first respondent&#8217;s actions were improper and undoubtedly they were harmful to X and Y. The involvement of X in the first respondent&#8217;s plans and asking X to conceal her location from her mother was inappropriate.

However, I must acknowledge that the lengthy nature of these proceedings results in my placing less weight on the need for a swift return that should normally take place. I have recounted the steps taken in these proceedings and they speak for themselves against a swift decision. I also note that the court now has far more welfare information than would often take place in summary proceedings. The children have been joined as parties. Their solicitor has presented significant evidence. Cafcass have met Y three times. There is background information about their education in England in 2023. All of this must be included in the discretionary balancing, albeit I am clear I am not invoking any welfare checklists or full best interests analysis. I simply note that because of the nature of these proceedings, they are less summary than might otherwise be expected.</span></p>

It is clear to the court they need each other and throughout the last challenging twelve months have relied on each other physically and emotionally to support each other. Y in particular has needed his sister. He has told Ms Gwynne, he misses his mother. He is after-all ten years old and has not hugged her since August 2022. </span></p>

There have been three arranged in person contacts arranged (in addition to the online calls etc) but the applicant has not been prepared or able to come to England for this to take place. It weighs heavily on the court that because of the first respondent&#8217;s actions, this mother has been physically separated from her children. It is a factor I have considered carefully in the balancing exercise. I hope that the resolution of the proceedings and clarity about where X and Y now live, will permit in person contact between X and Y and the applicant very soon. It is important to their wellbeing. I have reflected on the applicant&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse. They are of a very serious nature. Whilst there has been contact, indeed much family life, since some of the allegations, this background may work to undermine contact between the applicant and X and Y. Cafcass have raised no safeguarding concerns. I weigh the applicant&#8217;s allegations as part of the overall picture. It may be, beyond this summary application, this issue may need to be considered by the Family Court.</span></p>

She has obtained a significant degree of integration into life in England with her comfort at her father&#8217;s home, her schooling and her friends. Y too, despite the disagreement between his parents, has in reality been rooted in English life through his home with his father, his schooling since March and the friends he reports to Ms Gwynne. I need not rule on whether X (in particular) and Y are, or are not, now habitually resident in England and Wales to exercise my discretion under the Hague Convention.

It would cause her emotional harm to have wishes, so clearly stated, over-ruled. Even if the French family courts were to promptly consider her position and rule she be returned to England, this would cause her harm. She is entitled to know that she is now settled and can look forward to returning to her school in September and continuing with her education and her wider personal development as a young woman in England. It follows that as X should not be returned, nor should Y. It would not be right for this close sibling relationship to bend to the detriment of Y, to the policy demands of the Hague Convention. Indeed, as Professor George reminded me in his submissions, by promoting the voice of these children and concluding there is a grave risk of harm to Y, if  separated from his big sister, the court is giving effect to the policy imperative of the Hague Convention, which must apply, at times, in the exception to the rule that children are returned. </span></p>
