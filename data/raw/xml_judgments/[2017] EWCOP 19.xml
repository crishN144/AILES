However, she never exhibits any signs of awareness, and it is no longer apparent when she is content or enjoys doing something or not, or whether she has any sense of feeling, smell or hearing whatsoever.</span></p>

However, for around 18 months now I have seen nothing which makes me think she has any awareness of what is going on whatsoever.

They had reached their positions after the most careful thought, placing M at the centre of their concern, and concluding that she would not have wanted to go on living like as she was, nor endure the inevitable continued decline in her terminal condition.  I therefore decided that CANH should be discontinued and replaced by palliative care after a meeting of family members and professionals had agreed on a suitable timetable.</span></p>

Here, I was satisfied that the court had all the essential information and that further inquiries would not alter the fundamentals.  I also noted that the medical opinion on M&#8217;s overall best interests was to some degree influenced by (and might, in the end, be said to have been tipped by) the views of her family.  There is nothing wrong with that.  For obvious reasons, it is not found in many of the reported cases, which often portray doctors and families in opposite camps, but those cases are surely unrepresentative of the much greater number where a common position is reached through people listening to each other.  Just as family members will naturally pay regard to the views of carers and doctors, particularly on the medical aspects of the situation, so doctors will naturally listen to the views of the family about their relative&#8217;s wider best interests.  What is important is that those called upon to express a view should do so conscientiously, drawing upon their personal and professional knowledge of the individual concerned.  </span></p>

A mandatory litigation requirement may deflect clinicians and families from making true best interests decisions and in some cases lead to inappropriate treatment continuing by default.

Often, family members, however well-motivated, will not be capable of discharging the role of litigation friend in relation to such a momentous issue.  These situations are harder to define than to recognise.  Here, there was no reason to believe that Mrs B&#8217;s ability to act on M&#8217;s behalf was compromised by her family relationship, or by her considered beliefs about her daughter&#8217;s best interests.  There was an independent specialist second opinion of the kind that the Official Solicitor would normally commission.  Mrs B also had the ability to conduct the proceedings competently, having the advantage of leading solicitors and counsel in the field &#8211; the irony that this came of the application being brought under s.21A not being lost on the parties or the court.  In all these circumstances, the fact-specific decision was that Mrs B was a suitable litigation friend, and so she proved. </span></p>
