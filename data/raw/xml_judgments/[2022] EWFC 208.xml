	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">At the centre of this case is a little boy called F.  He is now 19 months old and living with his paternal great aunt under an Interim Care Order.  Before I set out the circumstances in which I come to be involved in his life, his anxious parents will forgive me, I hope, if I make some short general observations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">First, this is a story about the importance of evidence and the testing of evidence in a court room setting.  As will become apparent, the evidence upon which I have finally made my decision was not apparent on a reading of the papers.  It developed.  It was, as evidence often is, dynamic - flexing and bending in response to the evidence of others.  We all need to ensure that we prioritise court resources appropriately and that involves actively reducing litigation issues and avoiding the unnecessary hearing.  However, we also need the occasional reminder that sometimes we must hear, test, and probe the evidence.  That is our role.  What better use can there be of the court&#8217;s expertise than the proper testing of evidence which informs a decision affecting the lives of a child and his parents? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, this is a story about the skill brought to these matters by experienced and committed lawyers.  I have had the pleasure and the luxury of highly experienced Counsel in this case.  No relevant stone has been left unturned.  Advice regularly given, the evidence examined, beautifully presented, and expertly probed.  Without them this task would have been considerably more arduous.  I offer my personal and genuine thanks to each one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, no one should underestimate the lifelong impact on a family of care proceedings and like so many cases at the moment, this is a story that has taken far too long to come to a conclusion.  F is now 19 months old. When proceedings were issued, he was little more than 6 weeks old.  There is no excuse for this delay. There is unfortunately nothing unusual about it.  I offer my most sincere apologies to F and his parents that it has taken so long to get to this point. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Let me return to the facts of the case.  On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Jan 2021, F was taken to a London hospital by ambulance.  Shortly after arrival he was treated by the resuscitation team.  During his time with various health care professionals, he was documented as having marks on his face which have been referred to variously as redness, discolouration, petechiae, purpura and bruising.  What they were is subject to considerable dispute, as is when they were first seen and precisely where they were seen on his face.  The LA&#8217;s case is that F&#8217;s collapse prior to the calling of the emergency services and his later presentation is more likely than not as a result of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;..the application of a blunt force to F&#8217;s face and consequent asphyxia&#8221; </span>in an attempt <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;at intentional suffocation through smothering&#8221;.</span>  Originally, the LA considered that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the perpetrator of this was the mother or father but as the evidence unfolded, it has withdrawn its accusations against the father &#8211; including that he failed to protect.  The single issue for me to determine has been whether I am satisfied that this mother attempted to smother her child. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">This has been a tough case.  The evidence is extensive.  The stakes are very high.  As Mr Twomey QC for the mother said in November 2021: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In plain language, the main allegation facing these parents is that there was an attempt to murder or cause very significant harm to their six-week-old baby by suffocation&#8221;</span>.  The consequences of a wrong decision for any family is always serious but never more so when, as Ms Stone QC for the Guardian puts it, the allegations are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;at the top end of seriousness&#8217;</span>.  The pull of the expert witness and of science is always strong and identifying a unifying diagnosis is an attractive and often irresistible means by which we determine what is most likely.  However, it is our duty as lawyers and as Judges to ensure that we are not blinded by this approach and crucially that we do not ignore the possible and the fact that sometimes more than one thing is going on.  This has been one of those cases for me but piecing together my reasons and double checking them to ensure that I am not being led astray by the immense sympathy I feel for these enormously likeable parents has been an arduous task.  At its end, however, I am quite clear.  I am not satisfied that this mother tried to smother her son, or that she placed anything over his face, forcibly or otherwise, to prompt the symptoms I have determined were seen.  The threshold is not met.  F can return home.  These parents should be given some support to come to terms with what they have been through.  I am only sorry that it has taken so long.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not think that the LA can be criticised for taking the action it has and issuing the proceedings.  Not least because the evidence upon which I have hung my conclusions has developed during the course of the proceedings (beginning with the instruction of Prof B) and gained considerably more traction during the hearing.  Let me explain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The parents met in April 2016.  They were married in April 2017.  The mother was born and brought up in Nottingham where her family continue to live. She has 3 older brothers all married with children. The father was born in London. He is the youngest of four children. He has lived with the paternal grandparents at the current address since he was born. His eldest sibling, M, is married with children and living close by. She is the carer for the paternal grandmother.  His eldest brother, K, lives in the paternal family home with his wife, L, and their three children.  They live on the top floor of the house and have separate cooking facilities.  The father had another brother, J.  J had significant disabilities.  He died on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The parents were keen to have children as soon as possible.  They tried for over two years before the mother fell pregnant for the first time.  Sadly, that first pregnancy ended in miscarriage in 2019.  The mother suffers from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which can impact upon fertility.  Fortunately, her second pregnancy was successful, and F was born on 11.12.20 after a difficult delivery. Mother and son remained in hospital for a few days following F&#8217;s birth due to infections.  When discharged the Mother travelled to Nottingham to stay with her family because the paternal grandparents, with whom it was intended they would live, had tested positive for Covid-19 and were isolating. The father stayed with his parents in London during this brief separation.  The Mother and F returned to London on 30.12.20.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">On 24.1.21, when he was 6 weeks old, Aunt M was at the paternal GPs home cooking a family meal. She was assisted in the kitchen by L, the wife of the eldest brother.  The grandparents were in the home as were the rest of L&#8217;s family.  There was a family meal planned.  It was on this evening that F was taken to hospital by ambulance. The precise sequence of events will be set out further below.  Suffice to say that the alert was first raised by F&#8217;s mother who noticed something wrong with her son.  The father was in the kitchen having a snack and was called up to their room by the mother to look.  He thought that there was nothing wrong.  Minutes later he was called back by the mother and what he saw then caused him to call the paternal grandmother for assistance.  Aunt M arrived on the scene and a call was made to the LAS.  The first responders (paramedic followed by ambulance crew) suspected an allergic reaction as the presenting symptoms appeared to them to be redness and swelling to his face. Whilst being transported to hospital in the ambulance, the Mother initially reported that she noticed bruising to F&#8217;s face.  This was not seen by any health professional. I will need to decide whether she did see bruising or any other marks to F&#8217;s face at that early stage. </p>

However, when seen by the consultant in paediatric emergency medicine he was considered by her to be looking &#8216;unwell&#8217; with the result that he was moved to another room and a resus call was put out.  A resus team attended and went to work under the direction of the consultant.  Intravenous fluids were introduced through a line in his leg bone. Whilst originally it was suggested otherwise, during the course of that resus routine, photographs provided by the parents showed that a mask was placed and held over his face during treatment.  </p>

She saw him for the first time on her ward round the morning after his admission (25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Jan).  In her CP medical report she noted that he was admitted with an episode of BRUE (brief resolved unexplained event) likely caused by gastroesophageal reflux.  Investigations revealed that he had an undiagnosed ventriculoseptal (heart) defect (a hole in his heart) and a parietal lesion identified on cranial imaging thought likely to be secondary to a healing cephalohaematoma caused by injury to the skull during assisted delivery with forceps. Her report also documents <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;resolving facial bruising and subconjunctival haemorrhages for which no medical cause has been identified and is unexplained with no history of facial trauma given by the parents and no correlation with other events around the time of the BRUE&#8217;</span>.

They were aware of the mother&#8217;s teenage depression and sensitive to the difficulties she encountered then.  As I shall explain, I consider their encouragement of her visits and stays with her family and their solution to the domestic issues as between the two sisters in law to demonstrate a desire to support her, not to undermine or isolate her, or even ignore the impact of the tension on her.  Indeed, it is a positive part of the LA case that this family was practically very supportive of this mother in her care of F &#8211; actively sharing in the care of this newborn to enable the mother to sleep and rest where possible. </p>

I sought confirmation from Mr Woodward-Carlton QC that in the event that he did not manage to cross the evidential threshold in other evidence then this broader canvass evidence was not capable of making his case.  He agreed.  However, the whiff of something not right here has hung around throughout this case and given the time devoted to it I consider it only fair to these parents &#8211; in particular, this mother - that I set out my assessment of essential parts of this evidence where I can.

Whilst I have found the father to be the more reliable as a historian that is not because I consider the mother to be dishonest.   She is not.  This mother is to my eye visibly impacted by this trauma.  In my view, her barely concealed inability to accurately recount the details of the evening that her son was taken to hospital are caused by a simple lack of recall regarding that traumatic event; her seeming refusal to admit the full impact upon her of the pressures of conceiving, or of having a poor relationship with a family member or of being the parent of a new born is rooted in a fear of the consequences should she admit that she has succumbed to even the most common of life&#8217;s stressors.  She is quite obviously concerned at how she would be perceived and that this might be thrown into the mix to make a case against her &#8211; in the way that her teenage depression has been.  Significantly, the father&#8217;s recollection is better.  His relaxed acceptance of the pressures that she faced coupled with his sensitive understanding and practical hands-on support leant powerful support to the credibility of them both.  It also confirmed the strength of their union.  Overall, my observations of them in the witness box was of two very dignified young people, still respectful of the process and trying their very best to tell me everything that they could despite their justifiable and growing frustration at the circumstances in which they find themselves. </p>

She was a poor historian. She was muddled and she found it difficult to admit that the circumstances in which she was living were challenging. Her muddled accounts were not in my view muddled because she was seeking to hide something.  I am shored up in that by the fact that often the muddle left her with an account less favourable to her position than what turned out to be the truth.  One example of this is the timing of the eating of a takeaway that afternoon.  She placed that event very close to the time when she was due to eat with the family giving the LA the opportunity to use it to suggest that she did not intend to join the family that evening, and the story of a family gathering was a fa&#231;ade hiding the true position.  When the father gave evidence, he said that</p>

There are minor discrepancies.  For example, concerning the extent of the swelling seen and whether there is consistent reference to breathing problems or &#8216;blue&#8217; colouring, but I do not consider these minor discrepancies to be of any real significance.  What is highly significant in my view is that these descriptions broadly paint a picture of events which is entirely in keeping with the way in which Prof Bu&#8217;Lock describes a baby with F&#8217;s health issues would present and at a time when no one was aware that he had a hole in his heart.  Indeed, even the instructed consultant paediatrician was unable to recognise the significance of this until the instruction of the cardiologist in the case.  These parents cannot have made this up.

Looking back, she is now not certain that this is what she saw.  This is relied upon by the LA who argue it is an attempt to conceal the early development of injuries.  I am afraid that this makes no sense to me.  The identification of early bruising was certainly contrary to the mother&#8217;s interests. Maybe she would not have been aware of this.  However, she is the only person who sees these &#8216;bruises&#8217;.

Nor did they observe any bleeding in the eyes.  Finally, the picture is also of a child who was improving during their visit.  F was settled and stable on hand over at the hospital. Again, I refer to the section below and Prof Bu&#8217;Lock&#8217;s description of how F might look after recovering from a breath holding episode.

Although an &#8220;arrest call&#8221; was put out, Dr D explained this does not connote panic, but rather an &#8216;escalation of care&#8217;, where it was felt that more input was needed. My observation of her as a witness was that Dr D is a highly experienced and well-trained emergency consultant.  She struck me as &#8216;unflappable&#8217; which I expect is a necessary quality to have in paediatric A&amp;E.  When she describes an escalation in care as not being something to be panicked about, I am not at all convinced that this means that the situation is not very serious.  Dr D performs in a theatre of life-threatening events and it is likely that all events are greeted with calm and clinical expertise.   </p>

It may be that she does not recall because looking back this is not how she would describe the event now.  She was clear that F did not stop breathing.  For my part, I find it surprising that Dr S would record this had it not been related to her by someone.  This also fits with the fact that F&#8217;s lactate levels were elevated at 4.2 &#8211; something that can indicate reduced body tissue oxygenation, although I am told that this is not a specific marker for any particular diagnosis. It seems likely to me that this is what Dr D told Dr S, as Dr S was careful to note it. The explanation that it might have referred to events at home seems unlikely as no one up to that point had described what happened at the home in that way and the parents would not have used that phrase.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Was there a deterioration in F in the hospital?  I have been cautioned about my approach to this.  I accept that I have no one account of how F presented when he arrived at A&amp;E and in the lead up and after.  No one person who could compare how they saw him progress.  However, I do have the detailed observations of the health care professionals whose job it was to monitor that progress and did albeit from differing perspectives.  There is clear evidence that F had improved in presentation whilst being observed and transported by the emergency services as set out above.  It is also clear that on delivery the first set of observations carried out by a nurse supported the assessment made by Mr K, the ambulance crewman, that F was stable and ok.  What followed was a clear instruction that this child was to be moved to a place where access to emergency equipment and monitoring was better because he looked  &#8216;unwell&#8217;.  As I have already commented, my assessment of Dr D is that &#8216;unwell&#8217; to her connoted something that had to be taken seriously and indeed it was sufficiently serious for her to put out a crash call.  As she described, a crash call pulls professionals from all over the hospital away from what they are doing, straight to her department. They are not just within the paed emergency team.  Dr D would not have called for them to attend had she not considered their intervention necessary.  What then unfolds lends support to that.  In my view this is very clear evidence that this baby suffered a sudden deterioration in his condition which caused experienced medics to deliver an escalation in care through the resus procedure. </p>

This type of mask does not require a seal and does not need to be pressed down on the face at all, although if the mask moved out of place then it would have to be manually adjusted so that it sits on the face and over the nose. She thought it unlikely that the child was &#8216;thrashing around&#8217; but conceded that a child need not be distressed for the mask to move. It is as well to remember that an intraosseous needle was inserted into F&#8217;s leg &#8211; into the bone &#8211; because it had not been possible to get a line into him by any other means and he needed fluid.  As Prof Bu&#8217;Lock observed &#8211; that would have been painful. All of the masks used on children are made from the same material as the sample mask provided to the Court &#8211; i.e. a soft, malleable material. She did not observe any pressure being applied or rough handling of the mask and she has never seen a mask leave a child bruised but she accepted that the only person able to comment on how firmly it was being held that was the person holding the mask.   </p>

Neither was dogmatic nor unprepared to accept the possible whilst being unafraid to distinguish the impossible.  Dr Millard was most helpful on the issue of angioedema.

Her role as the consultant paediatrician was to pull the clinical observations and assessments together and to give a paediatric overview of the case providing a full assessment of the nature, causes and mechanisms of any injuries caused.  She was expected to apply her knowledge as a generalist to the likely differential diagnoses. Her clear conclusion was then and has remained that F&#8217;s injuries were &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">suspicious&#8217;</span> of intentional suffocation.  She based her conclusions on the CP medical and without seeing the hospital, or source material.  As we have seen the CP medical was fatally flawed. However, when the detail was put to her in cross-examination she refused to shift her position or more importantly, accept that her failure to rectify the errors in her report as a result was in any way unhelpful.  Dr Ismail gave the distinct impression that she was wedded to her decision that this is smothering, and nothing would change that.  She advised against the instruction of a cardiologist, apparently on the basis that the treating cardiologists at GOSH considered the VSD was not of significance here and has barely modified that position in spite of the clear and unchallenged evidence of Prof Bu&#8217;Lock that the VSD is very much in play here.  On the issue of mechanisms and forensic analysis, where her opinion differs from Dr Irvine, I have preferred his evidence. </p>

This means that there is a hole between the right and the left lower pumping chambers in the heart.  In Jan 2021 it was a significant size. The hole allows blood to flow (shunt) from one side to the other.  It is documented that F&#8217;s VSD was shunting bidirectionally on the first few scans.  </p>

When this occurs then the baby&#8217;s measured oxygen saturations may drop from their usual 98-100%, due to mixing of deoxygenated blood with the arterial circulation. This is known as cyanosis. If transient it is of little consequence other than imparting a blue tinge to the skin, but if prolonged then it may reduce the body&#8217;s tissue oxygenation causing acidosis and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">circulatory</span> compromise.  </p>

That in turn is likely to have resulted in the reductions in his oxygen levels as set out in the paragraph above. Although gastroesophageal reflux is common in babies, right to left shunting across the VSD might well explain his exaggerated response to these events and the perceived or real need for resuscitation both on admission and in hospital.

Thus, it seems that the VSD does provide an explanation for F&#8217;s cyanotic episodes at that age.

A term used frequently by the treating medics &#8211; Dr D and Dr K being two examples.  As I have already set out Professor Bu&#8217;Lock was clear that F&#8217;s VSD meant there was potential for blue blood to cross from the right to left side of the heart, particularly if he was breath-holding or gagging or experiencing a Valsalva manoeuvre, which in turn would cause him to look blue because oxygen saturations in the arteries are reduced. She went on to explain that this would cause the baby to look &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very different from how they would look normally</span>&#8221;.  Further, as the shunting stops, circulation returns to normal and the child may become flushed as part of their recovery. That results from re-oxygenation, meaning that a baby may well look red which is precisely what the first responder observed.   </p>

For the reasons set out, I prefer Dr Irvine&#8217;s evidence.  Dr Irvine advised that purpura and petechiae are similar. Petechiae are very small and often referred to as &#8216;pin-prick&#8217; marks; purpura are a larger version of similar type marks.  Both are generally caused by an increase of pressure and small venal ruptures or venous pressure, but not by external applications of blunt force &#8211; unlike haematomas or what he would term, bruising.  Dr Ismail&#8217;s evidence on this was confusing.  She was far less clear about the differences between the two although at one point agreed that purpura and petechiae would not usually be caused by external trauma.     </p>

The difficulties encountered in assessing what was actually seen by clinicians some 18 months on has been very clearly demonstrated in the paragraphs above.  With proper medical photographs, taken in accordance with the RCPCH guidance, asking the instructed experts to comment on what appeared to be there, might have been more acceptable.  I am left with imperfect imaging, predominantly taken by the parents on their mobile telephones, in different lighting conditions, with varying backgrounds and at different angles.  I agree that the photographs are still evidence and need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence.  They have been very useful in establishing for example that a face mask was used during the resus procedure &#8211; something that was initially denied.

Thus, if petechiae were present prior to arrival at hospital, breath-holding during the incident at home was a potential explanation for them but if the petechiae were not present before resuscitation, they were probably caused during resuscitation and the absence of petechiae prior to resus is highly significant in this regard. </p>

There is no evidence that she was carrying unresolved mental health issues with her from her teenage years, and I am not satisfied that the stresses of life that she encountered were anything out of the ordinary or were having any greater impact upon her than any other expectant mother during the pandemic.  What is more, I consider the paternal family (with the exception of L) to be extraordinarily supportive of her and not the contrary. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">There is no dispute that the mother historically suffered with situational depression arising from incidents in her school years.  She was badly bullied at school and she became depressed as a result.  She was deeply unhappy, and this prompted her to take an overdose of paracetamol. There is no evidence that the problems that she suffered then remained, as at Jan 2021, unresolved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">The suggestion that she had attempted to conceal the extent of her depression was discredited by Mr Twomey QC in his questioning of the now abandoned psychiatrist.  As a result, it must now be accepted that she did not receive anti-depressant medication beyond her teenage years.  It is right that this mother did not mention this history initially to the social worker but there seems to have been no attempt to work out why.  Rather than considering the possibility that like large parts of the population, she finds it difficult to admit these historical problems with mental health, assumptions were made that she was seeking to hide something.   107.<span style="font-family:Arial"/><marker name="tab"/>The LA has sought to draw upon the hints of a &#8216;lack of stability&#8217; and &#8216;strange behaviour&#8217; reported by the sister-in-law to the police.  She suggested that the family had been looking to have a mental health assessment of the mother.  This was denied by her in evidence but more significantly this suggestion was also denied by the family and greeted by them with complete surprise. It is notable that the paternal family were all fully aware of the mother&#8217;s struggles as a teenager.  They were asked in evidence about that and volunteered that she had been open with them about it. As I will set out, the allegations made about her odd behaviour are completely without evidential foundation and there has been no real attempt by those within the LA relying upon this information to objectively assess the validity of these claims.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">The LA boldly asserts that the mother&#8217;s ongoing mental health difficulties were demonstrated by her continued health anxieties and her expressions of anxiety to her GP about life and family stresses.  I am not satisfied that these complaints to the GP demonstrate that this mother was unhappy or &#8216;unsupported and isolated&#8217; in the paternal family. The fact that she was homesick and missed her family does not automatically demonstrate this to be so.  In my view it was an entirely sensible suggestion that she should spend the time immediately after F&#8217;s birth with her family and for me it demonstrates how thoughtful and supportive this family was.  Culturally, it would not be unusual for the paternal family to insist that the mother should be with them following the birth of their grandson, no matter what.  It is notable, in my view, that this was not a family that insisted on this.  The father himself alluded to his &#8216;relaxed&#8217; attitude to the time the mother spent with her own family &#8211; taking her there himself.  I took that to mean &#8216;relaxed&#8217; as compared to cultural norms.  This obviously did not stop her from feeling homesick but at least that anxiety was not increased by the attitude of the paternal family.  It was understood by them, in my assessment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">Much has been made of the &#8216;pressure&#8217; upon her to have a child. It seems to me highly likely that this mother felt her own pressure to have a child simply because she had found it so difficult to conceive and when she finally did, she lost her first pregnancy.  The mother was reluctant to admit that she felt this pressure, but it is entirely normal and natural to feel that way.  The father&#8217;s evidence was again more open and insightful on this issue.  He accepted that his grandmother, to whom he is close, had said she would like to see him with a child.  He agreed that this was probably an added pressure, but he told me how he had explained to his wife that it was not to be taken that way. He demonstrated enormous sensitivity and understanding about this issue and I cannot believe that his wife would not have seen the same.  Again, that does not remove the pressure that she placed upon herself but to seek to suggest that the paternal family colluded in bringing that pressure to bear is a step too far in my view. </p>

She struck me as rather embarrassed by having to explain why she had approached the police when she could not identify a great deal of substance in her complaints.  I also heard from the paternal grandparents and the elder paternal aunt, Aunt S.  I considered that they were all honest and decent witnesses.  The suggestion has been made that they have played down the issue as between the mother and L.  That may be right.  It is their family business.  However, I believed Aunt S when she told me that in her view this issue between the two women had its roots in domestic pettiness.  She reminded me that L had been the only sister-in-law in that household for more than 8 years by the time the mother arrived.  L herself commented that she considered the mother was given <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;some leniency in terms of daughter in law duties&#8217;</span>.     </p>

An examination of the detail of allegations of the alleged erratic behaviour reveals them to be petty in the extreme and I do not consider the mere fact that she felt the need to report them somehow make them credible complaints.  The police could not get L into the station to make a complaint and they finally concluded that there was no crime, suggesting that L visit her GP for her anxiety.  Most telling for me is the recording that L told the police that family were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;pushing for a mental health assessment&#8217;</span> of the mother.  I am sure that was said.  It would be a strange thing to note, if not. But having heard the evidence of the paternal grandparents, I am quite satisfied it was not true.  It demonstrates L trying to infuse her rather pathetic domestic complaints with the flavour of mental instability.  No doubt she knew about the mother&#8217;s history of bullying.  She now says that she did not say that. </p>

The root of it was as Aunt S recounted, domestic pettiness.  However, it is my view that the paternal family acted to support the mother from the impact of this.   My sense is that L was the outsider here.  The photo taken of the family together on the mother and F&#8217;s return demonstrates this &#8211; L standing awkwardly on the edge.  It was her family that was given a separate kitchen. </p>

However, it is testament to his openness that he admitted that this was something he did suggest and that he wanted to do.  I think that this was probably worrying for the mother but listening to the father made me realise that this was a difficult decision for him, because of his closeness to his own grandmother, but it was not made in ignorance of the impact upon his wife.  Nor would he have gone away without ensuring that she was happy and cared for and quite possibly back with her own family. </p>

Whilst it is right that his treating cardiologists describe his VSD as stable the chain of medical consequences that could flow from having a hole in his heart as a newborn combined with gastric reflux and observed breath holding provides alternative explanations worthy of examination.

I repeat that it is not for the parents to prove that these are not inflicted injuries.  It is for the LA to prove that despite the likelihood that F&#8217;s presentation on those occasions was related to his unusual combination of health issues, these additional features make an attempted smothering more likely on the evening of 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.</p>
