It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the Page 14 evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be &#8220;real&#8221;. It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8220;grave&#8221;. Although &#8220;grave&#8221; characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.

However, they do gain colour from the alternative &#8220;or otherwise&#8221; placed &#8220;in an intolerable situation&#8221; (emphasis supplied). As was said in Re D, at para 52, &#8220;&#8216;Intolerable&#8217; is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean &#8216;a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate&#8217;&#8221;. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13b the court is not only concerned with the child&#8217;s immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">There is obviously a tension between the inability of the court to resolve factual disputes between the parties and the risks that the child will face if the allegations are in fact true. Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and Page 15 pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221;</p>

In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance, the Judge will have to consider whether to adopt what Lady Justice Black said in Re K.  The evidence before the court enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that the allegations give rise to an Article 13(b) risk.  In making this determination and to explain what I meant in Re C I would endorse what Mr Justice MacDonald said in UHD v Mackay, Law Reports England and Wales, High Court, 2019 at page 1239, namely that &#8220;the assumptions made by the court with respect to the maximum level of risk must be reasoned and reasonable assumptions.
