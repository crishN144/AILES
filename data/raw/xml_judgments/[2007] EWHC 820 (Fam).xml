	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment is being handed down in private on 4 April 2007.  It consists of 8 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge.  The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"> The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application concerns 4 siblings who have been in care for 5 years.  Since March 2006 they have lived with their maternal great-aunt in Canada, Z (&#8220;the aunt&#8221;).  All parties wish for the children's future to be secured with the aunt.  After much investigation it is agreed that the best method to secure this is by a Convention adoption order in England.  That cannot be achieved if, at a time of the order, they are no longer habitually resident in England.  I am asked to rule on whether they are or are not so habitually resident.</p>

The mother of all 4 children is Ms S who is 28 years old.  The father of B is Mr M.  His whereabouts are unknown.  The father of the younger 3 children is Mr A who is 29 years old.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of a visit by the local authority, the London Borough of Greenwich, in January 2002, an emergency protection order was made in respect of the elder 3 children.  At a hearing in July 2003 His Honour Judge Sleeman found that B and C had witnessed scenes of domestic violence and been hit themselves.  They had been exposed to an emotionally abusive environment, and both were likely to suffer both physical and emotional harm if they had not been removed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He found that B was expected to be self sufficient, and to assist the mother with her brothers.  The mother was unable properly and consistently to nurture and care for the children (which now included E) or meet their needs in a sustained way.  Her own needs dominated at the expense of those of the children.  There was no real acknowledgment by either parent that they needed to address any problems in their marriage or their parenting skills.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He held that the children could not wait for any further assessment.  This was in part because it was unlikely that the parents would change in the near future.  He approved the placement of the children for adoption.  He gave the local authority permission to terminate contact upon an adoptive placement being identified.</p>

It was not completed until April 2004 when the Toronto Children&#8217;s Adoption Aid Society gave conditional approval to her as an adopter.  Final approval was given in August 2004.  The children were approved by the Panel for freeing for adoption in November 2004.</p>

Son afterwards they went with her to Canada, returning a month later.  On 1 March 2006 the local authority was given permission to withdraw their application for a freeing order.  On 17 March the local authority approved the aunt as a long term foster-carer for the children.  On 26 March the children went to Canada again for what was regarded as an extended holiday where they have remained.</p>

They have concluded that it provides the only sure way of securing the children&#8217;s&#8217; placement with the aunt.

It is brought under the 1993 Hague Convention which has been in force in England and Wales since June 2003.

The children have been in Canada, save for 2 breaks, for a year.  It is highly improbable that anything will happen in the next 2 months to alter the position as I find it to be today.</p>

Where a child is in care, the local authority has parental responsibility for the child.  It also has the power to determine which parent shall share their responsibility (s38 (3)).  But ordinary residence comes to an end where as here the child is placed with a relative.  The question is how that impacts on habitual residence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied the 4 children have never acquired habitual residence in Canada.  Firstly the aunt has never had parental responsibility for them.  Whilst she provides them with a home, their time in Canada has always been at the behest of the local authority.  It alone determined when it began, for how long it continues, and when it comes to an end.  The children are dependent, not on the aunt to determine their residence, but upon the local authority.  That in my view is determinative.</p>

It was at best a hope that one day it might become a settled home for the children.
