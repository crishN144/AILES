	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">This complex and unusual hearing concerns the horrific life experiences of two young children. I will identify them as A and B. They are respectively nine and  six years old. They were removed from the care of their parents on 27 May 2022 and after an abbreviated period in foster care, they have since lived with their paternal aunt where they are said to be thriving.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">Threaded through the detailed tapestry of the local authority&#8217;s schedule of allegations is the mother&#8217;s malign influence that has led to the children suffering significant and intolerable harm. Broadly, it is alleged that the mother has caused each of the children to spend the majority of their lives in a highly abusive environment in which they have been medicalised, subjected to a multitude of unnecessary medical investigations, a significant number of unnecessary invasive medical procedures and they have spent most of their lives in hospitals or under the care of home care nurses. Examples of the mother&#8217;s behaviour include covert administration of potentially lethal medication to B and withdrawing blood from her over a sustained prolonged period causing her to be the subject of further unnecessary investigations and intrusive procedures. The local authority also alleges that the children&#8217;s lead Consultant Paediatrician Dr K has unintentionally permitted herself to be manipulated by the mother, has failed to observe proper professional boundaries in her relationship with the mother and has unintentionally caused delay in the detection of the true cause of the children&#8217;s perplexing presentation. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">The mother denies the allegations and states that she has done no more than be guided by the practitioners in seeking answers to the complex and worrying presentation of her children. After the parents&#8217; separation and with the emerging evidence, the father supports the local authority&#8217;s allegations. Whilst the guardian has not pursued any additional findings on behalf of the children, she has very properly ensured that all of the relevant evidence has been appropriately marshalled and adduced before the court and has made submissions in respect of which of the findings as sought by the local authority she considers can properly be made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">The parties have made detailed submissions on the applicable legal principles and each has highlighted what they say are the important aspect of the authorities which I have considered carefully. There is no dispute on the applicable law, and I do not intend to rehearse this in any detail. However, I observe that it is a simple and general principle of law that the party seeking to rely on a relevant disputed fact must prove that fact. In civil and family proceedings such facts must be proven on a balance of probabilities. The guiding principles were most helpfully summarised by Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JS </span>[2012] EWHC 1370 (Fam). Following this decision, Jackson J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire County Council v C, M and F (Children: Fact finding Hearing) </span>[2014] EWFC 3 added a further item to this invaluable list of important considerations. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">More specifically in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Threshold Criteria; Fabricated Illness</span>) [2002] EWHC 20, the court provided further guidance by stating that whilst medical evidence is very important, the court is tasked with assessing all of the evidence that includes the evidence and credibility of the carers, contemporaneous notes, the inherent probability or improbability of events and circumstantial evidence that may corroborate the account of witnesses. Later in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T </span>[2004] 2 FLR 838, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P recognised the importance of considering individual pieces of evidence but warned against &#8216;compartmentalising&#8217; the evidence in a case where the judge of the first instance was found on appeal not to have sufficiently scrutinised the evidence of the parents and explanation for one of the injuries. Furthermore, I have considered and applied the observations of the former President of the Family Division in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A child) </span>[2016] 1 FLR 1<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> I am not bound by the local authority&#8217;s schedule of findings and can make such findings as are relevant and supported by evidence.</p>

They were married in 2014. Soon after, the mother fell pregnant with A who was born in the following year. Just over 2 years later B was born. Although, the family enjoyed many joyful moments over the years, it is common ground that the parents&#8217; relationship was not always a happy one. They separated in or around March 2023. By the mother&#8217;s account she commenced her relationship with another man in April 2023 having met him in December 2022. </span></p>

A was about twelve weeks old when she was taken to Hospital A for her first visit and B was five days old when she first visited Hospital A. In the ensuing years, the children had numerous and frequent admissions to Hospital A. At times, their admissions to the hospital lasted for some weeks and at other times some hours or days. The children were well known to the hospital staff.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in"><span style="color:#000000">The medical history and the investigation of the children is extensive and I will detail the relevant parts later in this judgment. The children were the subject of a number of medical investigations and procedures. They were referred to a number of tertiary hospitals for specialist assessments and investigations into their apparent presentations which were mostly perplexing and a root cause could not be identified. It is clear that the children spent a significant part of their lives in a clinical setting that, over time, encroached into their home environment.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in"><span style="color:#000000">A was admitted to the hospital on numerous occasions for investigations that included blood tests, sleep studies, x-rays and clinical examinations. In March 2016 she was inserted with a Nasal Gastric Tube (NGT) which was followed by her first referral to a tertiary service at Hospital B where an ENT Consultant saw her. The concerns raised by the mother were related to her breathing that included noisy breathing, cyanosis and holding her breath. After an elective admission to Hospital A in July 2016, A was transferred to Hospital B in August and discharged in September of the same year. The staff noted anxiety in the mother around feeding, the parents questioning if Creon should be prescribed and whether A should be referred to a tertiary Hospital (Hospital F). It was considered that A&#8217;s diarrhoea was secondary to constipation and she was prescribed laxatives. A continued to be under medical care with another referral to a tertiary hospital centre (Hospital D) in August 2017 when she was seen in the gastroenterology department and then subsequently referred to a third tertiary centre (Hospital C). Following an elective admission to Hospital D, she was further investigated for cystic fibrosis and prescribed Creon. Happily, the investigation for cystic fibrosis was negative. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in"><span style="color:#000000">Soon after her birth, B also became a regular patient at the Hospital A with many more medical interventions and referrals to tertiary centres that followed. Like her sister, in March 2018, B was referred to Hospital B where she was attended on by an ENT Consultant who found her to present as a healthy child. M continued to raise concerns about B not crying or vocalising leading to a referral to Hospital E for further investigations. B was due to undergo an MRI scan in Hospital B in May 2018 but did not attend. Subsequently, she underwent a micro-laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB) at Hospital E that found a mild tracheomalacia. She was also seen by a Speech and Language Therapist (SALT) who referred her to the team at Hospital A. In June of the same year she too was fitted with a NGT and was prescribed Creon although her (faecal elastase) results were within the expected range. In July, the family was referred to Homestart who continued to support the family until 2020 and the Hospital A Outreach Team also began to visit the home to provide further support for the family. </span></p>

In the intervening period and continuing into the following year, there was an emerging theme of mother reporting desaturation episodes in B that were not always supported by clinical observations. The mother was discouraged from using a nebuliser or suction to clear B&#8217;s airways. In November, B was discharged home with a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machine (CPAP) together with a care plan for using CPAP during the night and to take B to hospital if she required Oxygen.</span></p>

There also appears to have developed an assertion that the mother was attempting to increase the use of CPAP and to use Oxygen at home, neither of which was supported by Hospital E which was the specialist centre that had provided the CPAP machine and care plan for using this. However, the mother is clear that she was acting on advice from Hospital A. In December, the mother raised concerns about B becoming desaturated whilst in her car seat. This led to further investigations in 2019 by her treating Consultant Dr J and her team at Hospital E. </span></p>

The year commenced with a referral to a charity that provides support for families of children with life limiting or life threatening conditions. B was admitted to Hospital E for the insertion of a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG &#8211; feeding tube) which became infected requiring a further admission to Hospital A where her first Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) line was inserted. The latter was intended to provide long term intravenous access. By now the local authority had been aware of the family and in February 2019 the children were placed on Child In Need plans and Ms X was allocated to be their social worker. Over the following months the relationship between the mother and the social worker became increasingly inappropriate, crossing professional boundaries to an extremely concerning level that ultimately cost the social worker her career as a social worker. I will detail some aspects of this later in this judgment. </span></p>

By August, issues around her haemoglobin levels had re-emerged that led to her second blood transfusion and further admission to Hospital E where clinicians posed questions about a psychological cause for her breathing difficulties when no issues were identified with her feeding. A also started to receive some play therapy to assist her to cope with living with a sibling with such profound medical difficulties. In the summer, home care nurses began to provide evening care for B six nights a week. </span></p>

At this time Dr J and her colleagues at Hospital E were considering weaning B off CPAP. With the support of the social worker and Dr K, the mother sought a referral to another tertiary centre. The preferred tertiary centre was expressed to be the Hospital F. In December both children were admitted to Hospital A for respiratory infections. B was also seen for the first time by Dr B at the Hospital F.</span></p>

The rate of infections and need for treatment by antibiotic was increasing, with B at times having to attend hospital up to three times a day to receive her intravenous antibiotics, giving rise later in the year to concerns about a considerable risk of B becoming resistant to antibiotics.  </span></p>

Such were the concerns of Nurse B (nurse at Hospital A) about the mother&#8217;s personal relationship with the social worker that she challenged Ms X about her objectivity and ability to raise safeguarding issues. The mother also became close to Ms C who was an administrative assistant at Hospital A. This relationship soon began to cross professional boundaries. During this period, the mother also became &#8216;friends&#8217; with Dr K on a social media platform and was given Dr K&#8217;s personal mobile telephone that she used to message her. This period was also marked by an apparent growing divide between some of the nursing staff and the treating doctors at Hospital A, with the former becoming concerned about some of the aspects of the children&#8217;s presentation and the inconsistencies between their presentation at hospital and as reported by the mother.  </span></p>

The family was due to go on holiday and the mother was trained to provide intravenous antibiotics for A, however they needed to return home as A&#8217;s line had become blocked and required replacement. B continued to present frequently at Hospital A and Nurse B began to question if B was using the CPAP machine more than required.

Within the multidisciplinary team meetings, concern was raised about the number of blood transfusions that B had undergone and the fact that she had unexpectedly maintained normal ferritin levels. It was agreed that there should be a structured two to three week admission to observe and better investigate B. At around this time there were concerns about A&#8217;s PICC line which was later changed to a port-catheter. A used to become highly distressed when her Portacath was accessed and at times required to be restrained. In the autumn months the mother raised increasing concerns about the nursing staff at Hospital A. In the same period she had a termination which was privately funded by the social worker. The year concluded with Dr B delighting in B&#8217;s progress with respiratory issues and expressing a hope that she could stop using CPAP. </span></p>

Until May, the children continued to present regularly to the hospital. A had an extended period of admission. With knowledge of A&#8217;s resistance to her port being accessed, Nurse B began to raise concerns about why A was admitted to the hospital at all given that she seemed well. Following an admission with fever and concerns over her port, A was inserted with a new line under general anaesthetic.  Later in April she was admitted to Hospital C where her port was changed with a portacath and released to the care of Hospital A. During her stay at Hospital C and for her return home, A was prescribed Oramorph (morphine). In March, B was also admitted to the hospital with intermittent elevated temperature and erratic blood sugar readings.</span></p>

Later, it became apparent that the charity had raised these concerns which in turn may have contributed to a deterioration in the engagement with their services. At the mother&#8217;s request, their dealings with the family ended in late February. In March, the parents approached a local hospice that provided support for children with life limiting conditions. Later in a meeting with N at Hospital A, the mother raised her concerns about coping with so many hospital admissions and wishing to have more care for the children at home. At around this time Nurse B was raising further concerns about the mother &#8216;dictating&#8217; A&#8217;s care. Concerns about A&#8217;s emotional wellbeing continued with the mother describing her as self-harming, withdrawn and scared of becoming unwell.

A large crack was observed to the side of the machine. B remained under close observation and her urine samples for 18 and 19 May 2022 (received on 23 and 25 May) respectively indicated a positive result for chlorphenamine and trimethoprim, neither of which was prescribed for B. On 20 May there was a plan to assess B without Creon and Dr I discussed the findings of the sleep studies with the mother. In Dr I&#8217;s view the elevated CO2 levels and low respiratory rates were not entirely consistent with symptoms of airway obstruction and inconsistent with there being no low respiratory rate in the first few nights of admission when B was using CPAP.

He explained that whilst the presence of many other drugs that were detected in B&#8217;s samples is explained as drugs that were prescribed to her, the presence of the above three drugs in B&#8217;s samples cannot be explained. In summary he opined chlorphenamine was administered to B one or more days before 18 May 2022 but unlikely to be before 11 May 2022, trimethoprim on or close to 19 May 2022 and morphine on three occasions between 20 and 26 May 2022. He expressed his opinion to be with a high degree of certainty in respect of there being two occasions of administration of morphine and on a balance of probabilities a third during the same period. In his opinion, the high readings of morphine in the urine samples and taking account of the length of time between the 19 to 22 May, it would be</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> &#8216;extremely unlikely&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000">that there was a single administration of morphine. Furthermore, the subsequent high reading on 26 May would not have persisted from a single dose that was administered on 20 May. Taking into account the subsequent negative results, he concludes that there were three administrations of morphine during this period.  </span></p>

Mr Scott-Ham raised some concerns about the accreditation of the laboratory. He was clear that the process adopted was entirely appropriate for clinical purposes and the purposes of this court, describing the analysis as not being &#8216;good&#8217; but &#8216;not bad&#8217;.

Having considered his evidence, I am entirely satisfied that the test results are sufficiently reliable to be taken into account as part of the overall evidence. Furthermore, the detailed clinical evidence does not support contamination as a contributing factor. This evidence includes the process by which the urine sample was collected, stored and sent for testing as well as the lack of any evidence that there were any known sources of morphine on the ward at the relevant time. Furthermore, the pattern of the results in themselves is inconsistent with contamination contributing to the readings. This makes the hypothesis of contamination most unlikely.</span></p>

Within the grab bag the police found a purple syringe and tube. On instructions from the police, these were subsequently tested by Eurofins Forensic Services and their report dated 17 February 2023 confirms that there were traces of morphine and chlorphenamine in the syringe and morphine in the tube. At the close of evidence, the police provided a statement that attests to the continuity of the chain of custody of these items. This statement has not been challenged. There is no proper foundation for suggesting that these items were not placed in the suitcase before coming to the hospital or that any person other than the mother had placed these items in the grab bag and then in the suitcase.  </span></p>

Whilst she deferred to the expertise of Mr Scott-Ham and Dr Hawcutt, she too identified the morphine as an opiate analgesic with common side effects that include small pupils, decreased responsiveness, drowsiness, fever, reduced respiratory rate and heart rate, and increased carbon dioxide retention. Among the several side effects of chlorpheniramine include drowsiness, lack of sweat production, increased heart rate, reduced consciousness and blood pressure as well as reduced respiratory rate that runs the risk of hypoxia. Finally, the side effects of trimethoprim include diarrhoea, difficulties with breathing and shortness of breath.

This was finally fractured after Dr J, who was the Respiratory Consultant in charge of B&#8217;s care at the Hospital E, expressed a view that the reported desaturation events with B were episodes of &#8216;self-gratification&#8217;. With the support of Dr K, the mother sought a second opinion and the Hospital F was mentioned as one of the alternative tertiary centres. I accept Dr J&#8217;s evidence that at this point there was no transfer of care to Hospital F but merely the commissioning of a second opinion. Indeed there were discussions led by Dr J about weaning B off CPAP. It is noteworthy that the mother was suggesting that Hospital F was a suitable alternative tertiary service and was requesting a transfer of B&#8217;s care to the Hospital F.</span></p>

Subsequently, Dr B referred B to Dr O, a Consultant in Paediatric Gastroenterology at Hospital F, for a further consideration of SDS. Indeed B was under the care of a multidisciplinary team that was looking into a number of perplexing presentations without a unifying diagnosis. With a shared growing concern, the team agreed that B should be admitted for a planned multidisciplinary review. B was offered an admission in December which was refused by the mother on the grounds that it was too close to Christmas. This invitation was repeated again in January 2022 which was not accepted by the mother stating A was too unwell, then again in February, which was not followed up by the Hospital F, then finally there were discussions for admission in June and significantly discussions on the 5 May, the details of which have been the subject of much dispute.</span></p>

It asserts that these contradict the mother&#8217;s account that A was admitted to Hospital A in the morning of 5 May and further invites the court to find that when considered with other evidence, it illustrates a reluctance by the mother to agree to B&#8217;s admission to the Hospital F for a planned study. </span></p>

It is entirely expected that a parent should have some anxiety or reluctance to agree to a long period of study in hospital for their child especially in the challenging circumstances that these parents found themselves. Whilst the mother was keen for B&#8217;s care to be transferred to the Hospital F, the evidence when considered as a whole, illustrates a growing reluctance on her part for B&#8217;s admission for a sleep study. This is a small part of the evidence that is understandable and must be assessed as part of the totality of the evidence that includes the fact of B&#8217;s admission to Hospital F later in May which was agreed to by the parents. However, the mother&#8217;s account of the events of the 5 May was contradictory and clearly unsustainable in the face of the clinical evidence that was corroborated by the relevant notes of that day.  </span></p>

On 20 May 2022, Dr I informed the mother of the initial finding of the sleep study that demonstrated low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide readings and a low respiratory rate despite being on CPAP. These findings together with variations in the readings were perplexing and not explained by any known factors. This was particularly concerning as the addition of oxygen to CPAP seemed not to have any impact on the readings. These observations were also consistent with the previously expressed concerns of Dr B and Dr J about the perplexing presentation of B. It is not disputed that following the mother&#8217;s arrest, the sleep study continued, returning normal readings. In Dr I&#8217;s view, there is a corresponding connection between the timing of the administration of the sedative drugs and B&#8217;s presentation that leads her to conclude that the administration of a sedative, including morphine, is the most probable explanation for the results of B&#8217;s sleep study. The evidence about B&#8217;s presentation during the relevant periods is not sufficiently cogent for me to place any weight upon it. </span></p>

At times, the transfusions were given in clusters. Miss Stone KC and Miss Quinn have very helpfully set these out in a table that is based on B&#8217;s medical records and include some of the transfusions that were not picked up by the experts in the case. The general pattern shows that there were two transfusions in 2019, nineteen in 2020 with three over two days in January and the remaining sixteen given between 29 July to 28 December. In 2021 B received six transfusions over three weeks, including three in one week. There were another thirty from 10 February to 28 December 2021. Finally she received a further two transfusions in January 2022, one in February and one in March of the same year. B was given these transfusions as she was presenting with anaemia which appears not to have resolved over the majority of the above stated period despite the ongoing treatment.</span></p>

He has provided a report and gave oral testimony in this hearing when he was extensively challenged in cross-examination. Dr Keenan&#8217;s opinion is based on there being forty-eight blood transfusions in the above stated period. There is no criticism levied at Dr Keenan given the state and the volume of the medical records. The additional transfusions have further fortified his opinion. In summary, Dr Keenan was unable to identify a clinical reason for B&#8217;s anaemia and the need for such an extraordinary number of blood transfusions.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in"><span style="color:#000000">In his opinion there are two fundamental issues with B&#8217;s presentation and treatment. The first is the lack of any evidence of post-transfusion iron build up. He explained that the human body cannot actively excrete iron. The blood that is transfused into the body contains iron and with multiple transfusions, there would be a build-up of iron. B also had additional infusions for anaemia. This can only be explained by significant blood loss of which there is no evidence. There was no evidence of material occult gastrointestinal blood loss or any other blood loss. The taking of blood samples is not of sufficient volume that would explain the lack of expected volume of iron build up. </span></p>

The number and the cluster of transfusions was not something that Dr Keenan had experienced before and he found it to be highly unusual. In light of these factors, Dr Keenan concludes that the only plausible explanation for B&#8217;s unexplained presentation is that for several years significant amounts of blood were withdrawn from her.</span></p>

Blood siphoning by a parent was outside the experience of both experts with Dr Ward observing that such behaviour by a parent would be among the most serious behaviour in FII cases.</span></p>

In his statement (dated 26 May 2022), Dr Z sets out the history of the referral to his team which was made by Dr K in the context of investigation for SDS. The investigations involved two bone marrow aspirates that were undertaken on 2 October 2020 and repeated on 5 August 2021. The results were consistent with anaemia with no abnormality in the bone marrow. In his statement, Dr Z addresses the issue of iron loading and for the same reasons as set out above, he concludes that:</span></p>

The reported concerns by the mother date back to the early periods in A&#8217;s life and continued throughout the majority of her life. Her first admission in this regard was in January 2016 after reports by the mother that A was floppy and suffering with stridor. This caused her to undergo a sleep EEG with results in the normal range without any identified issues. She underwent a home sleep study in February of the same year with very worrying results including thirty-four episodes of desaturation which was contrary to the subsequent observations on the ward at Hospital A where no abnormalities were observed. A was under the care of a tertiary specialist team (Hospital B) where she underwent further sleep studies in April and May 2016 in which no abnormalities were identified. </span></p>

He too observed no abnormalities that would explain the reported concerns about A&#8217;s breathing and episodes of desaturation. There are a number of examples over a significant period where the mother&#8217;s reported concerns about A&#8217;s breathing are contradicted by the professional observations. Dr V discontinued the use of Clenil (inhaler) earlier in 2017. However, three months later, based on the mother&#8217;s report of breathing difficulties, Dr K prescribed its use again. The theme of inconsistency between the maternal report of breathing difficulties and clinical observations continued in 2018 and 2019, with evidence suggesting that the mother was not accurately reporting A&#8217;s symptoms or the clinical observations from one clinician to another. A&#8217;s CT scan in June 2018 showed no evidence of abnormalities despite the mother reporting to Dr K that there was evidence of scarring. For example, in December 2019, the mother is recorded as reporting to Dr K that A had required six out of hours consultations with the relevant records showing three consultations and in the subsequent clinical observation of A describing her as normal.  In March 2019, the mother wrongly reported to A&#8217;s health visitor that A&#8217;s salbutamol dosage had been increased by Dr V. </span></p>

Therefore, the disconnect between the mother&#8217;s description of A&#8217;s symptoms, the profound differences in the results of the home sleep studies and those undertaken in a clinical setting, the lack of any underlying medical condition and the mother&#8217;s inaccurate sharing of information, inform the core of the local authority&#8217;s allegations against the mother.</span></p>

Examples include a study in January 2016 where the mother described A as having a &#8216;big breathing episode&#8217; which was not corroborated by any other evidence and contradicted by the normal test results. Similarly in February of the same year mother is recorded as reporting to different professionals very concerning results from a home sleep study that were contradicted by a sleep study in Hospital A with results within the normal range. Furthermore, during the sleep studies in April and May 2016, the mother reported that A had not slept well, which was contradicted by the outcome of the two sleep studies. The home sleep studies in November 2021 and the clinical sleep study of March 2022 at Hospital A have each returned very concerning results. Mr F who is an ENT Consultant (EPH) observed that the results of the home in November 2021 were </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;quite dramatic&#8221;. </span><span style="color:#000000">In his evidence, Dr V observed that A had very unusual results in these two sleep studies that could not be explained by any underlying medical condition, any infection or cold. In the period between the two studies, A underwent a tonsillectomy. Given the reported respiratory difficulties, Dr V expected A to have very large tonsils to the extent that they would be touching so as to obstruct the airway.

The use of the CPAP was then guided by a plan that was to be implemented by the parents. CPAP was initiated in November 2018 and although it was not intended to be a long-term part of her treatment, it remained a dominant feature of B&#8217;s life until 2022.

However, he was confident that the combination of these still images illustrated a narrowing of the trachea in 2018 with mild abnormality and most of the airway tree being patent together with normal vascularity that negated Malacia compression. The 2019 images showed a &#8216;classically normal&#8217; trachea.  Finally, he agreed that the 2022 sleep studies demonstrated that any Malacia was not having any notable impact on her gas exchange or breathing. These factors did not support the continuing use of CPAP. The evidence is clear that there was no underlying medical condition that would explain B&#8217;s continued respiratory prestation and use of CPAP. </span></p>

Dr J stated that clinically, B was progressing well but there was a disconnect between the reported episodes of tachypnoea, noisy breathing and desaturation. She found B to be well when she saw her. Such were her concerns that she suggested that B be admitted to Hospital A under the care of a multidisciplinary team to undertake a comprehensive investigation. In a telephone conversation with Dr B (Hospital F) in January 2020, for the first time she raised the possibility that there may be an element of </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;secondary gain by parents&#8221;</span><span style="color:#000000">.  </span></p>

These range from November 2017 to May 2022. It is unnecessary for me to set these out in detail but record that in the main they are supported by reliable clinical evidence. These examples include unremarkable findings in the November 2017 sleep study despite the mother reporting a &#8216;drop in her stats and grunting&#8217;, in March 2018 mother reported that B had almost no cry but on examination she was found to be healthy with a good strong cry, in October 2019 professionals did not observe any of the mother&#8217;s reported difficulties with respiratory secretion and multiple sleep studies that found B to be within the expected range contrary to the mother&#8217;s reports of B&#8217;s presentation.</span></p>

I agree that the evidence is far from clear about the frequency and degree of observations during this stated period. Similarly, they  submit that whilst the mother negotiated the terms of discharging B home for a period on 8 November 2020, Dr J did not have sufficient concern about this so as to require the mother to sign &#8216;discharge against medical advice form&#8217; and he further noted the mother would be cooperative and she returned B to the hospital at 21.50 where she stayed overnight.</span></p>

The examples include mother reporting longer desaturation episodes at Hospital E in September 2018 when the staff observed self-resolving fleeting episodes where the mother did not call for assistance despite her assertion in evidence that she would have done so had the episodes lasted for three or more minutes. Furthermore, B&#8217;s CPAP plan required her to attend hospital if she required oxygen. The mother was dissatisfied with this and sought to manage this at home. At the same time in September 2019 the mother did not call for an ambulance despite reporting that B had desaturated to about 60%, had stopped breathing and was cyanotic. In this regard, Dr Ward makes a general observation that the mother initiated an interaction with the hospital that pushed for more care to be undertaken at home and yet undermined what was being done at home which was in her opinion an emergent pattern. </span></p>

She did not take B to the hospital. This was in contradiction to the mother&#8217;s evidence that she would have called an ambulance if there was a serious incident. In November of the same year mother allowed B to sleep without her CPAP or an oxygen monitor. Thus the local authority submits that the mother must have been aware that B did not require the degree and levels of medical intervention that she has been exposed to. </span></p>

Importantly, it also provided for oxygen to be administered at the local hospital should she require it. There is no dispute that the terms of the care plan were breached. Indeed Hospital A from time to time authorised and facilitated the use of Oxygen at home. The evidence is also clear that on many occasions the mother requested for oxygen to be administered at home. As she explained in her evidence, the children spent a lot of time in the hospital environment and she wished to reduce traveling to and from the hospital. This is entirely understandable given the experiences of the family but must be balanced against the strict advice from the respiratory team at the Hospital E. This must further be considered against a background of  emerging divergence of opinion between the medics at Hospital A and those at Hospital E especially in respect of the diagnosis of self-gratification by Hospital E. In what was at best a confusing picture for the parents, the evidence does not reach the required degree of cogency so as to justify the findings as sought and the local authority did not pursue its findings in that respect in closing. </span></p>

There are no continuing respiratory issues with A, who underwent further sleep studies in May 2022 with normal results.

CPAP provides a positive flow of air which can be set to different pressures, with a setting at ten or above being used in the most extreme cases. In this instance the settings were prescribed and set by the Hospital E and required the clinician&#8217;s permission to be changed. In this context the local authority asserts that the mother did not adhere to the plan and had B on CPAP for longer than was required, necessary or prescribed by the plan. Furthermore, she initiated changes in the settings that ultimately increased the pressure beyond that which was prescribed and did not engage with the assessments to reduce her use of CPAP. </span></p>

The first prescription was for use during sleep which then extended to use up to four hours during the day if unwell or tired, and finally its use in a push chair and in the car when travelling. Whilst there is a general perception and assertion of &#8216;over use&#8217; of the CPAP by the nursing staff, in my judgment such an assertion does not withstand a closer scrutiny of the evolving CPAP plan and the contemporaneous evidence which collectively or individually do not reach the requisite degree of certainty to make such a finding. Furthermore, as I have already observed, there can be little doubt that the mother was requesting the administration of oxygen at home or otherwise outside the CPAP plan, but the evidence in this regards paints a confusing picture that the parents were presented with and does not reach the requisite evidential threshold for the court to make the findings that are sought. </span></p>

Whilst I have carefully considered the evidence in respect of each example/allegation, it is the collective picture that these speak to and inform the findings about the overall parental behaviour. The evidence is clear that the use of  CPAP was prescribed by Dr J and was the subject of continuing reviews that were in turn informed by clinical findings and the parental report of B&#8217;s presentation and use of CPAP. At times the mother&#8217;s reports were inaccurate and this is illustrated in her exchanges with Nurse B in November 2018 when she was wrongly informed that Hospital E had advised to increase B&#8217;s CPAP settings from six to seven. The evidence is also clear that in the context of a disagreement that was supported by Dr K, with Hospital E about a diagnosis of self-gratification, the mother&#8217;s relationship with Hospital E became increasingly fractured leading to a referral to the Hospital F for a second opinion. In my assessment of the mother&#8217;s evidence, she became increasingly invested in the Hospital F referral propelling her to advocating for the Hospital F to take charge of B&#8217;s care. In this context, she disengaged with the services at Hospital E at a crucial time when Hospital E wanted to explore the possibility of weaning B off CPAP. The  mother&#8217;s conduct in relation to the use of CPAP was clearly worrying Dr J to an extent that she raised safeguarding concerns in January 2020. </span></p>

The expert evidence that I have set out earlier in this part and those of the clinicians, clearly supports a finding that B did not require CPAP to the extent that it was used between 2019 and 2020. </span></p>

Turning to the first issue, Dr Ward explains in her report that the issues of pancreatic insufficiency arose in the context of faltering growth, suspicion of Cystic Fibrosis in light of the respiratory issues and loose stools at around the time when B was suspected to have SDS which is also associated with pancreatic insufficiency. She further explains that the umbrella diagnosis of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency can be caused by different conditions that include Cystic Fibrosis and SDS. There is no evidence that would support a diagnosis of either of these conditions. Whatever the diagnosis, the symptoms often include loose stools, fatty stools and poor growth. In the instant case the faecal elastase tests were normal indicating no significant Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency. However, if a child is found to be suffering with such a condition, the treatment would include PERT prescribed as Creon.

He stopped A&#8217;s prescription for Creon  during her admission to Hospital B in 2016 three days after Dr Z had prescribed it in Dr S&#8217;s absence.

The trial was in fact for three days and Dr K felt that A should have a longer period on Creon which led to a further prescription for Creon. Dr S&#8217;s evidence as set out in his statement and oral testimony was clear and insightful leaving no doubt that his advice to the family about the causes and treatment of A&#8217;s digestive issues was clear and the mother chose to ignore this. It is also clear to me that the mother was giving professionals including Dr K inaccurate information that led to unnecessary prescriptions of Creon. The evidence from A, father and nurse Parsons also demonstrated that A was not given Creon consistently when it was prescribed, thus raising the concern that the mother was aware that she did not require it. For reasons that are set out by Miss Howe KC and Miss Harrill and submissions on behalf of the children, I have approached the evidence of each of them cautiously. However, the main thrust of their collective evidence provides additional texture to the overall evidential landscape.

At twelve weeks old, A presented to Hospital A at 2300 hours on 30 September 2015. The main complaint was about her breathing and also included reference to poor feeding, lack of weight gain and projectile vomiting.  On assessment, she appears to be within normal expected range of presentation. By 5 September 2016 clinicians at Hospital B observed the mother to be feeding her appropriately and A displaying great interest in her food. The evidence is also clear that the mother displayed great anxiety around feeding issues. </span></p>

It is submitted on behalf of the mother that their evidence must be weighed cautiously as their evidence in this regard is in the context of a &#8216;high index of suspicion&#8217; generated by the police investigation and not entirely reflected in the medical records. These four nurses were among the very first practitioners to raise concerns about the children&#8217;s perplexing presentation. I have no doubt that the police investigation and the subsequent emerging evidence has added weight to their long-standing concerns. I found them each to be professional and balanced in their evidence. It was also clear that they each displayed a degree of frustration and regret that appropriate intervention for these did not come sooner.</span></p>

She also described the mother as controlling and exerting influence on clinical decisions. A was suffering with sepsis and was inserted an NG tube whilst at the Hospital C in the winter of 2022. She was then discharged to Hospital A. Nurse B also stated that the mother had inaccurately told the Hospital A team that Hospital C advised that the NG tube was to remain in, which was clearly incorrect.  The mother denies these allegations and states that all decisions were made pursuant to clinical observations and by lead clinicians. She accepts that all feeding issues in A were stopped once she was removed from her care but denies that she has ever raised any significant feeding issues other than in her infancy. </span></p>

The former follows a broadly similar path to those in relation to A. It is alleged that B was prescribed Creon with an increased dosage due to the mother&#8217;s false and or exaggerated account of B&#8217;s diarrhoea. The local authority further alleges that the mother has tampered with B&#8217;s stool samples so as to give them an oily appearance that would be consistent with the need for continued use of Creon.  The mother denies that allegation but accepts that once Creon was stopped in May 2022, B&#8217;s stool had a normal appearance and her diarrhoea resolved once she was in foster care. She further accepts that there was no objective evidence B suffered with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency. She states that she genuinely believed that B was deriving benefit from Creon. </span></p>

Dr K was clear that but for very few examples of observed diarrhoea, the hospital was reliant on the mother&#8217;s account of the same. In her view there was objective evidence of B suffering with pancreatic insufficiency. Similarly, her decision to prescribe Creon for B was informed by the mother&#8217;s report of B&#8217;s symptoms. However, Dr Ward observed that the continued use of Creon was out of habit and B appeared to be improving on Creon. Clearly this is a view that would have supported the mother in her belief that B was benefiting from taking Creon. </span></p>

Nurse BD was a home nurse who started working with the family in September 2019 and in her statement she explains that she understood B to have a multiple diagnosis including that ranged from speech delay, mild autism and respiratory issues.

This makes it all the more surprising that B was not taken to the planned video fluoroscopies that would have addressed this issue. As Miss Stone KC and Miss Quinn submit, there appears to be a disconnect between the mother&#8217;s reported difficulties and the professional observations. They cite ten examples covering the period between 2018 and 2019 which would have put the mother in the knowledge that the video fluoroscopy was being considered and it being an important feature of the investigations into this issue. B was subsequently discharged from the service due to non-attendance. The mother&#8217;s assertion that B was too unwell to attend the first planned video fluoroscopy is contradicted by the clinical notes. Whilst I accept this was at a time when she was wanting Hospital F to take over B&#8217;s care from Hospital E, it does not explain why this was not followed up by her or why she had not sought the assistance of Dr K.</span></p>

Similarly, whilst the mother may have been very concerned about her medical records being accessed for the purposes of a Strategy Meeting, convened after concerns about a possible domestic abuse incident at the family home, the evidence is clear that she was seeking to gain a degree of control by stating that she was advised to move to another hospital.

Whilst on its own, this may not amount to a serious charge and might have been explained as a &#8216;mismatch&#8217; in approach that required realignment, in the context of the overall evidence, it may serve as another example of the mother seeking to step outside the plans and exert a degree of control. </span></p>

Importantly, Dr K was clear that she had no knowledge of any offers of admission to the Hospital F that would have flowed from her initial referral, thus suggesting that the mother had not raised the issue of admission with Dr K nor did she ask her to follow this up, especially after the difficulties and confusion about admission in February of the same year. It is also clear that the medical notes evidence the mother refusing permission for B to be admitted for observations in September 2021.

A was already being seen by Dr V. In light of the concerns about A, on 16 August 2021 he arranged a microlaryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and adenoidectomy. He found A to be presenting within the expected normal range. The family continued to report snoring and sleep apnoea leading to a Coblation Intracapsular Tonsillectomy with no complications. On 23 February 2022 mother reported ongoing concerns with chronic cough and snoring with no improvement post-surgery. The clinical findings were once again within the normal range but there was a discussion about managing her with an inhaler and Montelukast. </span></p>

He also explained that the prescription of Dexamethasone was not appropriate when A was not suffering with recurrent croup. As previously recorded above given the unexpected results of the February 2022 sleep study, he expected A to have very large tonsils which proved not to be the case. Whilst the decision to perform any surgery is a clinical decision, in the context of A&#8217;s ongoing perplexing presentation, the mother&#8217;s reports of ongoing difficulties would have played a significant role in the decision to operate on A and to prescribe her the medication for the management of her reported ongoing respiratory issues. </span></p>

There is a raft of evidence that the local authority correctly relies on. Most notably, Dr Ward&#8217;s evidence makes it clear that in a consultation with the NHS 111 services in November 2016, the mother stated that A was awaiting a possible diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis that was already proved not to be the case through genetic testing. She also stated to the community nurse in December 2017 that A should not attend a Child Health Clinic as she may have Cystic Fibrosis. This was clearly not consistent with the information that the mother was privy to, that showed the opposite. </span></p>

There is no diagnosis of SDS and the medical evidence is very clear in this regard. Professor H, who is a highly regarded geneticist , undertook the genetic testing in this regard. None of these conditions have ever existed in B.  The height of the evidence of SDS was the identification of one gene  that was insufficient to support a diagnosis for SDS in the absence of all other expected presentations that can include dysmorphic facial features. In respect of the latter, there are two relevant observations by Dr K in October 2020 and Dr T in September 2020. All other relevant description of B&#8217;s asserted dysmorphic features appear to originate from the mother and the two clinical observations above were in the context of these descriptions having already been raised by the mother years earlier.</span></p>

She further submits that the evidence does not illustrate that she was strongly pushing for this. Similarly, she was requesting a prescription for a costly nebuliser that is again used for patients with Cystic Fibrosis. However, this medication is usually used for patients with Cystic Fibrosis which was confirmed through testing that B was not suffering with. She also accepts requesting the varicella vaccine for B, which she explains was routinely used for patients who are vulnerable to infections and health workers. This she says was reasonable given the amount of time B was spending in the hospital. In my judgment her request would be entirely reasonable if it was reasonable for B to spend so much of her life in the hospital environment. </span></p>

It is submitted on behalf of the mother that her evidence must be considered with a degree of caution and that it has taken a gloss post the arrest of the parents and the events that unfolded in the Hospital F in May 2022. In my judgment these factors do not detract from the powerful and insightful evidence that she gave to the court. Her concerns included the children having too many lines and procedures that were often provided too quickly. Her experience of the mother was contrary to her experience of other families that fight against intrusive procedures. The overall evidence paints a clear picture of A growing up believing herself to be chronically ill, that she had  recurrent hospital admissions, suffered pain and discomfort through unnecessary medical treatment, was exposed to the side effects of unnecessary medication and repeated investigations, together with exposure to the risk of medical complications through a high turnover of lines that were displaced and damaged, which led to infection and thrombosis. A was prescribed prophylactic antibiotics that in the unchallenged opinion of Dr Ward placed her at risk of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and possible increased resistance to antibiotics.  I will deal with the mother&#8217;s role and the clinical decisions leading to unnecessary procedures later in this judgment. </span></p>

The factual assertions in this regard are not disputed by the mother. When she was challenged about this she was very distressed which is entirely understandable. She also explained that A&#8217;s distress was at times such that the mother absented herself during the intervention.

However, the evidence is also clear that both through correspondence and discussions with the parents, they were left in no doubt that neither child was ever diagnosed as having SDS or indeed Cystic Fibrosis. This gives a solid foundation to the local authority&#8217;s assertions that B was brought up wrongly as a child with SDS.

Furthermore there can be no doubt B was exposed to significant unnecessary investigation that, as pleaded by the local authority, included seven hospitals, fifteen special paediatric consultants, one general paediatric consultant and a number of nurses including those on a rota to provide night care at home during the week.  Furthermore, with the assistance of Dr K and an enquiry from the social worker, B was referred to Hospice A and the mother further pursued a referral to Hospice B which provided support for terminally ill children.

There can be no doubt that at times she treated the children contrary to the specialist advice, with examples including the prescription of Creon with a false impression that it was helping, Oxygen used at home contrary to the CPAP Home Ventilation Plan, various infusions and treating B on the basis of a working diagnosis of SDS. </span></p>

Therefore, she contributed to the emerging division between the clinicians at Hospital A and created an atmosphere in which the nurses faced obstacles in raising their concerns. </span></p>

The social worker&#8217;s career came to an end under the heavy cloud of her unprofessional behaviour towards this family. She was ready to accept responsibility for breaking professional boundaries but was avoidant and less than frank in other important respects.

Both the mother and the social worker were in my judgment untruthful about the social worker telephoning the mother during professional meetings and allowing her to listen in. She readily agreed the inappropriateness of the text exchanges with the mother in which the nurses and Hospital A were referred to in highly disparaging and profane terms. She believed B in particular to be very ill and her motivations to find support for the family soon turned to a highly inappropriate relationship where she became one of the mother&#8217;s directing arms.</span></p>

She spent significant time in the witness box that was punctuated with many long breaks that together with other measures have ensured that she was able to properly participate in giving her evidence. In evidence, she appeared to have a notably detailed knowledge of the medical conditions, treatments and the general chronology for each of the children and her interactions with the professional. However, this was in direct contrast to her evidence when she was challenged on the main issues when she displayed a remarkable paucity of knowledge or any detailed recollection of the events and was unwilling to properly address the questions. At times she gave an untruthful or misleading account and other times she professed to have no recollection or knowledge of important events. The mother accepted no responsibility in a meaningful way for any of the important events in the children&#8217;s lives and in the main sought to hide behind the argument that she was acting on professional advice. Whilst it is entirely correct that the professionals had the ultimate responsibility to maintain professional boundaries or to make appropriate decisions for the children&#8217;s treatment, the mother&#8217;s manifest failure to recognise her contribution to the children&#8217;s horrific experiences was profound.

Her attempts at explaining the misleading information that she provided to the treating medics for many years was among the most troubling aspects of her evidence.  In the face of a catalogue of expert and clinical evidence that lays a clear path to identifying her disturbing role in causing such intolerable harm to the children, she was unable to display any degree of acknowledgement of her contributions to the children&#8217;s lives. I have no doubt that she understood the evidence, but it may be all too horrific for her to face up to. </span></p>

This soon became focused on A&#8217;s presentation outside the expected norms which was not supported by independent objective observation. B&#8217;s arrival was an important milestone that saw an increasing interest by the mother in the children presenting as unwell. Whilst some of these presentations were justified in the early stages and were anxiety provoking, the emerging picture over the ensuing years was not. With the passing months, the mother became increasingly invested in the children presenting as unwell and exploring ever expanding avenues to persuade the professionals to undertake more investigations of the children&#8217;s health. B was a particular focus for the mother. The mother&#8217;s increasing confidence and justification in her approach was fuelled by a number of professionals who could not identify a root cause for the children&#8217;s perplexing presentation.</span></p>

She collected a small group of trusted professionals through whose agency she began to control the trajectory of the children&#8217;s treatment. Before long she was a saintly figure who  stopped at nothing to fight for her children. She found further reward in the social recognition and the attention that she was gaining from friends, family, professionals and on social media. The mother developed a dangerously casual  relationship with medication that included morphine which is a controlled drug and potentially lethal if administered incorrectly. In the meantime the children were living in a highly abusive environment. Their respite from their regular hospital admissions was a return to a highly medicalised home environment. The pictures of the children&#8217;s bedroom show it more closely resemble a makeshift paediatric bay in a hospital that was supported by cupboards full of medication and medical equipment. The children&#8217;s home life was under a constant invasion by professionals.</span></p>

In 2020 B&#8217;s life took a sinister turn where the mother&#8217;s focus turned to her respiratory issues and anaemia. She began to covertly siphon blood from B&#8217;s central line which caused her anaemia and exposed her to a disturbing number of blood transfusions and treatments. When faced with the prospect of B having less intervention, she began to undermine the medical opinion that informed such decisions and ultimately disengaged with the services that were considering this. Her anxieties around the admission to the Hospital F were rooted in her concern that this may spell the end of the path that she had travelled for some years. When faced with no option but to agree to B&#8217;s admission to the Hospital F, she consolidated her efforts to present B as unwell and embarked on an extraordinarily dangerous path that may have put B&#8217;s life in danger and ultimately led to the children&#8217;s removal from the parents&#8217; care. </span></p>

However, these were all mild and would be expected either to resolve spontaneously over a period of months or years (gastroesophageal reflux, non-IgE mediated cow&#8217;s milk intolerance, sporadic croup) or to be amenable to treatment in a community setting (recurrent viral infections, constipation). In the absence of an overarching serious medical condition, these conditions did not require regular hospitalisation and intensive treatment with intravenous antibiotics, nasogastric feeding, parenteral nutrition and other interventions.</p>
