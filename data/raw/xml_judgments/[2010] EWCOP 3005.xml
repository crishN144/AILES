	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31 July 2007, I made various orders in relation to two persons who were patients under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. The two persons concerned were husband and wife, Mr E. T. G (hereafter &#8220;Mr G&#8221;) and Mrs T. J. G (hereafter &#8220;Mrs G&#8221;). At that time, I gave a detailed judgment explaining the circumstances of the two cases, the legal provisions which applied and my reasons for making the orders. The neutral citation of that judgment is <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2007/1861" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 1861 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 1861 (Ch)</ref> and it is reported as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re G (ET) (A Patient)</span> [2008] WTLR 599.</p>

On 7 January 2010 Mr G died.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> The orders I made on 31 July 2007 concerned both Mr G and Mrs G. Some of those orders have been fully complied with. Other orders have been given effect but questions have now arisen as to the continuing effect of those orders in the period following the death of Mr G and hereafter. Other orders have not been carried to fruition because of difficulties that have been encountered along the way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 February 2009, that is even before Mr G died, Senior Judge Lush directed that there should be a hearing to consider the progress made in relation to the orders of 31 July 2007. On 16 March 2009, he directed that such a hearing should be listed before me. On 19 April 2010 and 30 June 2010, I gave directions as to the steps which should be taken before any such hearing took place and as to the scope of that hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The review hearing duly took place on 10 November 2010. The Deputy was represented by Miss Barbara Rich. The Official Solicitor, who had been appointed as a litigation friend for Mrs G, was represented by Mr David Rees. Mr and Mrs G&#8217;s daughter, whom I referred to in my earlier judgment as C, was represented by Mr Michael King. Mr and Mrs G&#8217;s son, whom I referred to in my earlier judgment as N, did not formally appear at the hearing and was not represented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the hearing, there had been considerable disagreement and uncertainty on a large number of matters. Many of those matters, such as the effect of the liquidation (from May 2010) of the family company (which I referred to in my earlier judgment as GCL), and the rights of Mr and Mrs G under a company pension scheme, could not be finally determined in these proceedings in the Court of Protection as they involved persons who were not parties to these proceedings. Further, the parties directly concerned in these proceedings were not agreed on many matters arising in the proceedings themselves.</p>

I am sure that this turn of events owes a great deal to the efforts of the very experienced counsel who have been instructed in this case, supported by their instructing solicitors, and ultimately the good sense of their clients.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing, I was able to indicate to the parties that I was readily able to approve the greater part of the draft order. In view of the fact that there were no issues raised by the parties as to those parts of the draft order and those parts do not raise any question of general principle, it is not necessary to set out in this judgment what those provisions are, nor the reasons why I am prepared to make these parts of the order in the terms proposed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, there was one part of the suggested draft order which seemed to me to involve a question of general principle. In summary, the draft order contained terms directing the Deputy to make payments from Mrs G&#8217;s funds to her adult daughter, C, by way of maintenance of C. The parties agreed that I could only make an order in those terms if I was satisfied in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> that such an order was in the best interests of Mrs G. Although the parties were agreed between themselves that I had power to make the order, and no one proposed to make submissions to the effect that I should not make the order, I felt that I would benefit from a detailed investigation of the matter and I invited counsel to assist me with their submissions as to why this part of the proposed order was in the best interests of Mrs G, within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>. Counsel were able to offer considerable assistance on that score and I am now able to reach my conclusion, although I acknowledge that I have not had the benefit of adversarial argument on the point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have explained, my earlier judgment dealt with the position of both Mr and Mrs G. On that occasion I exercised the powers conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. I directed the making of statutory wills for both Mr and Mrs G, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/96/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 96(1)</ref>(e) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>. Those wills were subsequently made. I directed that lifetime gifts should be made in favour of C, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/96/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 96(1)</ref>(d) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>. The lifetime gifts in favour of C involved the advancement of substantial capital sums for various purposes and also the provision of continuing maintenance for C. Finally, so far as relevant for present purposes, I directed that a lifetime gift should be made in favour of N, again pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/96/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 96(1)</ref>(d) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my earlier judgment, I identified the principles which I should apply to the matters then before me.

As is well known, that case directed the court, for the purposes of exercising its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>, to assume that the actual patient was having a brief lucid interval, prior to a certain relapse into incapacity, and during that lucid interval the patient would make a decision on the relevant question. The court would then give effect to the decision which it held that the patient himself, acting reasonably, would have made in that way. In the language which has since become current, this is an example of the court making &#8220;a substituted judgment&#8221;, that is making the decision which the court finds that the patient, acting reasonably, himself would have made.</p>

I also considered the same questions in relation to maintenance of C by Mr and Mrs G. I held that Mr and Mrs G would, in their lifetime, have made the gift of substantial capital sums  to C. I gave effect to that decision by directing the receiver for Mr and Mrs G to make those gifts. I also held that Mr and Mrs G would have decided to make maintenance payments to C.

I directed that these payments were to be borne equally by Mr and Mrs G.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was agreed that the coming into force of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (on 1 October 2007) produced the following consequences. The receiver for Mr G and the receiver for Mrs G (being the same person) became the Deputy for Mr G and for Mrs G: see 2005 Act, schedule 5, paragraph 1(2). Further, that appointment as Deputy was subject to the provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, schedule 5, paragraph 1(7) that on the death of Mr G, the appointment as the Deputy of Mr G ceased. I agree that these are the relevant consequences of those matters. Indeed, speaking generally, where a Deputy is appointed in relation to P and P then dies, the powers of the Deputy cease. The Deputy does not continue as the Deputy of the now deceased person. This is in accordance with earlier decisions on the legislation in this area which preceded <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>: see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re Bennett</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1913] 2 Ch 318" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1913">[1913] 2 Ch 318</ref>, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re Wheater</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1928] 1 Ch 223" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1928">[1928] 1 Ch 223</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re Davey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] 1 WLR 164" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] 1 WLR 164</ref> at 172. I was shown a confirmatory order dated 5 November 2008 appointing the former receiver as the property and affairs Deputy for Mrs G. I assume that there was a similar order in relation to Mr G. I do not think that the terms of the order affect the above conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I next need to consider the way in which the relevant parts of paragraphs 4 and 6 of my earlier order operate in view of the death of Mr G. Counsel are agreed that the position in relation to the relevant part of paragraph 4 of the order is that the order continues to apply but to the Deputy for Mrs G only and that the result is that the Deputy for Mrs G is directed to pay one half of the sums referred to in paragraph 4(1)(b). Counsel are similarly agreed that the position in relation to the relevant part of paragraph 6 of the order is that the order continues to apply but to the Deputy for Mrs G only and that the result is that the Deputy for Mrs G is directed to pay one half of the sum referred to in paragraph 6(1)(a). In view of the other submissions of the parties as to how I should approach matters, it does not matter for present purposes whether counsel are right on their approach to the interpretation of the relevant parts of paragraphs 4 and 6 and I will therefore assume that counsel are right about that matter. On this basis, the current position is that the Deputy for Mrs G remains subject to a direction that he pay one half of the relevant sums to C. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, counsel for C says that, on this review of the earlier orders, I should direct the Deputy for Mrs G to pay the full amount (and not just half) of the sums referred to in paragraphs 4(1)(b) and 6(1)(a) of the earlier order. He says that I can, and I should, give that direction under the relevant provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.

I plainly have power to vary my earlier order but a question might arise as to whether I should exercise that power. Should I leave that direction to have continuing effect or should I discharge that direction on the grounds that I do not now have power to give such a direction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>? Because my ultimate decision, for the reasons which I will proceed to give, is that I can, and I should, make the order requested by C, I will not discuss this possibility further.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the sake of completeness, I ought to refer to the fact that the statutory will which was made on behalf of Mr G and which took effect on his death contained a provision (at clause 2) which directed the trustees of the will to give effect, amongst other things, to the directions in paragraphs 4(1)(b) and 6(1)(a) of my earlier order. There was a potential dispute as to the meaning of clause 2. There was also a potential dispute as to how clause 2 affected the liability to pay inheritance tax on the estate of Mr G. Those potential difficulties have been wholly removed by reason of a Deed of Variation executed by C and the executors of Mr G&#8217;s will, prior to the hearing before me, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/142" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 142</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51" uk:canonical="1984 c. 51" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance Tax Act 1984</ref>, by which deed C unconditionally gave up any benefit she might have had in these (and other) respects under clause 2 of the will.</p>

The position is not without its complications and Miss Rich addressed me on the basis of making certain assumptions, which might turn out to be too negative, in relation to certain matters which are in the course of being further investigated or which are in the course of being worked through. I agree that it is appropriate in this case to be cautious in making assessments in these respects as to what the future might bring and I also agree that the Deputy&#8217;s approach has been sufficiently cautious. On the basis of that approach to the evidence, I am satisfied that the payments which I am asked to direct in favour of C will come out of funds which are surplus to Mrs G&#8217;s own proper requirements for the remainder of her days. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Based on the evidence, I can make the following general comment. The earlier order which I made was based on the capital position and the income and expenditure position of Mr and Mrs G. Pursuant to Mr G&#8217;s will, and a deed of appointment and advancement to be made by the executors of that will, which will be effective for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/144" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 144</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51" uk:canonical="1984 c. 51" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance Tax Act 1984</ref>, Mr G&#8217;s estate will pass to Mrs G and there will be only modest inheritance tax payable (by reason of lifetime gifts made by Mr G). Further, as Mr G has died, it is no longer necessary to have funds available to provide for his future care and well being. Although the figures in play are in several respects not the same as the figures I used when making my earlier decision to direct maintenance payments in favour of C, it is true in a broad sense to say that if the capital available to Mr and Mrs G when I made my earlier order allowed the court to make that order, then the capital available to Mrs G today also allows the court to make the order in favour of C which is now sought.</p>

As I have explained, the court is given power to make a lifetime gift of P&#8217;s property and to make a lifetime settlement of P&#8217;s property for the benefit of others: see section 18(1)(b) and (h). The court can also make a will for P: see section 18(1)(i). Further, I note that under section 12, the donee of a lasting power of attorney may make certain gifts and by section 9(4), the authority conferred by a lasting power of attorney is subject to the requirement that the donee acts in the best interests of the donor of the power. These various references to gifts, lifetime and testamentary, and settlements for the benefit of others, suggest to me that the word &#8220;interests&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;best interests&#8221; is not confined to matters of self interest or, putting it another way, a court could conclude in an appropriate case that it is in the interests of P for P to act altruistically. It seems unlikely that the legislature thought that the power to make gifts should be confined to gifts which were not altruistic or where the gift would confer a benefit on P (or the donor of the lasting power of attorney) by reason of that person&#8217;s emotional response to knowing of the gift.</p>

Of course, the ultimate question for the court is: what is in the best interests of P? The court will necessarily draw up its own balance sheet of factors and that may differ from P&#8217;s notional balance sheet.

The court is not obliged to give effect to the decision which P, acting reasonably, would have made (the test of &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221;) but <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> appears to require the court to consider what P would have decided (or, at least, the balance sheet of factors which P would be likely to have considered). My provisional view is that, in an appropriate case, a court could conclude that it is in the best interests of P for the court to give effect to the wishes which P would have formed on the relevant point, if he had capacity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the attitude of the court to the desirability of giving effect to the wishes which the incapacitated person would have formed (although he had not actually formed them) it is helpful to consider a decision which was not itself concerned with the property and affairs of the incapacitated person. That decision is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Airedale NHS Trust v Bland</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 789</ref>, which was influential, in the period before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, in identifying a test of &#8220;best interests&#8221; in relation to the welfare and treatment of an incapacitated person, under the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction. That decision raised fundamental questions as to the sanctity of life and the right to self-determination in relation to a person who was in a persistent vegetative state. The overall conclusion was that the court should decide what was to happen by reference to the best interests of the individual concerned. This involved the court in making its decision as to what it considered was in that person&#8217;s best interests. That process differed from making a substituted judgment, as explained earlier. However, although the question was as to the best interests of the individual, that question permitted the court to have regard to that individual&#8217;s wishes and, further, to the court&#8217;s assessment of what the individual&#8217;s wishes would have been if he had been able to form any. For present purposes, there are relevant passages in the judgments of the Court of Appeal and in some of the speeches in the House of Lords in that case. At [1993] AC 817C &#8211; G, Butler-Sloss LJ explained the difference between the substituted judgment approach and the best interests approach. She adopted the latter and not the former approach. However, she accepted that when applying the best interests approach, the court could have regard to the views and personality of the individual concerned. At page 829C &#8211; F, Hoffmann LJ explained that a person could have an interest in those things of which he had no conscious experience. In a significant passage at pages 829 H &#8211; 830 A, Hoffmann LJ explained that if the individual concerned is not able to form and express his wishes, the court should try its honest best to do what the court thinks the individual would have wanted. It seems to me that Hoffmann LJ was in no doubt that acting in that way was part of the assessment required by the application of the best interests test. He himself made that clear at page 833F where he said that the substituted judgment approach could be subsumed within the concept of best interests. In the House of Lords, Lord Goff of Chieveley at pages 871H &#8211; 872 E adopted the best interests test and rejected the substituted judgment test but he went on to add that anything relevant to the individual&#8217;s best interests must be taken into account and if his personality was relevant to the balancing of all the factors, then it could be taken into account. Lord Mustill was not convinced of the utility of any consideration of substituted judgment: see at page 894 E &#8211; 895 C.</p>

The Law Commission discussed the concept of best interests at paragraphs 3.24 to 3.37 of this report. At paragraph 3.25, the Law Commission discussed the best interests test and the substituted judgment test in a way which allowed the best interests criterion to include a strong element of substituted judgment. The Law Commission explained why the Bill which they recommended had a checklist of factors to be considered when assessing best interests, rather than an attempt at a statutory definition of that phrase. The draft Bill attached to this report contained a provision similar to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> (see clause 3(1)) and a further provision similar, but not identical, to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> (see clause 3(2)). At paragraphs 3.30 and 3.31, the Law Commission explained its views as to the relevance to the best interests test of what the patient would have wanted, if he were able to consider the matter. The wishes that could be identified in this way could include altruistic sentiments and concern for others.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the same report, the Law Commission also discussed their recommendations as to the new law relating to the property and affairs of the patient.

Part VII was nonetheless to be repealed to allow the new provisions as to financial matters to be integrated into the new scheme dealing with personal and healthcare matters. It was thought that this should lead to significant changes in attitude and practice in relation to financial decision making for those lacking capacity. The Law Commission stated in paragraph 8.33 of its report that the references in Part VII of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> to the benefit of the patient should be replaced by the general best interests test and, because the best interests test was the subject of clause 3(2) (or now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>), it was not necessary to make specific provision as to the approach to the making of gifts.</p>

It follows from this, in my judgment, that the guidance given under the Mental Health Acts 1959 and 1983 about the making of settlements or wills can no longer be directly applied to a decision being made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>. I say this for a number of reasons: (i) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 2005 Act</ref> does not require the counterfactual assumption that P is not mentally disordered. The facts must be taken as they are. It is not therefore necessary to go through the mental gymnastics of imagining that P has a brief lucid interval and then relapses into his former state. (ii) The goal of the inquiry is not what P 'might be expected' to have done; but what is in P's best interests. This is more akin to the 'balance sheet' approach than to the 'substituted judgment' approach. The code of practice makes this clear in that it points out that the test of best interests was one that was worked out by the courts mainly in decisions relating to the provision of medical care: para 5.1. (iii) The previous guidance was concerned with deciding what P would have wanted if he were not mentally disordered. But <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> requires the decision-maker to consider P's </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">present </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">wishes and feelings, which ex hypothesi are wishes and feelings entertained by a person who lacks mental capacity in relation to the decision being made on his behalf. (iv) The same structured decision-making process applies to all decisions to be made on P's behalf, whether great or small, whereas the previous guidance was specific to the making of a will, gift or settlement. Moreover, it is a decision-making process which must be followed, not only by the court, but by anyone who takes decisions on P's behalf. (v) In making his decision the decision-maker must consider 'all relevant circumstances'. (vi) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The Act</ref> expressly directs the decision-maker to take a number of steps before reaching a decision. These include encouraging P to participate in the decision. He must also 'consider' P's past and present wishes, and his beliefs and values and must 'take into account' the views of third parties as to what would be in P's best interests.</span></p>

First, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(6)</ref> is not a statutory direction that one 'must achieve' any desired objective by the least restrictive route. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(6)</ref> only requires that before a decision is made '</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">regard</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt"> must be had' to that question. It is an important question, to be sure, but it is not determinative. The only imperative is that the decision must be made in P's best interests. Second, although P's wishes must be given weight, if, as I think, Parliament has endorsed the 'balance sheet' approach, they are only one part of the balance. I agree that those wishes are to be given great weight, but I would prefer not to speak in terms of presumptions. Third, any attempt to test a decision by reference to what P would hypothetically have done or wanted runs the risk of amounting to a 'substituted judgment' rather than a decision of what would be in P's best interests. But despite this risk, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself requires some hypothesising. The decision-maker must consider the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence P's decision if he had capacity and also the other factors that P would be likely to consider if he were able to do so. This does not, I think, necessarily require those to be given effect. As the Code of Practice issued by the Lord Chancellor on 23 April 2007 explains (para 5.38):</span></p>

In deciding what provision should be made in a will to be executed on P's behalf and which, ex hypothesi, will only have effect after he is dead, what are P's best interests? Mr Boyle stressed the principle of adult autonomy; and said that P's best interests would be served simply by giving effect to his wishes. That is, I think, part of the overall picture, and an important one at that. But what will live on after P's death is his memory; and for many people it is in their best interests that they be remembered with affection by their family and as having done 'the right thing' by their will. In my judgment the decision-maker is entitled to take into account, in assessing what is in P's best interests, how he will be remembered after his death.</span></p>

The starting point now must be what Lewison J aptly described (at [38]) as the 'structured decision-making process' prescribed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, a process which requires the decision maker--here the Court of Protection--to take a number of steps before reaching a decision, including, as Lewison J described it, encouraging P to participate in the decision, 'considering' P's past and present wishes, and her beliefs and values, and 'taking into account' the views of third parties as to what would be in P's best interests. And there is, in my judgment, no place in that process for any reference to--any harking back to--judicial decisions under the earlier and very different statutory scheme, decisions which, as Lewison J justly observed, required the judges to perform 'mental gymnastics' and which, as Palmer J equally justly observed in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">Re Fenwick, Re Charles, Minister for Community Services </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">[2009] NSWSC 530 at para 87, reached the high water mark of artificiality in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">Re C (a patient)</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">.</span></p>

(i) First, P's wishes and feelings will always be a significant factor to which the court must pay close regard: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">Re MM (an adult), A Local Authority v MM </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">[2008] 3 FCR 788 at [121]-[124]. (ii) Secondly, the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will always be case-specific and fact-specific. In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific. (iii) Thirdly, in considering the weight and importance to be attached to P's wishes and feelings the court must of course, and as required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, have regard to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">all </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">the relevant circumstances.

Another possible difficulty emerged in the course of discussion. I agree that this factor can create difficulties. First, in the case of a completely incapacitated person, the making of the gift or the terms of the will are decided upon by the court and not by P. In such a case, P has not done anything, in that the decision has been made for P and not by P. This point will have less force where P has participated in the decision or where the decision respects P&#8217;s actual wishes. There can also be a difficulty with the prediction that P, after his death, will be remembered with affection by his family for having done the right thing. Some families do not agree. Some gifts or statutory wills are made as a result of a direction of the Court of Protection where the court has had to prefer some family members to other family members. Some family members will think that the court has done the right thing and some will think that the court has done the wrong thing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The best interests test involves identifying a number of relevant factors. The actual wishes of P can be a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(a) says so. The beliefs and values which would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision, if he had capacity to make the relevant decision, are a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(b) says so. The other factors which P would be likely to consider, if he had the capacity to consider them, are a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(c) says so. Accordingly, the balance sheet of factors which P would draw up, if he had capacity to make the decision, is a relevant factor for the court&#8217;s decision. Further, in most cases the court will be able to determine what  decision it is likely that P would have made, if he had capacity. In such a case, in my judgment, P&#8217;s balance sheet of factors and P&#8217;s likely decision can be taken into account by the court. This involves an element of substituted judgment being taken into account, together with anything else which is relevant. However, it is absolutely clear that the ultimate test for the court is the test of best interests and not the test of substituted judgment. Nonetheless, the substituted judgment can be relevant and is not excluded from consideration. As Hoffmann LJ said in the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bland</span> case, the substituted judgment can be subsumed within the concept of best interests. That appeared to be the view of the Law Commission also.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, the word &#8220;interest&#8221; in the best interests test does not confine the court to considering the self interest of P. The actual wishes of P, which are altruistic and not in any way, directly or indirectly self-interested, can be a relevant factor. Further, the wishes which P would have formed, if P had capacity, which may be altruistic wishes, can be a relevant factor. It is not necessary to establish that P would have been aware of the fact that P&#8217;s wishes were carried into effect. Respect for P&#8217;s wishes, actual or putative, can be a relevant factor even where P has no awareness of, and no reaction to, the fact that such wishes are being respected.</p>

In relation to past wishes, there are some past wishes which are relevant albeit in general rather than specific terms. In the past, Mrs G was aware that Mr G supported C financially from time to time. It may even be possible to say that it was Mrs G&#8217;s own wish that Mr G should provide that support. Further, Mrs G&#8217;s will provided for her children, N and C, to inherit her estate after Mr and Mrs G were both dead.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my earlier judgment, based on the substituted judgment test, I held that Mrs G would wish the surplus assets of Mr and Mrs G to be used to an appropriate extent to provide maintenance for C. The situation today is not identical to the situation which I considered in July 2007. However, there are many matters which continue to apply or where the situation is comparable. The assets now available to Mrs G are her own assets and also the assets which formerly belonged to Mr G, which will now pass to Mrs G. There will remain surplus assets after the Deputy has made all proper provision for Mrs G for the remainder of her days. Thus, I hold that Mrs G would be likely, if she had capacity today, to make the same decision as to the maintenance of C as the decision which I concluded Mr and Mrs G would have made in July 2007. Further, if Mrs G had capacity today and was informed that C had received maintenance payments from Mr and Mrs G under the order of 31 July 2007, I think that Mrs G would not have wished to discontinue those payments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I next ask myself whether there are any other matters to be reflected in the balance sheet of relevant matters. At the hearing, there was reference to the fact that lifetime gifts from Mrs G to C might result in some modest saving of inheritance tax on Mrs G&#8217;s death, depending on how long Mrs G continued to live after making any relevant lifetime gift. The submissions of Miss Rich and Mr Rees on that point attached comparatively little weight to that consideration. I agree with their approach. The tax saving possibility is a factor in favour of making the gifts in question but the factor has limited weight on the facts of this case having regard to the amount involved and the life expectancy of Mrs G. Nonetheless, this factor does not count against the making of the order which is sought.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the sake of emphasis, I wish to repeat a matter I referred to separately earlier in this judgment. I have referred to the question whether Mrs G would retain sufficient funds to allow the Deputy to make proper provision for her for the remainder of her days. I also stated that an assessment of this kind must be a cautious one. These are plainly relevant matters. However, these considerations are all fully respected in the order which is sought. Further, any order I made will be subject to the possibility of variation or discharge if it were to come about that these considerations so required in the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have also considered whether I should take into account the possibility that Mrs G might be regarded by C, and by others, during the remainder of Mrs G&#8217;s life and after her death, as having done &#8220;the right thing&#8221;. I attach no weight to that consideration in this case, principally because Mrs G is not in any way participating in this decision and it seems to me very hard to say that Mrs G is &#8220;doing&#8221; anything. Further, while C herself will think that the court has done &#8220;the right thing&#8221;, I am less sure as to what N will think about that matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having identified the factors as best I can, it emerges that the principal justification, so far as Mrs G is concerned, for making the order for maintenance payments in favour of C, is that those payments would be what Mrs G would have wanted if she had capacity to make the decision for herself. I recognise that this consideration is essentially a &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221; for Mrs G. I am also very aware that the test laid down by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is the test of best interests and not of substituted judgment. However, for the reasons which I have tried to set out earlier, the test of best interests does not exclude respect for what would have been the wishes of Mrs G. A substituted judgment can be subsumed into the consideration of best interests. Accordingly, in this case, respect for what would have been Mrs G&#8217;s wishes will define what is in her best interests, in the absence of any countervailing factors. There are no such countervailing factors here. I therefore conclude that an order which provides for the continuation of maintenance payments to C is in the best interests of Mrs G.</p>
