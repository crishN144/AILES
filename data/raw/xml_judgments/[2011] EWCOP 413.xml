	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The proceedings themselves have been brought for the benefit of Steven Neary, a young man aged 20 with autistic spectrum disorder and severe learning disability.  He has hitherto been known within the proceedings as SN.  He lives with his father, Mark Neary, previously known as MN.  The issues that arise have two aspects.  The first concerns Steven&#8217;s future care.  It is now hoped that agreement will be reached about this, and I have given directions for a mediated solution to be attempted.  The matter will only be litigated if these efforts fail.  The other issue relates to the lawfulness or otherwise of events that occurred between 31 December 2009 and 24 December 2010.  This was a period when Steven lived in residential accommodation provided by his local authority, the London Borough of Hillingdon.  He was initially placed with his father's agreement for a period of a few days' respite.  However, a difference of opinion then developed between the father and the local authority about Steven&#8217;s return home, which the local authority came to consider was not in his interests.  The disagreement intensified and was not resolved until the matter came before the court on 21 December 2010, after which Steven returned to live with his father.  It is said by the father and by the Official Solicitor, who now represents Steven, that the refusal to allow him to return home was unlawful in a number of respects, and they seek declarations to that effect.  That matter is listed for further case management on 10 May 2011 and for final hearing on 23 May 2011.</p>

She refers to the important right of respect for private and family life, which informs the regime under which hearings are held in private.  She says that the Official Solicitor does not consider it open to him to make any concession because he cannot see it as being in Steven's best interests for there to be further publicity.  She draws attention to the views of an independent social worker who has reported on Steven's current situation and who comments on possible positive and negative effects of further publicity.  In summary, these are that (1) Steven enjoys the attention at a basic level, while lacking understanding of the issues involved; (2) greater likelihood of Steven and his father being recognised in the local area may foster better knowledge of his condition, leading to increased sympathy and support, and readiness to involve him in wider activities and social events; (3) media interest may place stress on Steven and his father, leading to a deterioration in Steven's equilibrium and a contraction of his social activities, particularly if any risks posed by Steven's behaviour were unduly accentuated in the reporting.  Likewise, I am told that a consultant psychiatrist who is in the process of reporting has pointed to a possible increase in anxiety for Steven if the media intruded into his daily life, for example, by door-stepping.</p>

The further application for permission to report the parties' names at this stage in the proceedings raises an issue that has not, so far as I am aware, previously arisen.  It is accepted by all parties that an order permitting this is within the court's power under Rule 91(2)(a).  The Official Solicitor however argues that the issue should be addressed at the end of the proceedings, when all relevant information is known.</p>

He says that the risks and disadvantages raised in response to the media's application are no more than speculative.</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Hearings before the Court of Protection should be held in private unless there is good reason why they should not be.  The statutory arrangements reflect a long-standing exception to the principle that justice must be done in open court.  The affairs of those who are not incapacitated are normally handled privately.  People should not routinely have their lives exposed to public gaze simply because their affairs come before the court as a result of their incapacity.  See <span style="font-style:italic">Independent News and Media Limited v A</span> (above) at paragraphs 18 and 19.</p>

The rules allow for exercise of the court&#8217;s powers to be calibrated to the needs of the particular case. </p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Publicity can have a strong effect on individuals, particularly if they are not used to it, or if, like Steven, they are vulnerable to anxiety and to changes in their environment.  Any evidence that suggests a real possibility of a detrimental effect from publicity must weigh heavily. On the other hand, there must be some proper factual basis for such concerns.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is a genuine public interest in the work of this court being understood.  Not only is this healthy in itself &#8211; the presence of the media in appropriate cases has a bracing effect on all public servants, whether in the field of social services or the law &#8211; but it may also help to dispel misunderstandings.  It is not in the interests of individual litigants, or of society at large, for a court that is by definition devoted to the <span style="font-style:italic">protection</span> of the welfare of disadvantaged people to be characterised (including in a report about this case, published as I write this judgment) as "secretive".  It is part of our natural curiosity to want to know other people's secrets, and using pejorative descriptions of this kind may stimulate interest.  The opportunity, in appropriate cases, to follow a process that has welfare, not secrecy, at its heart can only help the media to produce balanced reporting, and not fall back on clich&#233;s.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The ability of the media to participate need not be limited to cases involving extraordinary individuals such as Mr Paravicini.  Interesting and potentially important examples can arise wherever decisions have to be taken about people whose lives mirror those of large numbers of others in the same position.  In considering whether good reason has been shown, the question is not whether the individual is exceptional, but whether the issue is one of genuine public interest.</p>

In the former case, if the proceedings are conducted in private, there may very well be no story.
