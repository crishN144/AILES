	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This case concerns a family of six children.  It has apparently generated over 9,000 pages of documents.  The selective bundles prepared for the hearing are less than half that number but are still considerable.  The case occupied 10 days of hearing time, plus today.  At the start of the hearing there was a wide range of issues in relation both to the facts and to the outcome.  During the hearing the parents have reacted bravely and responsibly to the weight of the professional and expert evidence.  The outcome, namely the making of full care orders, is now completely agreed, and there is now consensus as to many of the threshold grounds for making those care orders.  It remains a multifaceted case, but the central issue which I now have to decide is how undoubted genital injuries to the fourth child, a girl, were caused; and specifically, whether the eldest child, a boy, caused them.  The date of those injuries was 2 April 2018, which was Easter Monday. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On that date the father was aged 51 and the mother 33.  The father had been previously married and has two daughters from that marriage, now adult, with whom he has little communication or contact.  These parents first met in 2000, when the mother was aged 16, and they soon began living together, as they still do.  Their relationship was characterised by considerable violence and aggression by the father towards the mother, exacerbated by his heavy drinking at that time.  Police were frequently called to the home.  It does appear that the father has more recently learned to curb his drinking and that the relationship is apparently now more stable. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In May 2011, when D was only about four months old, she was taken to hospital with a serious scald burn on her elbow.  There had been a delay in seeking medical treatment.  The parents colluded and lied about the cause of that burn, which they sought to blame on A, then aged eight.  The four children were removed from home.  The parents later admitted that it was the mother who had neglectfully caused the burn by permitting very hot milk to spill onto D&#8217;s arm in her crib.  Full care orders were made, placing the children in the care of the X local authority on a plan of rehabilitation.  After about 13 months in care the four children were returned home in July 2012, and the care orders were later discharged.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Although I have so briefly summarised those events, they form an important part of the background to the present proceedings.  They evidence the parents colluding and lying about the cause of serious harm to one of their children, and, indeed, expressly seeking to blame another child, A, who was completely innocent.  These events had the effect that the parents, and also certainly A, then already eight, had an experience of the care system, fostering and the involvement of social workers.  That may have influenced the attitudes, behaviour and reactions of the parents and A to the events on and after 2 April </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In September 2017 the family moved to a large, three storey (plus a cellar) rented house in Z.  Whilst the mother laboured for long hours and struggled to do her best to parent the children, a picture has clearly emerged of a chaotic, unstructured, little disciplined and introverted life in the home.  The family kept to themselves.  The children did not go out much, or socialise much with other children or families.  For periods, all or some of the children did not attend schools.  They appear to have spent inordinate amounts of time watching television, or films on computers, or playing computer games A, although still only 14 (he became 15 in [ ]) claims to have spent most of his time closeted in his room on the top floor, either sleeping until very late or playing computer games, or downstairs watching horror films with his father.  The family did not, however, come to the attention of the Z local authority in whose area they were now living. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the evening of Monday 2 April 2018 at around 21:00 the mother attended at the [ ] Infirmary A&amp;E with D.  The mother said, as was the case, that D was bleeding from her vagina, and asked whether (although only aged just 7) she could be menstruating very early.  After triage, D was examined at about 22:30 by a consultant paediatrician, Dr JS, MRCPCH, who observed clear internal genital injuries within the labia majora.  As no convincing account was given of an accidental cause, an abusive act was inevitably suspected as a possible cause, and social workers and police were called. D was detained in the hospital that night.  Around 02:15 in the early hours of the morning of Tuesday 3 April 2018 the police assumed statutory police protection powers, and at about 03:00 they removed the other five children from the home and later arrested the father on suspicion of rape (an offence of which he was never later charged).  The five children were taken to a children&#8217;s home, where they seem to have slept or lain on sofas or on the floor of a large room under the supervision of a social worker. </p>

The local authority and all four guardians agree that both parents love their children very dearly and would like all of them except A to be returned home.  The local authority and the respective guardians also all agree that all six children, including A, wish to return home.  However, the parenting capacities of the parents have been very thoroughly assessed, not only by social workers and the respective guardians but by an independent social worker, Miss ISW, and a psychologist, Dr CP.  The upshot is that there is in this case what I described during the course of the hearing as a wall of professional and expert evidence which is, sadly but firmly, all to the same effect.  Both these parents experienced very difficult and dysfunctional childhoods and upbringings.  The level of cognitive functioning of the father is in the low average range.  That of the mother is at the upper end of the extremely low range of functioning.  Neither of them currently have the capacity (whether separately or as a couple) to provide consistent parenting to any of these children, let alone five of them, to even a minimally acceptable level.  </p>

She said that both parents struggle to meet the needs physically and emotionally of the children.  They try their best.  The mother has an over positive view of her abilities.  The father struggles in terms of discipline and authority.  He wants to be a friend to the children.  The mother is a very vulnerable woman who has suffered great loss herself.  The parents can tell you about the parenting programmes they attend, but they do not have the ability to put into practice and sustain those improvements. Miss ISW said that the picture that the mother and father present of family life before April 2018 is at odds with all the other information in the bundles.  The documents indicate struggling, and what was happening with A was having a negative effect on all the children.  </p>

Those substituted care plans were themselves circulated to the guardians in draft for any further observations earlier on 4 March 2019.  In the upshot, all four guardians expressly say that they are in complete agreement with the substituted care plans in relation to the respective child or children whom they respectively represent.  Very understandably and humanly, the parents would have wished that all or most of their children could return home and, if not, that the children should have as much contact as possible with their parents and with each other.  However, their counsel, Mr David Orbaum, on behalf of the mother, and Miss Charlotte Worsley, on behalf of the father, have told me that the care plans now have a sufficient degree of flexibility built in to them and that the parents and their advisers (and indeed the local authority themselves, the guardians, and I myself) all recognise that it is impossible to be prescriptive at this stage about contact.  All or most of the children are likely to move to new long-term settings, and the local authority must necessarily be responsive and reactive to future developments.  Thus, while it cannot be said that the parents agree the care plans, they do accept them; and I have not been asked, by order, or even by indication, to impose any substituted terms or provisions or wording for the care plans, whether by an express order as to contact or otherwise.  I therefore endorse all the final care plans dated 4 March 2019 and will in due course make full care orders in relation to each of the six children upon them.&#8221; </p>

I regret to say that neither of them impress as reliable witnesses.  Each of them have said many inconsistent things to doctors, police, or social workers, at the time and in their written and oral evidence in these proceedings.  I stress that that is not necessarily to say that either is deliberately lying, although they may be.  On their own accounts of the facts, this was a perfectly normal day in the family household until it was apparent that D was bleeding and obviously needed medical attention.  Until then, no one went out except the mother and B to go to the supermarket, and everyone seems to have been largely absorbed in watching films or playing computer games, as they routinely did.  Because of its sheer ordinariness and eventlessness, it is not necessarily surprising that, when the events of the day became the subject of later intense scrutiny, the parents give some confused or conflicting accounts.  They may not be lying, but they are unreliable. </p>

Whilst there is always a first time for everything, it does seem a surprising coincidence if the one day which later came under the spotlight and was the subject of computer interrogation by the police was the first time that the father, who did download pornography that day, had done so.

In a case which is brimful of possibilities and speculation, it is possible that D had already been hurt by then and that both parents are covering up, but I find on a balance of probability that D was still unharmed and fine at teatime.  If indeed D was already hurt and vaginally bleeding when the mother got back from Asda, it seems unlikely that the mother, who did later take her to hospital, would have waited so long to do so.  The mother said that tea lasted about an hour, and I hold, on a balance of probability, that D was still unharmed at 17:00.   </p>

The searches are unlikely to have begun in the first instant after she began to bleed, so I conclude and hold on a balance of probability that between about 17:00 at the earliest and about 19:00 at the latest on 2 April 2018 D suffered the injuries which I will later describe. </p>

He went to get a plaster from the kitchen but he wiped the finger and there was no wound there.  He said that he then shouted to the mother in the living room because the blood was not from the finger but from her bum. D was at the bottom of the stairs.  The mother took her up to the bathroom.  These two accounts cannot both be correct and, frankly, I have no idea how, or when, or in exactly what circumstances each parent became aware that D was bleeding from her vagina.  The inconsistencies may be because the parents are covering up for something, or may simply be due to faulty recollection.  But they have the effect that I simply have no reliable account from either parent of events between 17:00 and 19:00, although I do accept that at some point the mother gave D a bath. </p>

His report, now at bundle page E28, lists the &#8220;multiple injuries&#8221; to her genital area.  The hymen itself was closed, annular and normal, with no injuries.  However, there were a number of internal bruises, including to the posterior fourchette, and blood was oozing from the area between the right side of the meatus and the upper inner part of the labium minus.  The anus and peri-anal was intact.  There was a large bruise on the upper and inner part of the right thigh extending towards the external side of the right labium majus.

The only area of divergence between them (of no relevance to any disputed issue I have to decide) is that Dr MA referred to evidence of &#8220;vaginal&#8221; penetration.  Dr LA preferred to say evidence of &#8220;genital&#8221; penetration since the hymen appeared normal and intact so that any penetration did not extend into the vagina itself.

The apparent small round bruise way to the right of the perineal area (to the left as one views it on screen) on the inner thigh is not a bruise at all.  The described large bruise (the external bruise) is a bruise which is clearly visible very close to the right labium majus and extending into the right labium majus.  Both doctors, and indeed also Dr JS, who first examined D, all agree that the constellation of observed external and internal injuries must have had a traumatic cause (i.e. they have not occurred spontaneously in the child) but are equally consistent with penetration by an object, whether a penis, a finger or some other inserted </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Straddle injuries from bikes are usually seen with the child sitting/standing astride the bicycle, falling down against the crossbar directly on the genitalia with the full impact of the weight of the body hitting these midline structures.  In D&#8217;s case, she does not describe sitting on the bike, but falling onto it after it had slipped down the stairs.  The only area to be injured was her genital area, and therefore to cause this, she would require to fall landing with her legs apart, impacting her genital area and only the genital area, on the stabiliser.  This is hard to envisage, as the stabiliser would have to hit the midline genital region only as there are no signs of grazes to the inner thighs or any other injury.  I would also envisage this event would have caused a degree of noise (as she and the bike fall downstairs) and a shout of pain.  Therefore, whilst a straddle injury from a bike may cause the injuries that were found, the description of how it happened in this case makes it very unlikely that this was the true explanation.  It is possible that D did indeed fall, along with the bike fell downstairs and she fell against the bike, and has attributed the bike as having caused injury.  However, for the reasons outlined above, I think this is unlikely to be the explanation of these injuries.&#8221; </p>

A said that yesterday his dad had gone shopping with two of the children, he thinks D and B.  He said when they got back D was playing with her bike and was trying to take it upstairs on her own, when she fell down the stairs backwards and landed on her hip on the banister.  He said he saw this happen, and her mum went to her to comfort her.  She was holding her left-hand side above her hip crying.  He said that later that day (maybe two hours later) D came downstairs saying she was weeing blood.  Her mum initially dismissed it but she was quite upset so she started to listen to her.&#8221; </p>

Dr JS said that she asked the mother whether D had had any falls or accidents and that the mother was clear that there was no history of trauma. D herself was very quiet.  She sat on her mother&#8217;s lap and did not say anything during the assessment, and did not mention her bike.   </p>

The police officer who was later present, PC SC said that she does not recall seeing a drawing of a bike, and any drawings which D did do at the hospital are now lost.  Also during those 45 minutes there were telephone conversations between the mother and the father.  It is of course entirely appropriate that the mother and father should have kept in contact that evening so she could report to him what was going on with their child.  The mother says that the father told her on the &#8216;phone that A had told him that he had seen D fall on her bicycle on the stairs earlier that day.  The upshot was that when a nurse, a social worker and the police began to speak to the mother, the mother told them, in the presence of D, that D had fallen on the stairs with her bike and that that had caused, or may have caused, the injuries.  This is an account which, in general terms, D has subsequently often given herself.  The mother herself was adamant during her oral evidence that the sequence of events was: first, that D drew a picture of a bike; second, that the father told her on the &#8216;phone that A had seen D fall with her bike on the stairs; and third, that she, the mother, then informed police and medical staff about this.  At all events, an account that D had fallen in some way with her bike on the stairs certainly became current at the hospital that night.  An obvious question is whether it first arose spontaneously from D as the mother claims; or was relayed to the mother by the father and then implanted by the mother in D; or, indeed, was fabricated by the mother herself and then implanted by the mother in D.  Frankly, I have no idea; but insofar as the local authority allege or suggest that the whole bike story was fabricated and planted in D&#8217;s mind by the mother that night, they have not discharged the burden of proof. </p>

That took place in the same premises as the physical examination and colposcopy by Dr MA and immediately after it.  I have carefully viewed the CD of the interview.  It took place between 13:00 and 13:19. It is possible to criticise aspects of the interview by reference to the published ABE guidance.  In particular, the guidance stresses the importance of prior planning, but there was little or no planning for this interview.  The interviewing police officer explained, however, that the police considered that there was a degree of urgency in case other children were at risk.  At all events, although given every opportunity to do so, D gave no account or explanation as to how she had got hurt.  When asked, now at bundle page </p>

D gives a description and detail of A using his nails and scratching her, and licking her with his tongue, and of it tickling, and of her going red in the face, which a girl of seven could not have made up.  They submit that she must be describing, even with many inaccuracies, a real event that she personally experienced and which she very clearly attributes to A.  There are, however, many inconsistent and confusing aspects to the interview, in particular as to whether this occurred on one occasion, namely on the day on which she hurt herself (viz; 2 April 2018) or on several or more occasions at night.  She expressly says several times that she told her mother, which her mother denies.  She expressly says, more than once, that her mother grounded A for 10 days and that A had to have his meals in his room.  If D is describing an event on 2 April 2018 there was no opportunity for A to be grounded, since the family was immediately split up.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is not in issue or in doubt that D did suffer the described injuries.  For reasons which I have already given, I have already held on a balance of probability that they must have occurred between about 17:00 and 19:00 on 2 April 2018.  On the medical evidence, which I accept, they are only explicable by either some form of traumatic penetration or a midline straddle type trauma.  In my view, they are highly unlikely to have been caused by a fall with the bike of which any description has been given, for the following reasons.  First, it is true that D has said on many occasions that she did have a fall with her bike and she herself has often attributed her injuries to such an event.  I do not exclude that she may have had a fall with her bike on or around that day.  She liked to carry her bike upstairs as she thought it was safer in her bedroom, but, in my view, any described fall is highly unlikely to have caused these injuries.  It is not described by A, nor suggested, that D was astride her bike on the stairs, but that she was carrying it on the stairs.  As Dr LA stressed in a passage which I have already quoted, these were what doctors call midline injuries entirely confined to the midline, internal to D&#8217;s labia majora and the one external bruise just, but only just, to the right of her right labium majus and essentially also on the midline.  I find it hard to conceive how, if she was carrying the bike up the stairs and fell, she should have fallen so precisely on her midline onto the stabilisers with sufficient force to generate </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Second, the medical evidence is clear that if D had suffered these injuries in a sudden traumatic event, such as a straddle fall on the stairs, they would have been painful and she, at the age of seven, would have inevitably cried or screamed out and continued for a period (Dr MA says for a long period) to have cried.  An adult or older child might grit her teeth and be more stoical; a seven-year-old would not.  If she did have a fall with the bike, it would only have been on the first flight of stairs between the ground floor and the first floor where her own bedroom is, and no one suggests a fall on the second </p>

As I have already identified, there are many inconsistencies in his accounts, and most notably it is integral to his accounts that his mother comforted D, which the mother strongly denies.  In any event, the descriptions which A gives are </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">not of a straddle type incident or injury, but, rather, of hurting her hip or thigh against the banister.  It follows that the injuries must have been caused either by some other accidental straddle type event, or by a non-accidental and abusive act.  Apart from one or two of D&#8217;s own more far-fetched explanations, such as accidentally kicking herself with her own foot (given on 27 April 2018) there is simply no evidence or suggestion at all in the evidence of any accident other than the alleged fall with the bike on the stairs.  Any accident must have occurred within the home, since D did not go out between 17:00 and 19:00 that day.  It would have to have been a straddle type event since the injuries are so midline.  The same point arises that if D suffered any accidental straddle type trauma, with the force required to cause these injuries, she would have cried out or shouted and cried and it seems inconceivable that her parents would not have become aware of it.  The injuries are wholly consistent with abusive penetration, and for these reasons I am forced to conclude on a balance of probability that such an act took place.  Digital insertion wholly explains all the observed injuries. </p>

He may have felt a need to try to put forward as an explanation the sort of accidental event (falling with a bike) that can happen in any home and would not result in care.

The evidence has many weaknesses.  The account came four months after the event.  In her immediate ABE interview on 3 April 2018 D had said in terms that no one had touched her.  When asked in August why she had not referred to A touching her in April she said that she had forgotten it.  If she remembered it in August, it is not credible that she could have forgotten it on 3 April, the day after the alleged event.

Further, she only gave the account of A touching her bits after both NA and SE had told her that she could not go home until they knew how she had been hurt.  The pressure on her may have been enormous, and implicitly her explanation of the fall from the bike was being rejected.  For all these reasons, it is no surprise to me at all that the police abandoned any attempt to prosecute in this case.  No jury, properly directed, could possibly be sure that A had caused the injuries.  I, however, am required to apply a lower standard of proof.  Despite all the above weaknesses which I have identified and which I fully recognise, I am satisfied on a balance of probability that A is the person who did cause these injuries by penetrating D with his finger or fingers.  In my view, there is a spontaneity and vividness about D&#8217;s account on 10 August 2018 which she could only have given if she was describing an experience which had actually happened to her, even if she very imperfectly and unreliably remembered much of the detail.  I accept and agree with the submissions of both Miss Irving and Mr Sam Momtaz QC on behalf of the girls&#8217; guardian, that when D speaks of A using his fingernails and of it hurting and tickling and of his licking her with his tongue, she is describing things which would be beyond the imagination of a seven-year-old girl and which she is highly unlikely to have picked up from another source, unless, as to which there is not a shred of evidence, some much older person had tutored her.   Further, she twice referred to her face going red, which, I agree with both leading counsel, is not a detail she would be likely to fabricate or fantasise. </p>

The hymen was intact and unharmed. D referred to A scratching her with his fingernails.  The reference to fingernails may also have been a reference to his fingertips. A may not have inserted his finger or fingers very far or very deep.  He claims to have been, and probably was, completely sexually inexperienced.  He may not have had any appreciation of the physical harm he might cause and did in fact cause, which Dr MA said was the worst abusive damage he had ever seen.  What A did was very wrong and totally inexcusable and he must have known that it was wrong, but the extent and gravity of what he did needs to be borne in mind. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I wish to follow those findings by the following immediate observations or comments.  First, it is a finding made on the balance of probability and only after considerable thought and hesitation.  As I have already explained, such a finding is fallible and I acknowledge that it may be wrong.  Second, as the above reasoning shows, it is firmly premised on the evidence of both parents that they neither saw nor heard, nor at the time became immediately aware of, D suffering an accident that day, whether on the stairs with her bike or otherwise.  I have already said that much of the evidence of each parent is inconsistent and unreliable, although not necessarily fabricated or lies, but on </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">this point, namely, whether they saw or heard or immediately became aware of some accident, they cannot be mistaken.  Their evidence that they did not is either true or a lie.  If they have lied and left A carrying the can, as they sought to do in 2011, then that must weigh heavily on their consciences for the rest of their lives.  Third, my finding casts A as a perpetrator.  I have not heard from him or seen him (save on the 3 April 2018 ABE video) but my provisional impression is that he, too, should be treated, not as a perpetrator but as a victim of his highly dysfunctional childhood and upbringing.  Although he said in his interview on 3 September 2018 that he had had some sex education at school, he was brought up in an undisciplined household with few boundaries and very lax standards.  He was still young (just 15 in April 2018) and immature. A needs help not reproof.  Although it will be entirely a matter for decision-making in the future, I stress that this judgment does not at all mean that A should later necessarily be regarded as unsuitable or unsafe to parent children, including girls.  He may be capable of learning from his juvenile mistake. </p>

It follows from the above that I find paragraph A proved (but with a slightly earlier start time of 17:00) and paragraphs B, C, D, E and F proved.  Paragraph G may be technically true, in that immediately before she was removed into care D had had an inappropriate sexual experience, but it adds nothing to A - F and is confusing, </p>

The first sentence of paragraph I is proved, but, in my view, the example given, although it may be true, should be deleted.  Any penetrative behaviour as done by A upon D is always completely unacceptable.  Some exploratory behaviour between young siblings of different sexes, or looking at each other&#8217;s genital areas, does not necessarily, in my view, cross the threshold boundary for taking children into the care.  So the first sentence is in; the example is out.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">That leaves K.  This relies upon the evidence of Dr JS as to the condition or state of all the children except D when she examined them on 3 April 2018.  The parents do not dispute the actual observations recorded by Dr JS of the general state of cleanliness and tidiness of the children, but they do make the point that the children had been removed from their home at about 03:00 that morning and had not been able to have a proper night&#8217;s sleep in beds, nor showers or baths.  They were wearing whatever clothes were hurriedly seized for them to wear.  The social worker, Mr DS, who had supervised the children overnight, said, in answer to questions from Mr Momtaz, that he could not recall whether he had had any concerns about the children&#8217;s physical presentation.  They did not appear dirty or grubby.   Nothing stood out about their appearance.  In these circumstances, it is, in my view, unfair to the parents that paragraph K should form part of the threshold grounds.  The observations of Dr JS were not the real reason why the children were taken into care at that time, nor are they the essential reason why the children cannot return home now.  Paragraph K should be deleted. </p>
