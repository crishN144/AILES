	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am faced with what might appear to be a situation without a solution bedevilled with arguments of considerable circularity. The key question relates to disclosure into Children Act care proceedings of information held by the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD) who is not a party to the proceedings. The issue which may be novel, in the sense that it has not arisen before in a case of this kind, is whether there should be any disclosure of information. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By her application of 22 November 2016, the SSHD seeks a discharge of a disclosure order made without notice on 4 October 2016. That order was revisited on 3 November 2016 in the presence of a member of the government legal department, on behalf of the SSHD, when further time was afforded so that she might decide on future steps. </p>

The situation here, as it emerged during the final minutes of the oral submissions made by Ms Wheeler QC on behalf of the SSHD, is that if the extant orders for disclosure are not discharged the &#8220;strong likelihood&#8221; is that the claim for public interest immunity, if successful, will result in a decision that the sensitive material would not be considered at all.</p>

There is one very young child born to parents who live in East London. Proceedings were begun on 26 July 2016 in the East London Family Court. In accordance with the President&#8217;s Guidance, &#8220;Radicalisation Cases in the Family Courts,&#8221; dated 8 October 2015, the application was transferred to the Royal Courts of Justice and allocated to me. The child was made the subject of an interim supervision order on 1 August 2016. </p>

The critical question is whether there is a real risk that disclosure would cause substantial harm to an important public interest. If disclosure would not cause substantial harm it would be made. If, however, the assessment was that disclosure would harm the public interest then material &#8220;attracts&#8221; PII and a claim must be considered.  </p>

This is a decision taken by the SSHD assisted by advice from those involved at stages 1 and 2. The decision maker will have to consider the importance of the information to the issues the court has to decide, and form a view as to whether the public interest in non-disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in disclosure, in order to do justice within the proceedings: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within her written argument, Ms Wheeler stated that if the SSHD decides to claim PII, she will finalise and sign a PII Certificate. That Certificate is the SSHD&#8217;s statement of her own judgment as to the likely harm to the public interest caused by disclosure and the weight to be given to competing public interests. The Certificate will generally contain an open and a closed part and a sensitive schedule. Ms Wheeler submits that determining the extent to which the reasons for claiming PII may be put in &#8216;open,&#8217; or should go into &#8216;closed,&#8217; is a decision which of itself requires careful consideration.</p>

However, if the material is judged to be highly relevant and the public interest in disclosure so pressing that it is inappropriate to claim PII, an application may be made for a closed material procedure under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.6</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/18" uk:canonical="2013 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2013 Act</ref>.</p>

She suggests there has been insufficient regard to the highly sensitive nature of the material sought and a failure to respect the differing roles of the public bodies identified within the Guidance. Ms Wheeler submits that the local authority should have informed the body from whom information is sought about the proceedings, including the matters in issue and what material it is minded to seek. In the first instance there should be discussion and if a hearing is required it should be on notice. Here, says Ms Wheeler, there would appear to have been no sound reason why the hearing was not on notice.</p>

Whilst I quite accept that requests for disclosure should be approached with, as Ms Wheeler suggests, &#8220;particular care and circumspection&#8221; it is difficult to identify what more this local authority could have done in terms of specificity or definition. Whether in this instance it would have been of real benefit to the SSHD to have case summaries and draft threshold documents is extremely dubious. Once more I reiterate that had it not been for the &#8220;tip off&#8221; from SO15, there would have been no reason for this local authority to initiate proceedings. The notion that the SSHD has insufficient information to respond, other than by seeking discharge of the disclosure order, is to my mind fallacious.</p>

Although it is correct that material has been sought both from Sussex Police and [a foreign State&#8217;s] Counter Terrorism Command, it seems unlikely that either will prove to be beneficial in advancing the local authority&#8217;s understanding of the key issues. The preamble to the 3 November 2016 order relates that [a foreign State&#8217;s] Counter Terrorism Command has informed the local authority that it will not derogate from its principle that, as a general rule, it will not disclose what information it may hold on a given individual nor will it disclose whether it holds no information on any given individual. </p>

What would seem to have occurred is that the Government Legal Department has already made tentative decisions as to the likely approach if disclosure orders are pursued rather than revoked.
