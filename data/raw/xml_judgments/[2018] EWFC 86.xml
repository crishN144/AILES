She was born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement entered into in the Ukraine by the applicant, X, and her estranged husband, Y. The first respondent, Z, is the unmarried gestational surrogate who resides in the Ukraine. The second respondent is B, represented though her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Roddy. </p>

In this jurisdiction her birth mother, Z, is her mother and Y her genetic and legal father. X was not regarded as a parent and did not have parental responsibility. Her de facto status was as a psychological parent, but that does not in itself vest her with a legal relationship or ability to legally make decisions concerning B. </p>

It appears X became increasingly anxious to have her own child. Within weeks of meeting Y online in early 2016 she reported she was pregnant with his child. She sadly miscarried and then embarked on IVF treatment which also was not successful. </p>

For reasons which are not clear the written agreement entered into has not been part of the papers in these proceedings. According to X this agreement included terms that permitted the clinic to sign on Y&#8217;s behalf. X reports they chose an egg donor and embryos were created using the donated eggs and Y&#8217;s gametes. A surrogate was selected, and an agreement signed in June 2016. The subsequent embryo transfer was successful, she was carrying twins. Unfortunately, the surrogate first miscarried one child and then, later, the second. Before the second miscarriage, X had sought further IVF treatment in the Ukraine, which was also unsuccessful.  During the course of that treatment, the applicant met the respondent surrogate mother, Z. Following the first surrogate&#8217;s second miscarriage a further surrogacy arrangement was entered into with Z on 9 December 2016 and embryos were transferred to Z on the same day. This agreement is in the papers with what X states are the signature of the agency on behalf of Y. The pregnancy was confirmed in December 2016.  </p>

According to Y they had separated in November 2016, X says it was in early 2017. They both give different accounts for their separation. X alleges abusive behaviour by Y towards her that resulted in her need to involve the police, including them taking protection measures such an installing a panic alarm in her home. According to Y it was X who harassed him and in April 2017 the police took no further action in relation to the allegations made by Y against X. Either way they had separated by early 2017. </p>

To register the birth Y needed to agree to X registering the birth with her surname and give X power of attorney to make decisions without him being present. Once these were in place X was able to register B&#8217;s birth in the Ukraine on 5 October 2017. </p>

X had expected to be there for about 6 &#8211; 8 weeks and had budgeted accordingly. In fact, she was there for five months which caused her some financial difficulties. There were delays in securing a British passport for B due to the changed circumstances of X and Y. The initial application was refused. In October 2017 X returned to the UK for two weeks to try and make the application here, leaving B in the care of someone connected to the surrogacy agency in the Ukraine.  </p>

X attended her father&#8217;s funeral on 29 January 2018. She attended hospital with B on 31 January 2018 due to concerns about her breathing difficulties. As a consequence of the applicant&#8217;s behaviour and inconsistencies in her account of B&#8217;s medical history the hospital made a s 47 referral to the local authority where X lives. In fact, they were already aware of the case as X&#8217;s solicitor had made a referral on 31 January 2018 for a private fostering assessment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.04in">On behalf of X Mr Powell submits, supported by Ms Jaffar on behalf of the child, that B was not habitually resident in the Ukraine during the period of time she was there is the care of X. He relies on the following matters to support the submission. B was discharged from hospital into X&#8217;s care who was the only legal parent in the Ukraine as by that stage Y had abandoned his responsibilities in relation to the child. The evidence demonstrates X always intended to return to this jurisdiction with B, sought to take all necessary steps to achieve that result, only intended to be in the Ukraine for 6 &#8211; 8 weeks, clearly struggled with the consequences of having to stay longer and was in unsuitable temporary accommodation. There is no evidence to suggest any degree of integration other than taking such essential steps regarding health and accommodation pending the return to this jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with those submissions. The social and family environment in the Ukraine was essentially temporary in nature, pending the necessary immigration application for B to come here. Whilst there was a social and family environment in that the child was cared for by X, it was in the context of the pending application for B to come here and there is no other evidence to support any integration in a social and family environment. X and B were isolated there, did not speak the language, had unsatisfactory accommodation and were staying there longer than expected, which clearly created difficulties for X. Whilst the intention of X is only one factor, the evidence demonstrates that at no stage did X relinquish her habitual residence in this jurisdiction or plan to stay in the Ukraine any longer than she had to. </p>

It is worthwhile picking apart what we mean by 'natural parent' in this context.  There is a difference between natural and legal parents.  Thus, the father of a child born to unmarried parents was not legally a 'parent' until the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref> but he was always a natural parent.  The anonymous donor who donates his sperm or her egg under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref> is the natural progenitor of the child but not his legal parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 27</ref> and 28 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>.  The husband or unmarried partner of a mother who gives birth as a result of donor insemination in a licensed clinic in this country is for virtually all purposes a legal parent, but may not be any kind of natural parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 28</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>.  To be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that person's family, but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the child's welfare.</span></p>

She is a legal parent, does have parental responsibility and is an automatic respondent to these proceedings (see rule 14.3 FPR 2010). At the hearing on 5 October 2018 I joined her as a party, directed she should be given notice of this hearing and notified that the court will be invited at this hearing to make a final adoption order.

In Ms Roddy&#8217;s view, given the totality of those aspects of her experience known to her (including unsuitable abusive adult intimate relationships, identity issues arising from her own experience as an adopted child, the death of her father, the anxiety around B&#8217;s health issues , uncertainty as to her legal connection with the child given the absence of a genetic link and mounting financial expenses) she strongly encourages X to embark on counselling support to help her process those aspects of her life.

I wholly endorse that; X has had to manage a lot of difficult issues recently. Now this litigation has concluded this is the time for her to begin to address these matters.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.04in">In reaching my decision I must remain focussed on B&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs, which is the courts paramount consideration. Currently, B is in limbo in so many respects. She is cared for by someone who she regards as her mother who has no genetic relationship with her, and until the orders made by this court no legal status in relation to her in this jurisdiction. Whilst there remain concerns about the reliability and consistency of X&#8217;s account of the background and the action she took to fulfil her desire to have a child, the balance of the evidence following B&#8217;s birth is that X has provided good and consistent care for B and undoubtedly loves her. Those adults that have parental status for B in this jurisdiction (Z and Y) have remained consistent that they wish to relinquish that status. Z following the terms of the surrogacy arrangement and her lack of legal status regarding B in the Ukraine, and Y following the breakdown of his relationship with X. Whilst both Z and Y are an important part of B&#8217;s identity and background and an adoption order will extinguish their legal status with B, this has to be balanced with the advantages for B of an adoption order being made. Such an order will provide lifelong security and stability to her relationship with X. X has demonstrated sensitivity and understanding to B&#8217;s background. She was adopted herself, so is aware of the issues that can arise. Whilst I share many of the concerns outlined by Ms Roddy concerning B&#8217;s conception and X&#8217;s actions both prior to and immediately following B&#8217;s birth the more recent evidence demonstrates that X has been able to provide the consistent care B requires and has not continued to form unsuitable relationships. </p>
