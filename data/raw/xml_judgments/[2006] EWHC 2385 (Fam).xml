If the view was taken that the children's best interests were being adversely affected by the contact then it was provided that an immediate application was to be made to this court for consideration of cessation of the contact.</p>

The critical historical event is that on 28 July 2005 the mother had been given leave permanently to relocate the children to Austria. The order of Wilson J giving her permission was made by consent and recorded (a) an express agreement under Article 12 of Brussels IIr vesting this court with jurisdiction to determine to finality the father's extant contact application, and (b) and undertaking by the mother to return the children to this jurisdiction if called upon to do so. That agreement is manifestly a full and effective prorogation of jurisdiction over the substance of the matter in favour of this court, provided that I am satisfied that it is in the "superior interests" of the children, which I unequivocally am. It overrides the normal rule expressed in Article 9 which is that absent a prorogation agreement this court would lose jurisdiction three months after the change of habitual residence.</p>

It was made in the context of extreme difficulty having been encountered by the father in achieving anything beyond the most limited supervised contact from the very moment of the separation of the parents in April 2004. Before Wilson J's order there had been four previous orders dealing with interim contact.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I should say at this point that Mr Nicholls QC who appears with Mrs Carew Pole for the father mounts an interesting legal argument to the effect that the children's habitual residence as a matter of law never altered from England and Wales as the consent order of Wilson J was procured by the mother's fraud. I shall refer to this argument as "the fraud argument". The fraud, says Mr Nicholls, was that the mother falsely represented that she would promote and foster contact when, as subsequent events have shown, her true motive was to thwart contact at every turn with the ultimate objective of severing totally the relationship between the father and the children. Mr Nicholls relies on the ancient doctrine that fraud unravels everything and on the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (a Minor) (Abduction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 249" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 249</ref> at 261. Mr Nicholls therefore seeks declarations (a) that at all times since August 2005 the children have been habitually resident in England and Wales and (b) pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> that the children were wrongfully removed from England and Wales. The reason that Mr Nicholls seeks this relief is that he (or rather his client) then intends to invoke the machinery of the 1980 Hague Convention on Child Abduction and to have the Central Authority in Austria procure a summary judicial return of the children to this jurisdiction pursuant to the Convention. He is frank enough to say that he adopts this strategy as he has no faith, given what he would regard as a recent act of judicial sabotage in Austria (which I will describe below), that any order that I now make for contact would be recognised and effectively enforced by the Austrian Courts under Chapter III of Brussels IIr. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The position of Mr Gupta, who appears for the children, is pragmatic. He says that there should be a final attempt to persuade the Austrian Courts to recognise and enforce the fresh order for contact that he proposes I should make. He suggests that Mr Nicholls' fraud argument should be stood over and listed to be heard at a later date. He says that two hearings should be listed, the first immediately after the period of contact that he suggests I should order. At that hearing the question of the mother's compliance or otherwise with the order for contact can be judged. She would know that were she to continue to defy the order then there would be a further hearing at which the fraud argument would be ventilated. It would therefore hang as a Sword of Damocles and may have the effect of encouraging the mother to comply with her lawful obligations.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The order for leave to remove of 28 July 2005 was made in the context of an extremely fraught contact dispute between the parents. The mother's position had been from the date of separation that the father, on account of his personal vices, should be confined to supervised contact. That stance had received at least provisional recognition by the court since the only contact ordered had been of a supervised nature. Those orders had been, so far as I can tell, more or less complied with.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">At the time of the order of 28 July 2005 the mother's mental stance was plainly hostile to anything other than limited supervised contact. The father recognised this and consented to a further programme of such contact pending a one day appointment on 9 December 2005 of the hearing of his application for unsupervised contact. That further programme of supervised contact was, so far as I can tell, largely complied with.</p>

Indeed as Paragraph 2.3 of the case summary states "At that stage, the future pattern of contact, including whether and for how long it should continue to be supervised, was still a live issue between the parents".</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">One day was manifestly insufficient to deal with the contact dispute on 9 December 2005. It went part heard. I made an interim contact order and would refer to my reasons expressed in the judgment of that date. Although I could discern no good reason for supervision I acceded to its continuance as the case was not finally decided. However I appointed the father's mother as supervisor. I found her to be sound, responsible and reliable, fulfilling all the necessary qualifications needed by a supervisor. An added benefit would be that she and her husband as grandparents would have contact to the children and their Greek heritage would be promoted.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The mother regarded this order as in effect removing the requirement of supervision. In her eyes supervision by the father's mother was no supervision at all. She therefore immediately moved to a position of defiance of my order. I described her various acts of defiance, non-compliance and strategic manoeuvring in my judgment of 20 July 2005. It is a sad fact that the effect of my order of 9 December 2005 has been to diminish the father's relationship with the children rather than to build it up to the level that I have determined is so vitally in the children's interests. I have had cause to wonder whether on 9 December 2005, given the mother's implacably hostile stance to normal contact, whether a policy of appeasement may not have been better. But then, as history teaches us, appeasement almost always leads to disaster. </p>

There the mother had signed an Australian consent order allowing her mother to bring the child, who was in the custody of the father in Australia, to Wales for a 6 month holiday. The mother did not return the child at the end of the holiday. The Court of Appeal held that the consent order had been procured by the deliberate fraud of the mother, the father's consent was vitiated, and the removal was therefore wrongful. That decision is obviously right but it is a league removed from what Mr Nicholls seeks here which is a declaration that habitual residence never altered because of the alleged fraud. </p>

For adults habitual residence connotes the centre of a person's economic interests (<span style="font-style:italic">Swaddling v Adjudication Officer</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 184" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 184</ref>, ECJ). A person can be habitually resident somewhere even if his presence in that place is unlawful (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mark v Mark</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1193" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1193</ref>, HL). For children habitual residence is largely a matter of fact. Obviously in a classic abduction scenario the wrongful removal of a child from State A to State B does not change his habitual residence because otherwise the 1980 Convention would be emasculated. But where there has been a removal from State A to State B pursuant to a valid court order and where the children thereafter have lived exclusively in State B, in this case for 13 months, it is stretching language to breaking point to say that they have in fact been habitually resident in State A because the mother had destructive thoughts about contact in her mind at the time of the court order.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It should be borne in mind that were I to make the declarations sought by Mr Nicholls they would be merely exhortatory. It would be for the Austrian Court to determine whether the children were at the relevant time habitually resident in England and whether their removal was wrongful. It may or may not pay any attention to my declarations. Even if it did and came to the same conclusion there would be obstacle of Article 12(2) of the 1980 Convention which says that where a child has been settled in the destination state for 12 months the court is not obliged to order return. Whether the Austrian Court would apply the interpretation of that provision as expounded by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Cannon v Cannon</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 169" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 169</ref>, CA is anybody's guess.

Imagine that an order had been made, as here, for the mother to bring the children to England for a week of contact. Assume that she failed to comply with the order. By the time that the father was able to approach the Austrian Court for summary enforcement the week had come and gone and so the order was a historical relic incapable of enforcement. On the horizon is another week of contact. But until she fails to comply with it the mother is not in breach and so there is nothing to enforce. On this scenario it was mooted that the enforcement provisions might be regarded as a dead letter. This was another reason why Mr Nicholls was anxious to press his fraud argument. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Before I deal with the facts of this case I would deal with the extent of the powers of second court under Article 20, as this is very relevant to the matter in hand. Article 20 reproduces exactly Article 12 of the original Brussels II. That in turn was modelled on Article 24 of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968 (Brussels I) (in its old form as adopted by the then six Member States in 1968) and in its modern replacement, namely Article 31 of Council Regulation No 44/2001. The scope of Article 12 of the original Brussels II was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Wermuth v Wermuth No 2</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 1029" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 1029</ref>. The relevant authorities of the European Court of Justice were examined. In summary it was explained that the provision could only be invoked in order to supply measures which are intended to preserve a factual or legal situation in one Member State so as to safeguard rights which are the subject matter of litigation in the court of another Member State which has jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter. Moreover, the Article can only be invoked in cases of genuine urgency where it is impossible to make an emergency application to the court having exclusive jurisdiction. In that case an application for maintenance pending suit did not satisfy the first criterion. On the facts of the case the applicant did not demonstrate the element of urgency. What is clear is that Article 20 cannot be used illegitimately to seize jurisdiction validly vested in the first court. As Thorpe LJ stated at Paragraph 34</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"First, we must espouse Brussels II and apply it wholeheartedly. We must not take or be seen to take opportunities for usurping the function of the judge in the other Member State. Once another jurisdiction is demonstrated to be apparently first seised, the jurisdiction must defer by holding itself in waiting, in case that apparent priority should be disproved or declined. Secondly, one of the primary objectives of Brussels II is to simplify jurisdictional rules and to eliminate expensive and superfluous litigation."</p>

The authorities of Member State B urgently need to take certain provisional measures to protect the child who has no relatives in Member State B. The fact that the courts of Member State A have jurisdiction under the Regulation as to the substance does not prevent the courts or competent authorities of Member State B from deciding, on a provisional basis, to take measures to protect the child.

For this purpose she changed her lawyers. This time she supported her application with two psychiatric reports. The first dated 8 September 2006 was from Dr Gabrielle Wortgotter. She is the examining or reporting psychiatrist. The second was dated 18 September 2006 and was from Dr Steinberger who is the psychiatrist treating the mother and the children. I append each of those reports to this judgment. Both reports are based on the statements of the mother and the children alone. I do not believe that any of the papers in this case were available to their authors. The father was not interviewed and no attempt was made to obtain any of his records from, or the views of, his own psychiatrist in London. Indeed I am told that a request by the father that he speak to one of the psychiatrists was turned down.</p>

Dr Steinberger's report categorically stated that he had been detained in a psychiatric hospital "on the grounds of his paedophilia". She said that the children have "never feared anyone or anything as much as their own father" and that it would be "absurd, inhuman and sadistic" for the English court to require them to be brought to England for assessment and contact. She suggested that contact be suspended for two to three years "since this represents an extreme risk to the children's welfare".</p>

It is implicit in his ruling that he expected this court to make substantive decisions at the hearing fixed for 27 September 2006. Notwithstanding this clear message the mother chose not to attend or to be represented before me. Instead, on 26 September 2006 the mother's new lawyers wrote to the Guardian stating that the mother had now applied for a transfer of parental responsibility/custody. Obviously such an application is wholly misconceived and must be struck out as this court has exclusive jurisdiction, as Judge Felhab has accepted.</p>

Well, it's a very serious matter to prevent a father from seeing his children except under supervision, and if one was to propose that, as a doctor, as a psychiatrist, there would have to be a strong psychiatric reason to propose it. You would have to have either severe mental illness, which the father has never had, or a significant ---- mood disorder which he has not had, or a disabling neurotic disorder which he has not had, or a personality disorder, a serious personality disorder. When I first saw him in my first report I thought there was evidence of quite a serious personality disorder. As time has gone on since then, and relying on the reports of Dr. Woolfson, it appears that this problem has substantially resolved. I think, in fact, the very regular contact Dr. Woolfson has had with the father has provided a sort of external superego, if I can use a bit of psycho-medical jargon, or external conscience, should we say, and from the information available to me that seems to have had a very beneficial effect. So, the conclusion that I read from this is that there is no significant psychiatric reason which would prevent from seeing his children without supervision. "</p>

She seemed to think, like many women, that whatever she felt about him she had an ordinary mother's responsibilities and obligations to make an acceptable degree of contact work. That's what she conveyed to me. At the time I thought she was pretty sincere about the move to Vienna, she needed it at a personal level, but it wouldn't interfere with the contact because she needed the contact to work. We talked about finding a therapist for ML in Vienna if ML was anxious about seeing her father, how to help her be less anxious. That is the way we used to talk.</p>

I think the mother has also not been happy about the cost of flying the children to the UK and who is supposed to pay for that.

But I have to be realistic. I have endeavoured to frame an order to which neither the mother, the Austrian psychiatrists nor the Austrian Court could possibly take exception on the ground of psychological trauma to the children. It meets the apparent concern of Judge Felhab that my previous order provided for contact to commence before the psychological and psychiatric examination of the children. As will be seen my new order provides for such examination to take place before the children see their father and give the professionals the power to curtail or extinguish the contact if they judge it to be harmful to the children. I entirely endorse Dr Berelowitz's evidence that:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"I just want to insert one note of caution about this visit. Obviously contact is terribly important from a legal point of view in terms of this order. If you're in therapy and are someone for whom ordinary advice doesn't work, it is perfectly possible that these children will come and see the guardian and myself, and the guardian and I, and perhaps even the children, will be confident that the children do not have any good rational reason for not seeing their father, nevertheless their irrational reasons might not be amenable on a single visit or even two visits to my and the guardian's advice and they may not be able to tolerate contact even though they accept that their reasons for not going don't really add up. It is the same as trying to get a child with a school phobia back to school. They may accept that they don't have any very good reason for not going, but it is very hard to get them to go. One of the options might be that the guardian and I think that the children ought to have contact but plenty of work will need to be done in order to get even the first supported contact to take place because of what has happened over the intervening few months. The successive steps in this proposal, the few day proposal prior to the next thing, the progression can't be taken for granted."</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This is a classic case to invoke judicial assistance and collaboration under the auspices of the European Justice Network which was adopted in May 2001 by Regulation 470/2001 following the decision of the Council in Tampere in 1999 and the subsequent Commission proposal of September 2000 (see <a class="Hyperlink" href="http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/index_en.htm</a>). As a delegate to the Anglophone-Germanophone Family Law Judicial Conference held in September 2006 in Dublin I received a paper on the Austrian position on judicial cooperation given by Robert Fucik of the Federal Ministry of Justice, Vienna. He pointed out that Arts 15(6), 55 and 58 of Brussels II specifically exhort judicial cooperation. He wrote</p>

	    <p class="quo">"Of course, judicial cooperation has not only to be installed, but also to be done. Cooperation, trust and friendship between judges from different states have to be practised, not declared."</p>
	    <p class="NormalWeb">He identified the relevant liaison judges for this case in Austria to be Dr Christian Rauscher of the Federal Ministry of Justice and Judge Robert Czedik-Eysenberg of the Oberlandsgerichtssprengel Wien. I intend to send this judgment and order together with my judgments of 9 December 2005 and 20 July 2006 to the liaison judges with a plea that the Austrian court system does everything in its power to ensure that my new contact order is complied with. I will also send the judgments to Lord Justice Thorpe as Head of International Family Law in this jurisdiction and to Dr Werner Schutz who is a leading figure in the development of European Family Law at the Austrian Ministry of Justice. My plea can be expressed no better than the words of Lord Justice Thorpe in the recent case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Prazic v Prazic</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/497" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 497" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 497</ref> at Paragraph 28:</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">There remains the possibility that notwithstanding the highly controlled, observed and therapeutic nature of my contact order the mother will continue to defy it and will not bring the children here. I was informed by Mr Nicholls that a contact order in Austria is only enforceable by financial penalty and that coercive measures cannot be used. He told me that coercive measures can only be used to enforce custody orders. I find this hard to believe. But if it is the case and neither the mother and the children arrive on Sunday 5th November 2006 then on Thursday 9th November 2006 I will give consideration to a change of residence (custody) in favour of the father. Such an order, after it has been declared enforceable in Austria under Article 28, will be implemented there, and according to Mr Nicholls' instructions, coercive measures may be used. I am not saying that I would make such an order &#8211; it would on any view be draconian &#8211; but the mother should be very clear that such an order would be within my powers and that I would entertain an application to make it. As Dr Berelowitz said</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"Q. The only other question is this: it may well be that the father makes an application at a later stage for the summary return of the children to this jurisdiction. What do you have to say if anything about what effect that could have as to the welfare of the children balanced against them being exposed to the current developing scenario?</p>

If the father is confident that the children are developing a story about him that he is a seriously mentally ill, consistently alcohol dependent paedophile and therefore they should never see him again, I don't think there is any sensible measure that he should stop at in order to try to protect them from these sorts of ideas"</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">There is one final matter I must mention. At the beginning of his oral evidence Dr Woolfson said this:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"..it has been my practice to do spot checks on the father in terms of the usage of alcohol and drugs, and had done spot checks in February, April, May, June and July, they were all negative; and I did a spot check yesterday and that showed that showed that there was a trace of cocaine metabolite in his urine. That needs to be discussed in the sense that it is quite a serious departure from his former behaviour. There are two points of view that I considered. In the first instance I spoke to the father and he told me that he had been at a party on the Saturday evening and was in a state of considerable tension bearing in mind his forthcoming court appearance. He was with three or four Greek friends and they offered him some cocaine which he foolishly took. In that sense, he must have known, when I phoned him suddenly out of the blue yesterday morning ordering him to come for a spot check, that it was going to appear in his urine. He was in a position then where he could have said, "I'm ill", or not answered my phone call or done something to prevent his attendance at the laboratory, but, in a sense, to his credit, he went to the laboratory and had the test knowing that it would be positive. That is the only other comment I have to make about that issue.</p>

I think the father was foolish and he was "uptight and tense and anxious" and behaved immaturely, but I have not observed in the three plus years that I've seen him any evidence of outrageously antisocial, uncooperative behaviour or evidence that he could or would be physically violent or dangerous in terms of the handling or management of his children at all.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Professor Freeman did not express concern as to the father's fitness to have contact in the light of this revelation. I am told that Dr Berelowitz was informed of this episode and as he did not raise it in his evidence I can assume that he too has no concerns arising from it. For my part I have to express my disappointment that the father should have allowed himself to fall into temptation in this way. He has told me that he intends it never to recur. Given the regime of random testing he must know that his sincerity will be capable of being gauged. On the assumption that this will prove to be an isolated lapse I too place no weight on it in assessing what orders for contact are in the best interests of these children. </p>
