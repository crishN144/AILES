	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The court has before it an application for a declaration of non-paternity in respect of two children, A, who was born in 2005 and now aged 15, and B, who was born in 2006 and is now aged 13.  This matter was rightly described by the Children&#8217;s Guardian in evidence as a &#8220;minefield&#8221;.   Responsibility for this lies <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> with the adult parties in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The applicant is MS (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;), represented by Ms Daisy Hughes of counsel.  The father seeks a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> that he is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> in fact the father of the children.  The father invites the court to make the declaration he seeks based on the totality of the evidence before the court, which evidence includes the results of a commercial &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; DNA test he administered to both children without their knowledge.  Whilst in his statement of 4 November 2019 the father states that he is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> seeking a declaration that the second respondent, BT (hereafter &#8216;the putative father&#8217;), is the children&#8217;s father, it became clear during Ms Hughes&#8217; oral and written closing submissions that, in effect, the father does seek a finding to that effect in circumstances where he invites the court to draw an adverse inference against the putative father by reason of his refusal to submit voluntarily to forensic DNA testing.  The father presented as a rather egocentric and self-centred witness, lacking in empathy, quick to emphasise to the court how hard this matter has been for <span style="font-style:italic">him</span> and exhibiting little apparent appreciation of the impact of his unilateral and clandestine actions on A and B. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother of the children is the first respondent, RS (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;). She represented herself before the court.  The mother contends that the children should not be subject to further forensic DNA testing and the father&#8217;s application should be dismissed.  Her case as to the children&#8217;s paternity appeared to evolve over the course of the hearing to the point where she asserts that she now has &#8220;no reason to believe&#8221; that the father is not the biological father of the children.  She however, also conceded certain behaviour at the time of the conception of each child that leaves that assertion open to question.  The mother remains willing to undergo a forensic DNA test.  I found the mother to be an evasive witness who was prone to clothe her answers in caveats with a view to avoiding a concrete position with respect to the question of paternity and to leave open the possibility that the putative father is indeed the biological father of the children.  Within this context, her final position in oral evidence, in so far as it was possible to identify one, was that as far as she is aware the father is the biological father of the children, that she still believes that he is &#8220;most likely their father&#8221;, that it is &#8220;not likely&#8221; that the putative father is the biological father.  The mother also stated that if the father is not the children&#8217;s biological father she has no idea who is.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The putative father is the second respondent in these proceedings and is represented by Ms Margaret Parr of counsel.  The putative father submits that the question of a declaration on the father&#8217;s application is a matter for the court but argues strenuously that the court should not make any finding that he is the father of the children.  Again, the putative father&#8217;s case appeared to evolve over the course of the hearing to the point where, whilst he asserts it is highly unlikely that he is the father of the children, he too conceded certain behaviour at the time of the conception of each child that may </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">call into question the validity of that assertion.  As I have alluded to, the putative father has during the case management stage of these proceedings refused to submit voluntarily to a DNA test in order to settle the question of whether he is the father of the children. He reconfirmed this objection in oral evidence, notwithstanding the ability of the court to draw an adverse inference from that stance.  By way of explanation for his refusal, the putative father relied on concerns about data privacy and the security of his DNA samples in the context of his job in information technology, vague and non-specific criticisms of the family court, borne of previous litigation with respect to his daughters, and concerns regarding the impact of the results on his mental health.  Like the mother, I found the putative father to be an evasive witness who was also prone to dress his answers in caveats, again in an apparent effort to avoid a firm position with respect to the question of paternity and to leave open the possibility that the subject children are his.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The children are represented through their Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Huber, by Ms Joanna Moody of counsel.  Both children are described as feeling distressed, deeply angry and betrayed by the surreptitious DNA test carried out on them by the father.  There is evidence that each of the children has suffered considerable emotional anguish and instability in this context, with A in particular being said to have exhibited both threatened and actual self-harm.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian considers that both children are <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent with respect to the question of further, forensic, DNA testing.  Within this context, the current firm position of both children is that they will refuse to undergo further, forensic DNA testing, that they do not wish to know who their father is and that they wish to be left alone.  On balance, that position is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian with respect to both of the children.  In the circumstances, the Children&#8217;s Guardian submits that, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A(5) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>, it is not in the children&#8217;s best interests for the father&#8217;s application to be determined.  In the alternative, the Children&#8217;s Guardian submits that there is insufficient evidence to determine that application or to make any finding in respect of the putative father. </p>

Within this context, in determining the issues before the court I heard evidence from the father, the mother, the putative father and from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  I have also had the benefit of reading the documentary evidence that has been filed with the court and the helpful Skeleton Arguments provided by counsel.  Following the conclusion of oral closing submissions, Ms Hughes requested the opportunity to make further submissions in writing.  I gave permission and have received further written submissions from all counsel and the mother. The final set of written submissions was received by the court on 3 March 2020.  </p>

In October 2001 the mother commenced work at [company Y], a division of [company X].  Whilst in that employment, the mother met the putative father, who was himself at that time married.  The mother and the putative father led a large project together.  Within this context, the father asserts that between 2001 and 2003 the mother and the putative father were required in their respective roles to travel together to [location given] on a frequent basis for many days at a time and staying at the same hotel.

It is the father&#8217;s case that there is a considerable family resemblance between the putative father&#8217;s children by his ex-wife and B and A.  On the morning of the second day of this hearing, and having never raised the issue before, the putative father filed and served a handwritten statement asserting that he and his ex-wife had endured considerable fertility issues when trying to conceive their daughters.  With respect to the aspects of fertility treatment that related to him, the putative father asserted that he had been diagnosed with &#8216;slow swimmers&#8217;, a reference to the effectiveness of his sperm.   Asked to explain why he had not raised this issue before, the putative father stated, surprisingly, that it had not &#8220;struck me as of any relevance&#8221;.

When cross examined by Ms Moody, the mother stated that at the time of A&#8217;s conception she and the father had been actively trying for a baby and had undergone fertility and sperm testing to that end.  In oral evidence, the father confirmed that he and the mother&#8217;s relationship was sexual at the time of A&#8217;s conception. B was conceived in mid-December 2005. In evidence the father contended that he and the mother had not often been intimate during this latter period but had had sexual relations once or twice when on holiday at this time.

At a hearing on 10 October 2019 before HHJ Forrester the putative father stated that he was not willing to undergo DNA testing and made a direction that the father indicate whether he sought an order requiring the putative father to provide DNA samples and an order that such sample be tested against those taken from the children by the father.

She was clear in her view that her paternity is a matter for her parents to resolve and she does not wish to be involved.

Within this context, Ms Huber rejected the notion that further, forensic DNA testing would provide any sense of &#8220;certainty&#8221; or &#8220;finality&#8221; for the children, given the emotional damage caused by the current situation, with which damage they will continue to wrestle.   </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Minor) (Blood Tests: Parental Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 89" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 89</ref> the Court of Appeal referred to Art 7 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in concluding that every child has the right to know the truth of his identity unless disclosure is clearly contrary to his best interests. There must be cogent reasons for denying the child that knowledge.  The child's long-term interests may also be better served not just by his knowing the truth about parentage but also by the fact that the adults involved will be able to plan their future lives in light of the true situation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Minor) (Child Support: Blood Tests)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 548" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 548</ref>). Within this context, it has been held that in most cases it is in the interests of the child that paternity doubts should be resolved on the best evidence and that the child should be told the truth as soon as possible and that there are few cases where the best interests of the children can be shown to be served by suppression of truth (<span style="font-style:italic">Re T (A Child) (DNA Tests: Paternity)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1190" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1190</ref>).

In deciding whether to make a direction for testing, the proper approach is that the court should permit a scientific test unless it is satisfied that to do so would be against the child's interests, having weighed those interests against the competing interests of the adults </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.36in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;The starting-point must be that the old uncertainties which formerly surrounded issues of disputed paternity when a mother had been sexually involved with two or more men at the time of conception are now banished altogether. Genetic testing, already advanced to a high degree of probability through the negative techniques of exclusion, has now moved on to the point where it has become possible to achieved positive certainty. That has had a profound effect on cases like the present, where a mother has been having relations with different men at the time of conception. Any man who is unsure of his own paternity and harbours the least doubt as to whether the child he is alleged to have fathered may be that of another man now has it within his power to set all doubt at test by submitting to a test. It has ceased, therefore, to be possible for any man in such circumstances to be forced against his will to accept paternity of a child whom he does not believe to be his. Against that background of law and scientific advance, it seems to me to follow, both in justice and in common sense, that if a mother makes a claim against one of the possible fathers, and he chooses to exercise his right not to submit to be tested, the inference that he is the father of the child should be virtually inescapable. He would certainly have to advance very clear and cogent reasons for this refusal to be tested &#8211; reasons which it would be just and fair and reasonable for him to be allowed to maintain.&#8221; </p>

In particular, with respect to the putative father I have taken account of Ms Parr&#8217;s submission that the evidence concerned intensely personal matters dating from a very difficult period in the putative father&#8217;s life of which he was clearly not proud.  However, there is a more fundamental difficulty with this evidence and with the father&#8217;s contention that it demonstrates that the mother and the putative father were having sexual intercourse at the time of each child&#8217;s conception.   </p>

That regulatory framework for forensic DNA testing is in place precisely to avoid this situation and to ensure that the court has available to it independent testing undertaken by a qualified person in forensically rigorous circumstances.  Within this context, I agree with Hayden J (as he now is) that it is likely that any procedural or professional deficiencies that are identified in the testing will make it impossible for the court to rely on the conclusions of that testing.  In this case the samples were not taken by an approved sampler but by the party that now seeks to rely on them, the court has only the father&#8217;s account of how the testing was undertaken, the father was not in a position to determine whether there was any reason that the samples should not have been taken at that point, there was no independent witness to the samples being taken, there is no confirmation beyond the father&#8217;s account that the samples sent were the samples taken from the children and there is no demonstrable chain of custody with respect to the samples.

Within this context, I have borne carefully in mind that the authorities make clear that the court&#8217;s power to draw an adverse inference based on a refusal by an adult to undergo testing is wholly at large, is unconfined, is wide enough to extend to an inference of the child&#8217;s actual paternity and that, in this context, the court is entitled to draw the inference that a putative father is the father of a child by his refusal to submit to tests even where there exists a presumption that the child is the legitimate child of another man.  I am also mindful that there is some authority for the proposition that where there is a refusal to undertake a DNA test the inference that the unwilling party is the father of the child should be virtually inescapable.  However, in evaluating the weight, if any to attach to a refusal by a putative father to undergo testing, and in examining whether any explanation is objectively valid and demonstrates rationality, logicality, and consistency leading to reasons which it would be just and fair and reasonable to allow him to maintain, the court must necessarily have proper regard to the context of the refusal.  In the particular circumstances of this case, there are significant difficulties with an approach that seeks to draw from the putative father&#8217;s refusal to voluntarily undergo DNA a virtually inescapable inference that he is the children&#8217;s father. </p>

It is correct that the father raised the issue of forensic testing before the court on 20 January 2020, although he did not press a formal application.  I also acknowledge that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H </span>it was held that there is little material difference between a refusal to provide a sample after the court directing such a sample and a refusal where no such direction has been given.

In the circumstances, the position of the putative father that he declined to participate in DNA testing because he was not persuaded of the necessity for voluntary DNA testing and sought to preserve the confidentiality of his DNA must be seen in this context.  In the circumstances, whilst the putative father is not in breach of a direction of the court that he undergo DNA testing, much more importantly his decision not to submit to voluntarily DNA testing must be seen in the context that until this hearing no one, including the mother, was seeking a declaration or a finding that he is the biological father of the children.    </p>

Once again, there are difficulties with this evidence.  First, these matters were assembled by the father as relevant to the question of paternity only after he had developed suspicions that the putative father was the biological father.  As the father himself conceded, at the time these matters did not cause him any suspicion (albeit I am satisfied he did not know about at least some of the visits by the putative father).  Within this context, and as conceded in part by the father, there is a danger that the father&#8217;s evidence with respect to these matters is significantly contaminated by confirmation bias in circumstances where they derive from the father&#8217;s much later efforts to prove a proposition he had come firmly to believe was true.

On 21 November 2019 A denied to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that she had been self-harming but admitted struggling emotionally and wished to talk to a professional.  B was also referred to CAMHS at this time following his exclusion from class for behavioural issues and a diagnosis of depression.  In a statement filed four days later the mother reported that B had expressed suicidal thoughts and A had again self-harmed by cutting her wrists with a kitchen knife.  In her written closing submissions, filed following the request of Ms Hughes to file further submissions in writing, the mother stated that B had recently thrown himself into a river.

However, I am satisfied that much of the emotional turmoil being experienced by both children stems from the issue of paternity, and in particular the manner in which their DNA was obtained from them.  This much is entirely plain from what the children themselves have said.  Further, the court cannot simply ignore current emotional distress, behaviour and evidence the self-harm exhibited by the children and the statements they have made regarding the emotional pain caused to them by the father&#8217;s concealed actions.  Within this context, I must place weight on the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s that any order the court made for further forensic DNA testing will be seen by the children as simply more emotional pressure being placed upon them at a time when they are highly emotionally vulnerable and in relation to an issue they consider to be between the adults of which they want no part.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, both children have also expressed clearly that they do not wish to provide further, forensic DNA samples.  A is 15 years of age and B is 13 years of age.  There is no cogent evidence before the court that their views on testing are being influenced by their mother nor did any party seek to challenge the conclusion of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the children are <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent on the issue of providing further samples.  Unlike the cases of very young children, where unresolved questions of paternity may be a &#8216;ticking time bomb (to use Ward LJ&#8217;s phrase in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Paternity: Blood Test)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 65" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 65</ref>), in this case A and B are teenage children who have become aware that paternity is in issue and who have made clear that they do not wish to know their paternity and will not submit to testing to establish the same, they being competent to so refuse.  Within the foregoing context, the Children&#8217;s Guardian submits that as children aged 15 and 13 years old respectively with strong and clearly expressed views, A and B have a right not to know (or more accurately to choose if and when to know) their paternity and that to conclude otherwise at this time would be to place further and damaging emotional pressure on them.  I accept that submission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The authorities are clear that, with respect to children under 16 who are considered <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent, if a child is of sufficient understanding he or she may refuse to submit to medical examination or other assessment and that it is therefore generally unwise to subject a child who is able to understand the purpose and implications of testing to testing against that child&#8217;s will.   In the circumstances, I am satisfied that to press further forensic DNA testing of the children at this time would not only heap further and damaging emotional pressure onto the children and be antithetic to their clearly expressed wishes and feelings, it would also be wrong in principle in my judgment to impose such forensic DNA testing on <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent children who clearly object to it.  In this context I am satisfied that to do so at this time would be against the child's interests, having weighed those interests against the competing interests of the father, the mother and the putative father, who will be affected, one way or another, by my decision.   </p>

However, as also made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, such factors are more appropriately dealt with under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/58" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 58</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> if and when the court reaches the stage of whether, having decided to determine the application, a declaration should be made. Further, and in any event, a declaration based on evidence that is, as in this case, deficient is obviously antithetic to the need for the status of an individual to spelled out accurately and in clear terms and recorded in properly maintained records.   </p>

Further, in circumstances where the <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent subject children in this case object to forensic DNA testing and where I am satisfied that to press further testing at this time to remedy that issue would be emotionally damaging to the children, I am equally satisfied that it is not in the children&#8217;s best interests to compel them to undergo the testing that would remedy these evidential difficulties at this point in time, having weighed those interests against the competing interests of the adults in this case.   </p>

Further, any decision by the court not to accede to the father&#8217;s request to legally determine whether he is the father of the children constitutes an interference with his right to respect for family life unless it is in accordance with the law, pursues an aim or aims that are legitimate and can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.

Beyond these factors, there is a wider public interest in the children&#8217;s status being, eventually, formally settled and recorded in properly maintained records, not least to address potential future questions with respect to, for example, consanguinity.  With respect to the children, whilst the court must be careful not to simply assume that the children will eventually want and need certainty regarding their paternity and that such certainty will inevitably be good for them, in the medium to long term I am satisfied that it is likely to be in the children&#8217;s best interests to know the identity of their biological father, that conclusion being one that, as observed by Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (Paternity)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 FLR 26" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 FLR 26</ref>, is generally consistent with the proposition that:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">How then does the court, within this context, balance the need to ensure the best interests of the children and the need to act fairly to the father, with whose application for a declaration of non-paternity the court is seised?   In answering this difficult question, I am attracted by the submission of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that I should consider the approach adopted in circumstances not dissimilar to those in this case by Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, a case concerning, as I have noted, a teenage child who was struggling with emotional issues and refusing to agree to participate in scientific testing to determine his paternity.  In that case, having heard evidence from each of the parties, the social worker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, Hedley J determined that the appropriate means of relieving pressure on the child to submit to testing whilst also treating the father fairly by ensuring a mechanism for the eventual determination of his application was to order scientific testing of the adults and to order scientific testing of the child but to stay the order in relation to the child without limit of time, with an invitation to the Cafcass officer to explain to the child the rationale for the judge&#8217;s decision.  Namely, that the court understood the pressure on the child and did not wish to force the question of testing, but that the issue of paternity could not remain unresolved forever.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This approach commends itself to the court in this case.  I am clear, based on the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian and the mother, that it would be entirely antithetic to the children&#8217;s best interests to force the question of testing at this point within the context of their wishes and feelings as set out above.  As I have noted, it is readily apparent to the court why A would feel so grossly violated by the surreptitious taking of her DNA by the father and why B would feel necessarily confused by the consequences of that action.  Within this context, I am satisfied that their fierce objection at this time to further testing is both deeply held and genuine.  Against this, the children are each articulate and have engaged with the Children&#8217;s Guardian. The Children&#8217;s Guardian did not rule out the possibility that the children <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> ultimately change their mind in respect of testing if they knew that each of the adults had already provided samples.  In this context, whilst satisfied it would be wrong to press the question of testing with an order taking effect immediately, I am satisfied that an </p>

Equally, whilst satisfied that it would not be in the children&#8217;s best interests to determine the father&#8217;s application on the basis of the current deficient evidence before the court, the father&#8217;s application should not be dismissed in circumstances where the court is leaving the door open to the provision of evidence of sufficient cogency to determine that application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I have acknowledged the decision of the court leaves the applicant in the position of being the legal father of the children for a further period, with all the legal consequences that flow from that status.  Within this context, as I have also noted above, any decision by the court note to accede to the father&#8217;s request to legally determine whether he is the father of the children, and to allow a legal presumption to prevail over what may be a different biological reality, constitutes an interference with his right to respect for family life unless it is in accordance with the law, pursues an aim or aims that are legitimate and can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.  However, two points fall to be made in this respect.  First, in balancing the competing rights of the parties, including those of the children, the children&#8217;s best interests are paramount.  Within this context, the interference in the father&#8217;s Art 8 rights constituted by a further delay in the determination of his application are necessary and proportionate to the aim of ensuring the best interests of the children are protected for the reasons I have set out.   Second, it cannot be ignored that the father is the author of his own predicament, having chosen, at best unwisely, to take matters into his own hands by deploying clandestine DNA testing upon which the court cannot rely for the reasons I have given.  </p>

In resolving the contradiction thereby created I am satisfied, for the reasons I have given, that the proper way forward in this case is to direct, pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1969</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20</ref> that the father, the mother and the putative father shall provide DNA samples for testing, the results of that testing to be delivered to Cafcass and held in a sealed envelope on the children&#8217;s Cafcass file.
