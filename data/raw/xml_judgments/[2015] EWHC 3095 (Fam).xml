	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on the applicant wife's claim for ancillary relief. According to her counsel's financial schedule the net assets amount to around &#163;1.3m. It is a routine needs case following a 20 year marriage. One might ask therefore: why it is listed for hearing in the High Court with a time estimate of 4 days and where the wife has incurred costs on the indemnity basis of around &#163;150,000?  The answer is the conduct of the husband. It has been truly abysmal. Since the claim was commenced in September 2012 there have been over 30 hearings including four appeals mounted by the husband. This deluge has been caused by the husband's extreme litigation misconduct. In parallel proceedings concerning a bogus loan asserted by his sister he made threats to kill against the wife and her counsel for which he was committed to prison for contempt. In these ancillary relief proceedings he has been removed from the courtroom on at a least one occasion by security staff. He has been repeatedly warned by judges about his unpleasant menacing conduct in court. On one occasion he assaulted the wife's counsel and the wife in court for which he was later convicted of assault in the magistrates' court. He skipped his sentencing hearing and fled abroad from where he has bombarded the court with abusive emails claiming that he has a fatal illness and demanding that the proceedings be adjourned indefinitely. In the course of the proceedings he has entered into a number of transactions designed to defeat the wife's claims. </p>

Clothes shoes I went and gave to my sister. I will put you on the street without anything"</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final hearing for 26 October 2015 was fixed in early June 2015. The PTR was fixed before Moylan J on 8 October 2015. The husband did not attend. Instead on that day he sent an email to the court claiming that he was suffering from a fatal illness and seeking confirmation that "no hearings are currently scheduled". Moylan J ordered that the matter remain listed and gave final directions for trial. On 16 October 2015 the husband made an application in Form D11 seeking adjournment of the hearing "until further notice". In the form he says <span style="font-weight:bold">"MOYLAN You have been cruel AND EVIL person to ask a CRITICALLY ILL PERSON to make this application. BE A HUMAN BEING"</span>. To the form he attached a "medical certificate" from Dr Dobray Maria of Budapest, Hungary. This states:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moylan J ordered that the husband's application be heard on 22 October 2015 and it came before Roberts J. She dismissed the application, which was hardly surprising given that the medical certificate, if authentic (which I doubt), fell far short of the standard needed for an adjournment of a final hearing. That standard has been definitively expressed by Norris J in <span style="font-style:italic">Levy v Ellis-Carr</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">&amp; Others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2012/63" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 63 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 63 (Ch.)</ref> at para 36 where he said:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"In my judgment [the doctor's letter] falls far short of the medical evidence required to demonstrate that the party is unable to attend a hearing and participate in the trial. Such evidence should identify the medical attendant and give details of his familiarity with the party's medical condition (detailing all recent consultations), should identify with particularity what the patient's medical condition is and the features of that condition which (in the medical attendant's opinion) prevent participation in the trial process, should provide a reasoned prognosis and should give the court some confidence that what is being expressed is an independent opinion after a proper examination. It is being tendered as expert evidence. The court can then consider what weight to attach to that opinion, and what arrangements might be made (short of an adjournment) to accommodate a party's difficulties. No judge is bound to accept expert evidence: even a proper medical report falls to be considered simply as part of the material as a whole (including the previous conduct of the case). The letter on which the Appellant relies is wholly inadequate." </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Roberts J did however provide in her order for the husband to be able to contact the court to be able to participate in the hearing by video or telephone. Her order in unsealed form was emailed to the husband by the wife's solicitors on the same day at 5:53 pm. If the husband was dissatisfied with it then his only recourse was to appeal. However on Saturday 24 October the husband submitted a yet further application in Form D11 seeking an adjournment relying on the same medical evidence. It is obviously abusive for repeated applications to be made in relation for the same relief where there has been no material change of circumstances. If an application for relief has been dismissed on the merits then absent a change of circumstances (or the original order being shown to have been based on misstated facts or material non-disclosure) the only proper way of challenging it is by way of appeal: see <span style="font-style:italic">Arif v Zar &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/986" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 986" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 986</ref> at para 27, per Patten LJ. Therefore, I summarily rejected the further application and proceeded to hear the wife's ancillary relief application. Notwithstanding that the husband had been invited to participate by telephone or video he did not seek to do so but rather kept up a stream of abusive emails to my clerk. For example on 27 October 2016 (while this judgment was under consideration)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Exclusive of the mortgage the sum of &#163;135,694 was provided to buy it. On the evidence of the wife I am satisfied that this derived solely from the husband. There is no evidence that either the son or the sister had either the means or the capacity to raise this money. I am satisfied that as the contributor of the (non-mortgage) purchase monies the husband is the sole beneficial owner of this property, and I so declare. This finding is binding on the son as he is a party. It is also binding on the sister as DJ Hess on 16 December 2013 made an order requiring the sister to file a witness statement if she wished to claim any legal or beneficial interest in the property in issue. That order was served on her, but she filed no evidence. She has also failed to comply with a third party disclosure order. She is therefore estopped from denying the finding I have made. </p>

In reaching this conclusion I have applied the relevant principles relating to the treatment of non-disclosure of assets as set out by me in <span style="font-style:italic">NG v SG (Appeal: Non-disclosure)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/3270" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 3270 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 3270 (Fam)</ref>.

		<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">As mentioned above in July 2011 the company AVSVAVMV Expert Solutions Ltd was formed. Between September and November 2012 the husband was able to transfer to his children &#8364;253,000 from the company. Thus in a short period at least this amount, and probably a great deal more, was accumulated within the company. It is very reasonable to assume that similar sums have been accumulated there or elsewhere since that date.</p>

In addition he has retained other chattels which cost around &#163;150,000, but which are unlikely to be worth that sum. The husband should be treated as having at least &#163;100,000 worth of matrimonial personalty.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">The husband has adamantly refused to give disclosure and has engaged in a number of frankly absurd manoeuvres to try and defeat the wife's claims. Similarly the children and the company (the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> &#8211; 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> respondents) and the husband's sister have failed to comply with disclosure orders. Where there is a refusal to give disclosure the inevitable inference is that there are undisclosed assets that the non-discloser is trying to protect, and this is particularly so where the principal non-discloser engages in other manoeuvres  to seek to defeat the claim.   </p>

Her plan is to sell 7 McKenzie Way and to use the proceeds (a) to pay off the mortgage on 68 Poplar Road and (b) to provide a fund to enable her, inter alia, to set up a beautician's business. Up to now she has been working in a supermarket but an arthritic condition has brought that to an end. She is willing to accept the challenge of independent life and for this reason wishes closure between herself and the husband. Inclusive of the pension share she would have a fund of free non-housing capital of just over &#163;500,000 to provide for her future for the rest of her life. That would provide a net Duxbury income of a little under &#163;25,000 annually, which is barely sufficient to meet her needs. Thus she will definitely need to earn additional sums.  </p>

There is no doubt the husband's misconduct has been at the extreme end of the spectrum. It is in the public interest for his conduct to be exposed. The public should be aware of the scale of problems that courts administering justice and implementing the rule of law have to face at the hands of unrepresented and malevolent litigants determined to do everything they can to destroy the process. I appreciate that the wife, who is wholly innocent, will lose her rights to privacy by virtue of this judgment being published without anonymisation but in my opinion the public interest in the whole truth being known outweighs her privacy rights. </p>
