Those issues were the same as those raised within the Family Law Act application.  They made an order consolidating the two sets of proceedings, with a request to the Family Court at Bournemouth to transfer its file to Oxford.  An order was made prohibiting the father from removing the children from their mother&#8217;s care.  The order provided for video contact between him and the girls to start.  The parties were directed to file statements and to return to Court on 28 April 2023, by when it was anticipated that the application for a non-molestation order would have been resolved in Bournemouth.</p>

They have not been tested in evidence by a Court.  They remain allegations, unproven in a Court of law.  They cannot be disregarded as they would be if they had been made and found not to be proved by a judge.  There has been no finding that the mother has put forward a &#8216;false narrative&#8217;, as asserted by the father.  </p>

It is arguable that as a result the mother felt unable to rely upon the Court for protection, and chose instead to negotiate a safer position for herself with the father directly, at a cost of not formally pursuing the allegations of domestic abuse within these proceedings, and re-establishing direct contact with him, which she had initially sought to avoid.</p>

One, called &#8216;pick up by daddy&#8217; shows the children rushing to the arms of their father, smiling and laughing.  It is not clear who took the video, they are at some distance, the father looks up to the camera after kissing the girls on the head.  The impression is that the video is being taken as an evidence-gathering exercise, to show the children&#8217;s love for their father, which of course is not challenged in these proceedings.  In comparison in the video showing a handover to the mother the children could perhaps be said to be dragging their feet a bit, Emma is tearful and her dad calls to her to go and say hello to her mum, although she is already heading towards her, and is lifted into her mum&#8217;s arms for a big hug.  The inference I am asked to draw from this is the children are less happy to go to their mother because she is less well-equipped as a parent than their father.  I am concerned at why the father is standing filming the girls in this way, rather than focusing on supporting them emotionally.  If indeed there was an issue with handovers, I question why the father was not supporting the children, encouraging them, working with the mother to find a way to make things go better.  </p>

Each case is explored on its own particular facts.  In this case the father is very much &#8216;hands-on&#8217;, capable of taking care of the girls on his own, and historically he has always played a full role in their lives.  But the mother has not worked since she has had the children, while the father has.  Her primary responsibility for the children has been their day-to-day care and taking care of the household.  For the last year she has been their sole parent.  It would represent a significant change, and a significant loss for the girls to move to live with their father and to leave her behind.  At the same time, before they left in November 2022, they were used to seeing their father every day and not living with him has been a significant loss for them as well.  If they continue to live with their mother and see their father on alternate weekends and for half the holidays this will continue to affect them.  It is very positive to know that despite the long break from not seeing him, when they were reunited, they were able nonetheless to step back into a positive and happy relationship and to spend quality time together over the summer holidays.</span></p>

In [City A] they live in a large house, and are six to twelve months away from being allocated permanent housing.  It is arguable that they may find better accommodation there than in [Oxfordshire] which is one of the most expensive areas in the country. </span></p>

Such arrangements can work extremely well for children whose parents are separated, particularly where there is a good relationship between the parents, good communication, and the children are able to move seamlessly between the two homes with ease.   Such an arrangement may well come to pass in this case.  I would not endorse making a stepped order towards that, or an order conditional on the father moving to the area, when I do not know when the move is going to happen.  Before making such an order, I would want to know of all the circumstances that existed at the time, carry out a welfare checklist analysis and then consider what would meet the girls&#8217; welfare needs. </span></p>
