      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic">This judgment was given in private. The judge gives permission for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of this judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. If the judgment is to be reported or published, there is a requirement to ensure that no reporting restriction will be breached. This is particularly important in relation to any case involving a sexual offence, where the victim is guaranteed lifetime anonymity (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992), or where an order has been made in relation to a young person. All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.</span></p>

As is clear from that judgment, publication was opposed by the local authority, police and Guardian.  Having balanced the relevant rights and risks I was satisfied that the balance fell in favour of the judgment being published subject to significant redactions and anonymisations.  These anonymisations included the relevant local authority only being referred to as A Local Authority in Wales and the police as A Welsh Police Force.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This judgment arises from an application by Tortoise Media for me to revisit the issue of naming the actual local authority and police force involved.  Ms Tickle advances the argument on behalf of Tortoise Media.  The media were not alerted to the original publication hearing.  Upon learning of the judgments, contact was made with the court and arrangements were made for Tortoise Media to file submissions in support of their application together with written responses from all parties.  The application was considered at a hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2024.  The overarching submission by Tortoise Media is that the public interest in naming the local authority and police outweighs the competing rights and interests of the child who may be identified as result of naming the local authority and police.</p>

For many the importance of scrutinising such failings in a fully transparent way transcends the need to protect the privacy of vulnerable children.  There are two fundamental rights engaged here, freedom of speech and children's privacy as a facet of their family life.  When evaluating where the balance lies between these two competing rights and interests it is important, to my mind, that judges of the Family Court do not allow ourselves to remain magnetically attracted to the welfare principle (i.e. that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration). To do so distorts the relevant balancing exercise.</span>&#8221;</p>

She added that it was one of the saddest given the emotional harm inflicted on a desperately ill child over a very significant proportion of the remainder of the life they are likely to have.  She said that judgments like that are scarce to journalists, Councillors, MPs and campaigners.  She said that the use of the judgment is limited if the exact local authority and police are not named and that there are a huge number of important functions that cannot be met if the state actors are not named.  She said that in my judgment I expressed some scepticism in terms of the operational impact on the local authority and police.  She developed this further saying that without naming them there is no way to hold the local authority or  police to account &#8211; no way to check that they have instigated the changes as they said they would.  She said that the failings of the local authority should be known to the Care Inspectorate Wales  and to the Senedd and Councillors so that attention is drawn to it.  She said the failings of the police should be known to the Police inspectorate and the Government.  That the public need to know.

She urged the court to be wary of jigsaw identification saying it was a convenient argument for the local authority and police who have a vested interest in not being named.  She did not accept that it was inevitable that the child would be identified if the local authority and police were named.  She submitted that, even if the child was identified as a result of naming the local authority and police, it does not automatically follow that the child will suffer harm.  She questioned what evidence there was in support of harm as opposed to mere speculation.  She said that she had been told by the Grandparents that some people in the community already know about matters and there have been no issues.  That the child at his age is not likely to come across the judgment himself.  That the Grandparents have his interests at the forefront of their mind and that public opinion is likely to be one of sympathy rather than anything else.  She said that the Grandparents who have cared for the child with love and dedication support the applications.  The local authority and police do not but she submitted that 17 months of poor judgment and poor practice should mean that their judgment is of limited value when set against that of the Grandparents.</p>

If the child is identified it brings focus back on to the situation at a time when speculation, debate and gossip should be dying away.

In this case, by reference to Hayden J&#8217;s judgment in [2020] EWHC 1162 (see paragraph 17 above), Miss Jones described the jigsaw as being analogous to a Peppa Pig jigsaw rather than a puzzle of Schloss Neuschwanstain.</p>

She accepts that the local authority and police may have self-serving arguments in opposing this application but stresses that the Guardian most certainly does not.   She said that the features of this case are too unique to tip the balance in favour of naming the local authority and police.</p>

If the lack of invitation to the press did amount to a defect in procedure, I am satisfied that it has been remedied by the manner in which matters have progressed since and the manner in which Ms Tickle has advanced her application.</p>

In considering such a balancing exercise I remind myself that at paragraph 4 of my original judgment I set out the purpose of the judgment as being:</p>

It is so there is a proper objective record of what has happened.  This judgment should be placed on the child&#8217;s file and anyone dealing with this matter in the future should carefully consider this judgment to have a clear understanding of what has happened.  This judgment is also for the Local Authority and the Welsh police force to have a clear and complete picture of matters so that lessons can be learned, and mistakes of this nature can be avoided in the future.&#8221;</span></p>

My use of that phrase was not a reference to any potential press coverage, media attention or editorial line that may have been taken by the press.  The context of that phrase was Grandfather initially wanted a large number of people named in the original judgment.  He wanted frontline social workers, police officers, local authority solicitors and previous local authority counsel named.  He wanted the judgment to potentially deal with their individual actions and failings.  It was in that context that I referred to a public flogging and not in the context Ms Tickle has taken it as a slur on the press or media or the court starting from the wrong position.  I have no doubt or reservations about the important work the press undertake in the sphere of the family court.  The media has an important role to play in these proceedings, as their reporting can, amongst other things, help the public understand how the family court system works and how family cases are decided</p>

To provide a narrative for the child for his life and to sit on his file for all professionals who may come to this case in the future.  The other stated purpose was learning, prevention and emphasis of what had gone wrong.  Ms Jones made it clear in her submissions that one further purpose was the intention of the Guardian to use the judgment as the bedrock of a claim on the child&#8217;s behalf for the harm he has suffered.</p>

I agreed fully with Ms Jones that the local authority&#8217;s management of the child&#8217;s care since August 2022 had been &#8216;negligent, unlawful at points and a harmful interference with his right to family life&#8217;.  There were many failings identified in the judgment on the part of both the local authority and the police.  </p>

I was provided no detail as to ongoing lines of enquiry that would be jeopardised by publication of the judgment.&#160;&#160;Any such argument would, in any event, only be applicable to deferment of publication rather than publication itself.  I have considered whether publication should be deferred until such time as the investigation has concluded and have decided it should not be.  The investigation is not far off 2 years old.  There is no indication a file will be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service any time soon.  When this matter started in 2022 mention was made of the investigation taking years and, sadly, that has proved to be the case.  I do not consider it appropriate to defer publication to an uncertain unspecified date in the future.</span>&#8221;</p>

The powers exercised by the local authority and the police in such matters are potentially so drastic in their possible consequences that there is a powerful public interest in those who exercise such powers being publicly identified so that they can be held publicly accountable. This is the main thrust of Ms Tickle&#8217;s application.  She argues that it is only by the local authority and police being named that such accountability can be ensured.  </p>

It is whether that should outweigh the competing interests of the child.  My concern throughout has been the impact publication and possible identification would have on this child.  Whilst not agreeing with the Guardian in terms of the judgment itself being published I attached considerable weight to the view of the Guardian in terms of the level of redaction and anonymisation that was required to avoid jigsaw identification and to avoid the harm that she feared would follow.   This is harm and the likelihood of that harm arising from the child being identified.  Ms Tickle says that the local authority and police have a vested interest in not being named.  Whilst I accept that may be true the same cannot be said for the Guardian.  She strongly advocated during the proceedings for the local authority to review its position.  She was harshly critical of the local authority when it came to the way they had approached the matter throughout.  She supported fully the application to withdraw.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I noted in my judgment the disruption which the child has experienced in his short life.  This is the third set of public law proceedings which he has been involved in since his birth.  The proceedings have laid bare intergenerational family dysfunction.  The facts at the core of this case have torn this family apart.  There are members of the family who support Grandparents and there are members of the family who support the complainant.  I agree with the submissions of the Guardian that the child lives in a relatively small community where he attends school and activities.  He will likely be one of very few children in his local area with a life limiting condition.  He may be the only child in his local area with a life limiting condition, who was placed with his grandparents with allegations of sexual abuse surrounding the family.  A community where some people inevitably know some of the detail.  But there is a significant difference between that and knowing the full history as extensively set out in the judgment.  This child suffered as a result of the actions of the local authority.  The period of time not in his Grandparents care resulted in harm.  That harm continues to impact upon him since being  returned to his Grandparents.  I was told by Grandparents at the time of my original decision that he continues to be upset when leaving home.  He is presenting as more frustrated and angrier than before.  He presents with worry when he sees a police car in the street.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Being out of his Grandparents care for 17 months must have been a distressing and confusing time for the child.  He was well cared for and content with his Grandparents until August 2022.  He was then removed from their care in distressing circumstances and remained out of their care for over 17 months.  The risk of jigsaw identification remains a significant one.  A risk that is heightened further if the local authority and police are named.  The Guardian&#8217;s view is that the child has been through enough.  The risk of identification from the judgment is just not one which is outweighed by the public interest in her view.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is right that the child is not capable of searching the internet at his age.  It may be that, due to his condition, he is never capable of this and therefore the likelihood of him finding the judgment is reduced.  However, I agree with the submission that an individual&#8217;s entitlement to private family life is not determined by the extent to which they are able to exercise that right, nor is it determined by whether or not they are aware it is being breached.   Whether the child has the cognitive or physical capabilities to access and understand the judgment does not invalidate his basic right.  His ability to view and access the judgment also does not prevent others from accessing it and gaining knowledge about his life that even he may not have.  </p>

I am all too alive to the great public interest that there may be in the content of my substantive judgment.  The consternation that inevitably follows from the significant criticisms I made of two public bodies.  The desire to expose the local authority and police so that she and other members of the press may hold them to account and to seek to assure that such failings do not occur again.  I must balance that against the risks that arise to the child at the centre of this case.  A child who has already suffered harm.  A child who continues to experience the effects of his removal.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I was referred to the Haringey judgments of Hayden J by both Ms Fottrell KC and Ms Tickle.  Hayden J despite detailing significant failings by the local authority he initially refused to name the local authority largely because of the risk of jigsaw identification.  He revisited that decision following an application by the press.  During submissions Hayden J was referred to an Ofsted report from 2018 which revealed failings that he said could be &#8216;folded, entirely seamlessly into&#8217; his judgment.  He had initially been assured that failings were isolated examples of bad practice but concluded that those assertions were not supported by the Ofsted reports which he said were reflective of a much broader and deeper malaise within the local authority.  The lamentable history of Haringey was a major factor in the decision of Hayden J to name the local authority as he felt the public interest argument prevailed.  Ms Tickle sought to make similar submissions in this case.  She spoke of a Care Inspectorate Wales report that whilst largely positive did express one concern.  She spoke of some complaints that had been upheld.  I acknowledge those matters but am not persuaded that they there are of a nature comparable to the &#8216;deeper malaise&#8217; of Haringey.  They are matters that I have regard to but they are not of such significance or relevance to the failings I identified in my judgment that they elevate the call for accountability or public interest beyond that which I previously considered.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I said in my publication judgment that the decision to publish at all was a finely balanced decision largely due to the risks of jigsaw identification.  I was satisfied that the public intertest did require publication but that was caveated on the basis of all measures being taken to protect the anonymity of this child and avoid jigsaw identification.  Anonymisation of the local authority and the police was one the measures I felt necessary to meet this objective.  As meritorious and seemingly compelling the arguments of Ms Tickle may appear they were to a very large extent matters that I had in mind when originally balancing the respective Article 8 and Article 10 rights.  Ms Tickle has undoubtedly elucidated the matters in much greater detail and with the benefit of the unique perspective of the independent press but I am not satisfied that balance is such that it tips in favour of naming the local authority or the police.  The almost inevitable local and perhaps national press interest that could potentially follow focused on the relevant local authority and police would significantly increase the prospect of jigsaw identification and lead to the harm that is feared of by the Guardian.  Fears that I share.  </p>

Having completed the judgment I was aware that there would be public interest in a matter of this nature.  For that reason I allowed publication against the opposition of the local authority, police and Guardian.  I weighed the respective rights and found that the balance lay in redaction/anonymisations including that of local authority and police.  I remain of that view today.  In my judgment the child&#8217;s welfare positively requires that he be protected from identification.</p>
