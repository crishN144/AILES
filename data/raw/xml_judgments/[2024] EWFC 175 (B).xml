	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is the final financial remedies hearing in what has been protracted, costly and destructive litigation. The litigation has not been confined to the financial remedies court. In 2022 the wife was granted a non-molestation order on a without notice basis. This was compromised on mutual undertakings and no adverse findings were made against the husband. There has been protracted child arrangement proceedings in the Family Court. Broadly speaking, the wife is the main carer of the two twin boys and the husband has contact midweek, every other weekend and half the holidays.</p>

The rest of his income is drawn by way of dividends from the company. The wife complains that she has received no dividends since separation notwithstanding her 30% shareholding.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The two primary assets are the former matrimonial home and X Ltd. The former matrimonial home has net equity of &#163;1,174,947. The assets of X Ltd largely consist of a flat in London and Bath. X Ltd also has a goodwill element because of the husband&#8217;s work as a stunt coordinator. The company owns various stunt equipment. Somewhat unusually the company also owns a self-propelled gun which I erroneously referred to as a tank. The wife produces evidence of an offer for the tank of &#163;45,000 but the bona fides of the proposed buyer are questioned by the husband. In any event the issue of the value of the tank has already been dealt with when a previous judge directed a single joint valuation which came to &#163;22,000. The husband wishes to retain this and gave evidence that he uses it to raise money for children&#8217;s charities and help for heroes. The single joint expert values the company at &#163;336,380 to which must be added cash reserves of &#163;23,500.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It seems that unfortunately the husband only declared his net salary to the CMS and omitted to mention dividend income for some time. This resulted in several reassessments and there exists about one year&#8217;s worth of arrears amounting to &#163;11,500. These reassessments are ongoing and depend on dividend payments received at the end of X Ltd&#8217;s financial year which does not equate to the tax year. The wife has consistently questioned the CMS payments received which have been erratic and played havoc with her finances. This in turn has impacted on her ability to provide care for the twins. It is for this reason that I favour global maintenance. More on this later.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The husband criticises the wife for not increasing her earning capacity. I do not share the husband&#8217;s criticisms. The wife clearly has unique skills as an illustrator and is now beginning to capitalise on those skills. She is the main carer for two young twins and her current work enables her to meet the children&#8217;s needs for example by collecting them from primary school at 2:30 PM during the week and providing their day-to-day care. She can work from home which saves on travel costs. She will need an office to enable her to continue to do this. She was taken to her CV which illustrates a number of skills, but this is now 19 years old. The arrangement between the parties was always more traditional with the husband as the breadwinner leaving the wife to raise two young twins. I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that she will continue to build a reputation as a competent and gifted illustrator and that she should not be expected to find relatively menial work as a teaching assistant, receptionist or clerk. This would make it difficult to meet her care commitments and would be unlikely to generate any further income in the future when one factors in travel, childcare and other costs.</p>

The wife&#8217;s housing need is somewhat greater than the husband&#8217;s because she will need to be within the catchment area of the twins&#8217; school. At the moment, they are at a primary school, but they will move to secondary school in September 2026. The husband says this will need to be the local Comprehensive School and that the twins are unlikely to get into the local Grammar School. The wife refutes this. I sincerely hope that any disagreement does not result in further litigation in the family court.</p>
