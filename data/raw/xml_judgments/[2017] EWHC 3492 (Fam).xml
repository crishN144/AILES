He says that as M bears his last name and has attended a political meeting with him she would be identified as being connected with him and consequently at risk.</p>

The FCO advises against all but essential travel to Iraq and Kurdistan, including Sulaymaniyah.  The maps which are included with that Guidance show that Sulaymaniyah is in relatively close proximity to other areas in Iraq in relation to which the FCO advises against all travel.  It is also reasonably close to the Iranian border.  The Guidance includes this information:</p>

The mother was also unsure how far her mother would have to travel from her home in Iran to Sulaymaniyah or the distances involved.  She agreed in cross examination that they would have to travel across a border which had been graded as dangerous and along roads that were classified as highly risky and dangerous in Kurdistan.  </p>

The question I have to determine is whether or not it is in M&#8217;s best interest to travel to Kurdistan for this holiday.  The question for the court in <span style="font-style:italic">AA</span> was whether or not Article 15 prevented the removal of Iraqi nationals.
