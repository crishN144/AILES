Without ever losing sight of that human reality, however, and acutely conscious, as I am, of the stress, worry and anxiety burdening parents in such cases, and of the powerful human emotions that are inevitably engaged &#8211; a matter to which I must return below &#8211; this case is, from a legal perspective, straight-forward and simple. It raises no new point of principle, and I can therefore be brief.</p>

X was represented by Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC. It was clear that Y was wholly supportive of X&#8217;s application. Both were present at the hearing.

No Form WP can be found in the clinic&#8217;s files nor is there any clear evidence that a Form WP was ever completed. Ms Fottrell is content to proceed on the basis that there never was a completed Form WP. The Form PP was completed by X. There are certain irregularities in the Form PP, though of a kind which previous judgments indicate would probably not be fatal. There is, however, no need to explore this aspect of the matter any further for, absent a Form WP, the existence of a Form PP is not sufficient.</p>

It is, like others, in &#8216;composite&#8217; form, covering a number of different topics. Importantly it includes, under the heading &#8220;Partner&#8217;s consent&#8221;, the following text:</p>

In previous judgments, I have recorded the, often harrowing, words of other parents similarly and suddenly confronted with such news. No parent should ever be put in such a situation because of this kind of bureaucratic incompetence.  </p>
