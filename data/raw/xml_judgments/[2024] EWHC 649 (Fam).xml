V was conceived by Y and Z at a licensed fertility clinic with donor sperm. Following V&#8217;s birth an issue has been raised by the clinic, Complete Fertility (&#8216;the Clinic&#8217;) regarding the paperwork that was completed that enables M to be V&#8217;s second legal parent.</p>

None of those persons sought to apply to be joined as a party. Y and Z filed a joint statement in support of the application and Ms Saran, has filed a statement on behalf of the Clinic clearly setting out the relevant records and evidence from the Clinic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is another case where an audit of an HFEA licensed clinic has discovered that the relevant forms have not been completed, resulting in uncertainty about the parental legal status of a child born to individuals undergoing fertility treatment.  Ms Saran, Consultant in Reproductive Medicine and the statutory Person Responsible for the purposes of the Clinic&#8217;s HFEA licence, expresses the Clinic&#8217;s sincere apologies for the Clinic&#8217;s oversight in relation to completion of the WP and PP forms when the change was made for the embryo transfer to Z rather than Y. Ms Saran sets out that measures have been taken by the Clinic to ensure this situation does not occur again. She states a full incident investigation was conducted and the Clinic has revised their &#8216;Legal Parenthood Pathway&#8217; document. These steps are to be welcomed, as the ramifications of non-compliance, on even a limited number of individuals, is far reaching. Y and Z powerfully describe in their joint statement their shock and distress on being informed by the Clinic of the difficulties regarding the forms, the implications for Y&#8217;s legal status in relation to V and how they have found the whole process traumatic, including the need to make this application. This illustrates the need for clinics who undertake this type of treatment to ensure they have reliable systems in place to avoid what happened in this case occurring again.</p>

The Clinic file did have completed WP and PP forms from May 2021 through which the applicants nominated Z as the second legal parent of any child carried by Y, as had been originally planned.

The applicants' expectation was that the signing of these forms, and for the present I am assuming the alternative case that the WP and PP forms were not signed, had the desired effect; the effect they had been counselled about and given information about and which they plainly wished to bring about of making them both legal parents. It is fair to note that the documentation does not spell out consent to legal parenthood explicitly, but I am satisfied that, taken together, that is the effect of the seven documents. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that I can and should make the declaration sought on both the primary case and the alternative case.&#8221;</span></p>

At  [69]-[70] I stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The critical question is whether a consent signed prior to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>, at a time when the law did not permit a second female partner to become a parent following the use of donor sperm, is valid for the purpose of s 44.

There is no reference to timing, other than requiring them to be in writing and signed before the treatment took place. The legislation puts the emphasis on the written consent, which is ultimately determinative.
