She has been in this country for six years and is  settled here.  The father of the baby is not involved and may not have been identified.  The mother, sadly, has problems of drug addiction.  Mr.&#160;Wilson, who represents her, tells me that she is an intelligent lady who understands that she is unlikely to be able to care for her child.  Social Services have found her co-operative and also intelligent.  K is represented by a&#160;guardian.  The mother&#8217;s parents are in Lithuania and are looking after at least one or perhaps three of their granddaughters by the mother&#8217;s sister.  The mother&#8217;s sister also has some problems.  </span></p>

There are some questions which require to be answered still.  This local authority is looking extremely actively at the possibility of placing this child with her grandparents. If this case were to conclude entirely within these English care proceedings which commenced after K&#8217;s birth, this would require a placement outside the jurisdiction to be approved by the court pursuant to Schedule 2, Rule 19 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

She also has Lithuanian grandparents who the mother proposes as carers for this child.  The mother is presently in prison having been convicted of drug-related offences.  She may be just about to be released on a &#8216;tag&#8217;.  She has not, at least until now, put herself forward as a carer for this child and strongly supports a Lithuanian option with her parents.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It seems to me, notwithstanding that the local authority is very actively assessing the grandparents, that this is an appropriate time for the Court to consider whether it should exercise its powers to request Lithuania to assume jurisdiction pursuant to Article 15(1)(b).  As Baker J in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Bristol</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case and Moylan J in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Leicester</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case ruled (and I take the same view) there is no drawback and every advantage in making a request to another member state alongside further assessment of a&#160;parent.  It seems to me that an assessment or further inquiries of relatives abroad demands the same approach.  The aim is to progress the case and to avoid delay.  If Lithuania does not wish to assume jurisdiction, which it may not if it takes the view that these proceedings are well advanced and that this local authority is adopting the right approach, then this case, which I shall timetable through to a&#160;final hearing, will proceed in this jurisdiction.  The options for this baby within our understanding of child welfare, which may not be the same as Lithuania&#8217;s, would be either family placement if mother cannot care for her own child, or adoption.  Lithuania may regard other options as being appropriate for one of its citizens.</span></p>

However potential delay is in built into any of the options, and what I&#160;must strive to do is to adopt the course which is likely to serve the child&#8217;s best interests.  Also this Lithuanian child ought in principle to have her future decided by the Lithuanian authorities.  However it may be that the answers to the questions which I have approved, which will go by way of addendum to the grandparents through CFAB, may satisfy the local authority, which will set in place an agency decision on the 26th August. This may bring this case to an agreed resolution without the involvement of the Lithuanian authorities.</span></p>

All parties now, having considered the various options, are agreed that I should make  a request pursuant to Article 15 (3), list this case before a s.9 judge locally for the first week of September to monitor progress, but set up a contingency plan which timetables this case through to a final hearing if the Lithuanian authorities do not wish to become involved.  It cannot be ignored, as I have already said, that they may choose to intervene at a late stage even if they have not chosen to intervene before.  I have to adopt a course which is not necessarily a failsafe but which gives the best options available for this little girl.</span></p>
