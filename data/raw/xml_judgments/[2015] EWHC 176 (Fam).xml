I dealt with another listed case at 14.00, then heard full submissions in these proceedings and had the opportunity to consider the exhibits as well as other material throughout the course of the afternoon. It was simply impossible &#8211; because of my commitments elsewhere &#8211; to deliver judgment on the day of the hearing. Accordingly, the matter was listed for judgment today, 29 January, at a time convenient to Counsel on both sides. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties invited diametrically different approaches. On behalf of the mother, Mr Khan suggests there should be a summary return order and that the evidence filed would support such an outcome. He contends this is a serious and troubling case and that what the father did in removing the child from Abu Dhabi in late November last year was audacious, deliberate and cruel.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Hartley, on behalf of the father, submitted there should be further evidence before any consideration is given to summary return which is, in any event, strongly resisted. Miss Hartley suggested there are uncertainties about the parents&#8217; and child&#8217;s ability to live lawfully in the UAE which should be the subject of expert opinion; and that advice is also needed upon the procedure and substantive law in the UAE as it relates to disputed arrangements for children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I gave anxious consideration to Miss Hartley&#8217;s adjournment application during the hearing itself and I have reconsidered it since. Ultimately, I have decided that it is unnecessary to secure expert advice as suggested and for these reasons. Firstly, that as the result of the mother&#8217;s swift action in applying for a visa to reside in the UAE, sponsored by her father, the vacuum of information about what would be permissible so far as she is concerned has been removed. She has produced authentic documentary proof that her visa exists and contends that the Ministry of Exterior has informed her she can sponsor S on the basis that he is in her custody. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second piece of readily available information relating to immigration issues arises from foreign travel advice on the gov.uk website. The father as a British citizen is entitled to a 30 day visitor visa on arrival in the UAE which may be extended for a further 30 days by visiting an immigration office and paying a fee. A &#8216;long visit visa&#8217; has the same requirements as a short visit visa but costs &#163;200 and entitles the holder to a 90 day stay in the country. It would also have to be said, that if the father secured employment in the UAE then, as before, he would be entitled to residency. In all the circumstances, it is my view that an expert on the subject of immigration is not necessary.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for advice in relation to the way in which disputed arrangements for children would be resolved in the UAE, I need go no further than the guidelines provided by the House of Lords in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re J (A Child) (Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] AC 80</ref>. At paragraph 39, Lady Hale discussed the differences between legal systems, said they could not be irrelevant but added that their relevance will depend on the facts of the individual case. She continued, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more that give the judge pause; it may be a decisive factor. On the other hand, if it appears that the mother would not be able to make a good case for relocation, that factor may (not </span>sic<span style="font-style:italic">) be decisive. There are also bound to be many cases where the connection of the child and all the family with the other country is so strong that any difference between the legal systems here and there should carry little weight.</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind, this is indeed one of those cases where the connection with the UAE of the child, his parents and his paternal as well as maternal grandparents is so strong and so long established that any differences between our own and the legal system there should carry little weight. It is also relevant to consider that the parents have already had involvement with the courts there. The father relates that during a period of parental separation last year, he applied for visitation rights to S and agreed to take part in mediation organised by the Family Network Centre.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background for the purposes of this hearing may be shortly summarised. The mother is 25 years old; she is a Jordanian national who is living in the UAE where her parents also live. The father, aged 28, is a British national and was born in England. His parents, the paternal grandparents, as well as his sister have lived in the UAE for over twenty years. If he was looked after by his own parents when he was a child as seems likely, then for the majority of his childhood the father also lived in the UAE. In 2009, after he&#8217;d completed a university education in the UK, the father moved to the UAE and secured employment there.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother asserts, though the father denies, that she suffered domestic violence and that there was physical violence involving a referral to the police in February 2014. There was a separation between the parents in April 2014 after, as the mother claims, a further episode of violence. The parties reconciled in mid June 2014. They and S were on holiday in Scotland for a three week period in October 2014.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to the mother, the father wrongfully removed S from her and from the UAE on 24 November 2014. At her instigation, wardship proceedings were issued on 5 December. Notwithstanding a series of disclosure orders it was not possible to locate the father and S until 15 January at an address in Manchester which belongs to the paternal grandparents.</p>

An order was made providing for statements, the matter was listed for two hours for summary disposal or directions and the father was directed to bring S with him to court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It had not been anticipated that the mother would have been able to attend the hearing. It had been thought that she did not have a visa which would enable her to travel here and would only be able to secure such a visa if the father were to sponsor her. The mother&#8217;s passport had been in the possession of the paternal family. When on 14 January it was restored to her in the UAE, it became apparent that in fact the mother holds a visa, additional to the first, which does not expire until March this year. The mother travelled to London and was present throughout the hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is necessary to consider in a little detail what is said by the parents about S&#8217;s departure from the UAE so as to illuminate the question as to how he came to be in this country. As I perform that task, I&#8217;m keenly aware that because perforce this is a summary process, I&#8217;ve not heard oral evidence. It may be useful though when comparing the two versions of events to scrutinise any relevant documentary material as it may tend to support the claims of one or other parent. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s account of what happened between 23 and 24 November is as follows.  On 23 November the father had entered the bedroom at 06.00, shouted at and slapped her. The father told the mother their marriage was over, that he would take her back to her parents and would collect S for contact on 27 November. S who was awoken by the shouting was breastfed so as to settle him back to sleep.</p>

The father, she says, deliberately broke her mobile phone and she was pushed out of the door. The mother went to the police from where she was collected by her parents and they went to court. She produces a copy of the order made by the Abu Dhabi Court of First Instance on 23 November 2014 &#8220;to the effect that that the (father) is obligated to hand over to the (mother) her son S and to inform the court within 3 days.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition the mother secured a further court order permitting her to go to the matrimonial home so as to retrieve her own and S&#8217;s possessions. The mother&#8217;s case is that she told the police about the orders made by the court and was asking for confirmation that the father had received them. According to her, the police response was that they had tried without success to contact the father. His phone appeared to be switched off. The mother asked for a check as to whether he and S were still in the country and supplied their passport numbers. A police officer called the mother to say the father and S had left for the UK at 01.00 on 24 November.</p>

He maintains that on 20 October he was told by his employer that his contract of employment would not be renewed. Under UAE law, without a job he would not be able to renew his residence permit which was due to expire on 26 November. The father says he told the mother that unless he was able to find a job in time they would all have to leave the UAE or they would be treated as overstayers and fined AED 100 per day for each family member.</p>

The father maintains that &#8220;as time was running out&#8221; he purchased tickets for S and himself &#8220;in the hope that the mother would get in touch. She never did.&#8221;</p>

There can be no doubt but that on 23 November the mother approached the Court in Abu Dhabi for an order requiring the father to return S to her &#8211; documentary proof is available. Also on 23 November, the mother was examined by a physician, at the instigation of the police and found to have bruises and redness of the left side of the face. Again there is documentary support from an identified physician.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of my assessment of the written evidence it was straightforward to determine that S left the UAE as the result not of a consensual relocation plan but because the father had decided to take his son away from the mother and also from the country of his habitual residence. Moreover all the signs are that very considerable steps were taken by the paternal family in the aftermath of the abduction so as to make it impossible for both parents and S to reside in the UAE. Indeed, it had been a central plank of Miss Hartley&#8217;s argument on behalf of the father that the parents and S are not entitled to reside lawfully in the UAE and, therefore, a summary return order could not be made. In her Position Statement Miss Hartley said this &#8211; &#8220;Clearly if the parties and / or the child cannot return to the UAE, they cannot embark upon substantive litigation there in relation to S&#8217;s arrangements. Potentially the courts may not even have jurisdiction to try any such application if S does not have a right to reside in the UAE.&#8221;</p>

A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what may be best for him in the short run. It should not be assumed that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means he will stay here for ever.</p>

If those courts have no choice but to do as the father wishes&#8230; then our courts must ask themselves whether it will be in the interests of the child to enable that dispute to be heard. The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more than give a judge pause for thought&#8230; it may be a decisive factor&#8230; There are also bound to be many cases where the connection of the child and all the family with the other country is so strong that any difference between the legal systems here and there should carry little weight.</p>

Firstly, that the father doubts, notwithstanding the visa recently obtained by the mother as the result of sponsorship by the maternal grandfather, that in fact she has the right to reside in the UAE. Though Mr Anderson had to concede that the visa as it appears within the mother&#8217;s passport seems valid. The father&#8217;s second anxiety is as to the mother&#8217;s financial status in the UAE &#8211; a matter which, in fact, had not featured during the hearing. This morning Mr Khan was able to indicate, as I had assumed, that the maternal grandfather has been and will continue to provide financially for his daughter. The father&#8217;s third concern was as to broader welfare issues &#8211; that S would be better in his own than the mother&#8217;s care. The father emphasised that he only wants the best outcome for his son, that he and the mother should seek to resolve issues for themselves and that exercise would be best achieved here in the UK rather than the UAE.</p>

To allow him to remain here where his mother cannot stay for long and far away from his maternal grandparents with whom he has a close relationship would be against his welfare interests. Similarly, so soon as the dust has settled and some rapprochement between the two sides of the family is achieved I can see no reason why S should not continue his relationships with all of those paternal family members who live in the UAE. There is nothing to stop the father travelling and finding work there if he chooses so to do.</p>

She, after all, has been his primary carer. After S was born, the mother did not work outside the home whilst the father was in full time employment. The father also went, so he says, to the gym three times a week and played football. He may have been, as he suggests, deeply involved with S from the time of his birth but that does not detract from the fact that the mother was with him almost all the time, attending to his every need.</p>

The father cites an occasion in July 2013 when S was discovered to have a fracture of his right leg. There is no suggestion that it was an inflicted injury. The father&#8217;s complaint is that nothing was done about it until he returned home which the mother disputes. She maintains it was a hairline fracture that the doctor was not intending to apply a cast but she insisted so as to ensure she did not move S&#8217;s leg whilst changing him.</p>

All of those claims are denied by the mother. She says she would take S into the kitchen if he was crying at night so as to allow the father to sleep. Photographing a child&#8217;s infant penis was something a fellow student had mentioned to her which the mother had described to the father, she says, as &#8220;the weirdest thing.&#8221; </p>

More importantly, my view is that it should be for the Courts in Abu Dhabi, already seised, to resolve any factual disputes between the parents so as to make appropriate welfare arrangements.  The Courts there would be better placed to determine the welfare issues for S. </p>

The parents, in all probability, know of the essential differences. It seems likely that the father believed he would fare better in an English court which may account for the steps he took to cancel his own, the mother&#8217;s and S&#8217;s rights to reside in the UAE. But I am in no position to say that our ways of resolving parental disputes are better or to be preferred over those of the courts in the UAE. There are, as Lady Hale said in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re J</span> many routes to a healthy and well adjusted adulthood.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Insofar as I have not already touched upon welfare checklist factors, I should make clear that in my assessment S will have been emotionally harmed as the result of his enforced separation from his mother. It was precisely because of the almost inevitable impact upon him of two months continuous interruption in his relationship with his mother that I ordered he should stay with her between the hearing on Tuesday and judgment this morning.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lastly, I should indicate what may be drawn from the parties&#8217; respective recent behaviour about their capacity as parents. The mother describes her sense of devastation when she discovered that the father had taken S to England, an indication of her attachment and devotion to her son. When the hearing began she was extremely distressed, crying piteously, as the result I was told of some incident in the corridor at which S had been present. It is inevitable that the events of the last two months will have had a profound impact upon the mother. She has yearned to be reunited with S.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s actions in bringing S away from his mother, his country and all that was familiar to him seemingly paid scant or no regard to S&#8217;s well being. The father&#8217;s instructions to the paternal grandfather to take the passports to the authorities in the UAE so as to cancel the parents&#8217; and S&#8217;s residence permits indicate a cynical and single minded determination to thwart the mother in any attempt to secure S&#8217;s return.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of this assessment process in all its various facets, I am in no doubt. It is overwhelmingly in S&#8217;s welfare interests to return with his mother to the UAE as swiftly as can be arranged.  </p>
