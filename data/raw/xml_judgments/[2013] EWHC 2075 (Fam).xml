	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with one child, D.  D was born on [a date in] 2007 and is therefore five years of age.   His father, the applicant in this matter, is TB who is 52 years of age.  His mother, the respondent, is DB who is 57 years of age.  The parents were married on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2005.  Two years later D was born.  Sadly, the parties separated on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2009 when the mother left the former matrimonial home with D.  She stayed, as I understand it, for a short period of time with relatives and then in four successive refuges before settling where she now lives in Cambridgeshire.  </p>

Consequent upon the mother&#8217;s departure from the former matrimonial home, the father made an application to discover there whereabouts and to achieve contact with his son, which was issued on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2009.  Sadly, it was not until the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2010 that an order was made for the father to have direct contact and the first visit between father and son took place on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2010.</p>

Significantly, such a finding would [show that] TB failed to protect D, deceived the courts and CAFCASS and paid no heed to court orders.   TB&#8217;s allegation that DB has made and repeated untrue allegations of serious domestic violence not being found, would raise concerns as to the impact of these long-standing issues on mother and D.   </p>

The father had his first direct contact, as I have mentioned, on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2010.  There were throughout the latter part of 2010 further hearings relating to the father&#8217;s contact where undertakings were given by the father either that he would not consume alcohol preceding contact or an undertaking that his brother would not attend any contact.   </p>

However, just a month prior to the first unsupervised contact taking place, on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2010 the mother made contact with the Cambridgeshire Police making allegations against the father that she was suffering serious ongoing violence from him (I74 in the bundle).   The police referred the matter to Social Services.   A section 47 investigation was undertaken.   At a subsequent hearing on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December it was ordered that further contact by the father should be supervised.</p>

That was Ms. Coulthard who has remained the Guardian throughout.   On the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011 the mother made an oral application at court for the removal of the Guardian.   That was refused.    On the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011 a letter was received from Social Services making it plain that they had not been made aware by the mother of an undertaking given by the father in the order of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010 as to SB, his brother.</p>

On that occasion the court made D the subject of a shared residence order, the intention being that neither parent would have priority or primacy over the other and, as the Guardian told me in evidence today, so that in the future it was hoped the father would not been marginalised by the police or by Social Services if there were to be further allegations or incidents which required their involvement.</p>

It is of note that during the course of her oral evidence the mother told me that during the period of that staying contact she had a feeling that something was not right.   There was an issue between the parties about whether D should be returned on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April on the mother&#8217;s case or the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April on the father&#8217;s case.   As it was, he was returned on that latter date.  Coincidentally, just two days later, on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2012 the mother made a report to St. Ives Police Station re an allegation of domestic violence.   A referral was made by the police to Social Services.   On the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April Social Services concluded and notified the mother that the threshold for their involvement was not met and, accordingly, the matter would not be taken further.  </p>

This, apparently, so troubled and shocked the mother that, on some pretext, she went downstairs to get her mobile phone and then to record what was purported to be a conversation between her and D.    The transcript of that tape-recording is set out in the bundle at E326.  It is perfectly plain from reading that transcript that D was subjected to persistent questioning and direct questioning by his mother and when, as part of that, the child was asked who bathed him or who was in the bath with him, when it was put to him that it was SB, the child said, &#8220;No&#8221;, but the mother persisted.   It was then suggested by the mother that D had said that he had &#8220;wetted SB K&#8217;s thing&#8221; which transpires on re-listening was not what he said.   He had said that he had &#8220;letted SB K&#8217;s sink&#8221; which obviously makes no sense at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two days later, the mother and D are at the home of a friend of hers, JN, when it is said by JN, when she was bathing D and her two children, that D asked her whether his Mummy was going to get in the bath with them.  This, apparently, so shocked JN that she called for the mother, asked for her phone and proceeded to tape-record a conversation with D.  For whatever reason, that conversation either did not properly record or, by an oversight of DC Sutcliffe of the Cambridgeshire Police, was never sent to the High Tech Unit for retrieval.  She asserts that during that conversation D spoke of secrets that he had with his Daddy and of bathing with his Uncle SB.   </p>

She told me that she was absolutely 100% certain that what D had said was right. She could not explain what it was by D asking whether mummy was getting in the bath that so alarmed her and so shocked her that she asked for the mother&#8217;s telephone to record the conversation.   Moreover, she denied, when asked, that the mother had discussed with her either the events of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April or had told her of other matters that were of concern to the mother about D and having contact with his father.   </p>

What is even more alarming is, not content with recording D on that occasion, she then took the opportunity on unspecified further occasions to question D about what his uncle had done or what had happened to him so, as she put it, she could be satisfied that what he was saying was true.   One can only imagine the potential harm that was done to this little boy with that sort of ill-informed, unregulated and &#8220;aggressive&#8221; questioning.</p>

The mother invites me to make findings against the father of more recent aggressive behaviour but, far more seriously, invites me to find that D was sexually abused by his uncle and that the father failed to protect his son and allowed that abuse to occur.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SB is plainly a troubled man.   It is plain that he has suffered very real difficulties in his life including drinking alcohol to serious excess.   It is plain that in the years gone by during the currency of the parent&#8217;s marriage, up to but shortly before their separation, he caused very real problems for his mother, for his brother and for his sister-in-law.   He has a conviction in 2009 of kissing a girl in public under the age of 13.  He is therefore on the Register of Sex Offenders and is managed by Jigsaw in the community.  Detective Constable Smith and Mr. SB told me of how he has strategies in place to ensure that he maintains his Jigsaw conditions and does not commit like offences against children again which, for example, included when visiting his mother at the family home where there is a school nearby, he (a) ensures that he does not go when the children are going to school or leaving school and (b) he telephones his mother to ask if he may visit and then telephones to say he has arrived.  These allegations made against him in relation to the sexual abuse of D have affected him very greatly.   He told me, and I accept, that it led him to become depressed in July of last year for which he required medication.   His vulnerability was evident as he gave evidence before me.  He did so in a somewhat guarded manner.  That, in my judgment, is accounted for by the effect of these allegations upon him and not for any other underlying reason.</p>

He was clear in his denial of any physical abuse of the mother and clear in his denial that his brother, SB, would have had any opportunity to have abused D as alleged.  Ms. Brown, on behalf of the mother, prays in aid police notes where it would appear the father has, who was at the time undertaking a doctorate, passed himself off to the police as a doctor.   The father does not necessarily accept the account set out in the police report.  Even if they are true, they are examples of self-aggrandisement on his part and do not, in my judgment, otherwise undermine his credibility.   I agree with the Guardian&#8217;s analysis and view of the father; that he is very thorough, he is straightforward and he is reliable.  In my judgment, in relation to the areas of evidence relevant to the issues I have to determine, I found the father to be a credible and reliable witness.  </p>

In my judgment, she was all too ready to assume and to interpret the events with the worst possible connotation.  I also find that by her actions of making allegations to the police and the Local Authority from time to time, whether in December 2010 or in April last year, her purpose and intent was to stop, disrupt and minimise the father&#8217;s contact to D.  I do not understand why at this hearing in her evidence she alleged she had been raped by the father and there had been an attempted rape of her by SB.   That does not appear in either the 2010 findings document nor the schedule of findings sought for the purposes of this hearing.   I do not understand how, in her recent statement filed for these proceedings and in her oral evidence, she speaks so positively of the father as a father and of his relationship with D in light of the allegations she now makes against him.   I also do not understand how she could in her evidence assert that it was her desire to sit and talk through problems with the father when she has never done so in the past and, as has been demonstrated, her first recourse is not to apply to this court but to go to police and Social Services.  </p>

In my judgment it is clear on her pattern of behaviour that if D had said anything like that to her she would have raised a hue and cry and extended staying contact, as occurred in April last year, simply would not have been permitted to take place by her.  She would, in my judgment, have immediately made a complaint to the police and/or to Social Services as she did in late April 2012. I find the mother to be an unreliable historian who has exaggerated events at times to bolster her attempts to stop or limit the father&#8217;s contact with D.  At other times I regret to find she has invented allegations and lied to professionals, to investigating agencies and to the court.   </p>

I note her previous partner, a man called R, is, sadly, accused of being violent to her and of raping her.  I accept that there was a very clear difference in the demeanour of the mother when she was asked about the events of abuse at the hands of R (where she clearly was extremely and understandably emotional) compared with and contrasted to her demeanour when asked about the rape by the father or the alleged attempted rape by SB.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and in relation to the mother, on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April in the context of her being told that the Social Services were not going to take any further action into the matter referred by the police to them, I am concerned that she was too ready to reach a sinister conclusion.  She did not contact the father.  She effectively went straight to the police.  I remind myself that those events took place when, as the mother had told me, she had a feeling in her heart that something was not right when D was staying with his father.</p>

A more contaminated piece of evidence of alleged &#8220;disclosure&#8221; by a child could not be thought of.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, the interview of the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2012 conducted by Mr. Muchekeza and DC Sutcliffe was, by any standards of child abuse investigations, woeful.   That they conducted the discussion at the child&#8217;s home with the mother present in the house might well be excused.   But they questioned the child for 30 minutes without him making any disclosure and were at the point of calling it a day and leaving, which is understandable, but that they permitted the mother to speak to the child in their presence which was, &#8220;Tell them what you told Mummy about the bath&#8221;, is quite incredible.   It is a plain good ABE practice never to ask a child to repeat what they said to somebody else, simply to ask them to tell what has happened to them or what they have experienced.   To continue the discussion in the presence of the mother with the child being from time to time held by the mother is, in my judgment, wrong and improper.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The totality of all those matters taken together is that that body of evidence, of the recordings and of what D is supposed to have said to the police, to his mother and to JN is so contaminated or the risks of it being contaminated are so high as to, in my judgment, be completely unreliable.   I am reinforced in that view by the fact that Mr. Muchekeza and DC Sutcliffe, in material areas, had different notes and recollections of what it was that D was supposed to have said.   It is no minor insignificant matter, for example, that one records the child saying &#8220;he washed or touched his uncle&#8217;s willy and bottom&#8221; and the other records he touched &#8220;near&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event and furthermore, I am satisfied that it is almost inconceivable that this father would allow this child to be abused or to be harmed by anybody let alone by his brother whom he knows has had a very troubled past.  In many ways, the mother herself in evidence conceded that she really could not believe that this father would allow this to happen.   Moreover, whilst it is right that there were some issues on the father&#8217;s evidence and on the uncle&#8217;s evidence as to whether the uncle had seen D on two occasions last year, namely Easter Sunday and Mothering Sunday, or whether he may have been at the home when D was there on two other occasions in late 2012 is not really, in my judgment, relevant or significant upon the central question about whether this uncle had the opportunity to abuse D.</p>

But whatever the cause, whatever the reason, what is relevant and of great concern is that this mother did not hesitate to put the most sinister of explanations to what her four year old was saying and did her utmost to thwart the father&#8217;s contact and his relationship with his beloved son.</p>
