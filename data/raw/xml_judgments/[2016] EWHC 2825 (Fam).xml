	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am once again concerned with the lives of two children, NC, who is now aged 10, and SH, who is now aged 6.  The mother of the children in AS.  The father of SH is TH.  The father of NC is BC.  In March 2016 I delivered a lengthy judgment following a finding of fact hearing (see <span style="font-style:italic">AS v TH (False Allegations of Abuse) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/532" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 532 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 532 (Fam)</ref>) in which I made a series of findings against the mother regarding her conduct towards the children.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 September 2016 the matter came before me to consider the question of what final orders should be made in respect of each child&#8217;s welfare.  However, at that hearing TH questioned the jurisdiction of this court to make final orders in respect of SH&#8217;s welfare.  By implication, this also placed in issue whether the court had jurisdiction to make final orders in respect of NC&#8217;s welfare, although the point was not taken by BC.  The mother maintained that the court did have jurisdiction to make final orders in respect of both boys.   In light of this issue between the parties (and in circumstances where the fixture had become subsumed within an exceptionally busy &#8216;urgent applications&#8217; list) I listed the issue of jurisdiction for determination at this hearing, to be followed by a determination of the question of final orders should the court conclude that it had jurisdiction to make such orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue between the parties in respect of what orders should be made, either final or, on Mr Devereux&#8217;s case, interim, is now very narrow and boils down to a dispute concerning the quantum of supervised contact between the children and the mother.  The mother seeks supervised contact to SH and NC every three weeks.  TH submits that supervised contact between the mother and SH should take place four times per year.  BC submits that contact between the mother and NC should take place six times per year.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian submits that the children&#8217;s needs will be met by monthly supervised contact with their mother.  The narrow nature of the welfare issues between the parties in this regard does not, of course, detract from the need to be certain of the nature and extent of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make the orders sought.</p>

Within this context, the order of 20 February 2015 provided that if the question of jurisdiction was to be raised by TH the mother would be notified of this intention by 5 March 2015.

When the matter came before Mr Justice Keehan on 12 March 2015, the Position Statement prepared by counsel on behalf of TH did not raise the question of jurisdiction as provided for by the order of Her Honour Judge Finnerty dated 20 February 2015, and indeed was wholly silent as to that issue.  Rather, the issues raised on behalf of the father for consideration by the court were (i) the continuation of the injunctive relief obtained without notice to the father, (ii) consideration of the appropriateness of the declaration as to habitual residence without notice to the father, (iii) whether CAFCASS should be invited to compile a wishes and feelings report and given consideration to party status for SH and (iv) what further disclosure should be requested from the police and social services.  The order of Keehan J of 12 March 2015 records that the whilst father informed the court that he considered the mother to have wrongfully retained SH in England and that the matter should be determined in the courts of Scotland, and that whilst he continued to rely on the orders made by the Scottish court, he did not seek to enforce those orders at that time.</p>

Keehan J discharged the interim declaration in respect of habitual residence and the order purporting to prohibit the father from seeking to enforce any order that had been made in Scotland with respect to SH made on 28 January 2015.

In this respect I was taken by Mr Devereux to Lowe, Everall and Nicholls, <span style="font-style:italic">International Movement of Children: Law Practice and Procedure</span>, Family Law, (2004) in the footnotes to 3.9 and 3.23 where Lowe <span style="font-style:italic">et al </span>suggest that the term &#8216;considering&#8217; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 7</ref>(c)(ii) refers to the date on which the order is made.  This interpretation is plainly drawn from the Law Commission Report <span style="font-style:italic">Custody of Children &#8211; Jurisdiction and Enforcement within the United Kingdom </span>Law Com.

Within this context, and whilst limited contact continued for SH with his paternal grandmother and late paternal uncle, I am satisfied that, following their retention in England, as a matter of fact, both children ceased to be integrated in a social and family environment in Scotland.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequent to their retention in England, and having regard to the factual background and findings set out in my first judgment, it is plain that SH and NC&#8217;s time in England was very significantly disrupted.  Following their retention in England, SH and NC were first taken to live with their mother with the mother&#8217;s new partner, ER.  Whilst there they witnessed an extremely unfortunate incident prior to September 2014 when ER&#8217;s previous partner clung to the bonnet of ER&#8217;s car and screamed during a contact handover in respect of ER&#8217;s own children, to which incident a number of police cars and officers attended and as a result of which SH and NC were extremely upset.  A little over a month after SH and NC were retained in England they were again moved suddenly with their mother to a domestic violence refuge following the mother&#8217;s false allegations against TH.  Twelve weeks later in December 2014 SH and NC were moved again, this move happening suddenly amidst false allegations of risk of kidnap and harm.   By September 2015 SH and NC had been moved a third time to another local authority area.   The mother&#8217;s relationship with ER continued during this period, culminating in the mother alleging that she was assaulted and threatened by ER at home on 20 February 2016 at a time when the children were present in the property.  The mother informed the Children&#8217;s Guardian that this incident went on all night and that ER had tried to strangle her, had pushed her, and that she had been sick.  The children saw the ambulance arrive.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each of the peremptory changes within the context of the disrupted environment I have described above dislocated SH and NC&#8217;s school attendance and their peer relationships.  As at March 2016 the children were behind in their school work, a situation that their then teacher ascribed to the number of school moves the children had undergone during their time in England.  The children&#8217;s wider environment was also significantly unsettled.  Beyond the incidents of domestic discord and abuse witnessed by the children recounted in the foregoing paragraph, the serial moves they experienced took place within a context of SH and NC being seen over an extended period of time by multiple professionals in different local authority areas (when account is taken of the intervention by CAMHS, the children were questioned with respect to, or seen as a consequence of the allegations made in this case, often in the presence of each other, by no less than <span style="font-style:italic">nineteen</span> professionals on no less than <span style="font-style:italic">twenty</span> occasions for SH and no less than <span style="font-style:italic">forty-four </span>occasions for NC with <span style="font-style:italic">five</span> different police officers were involved with interviewing the boys).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, during this time the children were having <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> contact with any other family members beyond their mother who, as I have found as a fact, was during this period placing unwarranted emotional pressure on the children by herself making false allegations and making them known to the children, by inappropriately involving the children in adult discussions and by, on occasion, actively coaching the children to make allegations.  The quality of the children&#8217;s family relationship with their mother was, accordingly, poor.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian relates that SH has since commented that his mother would get angry if he stated he wished to see his father.  The net result was very significant physical, emotional and educational insecurity for both children.  The children&#8217;s perception of their situation was confused.  Indeed, I found in March that both children suffered significant emotional harm as a result of the care given to them by their mother during this period.  The intention of the mother in retaining the children in England was, as I found, to avoid the return of the children to the care of their fathers and, in relation to SH, to avoid compliance with the lawful orders made by the Scottish court.  TH and BC each intended the return of SH and NC to Scotland.  </p>

Thereafter, I am further satisfied that at a point after their retention in England both children lost their habitual residence in Scotland and that they had certainly done so by March 2016.  Further, for the reasons I have given, I am equally satisfied on the evidence before the court and the findings made in my first judgment that neither child acquired habitual residence in the period between August 2014 and April 2016.  To adopt Lord Wilson&#8217;s analogy in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child)(Habitual Residence: Inherent Jurisdiction)</span>, in the highly unusual circumstances of this case whilst the children&#8217;s roots in Scotland came up such that they lost their habitual residence in that jurisdiction, the children were not able, for the reasons I have set out, to put down roots representing the requisite degree of integration in the environment of England such as to acquire habitual residence here.  Whilst I accept that it is highly unusual to conclude that children are without a habitual residence, I am satisfied that, as a matter of fact, this was the result of the highly exceptional facts in this case.</p>

The meaning of the word &#8216;considering&#8217; is plain, namely to contemplate in order to reach a conclusion, or to examine the merits of a course of action, or to give attention to a matter.  Whilst he did not come to a settled conclusion on the point, it is clear that this is the sense in which Singer J interpreted the word in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Residence Order: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 518" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 518</ref> at 525.  Further, and within this context, whilst I note that Lowe <span style="font-style:italic">et al </span>suggest that the term &#8216;considering&#8217; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 7</ref>(c)(ii) refers to the date on which the order is made, that interpretation is clearly derived from the Law Commission report, which in turn makes clear (with emphasis) that this interpretation was only a recommendation. Notwithstanding that recommendation, Parliament chose the phrase &#8216;the date on which the court is considering&#8217; rather than the phrase &#8216;the date the order is made&#8221;, which was a construction open to it had that been the intention.   Thus, the statute does not say &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the date the court makes the order</span>&#8221; but rather &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the date on which the court is</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">considering whether to make&#8230;the order</span>&#8221;.  Within this context, I favour an interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 7</ref>(c)(ii) that relies on the plain meaning of the word &#8216;considering&#8217;.   However, I say &#8216;in so far as it is necessary for me to decide the issue&#8217; because even on Mr Devereux&#8217;s interpretation of the term &#8220;considering&#8221; as meaning &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the date the order is made</span>&#8217; the result in this case is the same in circumstances where I made orders on 26 April 2016.  On either interpretation I am satisfied that, on 26 April 2016, the court was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">considering whether to make&#8230;the order</span>&#8217; placing SH and NC in the care of their respective fathers for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 7</ref>(c)(ii) (I am also satisfied that this analysis could equally apply to the orders I made on 11 March 2016 providing for NC to have contact with his father and for SH to have contact with his paternal grandmother and late paternal uncle).</p>

Namely, the fact that this court has been seised of these proceedings since January 2015 and has conducted an extensive fact finding exercise and given a detailed judgment, the contents of which inform in detail the welfare decisions required in this case.  In these circumstances, this court is plainly the most appropriate forum to determine what welfare orders are in each child&#8217;s best interests having regard to the history of this matter.  It would be strange step to take in this case, at very end of long and involved fact finding process, to divest the final stage of determining which welfare orders should be made consequent on the outcome of that process to a different court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the now narrow question of what quantum of contact is in each child&#8217;s best interests, I am satisfied that I should make a final child arrangements order that SH should have contact with his mother on a supervised basis once per month for a period of three hours.  I am likewise satisfied that I should make a final child arrangements order that NC should have contact with his mother on a supervised basis once per month for a period of three hours.  My reasons are as follows.</p>

SH has settled well in the care of his father since April of this year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SH&#8217;s wishes and feelings as to contact are that he wants to see more of his mother and does not like Skype contact as it does not allow him physical contact with his mother.  Contact between SH and his mother in August went tolerably well.  SH told the Children&#8217;s Guardian that he wants to see his mother once every two weeks.   SH plainly has an emotional need to maintain contact with his mother and to continue to maintain and develop his relationship with her.  Having regard to the history of this matter, it is particularly important for SH to develop a &#8216;normal&#8217; relationship with his mother moving forward.  Against this however, I remain concerned that the mother still does not accept the findings made by this court regarding her conduct towards SH, conduct that has, I have found, caused him significant emotional harm.  The mother told the Children&#8217;s Guardian that that which she alleged &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">did happen</span>&#8221; but she just does not have &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the evidence</span>&#8221; to prove it.   At this hearing the mother reiterated this position to me through counsel.  Further, the mother appears to have determined she does not require therapeutic assistance.  Within this context, I agree with the conclusion of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the mother is not capable at this point in time of meeting SH&#8217;s emotional needs.  In the circumstances, I am further satisfied that the TH is right to express caution in respect of contact and the risk of emotional harm such contact presents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of SH, I am satisfied that the competing factors of ensuring that SH is able to maintain and develop his relationship with his mother and the risk of emotional harm that I am satisfied his mother continues to present are properly and proportionately balanced by an order for monthly supervised contact for a period of three hours.   This level of contact will assure that SH sees his mother on a regular basis, as he has expressed a wish to do, in order to maintain and develop his relationship with her.  At the same time, this frequency of contact will allow SH to continue to settle in the care of his father and reduce any risk that contact will undermine that placement or upset his emotional equilibrium.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context and having, as I must, SH&#8217;s best interests as my paramount consideration, I am satisfied that recommendation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian for monthly supervised contact is one that is in SH&#8217;s best interests and should be accepted by the court.   In preferring the higher level of contact recommended by the Children&#8217;s Guardian I have born in mind that, whilst risks remain in respect of contact, there are protective factors in place, namely SH has settled well in the care of his father, his father and his wider paternal family are very well attuned to SH&#8217;s emotional needs, contact in August 2016 went well and SH has expressed a wish to see more of his mother. In respect of Skype contact I agree with the Children&#8217;s Guardian that it should cease for the time being.  Plainly, this form of contact can be revisited in the future depending on the progress of direct contact and should SH express a wish to recommence such sessions.  SH should be made aware that whilst Skype contact is to cease at present, the option for Skype contact remains open should he wish to utilise that option in the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NC too has now settled with into the care of his father, is happy at school and has achieved what is described as a &#8220;glowing&#8221; school report.  NC initially rejected the court&#8217;s findings (they having been explained to him by means of a &#8216;children&#8217;s judgment&#8217; prepared by the court with the assistance of the Children&#8217;s Guardian).   More recently, NC has appeared more ambivalent in respect of the findings and simply does not want to speak about the past two years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Like SH, NC has expressed a wish to see more of his mother.  He would like to see her &#8220;twice every five weeks&#8221;.   Again, direct contact between the mother and NC in August went tolerably well.  NC has been observed by the Children&#8217;s Guardian to be very attached to his mother, with a wish to please her constantly.  Even more so than SH, having regard to the history of this matter, NC has a need to develop and maintain a &#8216;normal&#8217; relationship with his mother moving forward.  Against this, and within the context of the matters set out at Paragraph 97 with respect to the mother&#8217;s inability to acknowledge the findings of the court and her inability to meet the emotional needs of the children, the Children&#8217;s Guardian remains concerned that NC is particularly vulnerable to mother&#8217;s emotional control.  In these circumstances, the Children&#8217;s Guardian original recommendation had been that direct contact between NC and his mother should not commence until NC had commenced therapeutic intervention with CAMHS, with the nature and frequency of direct contact to be agreed in co-operation with NC&#8217;s therapist.  However, in September 2016 CAMHS indicated that it did not consider NC required &#8220;mental health interventions&#8221; at present.   They will review the position in December.  In light of this, and having regard to the fact that contact in August went well, whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian is concerned regarding the impact of <span style="font-style:italic">extensive</span> contact between NC and his mother in the context of the mother not accepting the findings and before NC and mother had the opportunity to benefit from therapeutic input, the Children&#8217;s Guardian on balance recommends direct supervised contact between NC and his mother once per month.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian considers that it would not be in either child&#8217;s interest to differentiate the level of contact SH and NC have with their mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once again, in the circumstances I have outlined, I am satisfied that BC is right to express caution in respect of contact between NC and his mother and the risk of emotional harm such contact presents.  However, I am also satisfied that the competing factors of ensuring that NC is able to maintain and develop his relationship with his mother and the risk of emotional harm that I am satisfied his mother continues to present are properly and proportionately balanced by an order for monthly supervised contact.   Whilst NC is more vulnerable than SH to his mother&#8217;s continued position in respect of the findings, I am satisfied that this level of contact will correctly balance NC&#8217;s need to maintain and develop his relationship with this mother and his need to continue to settle in the care of his father. I am further satisfied that it would not be in either child&#8217;s best interests to differentiate their respective levels of contact with the mother.  Having regard to NC&#8217;s best interests as my paramount consideration, I am satisfied that the recommendation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian for monthly supervised contact is one that is in NC&#8217;s best interests and should be accepted by the court.  In preferring the higher level of contact recommended by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, again I have born in mind that, whilst risks remain in respect of contact, there are protective factors in place, namely that NC is increasingly settled in the care of BC, his father is meeting his needs, contact in August 2016 went well, that CAMHS will be reviewing their role in respect of NC in December 2016 and that NC has expressed a wish to see more of his mother. Within this context, with respect to Skype contact between NC and his mother, I am satisfied that this should remain at its current level at this point in time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, I am satisfied that this court has jurisdiction to make final child arrangements orders in respect of each of the children.  I make a child arrangements order in favour of the mother in respect of SH that will provide that the mother will spend time with SH for three hours once per month in a supervised setting.  I make a child arrangements order in favour of the mother in respect of NC that will, again, provide that the mother will spend time with NC for three hours once per month in supervised setting.   Arrangements will need to be made for the registration of those orders with the Court of Session in Scotland.  I make no order as to costs save that there be a detailed public funding assessment of children&#8217;s costs.</p>
