In particular the anonymity of the child and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

An earlier order permitted the Bundle to exceed 350 pages, though did not specify an upper page limit, and permitted the contact notes to be separately available in a supplemental bundle.  The combination of the sheer volume of written evidence, the period covered by the allegations and the parties&#8217; evidence, as well as a time estimate which seems to have been reached without a witness template, led to my having to reserve judgment.</span></p>

There has also been a failure to follow what has been best practice guidance for some time in ensuring that, prior to any findings being made by a court, the term that should be used is &#8216;allegation&#8217;.  Use of the term &#8216;disclosure&#8217; before any findings have been made implies that what has been said is true.  It is doubly unfortunate in a case where, some considerable time after the alleged events, a court is placed in the position of trying to ascertain whether allegations have been proved to the required standard, based partly on what has supposedly been said by a vulnerable child at various points.  Professionals and those tasked with safeguarding should know better than to make assumptions or provide implications about the truth of allegations by the use of their language.  Ms Henry pointed out in closing that, whether M believed something or not is irrelevant for the purposes of fact-finding in the context of Children Act proceedings.  It is whether or not M can prove, on balance of probabilities, that F has done what is alleged that is the issue, not whether M believes it.</span></p>

M&#8217;s evidence was that A has always been consistent about these allegations, including to professionals and others, and has repeated what she has said multiple times.  When I asked her if it was possible that A being challenged about the behaviour prompted the repetition, M accepted that A was told not to do it but said that M believed that what she alleged had happened because of the repetition, which had been to lots of different people at different times, including professionals, and those professionals had explored alternative explanations and what M was alleging had been the consistent thing.  This is not my reading of the evidence before me, though.  A has said that F encouraged her to do it to some professionals, though this was not noted at all by the school in 2020 or 2021, and it seems that A has not repeated to anyone what the maternal grandmother alleged about F touching her inappropriately repeatedly.  A, as was noted by the school nurse and by the early help worker, gave no context to her comments about F encouraging her to do it.  She was inconsistent about where F supposedly touched her with the object in relation to the allegation by maternal grandmother that F put an object up her bottom, referring to variously her neck or tummy when questioned by her then nursery (D57), and describing having an object in her bottom at the time she was talking to the nursery manager.  </span></p>

The maternal grandmother accepted when I asked her about this that her safeguarding training would have been to note any significant demeanour.

It is not disputed that the maternal grandfather has no relationship with M, that her parents&#8217; marriage ended many years ago and that orders were made to prevent him from having direct contact with M or her siblings, and to protect the maternal grandmother from him.  The reasons for those orders seem to be relating to significant domestic abuse, and it doesn&#8217;t appear that F disputes that either.  F also accepts that in 2020 he did introduce the maternal grandfather to A without the knowledge of M, and put the maternal grandfather as an emergency contact for A at her school.  This happened nearly four years ago now, and F in evidence questioned the relevance of this which is a valid point.  M&#8217;s case is that F was well aware of the risks that the maternal grandfather may pose to A and introduced her to him despite these and despite professional concerns.  I have very little evidence from the Local Authority about this covering the period prior to when F facilitated the meeting.  M and the maternal grandmother both allege that F knew about the previous history of violence from the maternal grandfather, though both also put in their evidence to me that they did not really talk about the maternal grandfather.  M told me that &#8220;my mum doesn&#8217;t really talk about him much&#8221;, yet the maternal grandmother described a conversation with F in 2018 in which she says that she understood F to be fully aware of the violence from the maternal grandfather in the past.  Both M and the maternal grandmother accepted that the maternal grandfather&#8217;s half brother had attended M and F&#8217;s wedding but denied that there was any conversation with him about meeting the maternal grandfather as F alleged.  F&#8217;s evidence to me about this was that he was unaware of the violence in the relationship, but that M did not speak about him and it was &#8220;almost as though he did not exist&#8221;.  He accepted with hindsight he should have liaised with M before arranging for A to meet her maternal grandfather, that it came about &#8220;organically&#8221; as a result of discussions at the wedding with the maternal grandfather&#8217;s half brother, and that he seems to have focused on the potential material advantages for A of knowing wealthy maternal family members.  He also accepted that he should not have added him as an emergency contact, explaining that he had nobody else to add at the time, and had accepted that his actions were not appropriate at the initial child protection conference.  At its highest, it seems there is sufficient credible evidence for me to conclude that the maternal grandfather may have posed a risk to A but it is not clear to what extent F was aware of this given the absence of discussion about him that both M and the maternal grandmother accept was the norm.  F did accept in his oral evidence to me that he was aware that there had been an acrimonious relationship between the maternal grandparents. And, as F pointed out in his evidence to me, he was present when A met him and she only met him once nearly 4 years ago now.  Contrary to M's allegations that F does not accept professional advice, F did follow the advice of professionals and removed the maternal grandfather as an emergency contact and has not sought to pursue the relationship, accepting that it is a matter for the maternal family not him.  It seems to me that this is an instance of poor communication between M and F (both ways), neither has produced any evidence from the maternal grandfather&#8217;s half brother about what conversations may or may have taken place and with whom, and whilst perhaps deeply unwise actions on the part of F, it does not per se provide evidence of him causing emotional harm to and a risk of physical harm to her since his account that it was only once and he was present throughout was not challenged.</span></p>

However, it is not clear from those documents precisely what F knew and when about medication.  As far as I can work out from the Bundle, the first diagnosis for A was in March 2019 (GP letter July 2022 E5).  In May 2022 there seems to have been an asthma plan in place as set out in that GP letter.  Prior to this, the early health practitioner noted differing views from the parents about the administration of asthma medication (D16), but she doesn&#8217;t give any details about this beyond that M was administering it but F felt that A did not need it.  It seems from that evidence that there was a Team Around the Family held in March 2021 at which the GP explained that A did need medication and a joint appointment for the parents and A with the asthma nurse was recommended.  That joint appointment took place shortly afterwards to try to resolve the issue.  M accepts that after this she then took A to an asthma review without F in May 2022 at which the advice given in 2021 (ie that A did not require inhalers to be given regularly but that in date inhalers should be kept at both houses and used if symptoms were showing) changed to using a preventer inhaler twice daily with an alleviator inhaler to be used if A became wheezy or was coughing a lot (E3-E4).

In any event, in her oral evidence to me M acknowledged when questioned by Miss Henry that F does now manage A&#8217;s asthma appropriately and that the dates on the schedule were probably wrong.  It seems as if this issue is more likely than not attributable to the acrimonious relationship between the parents, including a breakdown of trust in both directions, which led to F not being included appointment in May 2022.  Although I accept that he was sent the details of the asthma management plan changes immediately after that appointment, his querying of how that came about was not unreasonable in light of the fact that he does not seem to have seen the same symptoms that M told the GP about.  Ultimately there is also no evidence that A did suffer harm as a result of this, and I have no credible evidence that F placed her at risk of harm by failing to administer inhalers as required once he was aware of the changed plan and the reasons for this.</span></p>

M&#8217;s evidence to me was that she relies on what A has said repeatedly about F threatening her with objects. The contact notes do not show evidence of this being an ongoing and severe fear on the part of A, nor that F downplays any fear or misuses objects.  M's case is that supervision of contact has prevented this, as she put in the allegation and told me in evidence.  F&#8217;s evidence was that he has taken on board the advice of Dr Haden on 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> August 2020 about how to respond when A mentions objects and the contact notes at CN29 and CN33, for example, show him responding appropriately.  M accepted in her oral evidence that A&#8217;s fear has lessened since she made her 2022 statement, which is consistent with what F and paternal grandmother also told me about A&#8217;s fear having abated.  There were no concerns voiced by A directly to the early help worker about this (D16).

It is hard to see what M relies upon to support her fear that F will revert to using objects inappropriately if contact were no longer to be supervised &#8211; he has completed parenting courses and clearly taken on board the advice of Dr Haden, and there is no evidence from the contact notes of him doing anything other than accidentally failing to remove an object (which could happen to any parent, frankly) and acting appropriately once he realised.  Significantly, there is no evidence of A reacting with undue distress or anxiety at that point or since if she brings up objects.  It seems more likely at this point that A&#8217;s fears about objects have abated, can be managed by appropriate parental responses and there is no credible evidence to show that F will revert to using inappropriate parenting techniques.</span></p>

Her main evidence about this seems to relate to a psychological assessment of F undertaken as part of the Local Authority Child Protection processes.  I have remarkably little clear evidence about this from any source.  The report is in the Bundle at E6-E17.  At E7 the psychologist noted that during group sessions involving the family </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">&#8220;the focus of the sessions often returned to unresolved events and difficulties from the past.  This made it difficult to focus on the present difficulties and ways in which everyone could move forward.  More specifically, F found it difficult to respect other&#8217;s views and he used emotive and denigrating language, particularly towards [maternal grandmother].  He appeared unable to consider his own role with the expressed difficulties, placing the onus on M and [maternal grandmother] to change&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">  This led to the psychologist moving to individual sessions, and then F withdrew from the assessment.  On any reading, that report is concerning because it is not clear to me quite what the Local Authority thought would be achieved by an assessment in 2022 focused on concerns around high level parental conflict, but where allegations of sexual and physical harm against F had been made by M and the maternal grandmother.  F&#8217;s evidence to me was that he thought this was about therapeutic support for him and the psychologist seems to have noted that he told her he was not aware of the nature of the assessment (E8).  Unlike a court appointed psychologist, instructed after the factual context has been determined by the court, this psychologist was faced with competing allegations which were denied, and there is no letter of instruction provided to all to clearly set the parameters of the assessment.  The psychologist, as she herself noted at E9, was instructed by the Local Authority in the context of an escalation in child protective measures where F was clearly feeling that his views were not being properly taken into account and that M&#8217;s allegations were being taken at face value.  With the benefit of hindsight, this attempt by the Local Authority to resolve matters with input from a psychologist was doomed to failure whilst the allegations being made by each parent about the other remained unresolved.  And I am not impressed that the chosen psychologist referred repeatedly to &#8216;disclosures&#8217; made by A, a point I covered in relation to various of the witnesses and professionals at the outset of this judgment.</span></p>

Some of the evidence about this overlaps with the earlier allegation about her putting her fingers in her bottom etc, and M relies heavily on what A has said about this.  As I have noted earlier, there are numerous instances of A saying that someone has told her to do things and then accepting when challenged that this is a lie.  For example, when A pulled her pants down in contact and was told that this was wrong by F, A responded to say that M liked her doing that and M accepted this was a lie (CN164).  Similarly, when A said that M had hit her in the face this turned out to be at worst accidental contact when putting her seatbelt on (CN184).  F&#8217;s evidence about this allegation was clear, he has never encouraged A to do this.  A can clearly display some very challenging behaviour and both parents and some professionals, such as her former school, have struggled at times to manage this.  She was noted by her school to clearly be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">&#8220;constantly trying to gain attention by doing things that are not acceptable&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> (C19).  Saying and doing things that shock will clearly gain her attention, and it seems clear that she did not differentiate between negative and positive attention in the behaviours shown throughout the bundle, though the contact notes do show her stopping when appropriately parented by F.  Whilst I have borne in mind that the fact that A lies at times doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean she is lying about everything she says, there is no credible evidence elsewhere to show that F has coached and encouraged her as M alleges.</span></p>

These fall into three groups, but have several sub-headings under each group.  I can take the first group of allegations in fairly short order because of the case law I noted earlier in this judgment.  Nobody is advancing a case that A does not want to spend time with her father, and everyone accepts that there are many instances in contact notes where A is clearly delighted to see him.  There is thus no evidence of one of the three key elements that F would need to show to establish alienating behaviours.  M accepts that she has covertly recorded handovers, and I have noted earlier that this appears to have been with a view to gathering evidence from what social services were told.  There is considerable guidance in the Family court about covert recording which can be summarised as it is rarely in the welfare interests of the child concerned, often creates evidential difficulties and ultimately says far more about the parent who has been covertly recording than the parent who has been recorded.  Sadly, that is my conclusion in this case &#8211; M and maternal grandmother (who also accepts recording handovers covertly) have recorded as a means of putting their interests first rather than A, have not obtained any reliable evidence as a result and their actions in doing this have clearly not helped a high conflict case such as this.  As responsible adults they should have known better.  In terms of F&#8217;s allegation of coaching A to make allegations, as I have noted earlier, A clearly says many things that are just not true and it seems clear to me that this is likely to be the origin of what she has said about F putting objects up her bottom and touching her bottom.  However, there is no compelling evidence adduced by F, who bears the burden of proof, that they have coached her to make the allegation and, at its highest, it seems more likely they have simply failed to respond appropriately to A saying these things.  As a result of that, this may well have encouraged A to repeat things though it also seems likely that A knows what she is saying is shocking and that gains her the attention she so clearly seeks.  Professionals have not detected evidence of coaching, despite clearly being alive to this as a risk, see for example the evidence from the nursery at D55.</span></p>

Her evidence about this issue also seems to be that there were communication difficulties about a request for video contact on F&#8217;s birthday, which were resolved by use of the Our Family Wizard app, something that F does not appear to dispute.  Whether or not she was right to refuse video contact at Christmas 2022 (and I&#8217;m not clear why it wasn&#8217;t possible for that to be supervised), at its highest it seems that communication difficulties between the parents have contributed significantly to this issue but it doesn&#8217;t seem as if M has refused video contact in the way that F alleges including when face to face contact has had to be cancelled.</span></p>

M&#8217;s response to this notes that she can produce witness evidence about this (though the burden of proof is not on her), but has not done so.  I am left with evidence of what seems to have been indirect communication via his solicitor to the effect that A would be staying with F, no suggestion of any threat to either F or A in that communication on M&#8217;s account, and overall an allegation that is of very little assistance to the court in determining what is in A&#8217;s welfare interests beyond that this is yet more evidence from both parents of considerable parental acrimony which seems to lead each to think the worst of the other.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The penultimate aspect of this first group of allegations is that M has lied to the LA and manipulated professionals in an attempt to withhold contact.  It seems apparent from my analysis of the evidence above that M has made allegations which have not been proved.  She has also accepted that she has made allegations to professionals which have not been pursued and in circumstances where she did not believe them.  An example of this was in April 2020 when M made an allegation to the police that F had made threats to throw A in the river (F8 and G15).  Her evidence about this when questioned by Miss Henry was confused, saying that she did make that allegation but thought she was doing so because she was concerned about this being emotional harm arising from threatening behaviour, linked to the allegation about use of objects, but thought that she was very clear to the police that this was the concern rather than an actual risk of him physically throwing A in the river.  She accepted that he would never throw A in the river and had also told social services that she did not think he was a physical risk to A.  It did not seem credible that she would have raised this allegation with the police solely about emotional abuse if, as she accepts, she was reporting the object up the bottom allegation.  However, is this and the unproven allegations evidence of &#8216;lying and manipulation&#8217; as F alleges?  It is for him to prove it, and it seems on the evidence before me that, at its highest, what M has tended to do is to think the worst of F and to adopt a rather &#8220;shot-gun&#8221; approach of reiterating allegations when making fresh allegations to professionals at times.  Ultimately this has not helped provide clarity and consistency in the evidence before me but is not the same as lying and manipulation. Equally, F accepted in his evidence to me when questioned by Ms Lavis, that he has at times made allegations that he has not pursued, for example the &#8216;brownish stain&#8217; he and paternal grandmother said they saw on A&#8217;s knickers at the end of April 2022 (D43). His evidence about this was that he did not tell the police or social services, and told the school because he was &#8220;just looking for a second opinion&#8221;.  The school records seem to show it was more of a reported allegation than a request for a second opinion in my view, something that was confirmed by F also saying to me that he &#8220;wanted a log kept and knew that the school was a place that would keep a formal record&#8221;.</span></p>

It is not entirely clear what the detail of this allegation is, beyond reference to suggestions made by a previous allocated social worker in 2022 about a contact plan (C51).  The essential evidence from both M and F about this seems to be that this contact plan was never actually agreed by all concerned including social services, and M accepted when questioned by Miss Henry that she did not want contact to move beyond supervision until F had had a psychological assessment.  I&#8217;m not sure that this establishes that M was &#8216;refusing any progression of contact&#8217; and any progression of contact in the welfare stage of these proceedings will be determined in light of my findings and subsequent welfare evidence including from the Guardian so I am not sure that this adds anything at this point.</span></p>

This is firstly alleged to be as a result of M using objects as a method of discipline.  Again it is not clear quite what F relies upon for this nor when he alleges that it has occurred, but it seems to relate to what he says A has said and done at times.  For similar reasons to my analysis in relation to M&#8217;s allegations of sexual and emotional harm, A&#8217;s actions and comments are not a sufficient foundation to prove this in my view.  This seems to be more of a retaliatory allegation, which F accepted may be the case in his oral evidence to me when questioned by Ms Lavis, saying that these were intended to &#8220;counter&#8221; M&#8217;s allegations.  I would note in passing that there is no legal principle, or even common sense principle, that requires one set of allegations to be &#8220;countered&#8221; by others and this is simply evidence of the high conflict between M and F in my view.  Similarly, F does not now pursue the allegation that A has been locked in her bedroom by M.  He does pursue an allegation that M has sold A&#8217;s toys as a form of punishment, something that M largely accepts albeit with the explanation that she thought this was what she had been advised to do as a part of A understanding there were consequences to her causing damage.  Whether it is overt punishment or simply presented as a consequence of her actions, I do have some concerns about a parent thinking that telling A her toys would have to be sold in these circumstances is good enough parenting for a child with A&#8217;s additional vulnerabilities.  Imposing consequences for actions is entirely valid, but those are normally withdrawal of privileges or time out rather than telling a child that they will have to sacrifice a toy.</span></p>

It seems very clear from all of the professional evidence before me, and some of the parents&#8217; evidence too, that A&#8217;s challenging behaviour arises from a complex set of factors.  I have no doubt that the change from seeing her F to then not seeing him will have been part of that given that everyone accepts she struggles with change, but the context is significant (as both parents kept saying at various points).  The initial child protection conference held on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> April 2022 resulted in a recommendation for supervised contact, which F agreed to (F74).  Regardless of his disputes with the Local Authority at the time or since, contact was not prevented entirely and the decision about supervision was one led by the Local Authority at that point.   It seems clear from the evidence her former school has provided that they were simply not capable of meeting her needs for a variety of reasons, not least the issues around bilingual teaching and frequent changes of teachers through the week.  This is bound to have been part of the complex set of factors which, for example, Dr Haden noted were at play for A. There is no clear evidence that M&#8217;s actions alone prevented contact and led to the problems with her behaviour as school.</span></p>

Again, as with some of M&#8217;s allegations, F seems to largely be relying on what A has said at various times, including in October 2022 when she told her school that she liked M&#8217;s partner because he sleeps in her bed with her (F277).  This prompted contact from social services to M, which resulted in the record at F212 which shows that M told them that A had wet herself, she made A have a shower whilst she stripped the bed and then let A get into bed with M and her partner.  At the time everyone seems to have been wearing pyjamas and this seems to be simply another example of one parent reading something sinister into what A has said without real justification.</span></p>
