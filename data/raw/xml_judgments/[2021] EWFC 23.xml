In 2014 the husband lodged a writ for divorce in Scotland. Since they had last resided together in Scotland and had by then been habitually resident there for at least a year, the English court was obliged to stay the wife&#8217;s petition: section 5(6) of, and paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 1 to, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973</ref> (&#8220;the DMPA&#8221;). In January 2015, after it had been stayed, her petition was by consent dismissed.

In the present case, there was no relevant connection between the wife&#8217;s English maintenance claim under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and the husband&#8217;s Scottish proceedings concerning marital status, and thus no risk of irreconcilable judgments. Therefore, the two sets of proceedings were not &#8220;related actions&#8221; for the purposes of article 13 of the Maintenance Regulation, as applied by Schedule 6 and, accordingly, the court had no jurisdiction to stay the wife&#8217;s application for maintenance. </p>

It applies only to a dwindling number of transitional cases commenced before 1 January 2021. The outcome intended by Lord Wilson has in fact been achieved by Brexit. With effect from 11 pm on 31 December 2020 the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Maintenance) Regulations 2011 have been almost entirely revoked by para 38 of the Schedule to the Jurisdiction and Judgments (Family) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019 No. 519). So far as England and Wales are concerned everything in the 2011 Regulations has been revoked, including, most relevantly for the purposes of this case, Schedule 6. Further, by virtue of paragraph 6 of those EU Exit Regulations the jurisdictional criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/27/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.27(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> have been altered from those in the Maintenance Regulation, to provide instead that jurisdiction will be established if (a) either party is domiciled in England and Wales, or (b) the applicant has been habitually resident in England and Wales for one year, or (c) the respondent is resident in England and Wales. </p>

The procedural treatment of &#8220;related actions&#8221; has been made redundant but may yet revive if the UK&#8217;s application to join the Lugano Convention of 2007 is successful. That 2007 Convention covers maintenance in the same way as the old Brussels I Regulation used to do so. The jurisdictional rules in its article 2 are in closely similar terms to those in article 3 of the Maintenance Regulation. &#8220;Related actions&#8221; and their treatment are covered in its article 28 in identical terms to article 13 of the Maintenance Regulation. It is pure conjecture whether the government, following a successful accession to the Lugano Convention of 2007, would reinstate the 2011 Regulations and specifically Schedule 6.  </p>

But her right to pledge her husband's credit for necessaries was an inadequate remedy for the separated wife whose husband's credit was not pledgeworthy.

The Legislature has invested the matrimonial Courts in such a case with powers to make such provision for the future maintenance of the wife as the Court may think reasonable. Some powers were given by the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. They have been extended by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>s of 1866 and 1907, and are now contained in ss. 190&#8211;192 of the Judicature Act of 1925. The necessity for such provisions is obvious. While the marriage tie exists the husband is under a legal obligation to maintain his wife. The duty can be enforced by the wife, who can pledge his credit for necessaries as an agent of necessity, if, while she lives apart from him with his consent, he either fails to pay her an agreed allowance or fails to make her any allowance at all; or, if she lives apart from him under a decree for separation, he fails to pay the alimony ordered by the Court. But the duty of the husband is also a public obligation, and can be enforced against him by the State under the Vagrancy Acts and under the Poor Relief Acts. When the marriage is dissolved the duty to maintain arising out of the marriage tie disappears. In the absence of any statutory enactment the former wife would be left without any provision for her maintenance other than recourse to the poor law authorities.&#8221; </p>

There are old cases, which I will analyse, which say that the court retains a discretion to allow an order for maintenance to continue after the dissolution of the marriage, whether by a domestic decree or a foreign decree. That power is, plainly, wholly anomalous, and, as Sir Henry Duke P has observed (see below), contrary to common sense. It appears to be a manifestation of the syndrome of chauvinism to which Lord Wilson referred in the Supreme Court. Curiously, the legal basis for the existence of the power was not considered by the Law Commission in either its Working Paper or its Report which led to the passage of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1970 Act</ref>. Nonetheless, the Law Commission did propose in its Report, without comment, a provision in its draft Bill which permitted a maintenance order to continue after the dissolution of the marriage during joint lives (see clause 7(2)(c) on p.76).

They took the view which this appellant took, that such an order once made and while the parties are alive is not got rid of except by an order of the Court of summary jurisdiction, and that an application must be made. On the whole, I think the appellant was right in his original view that he must go to a Court of summary jurisdiction to get rid of this order, although there had been a decree absolute for divorce, and it seems to me to follow from that that if there were not the statutory grounds of discharge of the husband from his obligation under the order, then before the appellant could succeed he must satisfy the magistrate that justice required that the order should be altered, varied or discharged. He failed to so satisfy the magistrate. I entirely agree with the reasons upon which the magistrate founded that view. The magistrate thought it was a very convenient thing that this order should subsist and that a Court, which was close at hand to the parties, should be able to give the wife assistance if she needed it, or give the husband relief if he was entitled to it.&#8221;  </p>

It is very hard to understand why one debarring feature of the common law, for example adultery, led to the discharge of a maintenance order while another debarring feature of the common law &#8211; divorce - did not. It is no answer to say that adultery is specifically mentioned in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss.6</ref> and 7, because other matrimonial offences, for example desertion, which are not mentioned in the statute, led to the same result.

Where the domestic divorce court (at that time only the High Court) could award maintenance there were pragmatic, practical, reasons for another more convenient local domestic court, close at hand, to be able to do so also. However, with the advance of mobility, and the devolution of divorce cases to divorce County Courts in 1968, these pragmatic reasons carry much less force. If a married woman had the benefit of a maintenance order but later applied for a divorce, then replacement by the divorce court of the maintenance order by an order for alimony <span style="font-style:italic">pendente lite</span>, or an order for permanent alimony, would be straightforward. It is hard to justify a state of affairs whereby all the financial questions between the parties should not be finally determined in one set of proceedings before the divorce court. </p>

The latter case involved a divorce in Scotland. The effect of those decisions was that where there had been a foreign divorce accepted as valid in England, the English courts would recognise that they no longer had jurisdiction over the parties, and would not interfere between them further except to entertain an application to discharge an existing order.

He applied to the court to discharge a maintenance order made by a Magistrate in 1950. The Magistrate not only refused the application but increased the value of the order. The Divisional Court allowed the appeal and discharged the order. The wife appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal and restored the order of the Magistrate.  </p>

There were no children of the marriage. The Divisional Court, after directing an inquiry as to the (innocent) wife's rights in Scotland to the proper officer of the Court of Session, took the view that in all the circumstances of the case it would be more convenient and appropriate that all financial questions between the wife and husband should be decided by the Scottish court; but they expressly stated (in my view rightly) that the fact that the divorce had been obtained in a foreign country did not necessarily require that the court's discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> of the [1895] Act must be exercised by discharging the original order.

I naturally accept, however, that the decision is binding on me. I acknowledge that it plainly validates and explains the reason for the existence of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.28(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

Having regard to all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the justice of the case requires that I should exercise the power to make an order for maintenance under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.&#8221; </p>

However, the core reason for the maintenance award was the wife&#8217;s &#8220;dire need of financial support&#8221;. I would accept that the alleviation of undue financial hardship might be another exceptional reason for exercising the discretion to make, or confirm, an award that took effect after foreign divorce. This would depend, however, on the court finding that no, or seriously inadequate, financial support would be awarded by the foreign court. </p>

That has been a product of an exceptionally strong mutual antipathy. This has been a case where love has to hatred turned to an extraordinary degree. The cross-examination of the parties was reminiscent of a peculiarly vicious defended divorce. Hours were spent picking over ancient grievances. The husband has vented his spleen by alleging that the wife is a bigamist. He has sought to amend the Scottish divorce proceedings to plead nullity on the grounds that the marriage was void at its inception, and he has reported the wife to the police for the crime of bigamy. The allegation was completely spurious. He has more recently shifted his sights and has intimated that he intends to report the wife to the police for having fraudulently misrepresented her age at the time of the marriage. It was pointed out to him that this too, was absurd, but he nevertheless declined to confirm that he would withdraw the threat. The husband has accused the wife of being a fraudster, a fantasist and generally useless. </p>

I do not have direct evidence, but am informed that W's brother, a creditor in H's insolvency, has been told by Mr Bain the administrator that H is seeking a capital advance from the trustees to pay the debt.

It is analogous to telling lies to the court. Well-established authority teaches us that lies to the court can lead to a number of conclusions. First, and obviously, lies to the court may lead to the inference that something highly material, and highly adverse, to the witness is being obscured. But other conclusions may be drawn. Sometimes witnesses unwisely lie in order to bolster a true case. This is hardly a surprising phenomenon. Sometimes witnesses lie in order to conceal shameful, but irrelevant, behaviour. Sometimes witnesses lie simply in order to be difficult. The forensic process is so exacting, and often (as in this case) so prolonged, that it drives people, perhaps already so disposed, to behave unreasonably, combatively, and truculently. This is an especially common phenomenon in divorce litigation where personal relations will have already plunged to new depths. </p>

Courts make orders that are intended to bind and if necessary, to be enforced.

One is that the court is not obliged to limit its orders exclusively to resources of capital or income which are shown actually to exist. The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse&#8217;s expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets. Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. <span style="font-style:italic">There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court&#8217;s view of the justice of the case</span>. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8221; (emphasis added) </p>

In the former situation he does not have the means and is not reasonably in a position to remedy the situation: in the latter situation he has the means, or refuses to obtain them when they are reasonably available to him, so that he fails to provide reasonable maintenance for the other party, and fails to provide or to make a proper contribution towards the reasonable maintenance for any child of the family. If there is such failure to maintain, relief on that basis may be sought and either party to a marriage may apply&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">No authority is cited in support of this statement but in my judgment it is plainly correct. Its use of the present tense shows clearly that the court must be looking at the here and now, that is to say the period immediately preceding the application. The criterion of reasonableness first requires the court in determining the preliminary factual criterion to consider what sum, if any, the respondent should have been expected to pay from his means to maintain the wife. It requires the court to determine initially whether the failure to pay maintenance was the result of &#8216;won&#8217;t pay&#8217; rather than &#8216;can&#8217;t pay&#8217;. If it is the former then the court moves to the second stage where the criterion of reasonableness plays a different role. Here it requires the court to make an evaluative assessment of what proportion of the respondent&#8217;s means should go to the wife as maintenance having regard to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref> factors including, prominently, the marital standard of living, the length of the marriage, and the wife&#8217;s own means. </p>

In those proceedings she is entitled to claim alimony pendente lite and, in the event of her succeeding in those proceedings, she is entitled to claim a permanent provision for herself whether by way of alimony or by way of maintenance. In the event of divorce, she is entitled to claim maintenance to be secured to her for her life as opposed to the period of joint lives, which appears to be the utmost that can be obtained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/100/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 5</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/100" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 100" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1949</ref>.&#8221;  </p>

Mr Horton argues that if the substantive application is dismissed then the interim order must logically be discharged <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span> with the consequential erasure of all the arrears. If the evidence now shows, contrary to the findings of Mrs Justice Parker, that the respondent did not have the means to pay at the time the order was made, or subsequently, then as a matter of logic the order must be discharged. After all, in her judgment at [112] Mrs Justice Parker stated that if it transpired that the sum awarded by way of maintenance was overgenerous it could be readjusted. </p>

The only change would have been the court&#8217;s view of the evidence. Section 38 would definitely not apply.

The costs orders made by Mrs Justice Parker and the Court of Appeal, are however, judgments which may not be altered. It is right that the husband should be required to pay those: they reflect the result that he lost on the legal point, and his ability to pay was not a relevant consideration in their making. That it may be difficult to enforce these orders is not a reason for disturbing them, even if I had the power to do so (which certainly in relation to the Court of Appeal order, I do not). </p>

In my judgment, on this hypothetical scenario, the husband ought to pay &#163;10,000 p.a. in maintenance to the wife. It would be a drop in the ocean when set against her current needs and debts. But there is no good reason why she should be entirely dependent on the charity of her family and friends. This was an 18-year marriage and the husband ought to make some attempt to discharge his duty to maintain his wife. Payments would commence on the date of my order. There would not be any backdating as the husband has no capital to discharge any arrears and the trustees certainly will not give him any for that purpose.  </p>

I am certain that the same result would have been reached as I have reached in this judgment and the application would have been dismissed. That would have saved the parties the better part of six years of stressful, contentious, ruinously expensive and psychologically damaging litigation warfare. There would have been a divorce long ago in Scotland. Years ago the Sheriff Court at Dumbarton would have finally resolved all financial questions between the parties. I am not blaming the husband for the course that he took; after all, he came within one vote of victory in the Supreme Court. With the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight I can, however, lament his decision. </p>
