During the night of the 8.2.18 it was reported by nursing staff that EF said &#8216;oww&#8217; when his genitals were wiped during a nappy change. A Paediatrician examined EF the following day and he was not seen to have any marks in his groin area. On 11.2.18 the social worker Hayley Brooksby attended the hospital and undertook direct work using pictures and words with him. He repeated that daddy had hurt him and curled his hand in a fist shape and moved it towards his head. Daddy was identified as being CD and mother&#8217;s boyfriend was identified as KL. It was considered that there was no direct evidence to suggest that the injuries had been caused in the care of mother or KL and so EF was discharged on 12.2.18 to his mother&#8217;s care. The children were seen by a social worker at home on 13th, 14th and 16th February 2018. An initial child protection conference was due to take place on 27.2.18. </p>

On 21.2.18 EF was presented at nursery with what appeared to be a fading bruise in his groin area. By 23.2.18 it was said by the nursery that this bruise was still present and visible during a nappy change. Mother was asked about this bruise and said that it had been present when EF was in hospital on 8.2.18 (which was untrue) and therefore the nursery did not make any further referral. </p>

AB was advised that EF would require admission upon review by the Paediatrician.  However, AB refused for EF to be admitted and left the hospital abruptly.  GH was in the car with mother&#8217;s partner KL and the 10-month-old child of the maternal grandmother (who had told the mother to take EF to hospital but then left her child with them and went to work).  This was reported immediately to the police and AB, her partner KL and the children were located at maternal grandmother&#8217;s house.  The Police evoked <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46</ref> powers and the children were returned to the hospital under Police Protection. Mother told the nursery that the new injuries had happened that morning when they rang her.</p>

These injuries are considered to be non-accidental as set out in the report of Dr Hewertson, Consultant Paediatrician dated 28.2.18. There were 19 bruises and he was tender over the lower abdomen, scrotum and penis. Bloods were all unremarkable. Most, if not all the bruises were deemed to have appeared since his medical on 9.2.18. Bruises to his cheeks could represent fingertip marks, bruises to his scrotum, lower abdomen and groin suggested blunt trauma and the appearance of the penis would be in keeping with the circumferential application of pressure sufficient to cause proximal bruising such as an application of a ligature. The bruising to the back would have required force. All of the injuries would have been painful for EF.</p>

Her view that Mrs Sharpe, in the course of their parenting assessment, had painted an overly negative picture of EF and his needs was seized upon as evidence that she did not accept that EF has certain emotional and psychological problems which require particular attention from his carers. I reject this suggestion. It was plain from her evidence, taken as a whole, that she accepted EF&#8217;s needs as identified by the social workers but as a lay person, as opposed to a professional, who loves this little boy she, quite understandably, had a more optimistic view of EF and his needs. This view will not, in my judgment, result in her ignoring or not being alive to the care and attention EF will require to address his emotional and psychological issues.</p>

I completely understand CD&#8217;s child focussed approach. IJ told me he accepted the proposal for EF&#8217;s surname to include both his and CD&#8217;s surnames but that he, for wholly understandable reasons, would prefer EF&#8217;s surname to be &#8220;D-J&#8221;. </p>

First, the oral evidence of EF&#8217;s and/or GH&#8217;s needs was no different from that set out in the written evidence. GH had no needs other than that which any three-year-old would have for love, support, security and stability from her care givers. EF has a stammer for which he receives speech and language therapy, he is developmentally delayed and currently functions at the level of a three-year-old &#8211; his educational needs will be assessed when he starts primary school. Further, when first received into care he was observed to demonstrate some sexually inappropriate behaviour towards his sister but latterly had exhibited behaviour which would not be considered unusual in a four-year-old boy but which required supervision. Moreover given his past history of parenting he flinched if an adult approached him &#8211; fearing he was going to be struck or harmed. </p>

There are differences between QR and IJ in their respective accounts of what was said at this very short meeting. I do not consider it necessary or helpful to resolve these differences, suffice it to say that IJ and MN left the meeting with the view that QR still had reservations about caring for EF.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already recorded I was impressed by QR in evidence. I accept she and CD had endured an emotionally traumatic few months earlier this year very shortly after the birth of their daughter. In light of the injuries to EF and the police investigation, CD had been required to leave the home he shared with QR, ST and UV, who was only two weeks old. Although she was fully co-operative she understandably found the process of being assessed intrusive and daunting. Coming from a family of four daughters and having two daughters of her own I am not surprised she doubted her ability to care for EF as a boy with his particular needs. She had reflected on her position, she had spent more time over the last two months with EF in contact and she was now confident she could care for EF and the other children. I accept her stance is genuine and that QR is determined and committed to care for this little boy whatever her past reservations may have been. I am satisfied she is not and has not been under any undue pressure from CD to agree to care for EF.</p>

I accept he had felt under considerable emotional pressure from the parenting assessment and from these proceedings when he spoke as he did. Further I accept his expression of regret at what he had said was a wholly genuine expression of remorse. In taking this incident into account the local authority have blown it up out of all proportion from its true significance which in my judgment is minimal. It was a demonstration of CD&#8217;s occasional impetuous response to events. Of greater importance it was a graphic illustration of the deep love he has for EF and for GH and of his sincere desire and commitment to care for both of them.</p>

I accept that running a household and caring for four children under the age of five will be difficult and will present challenges to QR, who will be the primary day to day carer, and to CD who works full time. I am satisfied, nevertheless, that they have the commitment, the support and their wherewithal to meet these challenges. Both come from large, loving and supportive families who will be on hand to assist them.</p>

I am in no doubt that IJ would take all necessary and appropriate steps to raise any concerns he may have in the future with CD and/or QR to ensure all of EF&#8217;s needs are met. </p>
