	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">At an earlier stage in the proceedings another local authority (&#8216;the second local authority&#8217;) were given notice of these proceedings. They were the local authority responsible for providing the support under the adoption support plan and the applicant in the care proceedings issued in relation to A and B in 2018, which concluded in September 2019. They provided disclosure of documents but did not seek party status. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">Since the autumn 2018 both A and B have been back living with the natural maternal family. A and her son, born in 2020, live with CT and her three younger children. B had been staying with CT&#8217;s aunt, although spending time with CT. It is accepted the placement with Mr and Mrs X has permanently broken down, neither A or B have lived with them since autumn 2018, with only A having limited contact with them since then. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">Although there is no dispute between the parties that the adoption order should be revoked, there remain issues about how the court should approach the relevant legal principles. As a consequence, the court invited Cafcass Legal to act as Advocate to the Court. This invitation was accepted and the court and parties have benefited from the clarity and analysis they have brought to the issues in the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">This case has had the benefit of expert specialist representation with the consequence the written skeleton arguments and oral submissions have been of the highest quality. Mr O&#8217;Sullivan and Mr Laing have represented Mr and Mrs X pro bono, for which the court is extremely grateful, as it has ensured Mr and Mrs X have had the benefit of legal representation. </p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">It is important for the court to recognise that behind the detailed legal submissions in this case the outcome of the application will have very significant consequences for A, B, CT and Mr and Mrs X. If granted, the order to revoke the adoption orders will change in a lifelong way the legal relationships they have with each other. It is an outcome they all support but that alone, whilst an important factor, does not determine the outcome of the case.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">It is necessary for the court to determine the issues between the parties about the legal framework within which the court should consider this application. Only then will the court be able to consider the relevant factors in the case and determine whether it should exercise the court&#8217;s discretion under the inherent jurisdiction to revoke the adoption orders. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">The written and oral evidence has described how important the outcome of this application is for the people who are most directly affected. The statements detail, from their own perspectives, how enormously difficult this has been for them all, and is likely to continue to be so.  </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">What is clear is how the continuing legal position impacts each of their lives in a very significant way. In her oral evidence, A very powerfully explained how her current legal status is present in so many aspects of her daily life. Everything about her is recorded with a surname, which she does not identify with as her name, it is not what she wants to be known by and does not reflect her own and her son&#8217;s day to day life. A vivid example of this was when her son was born. She wished him to be known in the hospital with her natural mother&#8217;s surname, that was not possible as all her relevant records are in the name of X. She described how the fact that this issue involves every aspect of her life means that she has to explain her circumstances each time, which causes her considerable distress. As she described, it makes her feel she is the odd one out in her family. She wants to be able to be in a position where she can say that in every aspect of her life that she is a member of the T family. Whilst B did not give evidence, the position A described is reflected in her written statement, she was present when A gave oral evidence and did not disagree with what was said. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">Neither Ms T nor Mr and Mrs X gave oral evidence. In their statements, Mr and Mrs X convey from their different perspective why they do not object to the order to revoke the adoption orders being made, and how the continuing position impacts on their lives. They too have to explain their position when they are contacted, as they remain A and B&#8217;s legal parents. </p>

The nature and effect of an adoption order. It is intended to be legally permanent and changes in a lifelong way the legal status as between the child and the natural parents (to extinguish any legal parent child status) and the child and the adoptive parent(s) (to treat them as if born as the child of the adopter(s)). There are strong public policy reasons for not permitting the revocation of adoption orders once lawfully made. The court&#8217;s discretion under the inherent jurisdiction to revoke such an order can only be done in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances. </p>

The court hopes that now these proceedings are concluded each of the individuals most affected will now be able to move forward in the light of the orders the court has made. </p>

In these proceedings from her telephone conversations and email exchanges with Mr X, Ms N states they continue to be very distressed about the adoption placement breakdown.

Those cases concern a failure to effect proper service of the adoption proceedings on a natural parent or ignorance of the parent of the existence of the adoption proceedings. In each case the application to set aside the order was made reasonably expeditiously. It is fundamental to the making of an adoption order that the natural parent should be informed of the application so that she can give or withhold her consent. If she has no knowledge at all of the application then, obviously, a fundamental injustice is perpetrated. I would prefer myself to regard those cases not as cases where the order has been set aside by reason of a procedural irregularity, although that has certainly occurred, but as cases where natural justice has been denied because the natural parent who may wish to challenge the adoption has never been told that it is going to happen. Whether an adoption order can be set aside by reason of fraud which is unrelated to a natural parent's ignorance of the proceedings was not a subject which was relevant to the present appeal...As the case law stood, certainly in 1976, the powers of the court to set aside an adoption order as known to Parliament would, in my view, have been limited to the power to set aside such an order on the basis of a breach of natural justice such as I have described above, and not an inherent power to set aside an adoption order by reason of a mistake or misrepresentation." </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.1in;text-indent:0in">"The act of adoption has always been regarded in this country as possessing a peculiar finality. This is partly because it affects the status of the person adopted, and indeed adoption modifies the most fundamental of human relationships, that of parent and child. It effects a change intended to be permanent and concerning three parties. The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents." </p>

Ms Fottrell submits it was clear the adoptive placement with Mr and Mrs X was in jeopardy at an early stage. They tracked through the key events in the chronology leading to the time in September/October 2018 when both A and B had returned to Ms T&#8217;s care, and the making of child arrangements orders in 2019 in favour of Ms T. She places great emphasis on the uniqueness and legal significance of this situation, whereby the natural mother shares parental responsibility with the adoptive parents in circumstances where the adoptive parents are clear that they do not wish to exercise parental responsibility in relation to either A or B. She submits from this point on A and B are trapped by a legal fiction, as are Mr and Mrs X. They are legally bound to children who as a matter of fact they are estranged from. There was only limited contact with A since then and none with B. Mr and Mrs X positively do not wish to be involved with or exercise parental responsibility in relation to them. They currently share parental responsibility with Ms T in relation to B, whose parental responsibility was extinguished by the making of the adoption order in 2011.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">In considering the first instance decisions Ms Fottrell focuses on <span style="font-style:italic">PK v Mr and Mrs K</span> [2015] EWHC 2316 (Fam), which on its facts is similar to the circumstances in this case. The application to revoke the adoption order was made on behalf of a 14 year old child who had been estranged from the adoptive parents, and had returned to the care of the natural family. The adoptive parents in that case who had attended earlier wardship proceedings did not object to orders for the child to live with the natural family. They played no part in the proceedings to revoke the adoption order, although they had notice of them. As Pauffley J observed at [11] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;All the signs are Mr and Mrs K have relinquished responsibility for PK&#8217;</span> continuing a little later to state at [12] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There are two obvious inferences to be drawn from the history combined with the lack of engagement on the part of Mr and Mrs K. The first is that they relinquished actual responsibility for looking after PK 9 years ago. The second is that they have no intention to oppose her applications which will have the effect of breaking the legal links between them and PK&#8217;.</span> Ms Fottrell aligns herself with the succinct analysis undertaken by Pauffley J, which includes aspects of the child&#8217;s welfare, such as PK&#8217;s strong feelings about her legal status resulting in Pauffley J&#8217;s assessment at [25] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;If I were to decline to revoke the adoption order and refuse to allow PK to change her name back to that of her natural mother, it would seem to me there would be profound disadvantages in terms of her welfare needs&#8217;</span> and the fact that all relevant adults are aware of the application and either support or tacitly accept it. At [27] &#8211; [28] Pauffley J states &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">The only advantage of a refusal of the application to revoke the adoption order would be the public policy considerations in upholding a validly made adoption order. I am in no doubt. The right course is to allow both applications in these highly exceptional and very particular circumstances and for the reasons given.&#8217;</span></p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re </span>O Sir James Munby P described the circumstances in that case as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;unprecedented</span>&#8217;, where the adoption order had been made following a mistake of law which went to the very root of the need for an adoption order at all. The entire adoption proceeded upon what, in law, was a fundamentally flawed basis. A consideration in that case was that by revoking the adoption order it would not result in uprooting the child, it would recognise a legal and factual reality and put an end to a legal and factual fiction. Sir James Munby P agreed the revocation would meet the child&#8217;s welfare needs and stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I can detect no convincing argument of public policy pointing in the other direction; on the contrary, in this most unusual and highly exceptional case public policy marches in step with justice to X, Y and C1; public policy demands that I make the order which so manifestly in required in C1&#8217;s best interests&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">Ms Fottrell submits her analysis is supported by cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re B, Webster </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order) </span>[2013] 2 FLR 1609. In each of these cases the child concerned had not been restored to the care of the natural family, or the natural family were not aware of the proceedings and/or the child had been placed with the adoptive parents for a considerable period of time. In those circumstances, the analysis undertaken by the court did not result in the adoption order being revoked. Whilst Ms Fottrell recognised the concern that by allowing this application to be granted it risked other similar applications, she emphasised the exceptional facts of this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">A further feature of this case which Ms Fottrell relied upon concerned identity. She submits the factual identity of A and B is being denied by operation of law. The background establishes that both A and B identify themselves as T children, they are living within the T family but by operation of law they remain tied to Mr and Mrs X, who have relinquished them. Through the child arrangement orders Ms T re-acquired parental responsibility, which she now (in so far as it is still operative) shares with Mr and Mrs X, who no longer wish to exercise it. The Article 8 issues considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Webster </span>were in a different context, they centred on the opportunity lost to the children in that case who were adopted from being brought up by their natural family. This situation is different, it centres on the disconnect between the adoption order and the child arrangements order, with the additional feature that parental responsibility under a child arrangements order ceases to operate when the child turns 18 years, yet the legal consequences of the adoption order are lifelong. As Ms Fottrell put it, both A and B are trapped by operation of law in an identity they have rejected and it has rejected them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in">The position on behalf of Mr and Mrs X is that whilst supporting the orders being revoked, they raise a number of issues that they submit the court must consider. Mr O&#8217;Sullivan and Mr Laing&#8217;s position is founded on their submission that the circumstances in which an adoption order may be revoked or set aside are limited in the <span style="font-style:italic">Webster </span>analysis to (i) a failure of natural justice, such as a natural parent not being informed (paras 152 and 160), vitiated consent (para 158) and a flawed adoption procedure (para 162); and (ii) fraud (para 155 and 160). Thereafter following consideration of the then leading authorities on article 8 ECHR at paragraphs 166 &#8211; 175, the court reached the conclusion that despite what was described as a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;substantial miscarriage of justice&#8217;</span> the adoption orders in that case could not be set aside (para 177). Mr O&#8217;Sullivan sought to characterise these situations being exceptional as a description rather than a test. </p>

Consideration of the Article 8 rights involves the court needing to balance the interests of the individuals concerned with the wider interests, including public policy considerations, albeit recognising the factual reality of this case.

Those written submissions provided the necessary focus on the relevant legal principles and their impact on the facts of this case. Importantly, she emphasised that exceptionality as described in <span style="font-style:italic">Webster</span> is not a mechanism for ruling out cases, or a straightjacket. Each case needs to be considered within the context of that threshold, test or description as it applies to the facts of that particular case, in the context of the wider issues, such as public policy. Ms Cronin emphasised the impact of an adoption order, how it changes the status of the individuals involved in many aspects of their life, which are lifelong. By way of example, she notes the observation by Mr X to Ms N of their wish not to be the point of contact for the children by the authorities which comes about from their status through the adoption order. Equally, A wished her child to be known by the T surname but that was not possible as a result of her status by virtue of the adoption order. The change in status following an adoption order has lifelong consequences, lasting well beyond an adopted child attaining the age of 18 years. </p>

The obligations under the statutory regime in certain circumstances extend beyond the age of 18 years (for example, section 23C CA 1989) and the inherent jurisdiction is sufficiently flexible to include that. To do otherwise in this case would create a perverse legal situation, where the inherent jurisdiction could assist B, but not A. At the time the application was made A was a child, the time it has taken for the application to be heard was outside the control of A. A heeded the advice at the time the child arrangements order was made in September 2019, to carefully consider the position before making any application. The extent of the inherent jurisdiction was recently considered by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">FS v RS</span> [2020] EWFC 63 at paragraphs 100 &#8211; 105 where he agreed the flexible nature of the remedy, with the need for any extension to be principled.  </p>

It is said that at the time they were placed with Mr and Mrs X, A and B were vulnerable children with complex attachment issues. The decision to arrange their adoption upset and replaced their settled routine of placement with the foster carer, where they had been for some time, and the regular contact with Ms T. The move broke the link with the natural family, including with their younger sibling, who they were aware had remained living with Ms T. The intention had been that the foster carer would play a </p>

A and B appear to have had limited outside support to help them adjust to their lost security and routine, and their very different new home. It was in this context they vented their distress and anger towards Mr and Mrs X. There was a deficit in appropriate support in what appears now, with the benefit of hindsight, to have been a poor and insensitively managed introduction and transition to Mr and Mrs X&#8217;s home. The anticipated robust post adoption support plan was not in place, with the result that Mr and Mrs X, understandably, felt let down. It appears a combination of factors may have contributed to this, including the social worker in the local authority with most knowledge of the case leaving her post about the time of the adoption, insufficient alternative arrangements being put in place and the position, possibly, being further complicated as the first three years following the adoption support was to be funded by the first local authority, although provided by the second local authority. Mr and Mrs X were inexperienced parents and unprepared for the insecurity, anger and distress felt by A and B following their removal from foster care and losing their natural family contact. The strength and persistence of those feelings over the 7 years they lived with Mr and Mrs X are apparent. Whilst Mr and Mrs X make reference to some settled and calmer times, it is acknowledged by them their relationship with A and B has permanently and irretrievably broken down. </p>

But this should be used &#8220;exceptionally&#8221;, with the focus being on ensuring natural justice; (ii) They query, as the law currently stands, whether there is a discretionary jurisdiction based on welfare; and (iii) If such a jurisdiction does exist, they identify a number of potential difficulties, one of which is that the court's inherent welfare jurisdiction is limited to children and vulnerable adults.

That cannot be right.  Just considering the consequences if it is will demonstrate the difficulties in that position. It could end up with the order being revoked for B, due to the court being able to consider her welfare, but not for A. As was observed during the hearing, that would produce a perverse result that would not sit comfortably with the underlying principles of the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction in this type of application. There is nothing in the authorities the court was referred to that limited these applications to children (the application in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> was an adult). I agree with Ms Cronin that it is too prescriptive within this jurisdiction in relation to these type of applications to say that welfare considerations simply do not apply once a person has attained the age of 18 years. As she submitted, there is provision in the CA 1989 that provides obligations on local authorities to make provision for children after they attain the age of 18 years, recognising that their welfare needs extend beyond that age. The relevance or weight to be given to welfare will depend on the circumstances of the case, but I am satisfied this court can consider, so far as it is relevant within the applicable principles in this type of application, welfare considerations. The suggestion by Mr O&#8217;Sullivan that if the court took this approach welfare would dominate the outcome, fails to properly understand the nature of the jurisdiction being exercised and, in particular, the balancing exercise that the court is required to undertake in exercising its discretion. </p>

Also, the situation in this case is different than the vulnerable adult line of cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic">DL v A Local Authority</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 253, where the inherent jurisdiction is sought to be invoked for the court to make an order to enable a vulnerable adult to maintain capacity.

Ms T supports that, she has resumed their care, her parental responsibility has been restored through the child arrangements orders and she wants the legal status between them to reflect that. Mr and Mrs X have had no contact or communication with A and B for over two and a half years. They do not suggest they should seek to retain any legal status with A and B, in fact they see positive reasons for that legal status to be extinguished.
