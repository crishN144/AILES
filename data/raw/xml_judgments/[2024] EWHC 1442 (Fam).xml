The mother&#8217;s case is that since July 2022, the father&#8217;s financial support for her and P reduced significantly to payments of &#163;400 p.m. (which she describes as sporadic).  The father accepts that he reduced the financial support to the mother, though he asserts the payments of &#163;400pm have been regularly made.  Given the reduction in financial support, N was withdrawn from private nursery/education and now attends a local state school.  It is the father&#8217;s case that the mother and he had agreed that she would live in England for a period of one year only, and that when she exceeded that period (by returning to England after an extended visit in the Czech Republic) in early 2023 without his consent he felt that he was no longer obliged to continue the previous level of financial support.  The father claims that the mother&#8217;s actions in moving with N back to England in early 2023 constituted unlawful &#8216;removal or retention&#8217; of N in England away from his place of habitual residence, but accepts that he took no steps to initiate proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.</span></p>

The father had  sent the mother a WhatsApp message, threatening to remove N from this jurisdiction to the Czech Republic.  In light of that message, the mother applied for and obtained a prohibited steps order, to prevent the threatened action.  The father accepts now that the threat was &#8220;ill-advised&#8221;, sent in &#8220;frustration&#8221; and this is something he now regretted.  HHJ Farquhar made an order preventing either party from removing N from the jurisdiction without the other party&#8217;s consent.</span></p>

The father accepts that he did indeed develop this platform.  It is agreed that in 2020 the father sold a majority (53%) interest in FP to a third party.  This is also accepted by the father.  The mother says that the sale yielded approximately &#163;34.5m to the father and refers to publicly available material in this regard; the father maintains that he is currently unable to divulge the details of the sale, and/or notably the price obtained, given the existence of a non-disclosure agreement.    He has told me that he will ask the purchaser for permission to disclose the amount into these proceedings.  He says that the monies which he did receive he has loaned &#8220;to other companies in my family&#8217;s portfolio such as RTB (working in agricultural technology), GBM (a mobile data company).

Judging by the paternal grandfather&#8217;s offer to the mother last weekend, the majority of the father&#8217;s wealth is likely to be held in offshore structures and/or by third parties.
