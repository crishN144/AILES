		  <p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.01in"> QD&#8217;s condition is specifically described in the documents as a Lewy Body Dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative dementia. </p>

The joint applicants are his adult son (&#8216;TD&#8217;) and adult daughter (&#8216;BS&#8217;), both children from his first marriage.  The First Respondent (&#8216;KD&#8217;) is QD&#8217;s second wife. QD is himself the Second Respondent and appears in these proceedings through the Official Solicitor as his litigation friend.  All parties have been ably represented; I am particularly grateful to Mr McKendrick QC and his solicitor who were instructed at very short notice.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Until early September 2019, QD was living with KD in Spain with his wife, and had been so for several years.  On or about 3 September, QD flew to this country in the company of TD and BS; this journey was made without the knowledge, let alone the agreement, of KD.   By application made on the following day the Applicants sought (and seek) a range of welfare orders concerning their father; in particular they seek an order that he reside at a care home in England (which I shall refer to as &#8216;The Pines&#8217; &#8211; a pseudonym), that he not return to Spain, and that he have only supervised contact with KD, his wife.   </p>

She further contends, as a feature of this argument, that the removal of QD from Spain was not wrongful, but was justified under the common law doctrine of necessity.  She alternatively contends that jurisdiction is established on the grounds of &#8216;urgency&#8217;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

Although the applicants&#8217; case was not specifically advanced on the basis that it may not be possible to &#8220;ascertain&#8221; QD&#8217;s habitual residence, if that were in fact my conclusion, I could exercise jurisdiction based upon his physical presence here<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">5</span>.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Alternatively, Miss Plant argues that if I were to find that QD is as a matter of fact habitually resident in Spain, I should in the circumstances invoke the inherent jurisdiction so as to enable me to make substantive orders in relation to QD, a vulnerable adult, in relation to his care, contact with others and his residence.  Ms Plant accepts that I could not use the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of QD&#8217;s liberty, but orders in that respect could be made by resort once again to the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>.  Thus, I would be, on her case, operating a hybrid jurisdiction founded in part on the inherent jurisdiction, while exercising statutory powers under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>. </p>

The position in April 2010 was that MN had been living with her niece in England and Wales on the basis that the niece was providing her with a permanent home. There is no evidence other than that MN is content and well cared for there and indeed may lose or even have lost any clear recollection of living on her own in California. In those circumstances it seems to me most probable that MN will have become habitually resident in England and Wales and this court will be required to accept and exercise a full welfare jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> pursuant to para 7(1)(a) of Sch 3.

There is, in my judgment, nothing in the <span style="font-style:italic">2005 Act</span> to displace this approach. Sections 4 and 5, after all, pre-suppose that such actions are not unlawful per se; they merely, though very importantly, elaborate what must be done and provide, if certain conditions are satisfied, a statutory defence against liability: see the important analysis of Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">G v E (Deputyship and Litigation Friend) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2010/2512" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCOP 2512" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2512 (COP)</ref>, [2010] COPLR Con Vol 470, especially paras 17-18, 56-57. </p>

That is to say, where Parliament has created a statutory scheme which is intended to be exhaustive, the common law should not go behind that scheme (<span style="font-style:italic">Black v Forsey</span> [1988] SC (HL) 28, discussed also in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span>, <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/1998/24" uk:canonical="[1998] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] UKHL 24</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] AC 458" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] AC 458</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 3 All ER 289" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 3 All ER 289</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 3 WLR 107" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 3 WLR 107</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 550" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 550</ref>; [1998] 2 FCR 501; [1998] Fam Law 592).  In essence, the terms of the statute must be looked to first to see what Parliament has considered to be the appropriate statutory code, and the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction should not be deployed so as to undermine the will of Parliament as expressed in the statute or any supplementary regulatory framework. It is my clear view that the court has power to make a range of declaratory, injunctive, and other orders, <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> where these are necessary &#8220;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">to fill the</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">gaps of law</span>&#8221; and to enhance the <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8 ECHR</span> rights of the vulnerable: see again <span style="font-style:italic">Re DL </span>at [67]. </p>

In July 2018, on a visit to England, TD and BS arranged for QD to execute a property and finance Lasting Power of Attorney (&#8216;LPA&#8217;) in their favour; this was done without the apparent knowledge of KD, who confirms that it was done &#8220;behind my back&#8221;.  A further LPA was executed in March 2019 when QD and KD visited England again.  On this visit, it is notable that KD had stayed with her adult daughter (a child from her first marriage) and grandchildren but QD did not stay there with her; arrangements were made by KD for him to stay at The Pines.   </p>

While I have no reason to question their case that they had received information which gave them concerns about QD&#8217;s welfare (and specifically the care he was receiving), it seems to me that there were options open to TD and BS other than QD&#8217;s summary removal from the jurisdiction of Spain, in circumstances for which he had no chance of being prepared.  For instance, it would have been a far more reasonable course for them to have notified the police or social services in Spain of their concerns; they could/should have raised their concerns directly with KD (however difficult this would have been), rather than perpetrate a deceit upon her by removing her husband from her care.  In short, their covert plan was not the only option available to them, nor was it, objectively viewed, a reasonable one.  Although </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, I am absolutely clear that it would not be appropriate for me to assume jurisdiction based on &#8216;urgency&#8217; (per <span style="font-style:italic">schedule 3, para.7(1)(c) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>); exercise of jurisdiction based on <span style="font-style:italic">para.7(1)(c)</span> would be justified in my view only where substantive orders are necessary in order to avert an <span style="font-style:italic">immediate threat</span> to life or safety, or where there is an <span style="font-style:italic">immediate need</span> for further or other protection.  While it is important that decisions are made in QD&#8217;s interests as soon as possible, I do not find that there is an &#8216;urgency&#8217; about the need for substantive orders.  I specifically reject Miss Plant&#8217;s argument that it is &#8216;urgent&#8217; for the court here to make substantive orders in order to beat the courts in Spain to do so. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, I am equally clear that it would not be appropriate for me to deploy the inherent jurisdiction here as a means for making substantive orders in relation to QD; there is a comprehensive and robust statutory scheme available in the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>, which covers (in <span style="font-style:italic">section 63</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">schedule 3</span>) this very issue.  To apply the inherent jurisdiction here would be to subvert the predictable and clear framework of the statute in an unprincipled way.   The flaw in Miss Plant&#8217;s argument was at least in part illustrated by the fact that she was obliged to accept that even if I assumed primary jurisdiction at common law, I would then need to revert to the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span> to deal with deprivation of liberty authorisations.   I did not consider that the short and summary judgment of Peter Jackson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Ann C</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2016/46" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCOP 46" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCOP 46</ref>, relied on by Miss Plant, is of any great assistance; in that case there was very great uncertainty about the habitual residence of P (there was &#8220;relatively little information about her current circumstances&#8221; before the court: see [6] of the judgment) and the court invoked the inherent jurisdiction at the end of a very short (15 minute) hearing to hold the ring until the Official Solicitor could undertake further enquiries.  </p>

I accept Mr McKendrick&#8217;s concluding submission that it is for the Spanish administrative or judicial authorities to determine the next step, which may of course be to confer jurisdiction on the English courts to make the relevant decision(s).   </p>
