The father of T is CB, represented by Ms Ginny Whiteley of counsel.  </p>

The local authority is represented by Mr Michael Jones of counsel.  Prior to this there were private law proceedings in respect of T concerning the father&#8217;s application for a child arrangements order, issued on 13 November 2018.  On 10 July 2019 the private law proceedings were stayed and T was made subject to an interim care order. The interim care plan provides for T to remain in the care of the mother, which he has done to date. </p>

On 14 May 2020, HHJ Forrester joined eight individuals as intervenors to these proceedings.  I discharged one of those intervenors, CR, at the last hearing.  At present, the following remain intervenors in these proceedings: </p>

Mr Ibrahim helpfully informed the court that he had also been approached by JS. but that it had not been possible to secure legal aid for him.  Mr Ibrahim made clear that JS. denies the allegations said to have been made against him, as do each of the other intervenors who have appeared at this hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Private law proceedings in respect of T commenced in 2018 when contact between the father and T ceased following the mother asserting that T had made allegations against the father, indicative of sexual abuse having taken place. With respect to the allegations said by the mother to have been made by T, these involved alleged statements by T that he had been sexually abused by his father.  The allegations were also said to encompass T&#8217;s elder half-sibling, NN.  T is also said to have made allegations concerning graphic violence and allegedly gave accounts of being exposed to bizarre actions of a sexual nature when in his father&#8217;s care. As I have noted, NN, and adults against whom T is alleged to have later made allegations, have been joined as intervenors to these proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The majority of the allegations said to have been made by T have been made to the mother alone.  T has also made limited statements to the social worker.  On 11 February 2020 he told the social worker that his father had abused him anally.  The local authority submit that it is notable that this was during a school visit to see T that the social worker was undertaking in order to share indirect contact from his father and that the mother had been made aware that this visit would be taking place when at a court hearing on 10 February 2020.  The mother disputes that she was made aware of the date of the visit.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">T also, to a limited extent, made allegations to police officers during an ABE interview.  T was the subject of three ABE interviews by the police.  The local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian submit that an objective assessment of these interviews demonstrates numerous and repeated breaches of the ABE guidance.  With respect to the substantive allegation made by T in the second ABE interview undertaken on 12 October 2018, T stated that his father touched him inappropriately.  The local authority submits that it is notable that this allegation is made immediately upon his return to the ABE interview suite, T having been allowed to leave the room for a period of three minutes, during which absence he spoke to his mother.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Within the foregoing context, it is important to note that T made no <span style="font-style:italic">direct</span> allegations either to the social worker or in his ABE interview regarding the alleged actions of any of the intervenors in this matter.  Whilst it is the case that T mentioned NN during the course of one of the ABE interviews, as Ms Bundred conceded during her submissions at this hearing, at no point does T make a<span style="font-style:italic"> direct</span> allegation of sexual abuse against RN, certain of T&#8217;s statements during the course of the ABE interview are contradictory and certain of his descriptions involve the use of dolls without an accompanying clear narrative of sexual abuse.  In addition, as I have noted, the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian submit that an objective assessment of the ABE interview in which NN was mentioned by T demonstrates numerous and repeated breaches of the ABE guidance.   </p>

Dr Tee considered that her findings, namely that perianal scars were evident, were strongly suggestive of anal abuse in the absence of other convincing history of witnessed trauma.  Dr Tee also noted a reddening of T&#8217;s penis.  The local authority invites the court to note that, with respect to the anal findings, no differential diagnosis such as constipation was considered by Dr Tee.  A subsequent report was provided by Dr Thornton within the private law proceedings.  Dr Thornton concludes that: </p>

I agree that there appears to be a deviation of the median raphe as it meets the anal margin. In my opinion this could represent a healed scar, but it could also represent a variation of normal. It was very close to the median raphe, and in my opinion it is not possible state with certainty that it was a scar, nor is it possible to exclude that it was a scar.&#8221; </p>

A further finding of fact hearing listed in May 2020 had to be adjourned as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The current situation is that T does not wish to see his father and there has been no contact between them since September 2018, save for some items of indirect contact that have passed from father to T via the social worker.

With respect to that question, on behalf of the local authority Mr Jones submits that the local authority will be actively advancing a case pursuant to its schedule of findings and, thus, the local authority&#8217;s case will be supportive of the position of each of the intervenors, namely that either (i) the mother has developed an unreasonable and false belief that T was sexually abused by the father, or (ii) the mother has deliberately fabricating false allegations of sexual abuse and inducing T to make false allegations of sexual abuse against the father. Accordingly, Mr Jones submits that the local authority&#8217;s case is, in effect, identical to that of the intervenors and that the local authority will challenge any assertions made by the mother regarding the intervenor&#8217;s denials by way of testing the evidence through cross examination and by way of submissions.

This case seems to me to demonstrate a general proposition that unless the accused adult deliberately absents himself from the proceedings, thereby inviting condemnation, it is vital that his evidence should be before the court. Unless he is made a party, that is left to the discretion of the other parties marshalling their cases. Unless he is a party, he will not be sufficiently represented and protected during the forensic process.

The overriding objective requires the court, when making case management decisions, to have regard to the need to ensure that the case is dealt with expeditiously and fairly, dealt with in a way that is proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues, in a way that ensures the parties are on an equal footing, in a way that saves expense and in a way that allots to the case an appropriate share of resources, whilst taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.

Both the parents, who are separately represented for care proceedings, and if this girl is allowed to intervene, D, will no doubt be represented on legal aid. There will be, inevitably, a proliferation of documents because, although it is suggested they should be edited and she might not get all the documents in the case, since she is crucial to the case she would have to have all the documents which concerned her. I would have little doubt that they would be at least half, if not the majority of the documents in the case. Of course, her counsel would have to have the right to examine his client in chief and to cross-examine every other witness in the proceedings. No doubt he would exercise the restraint that counsel always do, but he would have the right, where relevant, to deal with these matters in some detail. This would be an increase of the expense of these proceedings which is a relevant factor, even when one is urged (as we are in this court) to uphold the judge, whose primary task was looking at the welfare of this not yet 18-year-old girl.&#8221; </p>

In addition, having regard to the pressures currently placed on the family justice system by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am also mindful of the clear injunction at paragraph 46 of the President&#8217;s Guidance entitled &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">The Family Court and COVID 19 &#8211; The Road Ahead</span>&#8217; that parties will not be allowed to litigate every issue and present extensive oral evidence or oral submissions and that an oral hearing will encompass only that which is necessary to determine the application before the court. </p>

Rather, in this case the local authority, upon whom the burden of proving the findings its seeks rests, simply points to the denials of sexual abuse maintained by the current intervenors as supportive of a finding that either (i) the mother developed an unreasonable and false belief that T was sexually abused by the father, or (ii) the mother deliberately fabricated false allegations of sexual abuse and induced T to make false allegations of sexual abuse against the father.   </p>

In these particular circumstances, I am satisfied that the rights of each of the intervenors can be sufficiently protected in this case without them having to be maintained as intervenors putting forward individual cases, even in circumstances where the mother seeks to put allegations to them in the witness box.  I am reinforced in this view by the fact that, at all times when giving evidence the witnesses will have the protection of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 98</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Any statement or admission made by the witnesses in the course of giving evidence in these proceedings will not be admissible in evidence against that witness or his or her spouse or civil partner in proceedings for a criminal offence other than perjury.  Whilst I accept that the protection afforded by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 98</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is not absolute, prior to giving their evidence each of the witnesses can be given the relevant warning by the court.  Further, in the unlikely event of an application by the police or CPS for a transcript of the evidence of the relevant witnesses, this court retains a discretion whether to permit the disclosure of such material to the police or CPS.  Whilst it would not be appropriate to pre-judge any such application, were such an application to be made, then amongst the factors the court would have to take into account would be the fact that no findings were sought against the witnesses in question before this court, that the conclusions reached by the court regarding the witnesses&#8217; evidence do not amount to formal findings made by the court on the balance of probabilities and that, in appearing before the court the witnesses were just that, witnesses, and not interveners and represented before the court by a legal team.  In addition, during the course of their evidence, the court will, of course, remain vigilant to ensure that the proceedings remain fair for the witnesses who are required to give evidence.  In particular, the court can intervene if the counsel for the mother strays into areas of cross examination that are not appropriate having regard to the evidence before the court. </p>
