I remarked in judgment at the conclusion of the fact finding hearing that Mr B struck a poignantly sad and vulnerable figure.  It is no criticism of him to say that he never sought responsibilities of the kind that he has had to face and that objectively he could not undertake the care of Baby X.  His relationship with her is of the utmost importance to him and to Baby X and no-one suggests that the court and the other parties should do other than protect and promote that relationship so that Baby X&#8217;s welfare might be safeguarded.  Despite this, he has a propensity for violence and a history of drug abuse with custodial consequences.  Although Mr B will co-operate, an assessment would be needed if it is suggested that his contact should develop in any significant way.</p>

At an earlier stage they withdrew from the possibility of seeking to care for Baby X themselves for very understandable reasons.  Their relationship with Baby X is, like their son&#8217;s, of considerable importance.  There must be no diminution in their contact or any lessening of the importance that should be attached to their relationship and that of a paternal link and extended family for Baby X.</p>

The only meeting of minds there could ever be would be in a mutual recognition of and respect for all of those who bring their love and skills to bear in giving Baby X as high a standard of care as is possible.  I do not ask them to understand how this might be possible in the same family as the perpetrator of the harm but I do ask them to consider, and I hope eventually accept, that Ms A&#8217;s parents are capable of providing the care that Baby X needs.</p>

She seeks contact, which for the same reasons as that afforded to Mr B and his parents is of the utmost importance to her and to Baby X, but she has not sought to argue that there should be any consequence other than a care order to safeguard Baby X and she accepts the protections around her own contact which are sought by the local authority.

No-one questions the need for the local authority&#8217;s continuing involvement both as the agency which can co-ordinate the many and various facets of Baby X&#8217;s care and which will have to hold the ring between the maternal and paternal families and be the ultimate arbiter of whether Baby X as a very vulnerable young girl is adequately protected.  The threshold was found proved by the court.  Neither the paternal family nor Baby X&#8217;s mother seek day to day care.  The question which remains is whether Baby X should be cared for by her maternal grandparents or by foster carers selected and approved by the local authority under the auspices of a care order.  Although the court was asked to indicate a view, it is now common ground that in either circumstance contact orders should be made to protect and promote the contact positions I have described.</p>

With all the professional determination and skill of their employments which I am sure are a reflection of their inner capabilities, they have explained, argued and doggedly pursued their very firm belief that Baby X&#8217;s welfare would be best safeguarded by care within the family i.e. by themselves.  They have not sought to excuse or explain their daughter, indeed they do not strictly acknowledge what she did.  In contrast, they bring their own risk assessment skills to the table and argue that they are a match for the theoretical risks described by the experts which they are prepared to accept and which they have no doubt they are able to guard against.  In doing so they have argued with social care professionals and have run the risk that their controlled and controlling personalities will be viewed as too dogmatic for the task, too inflexible to be able to work with professionals and the paternal family.

She now needs the security, stability and loving environment of a primary carer rather than the expert inter disciplinary care provided by an institution, no matter how good.  Research clearly indicates that for Baby X to achieve any of the outcomes desired for a child she and her carers will have to surmount additional barriers caused by the complexity of her needs, the requirement for inter-related and co-ordinated service provision and the requirement that more than most Baby X will need very stable and predictable, committed care which is stimulating, positively child centred, replete with opportunities but more than anything else intensely nurturing.</p>

The impact of the trauma upon her is likely to have profoundly affected her capacity to deal with anxiety, fear, frustration and unpredictability.  Just one example of this is the Triangle assessment opinion, which I accept, that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Baby X needs to be held on a regular basis throughout the day, in order to support her emotional regulation and sense of safety and existence</span>&#8221;.

The issues are and have been finely balanced and no criticism attaches to the local authority for their careful appraisal and re-appraisal of the options.  Before the final evidence was tested in this hearing they preferred a specialist placement of full time foster care or a small group home and after the oral evidence of the experts had been heard and I had been invited to make observations thereon, they preferred a placement with Mr JA and Mrs SA in line with the advice of those experts.</p>

There is a potential for disagreements and conflicts which in turn could have a destabilising effect on provision of Baby X&#8217;s care.  The major need here is to look at factors associated with a positive outcome in such a high risk situation, the capacity of the parents to work together constructively with the local authority is an absolutely key role.

Given the significant suspicion and unhappiness of the relationships between the grandparents, any issues of contact and arrangements would need to be made via a third party.

This process has been tested in America and Australia but not in this jurisdiction.  Out of the experts&#8217; reports and discussions the court derived an agenda of topics which were relevant to the key issues and to which counsel were asked to contribute.  The witnesses were sworn together and the court asked each witness the same questions under each topic, taking a topic at a time.  The experts were encouraged to add or explain their own or another&#8217;s evidence so that a healthy discussion ensued, chaired by the court.

If Mr JA and Mrs SA were to break their contract with the court i.e. to go backwards in their perception and understanding by trusting their daughter without objective good reason that would present a physical risk.  The best protection is in the fullest understanding.  He agreed with Dr. Craissati that acknowledgement is not the key issue in a case where, sadly, Baby X&#8217;s capabilities are such that she will thrive off their emotional warmth and attachments but be oblivious to their understanding and language save and unless that overspills into disagreements and tensions which directly affect her care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.65in">Dr. Craissati wanted clarification of the present position of their understanding to which I have referred, but was very clear and helpful in articulating the point that in any event the risk remains &#8211; that is inherent in the facts (and by implication the perpetrator).  She stated that the acknowledgement question is frequently used by professionals for understandable and common sense reasons but addressing a risk is dependent on intellectual and emotional understanding which is a process which comes with time.  She said that it is inevitable that Mr JA and Mrs SA are on the foothills of that process.  She felt that a healthy ambivalence by Mr JA and Mrs SA towards their own daughter would be more protective than any pressure upon them to accept culpability on her part.  In essence, she said, research has shown that acknowledgement can be a red herring:  words are used that do not alter risky behaviours.  There is a need to re-visit understanding and trust from time to time to prevent complacency and that is the function of the local authority.</p>

If animosity is engendered with professional agencies or for that matter the paternal family that will not only directly harm Baby X it will damage the protective alliance.</p>

They agreed there was no likelihood of Mr JA and Mrs SA inviting mother into their house or offering unsupervised contact.  They also were of the opinion that Mr JA and Mrs SA will not breach boundaries with their daughter and place Baby X at risk.  That is important because the trigger for Ms A&#8217;s actions remains unknown.  Dr. Bass reminded the court not only is the aetiology unknown, her motives are difficult to discern and the therapy she would need to become less of a risk and more protective of her child is as yet untried and untested.  Her background as reported by her can be given little credence and such objective evidence as there is about her and her care as a child does not give rise to significant concern in respect of Mr JA and Mrs SA&#8217;s capability to care for and protect Baby X.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.65in">There is evidence before the court of Mr JA and Mrs SA being resistant to advice and instructions given by the local authority.  One classic example, now resolved, is their inability to come to a contact agreement with the local authority relating to their daughter because there were errors in the narrative even though the principles should have been readily capable of acceptance and have indeed formed the basis of an agreement now entered into.  Dr. Bentovim was able to helpfully identify the conflict engendered in them by being both an advocate for Baby X and not agreeing that her interests have always been correctly provided for by the teams who must work together.  He remains doubtful that these conflicts will always work out unless Mr JA and Mrs SA feel they have link workers to whom they can go for help.  Again, however, the process is developing and there appears to be an understanding that conflict will harm Baby X.</p>

Mr JA and Mrs SA are educated risk assessors who need to be able to rationally discuss the issues which arise.  That is in contrast to a parent whose psychopathology engenders conflict.  Having said this children with the level of disability which Baby X possesses need highly structured professional co-operation.  Dr. Bass said he would feel more sanguine if Mr JA and Mrs SA displayed more openly their understanding of the complexity of the provision which will be needed for Baby X.</p>

Her caring adults should be the same people not a sequence of well trained professionals.  Whereas Mr JA and Mrs SA can provide Baby X with that consistency and care, a professional placement would be subject to the vagaries of impermanence.  The local authority might be lucky in identifying people who remain consistent in Baby X&#8217;s life and who have the skills of Mr JA and Mrs SA and a co-operative attitude to inter-disciplinary care.  They might not.</p>

She is extremely sensitive to change not least because the quality of human responses to her provide her key motivation.</p>
