K has an older sister (L) who is just 16 years old, and is not the subject of these applications.   The mother contends that the children&#8217;s father (&#8220;the father&#8221;) wrongfully removed K from Russia on 4 July 2019, or in the alternative has wrongfully retained K away from Russia in either late-August, September, or October 2019.

The father, although travelling extensively for business at that time, joined them in London for periods of time.  During this period, the mother asserts that she and the children frequently travelled to Russia, in part to see the paternal and maternal extended family. In 2017, the parties entered into a nuptial agreement in Russia which provided for the transfer of the property in London and a property in Russia to the mother.  Divorce proceedings followed; the father issued proceedings in Russia and the mother in England.  The jurisdictional conflict was effectively resolved when the Russian court pronounced the decree on 23 October 2017 which was made final in February 2018.  </p>

On her arrival in Russia, she was arrested and subsequently charged with an offence of bribery of an official &#8220;on a large scale&#8221;; specifically it was alleged that she had attempted to suborn a police officer (with US$10,000) to bring a criminal case against the father.  She was remanded in custody in a pre-trial detention centre.  The father, who had been in Russia at the time, travelled to London to care for the children, and rented a flat in Hampstead for the following three months.  At that time, he was reliant on a tourist visa, and otherwise dependent on the status of the mother who had the greater security of a Tier 1 investor visa.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In June 2018, the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> proceedings were listed before District Judge (DJ) Gibson for final hearing; the mother was still in custody in Russia and not able to attend in person.  She applied (through solicitors, instructing Mr Harrison QC) for an adjournment.  This was in fact the second such application.  The application failed, and the mother&#8217;s lawyers withdrew.   The case proceeded.  DJ Gibson heard evidence from the father, from an independent social worker, Ms Cathy King, and an immigration expert.  Ms King provided significant evidence to the court; she had prepared three reports, having met with the children and parents in England and in Russia.  She raised a number of serious concerns about the wellbeing of the children.  I have read those detailed reports: for present purposes, it is sufficient to record (as Ms Demery, Family Court Adviser in these proceedings, says in her report to this court) that Ms King was &#8220;critical of both parents. Both children appeared to have been drawn into the parental conflict following their parents&#8217; separation. [K] did not speak with much affection about either parent&#8221;.  Ms King had also made clear in her report that the father intended to return to Russia (the &#8220;father cannot reside in this country because of work commitments in Russia&#8221;); she reflected in the first of her three reports (which had been filed before the mother&#8217;s arrest) that it was the mother&#8217;s intention to return to Russia herself if the father was successful in his application before the English Court.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">DJ Gibson ruled on the cross-applications.  She found that the children were thriving in the recent care of the father, and her order, dated 17 July 2018, provided for the children to live with him.  He was granted permission to remove the children permanently to live in the Russian Federation with effect from 28 July 2018.  The judge gave a fully reasoned and detailed judgment; it is material to highlight three of the judge&#8217;s findings: </p>

I do not regard this forecast as binding on me, but it provides some further illumination on how the court had viewed the father&#8217;s intentions for the permanent relocation of K in Russia at that time. </p>

The judge nonetheless made critical findings about her; these findings related both to her treatment of the two children, and in the way in which she had litigated in the English courts; the judge referred to occasions when the mother had demonstrably misled the court; the judge further referred to the mother&#8217;s &#8220;calculated deceit&#8221; in her evidence about the whereabouts of birth certificates and associated documents (&#8220;this was not spur of the moment lying&#8221;).  Despite these findings, the judge made orders for extensive contact, including staying contact for half of each holidays, between the children and their mother.  The order further provided for K to attend a named school/Academic Gymnasium in St Petersburg from September 2018 and (by consent) for L to attend a named private boarding school in England.    </p>

Notwithstanding her plea, it is the mother&#8217;s case now that the father orchestrated the allegation of bribery, and she asserts and maintains her innocence of the charge.  In 2019 she mounted an appeal, and on 21 August 2019 her charge was reduced to attempted bribery and she was immediately released from prison.  Under the terms of the revised sentence the mother is due to be recalled to prison when K is 14 years old; she continues to live in St Petersburg. </p>

There is limited evidence before the court that the father took any steps to advance that plan either during the autumn of 2018 or indeed during the first six months of 2019.

He further refers to DJ Gibson&#8217;s critical finding about the mother having misled the court, and her &#8220;calculated deceit&#8221; in 2018 (see [14] above).  He raised questions about her candour with the Russian courts in relation to her appeal in 2019; although I make no finding about this, it is a point not entirely borne out by examination of the documents to which my attention was focused.

She asserts that Russia was to be, and did indeed become, the centre of K&#8217;s life; he lived there, and he attended school there.  She maintains that the fact that he was apparently unsettled in school in Russia in the autumn of 2018 is not at all surprising given the recent upheavals in his life, and is not indicative that he had not settled in Russia.  As a secondary position, she argues that even if the acquisition of habitual residence was not as immediate as claimed, by the summer of 2019, K had acquired a sufficient degree of integration in Russia (given his school, his home, the presence of extended family) to support a finding that he was habitually resident there. </p>

He further maintains that K never settled in Russia, and therefore never lost his habitual residence in England.  Mr Turner QC contends that the only credible reason why the father would return to this country in the summer of 2019 was because K was not settling in Russia; he invites me to reject the mother&#8217;s case that they fled Russia to frustrate efforts which the mother may make to have contact with the children. </p>

As DJ Gibson found only days before their departure in 2018 &#8220;These are Russian children ... Russia is their home country by both birth and early upbringing&#8221;; it was, in her view, where their ethnic and cultural needs would be best met (see [12] above).  I have little objective evidence about K&#8217;s life in Russia.  I know that he resided in his father&#8217;s sizeable dacha outside St Petersburg with his father, his father&#8217;s partner, and his new-born half-brother.  K attended school in the city.

It is material to my assessment of the respective merits of each party&#8217;s case that even though the father claims that by December 2018 he was considering returning to England, because of K&#8217;s apparent unhappiness, the father took no significant steps in that regard until after he had actually left the Russian Federation in July 2018.  He exhibited to his witness statement the results of property searches undertaken in the spring (April/May) of 2019, which lent some weight to his case (though I note that the father has owned a property in London since 2007 while not living here, so purchasing property did not mean relocating here), and correspondence with an immigration solicitor (&#8220;[the father] would like to discuss his moving to the UK on invest visa basis. He used to have one, but it was cancelled in 2017 due to his divorce&#8221;), but this evidence was in my judgment counter-balanced by his e-mail to the London Prep School.

"Rights of custody" within the convention are broader than an order of the court and parents have rights in respect of their children without the need to have them declared by the court or defined by court order. These rights under the Convention have been liberally interpreted in English law.&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added). </p>

States&#8217; laws differ widely in how they look upon parental rights. They may regard the whole bundle of rights and responsibilities which the law attributes to parents as a cake which can be sliced up between the parents: one parent having the custody slice, with the package of rights which that entails, and the other having the access slice, with the different package of rights which that entails. This is by no means an unusual way of looking at the matter. Alternatively, the state may regard the whole bundle of parental rights and responsibilities as inhering, and continuing to inhere, in both parents save to the extent that they are removed or qualified by the necessary effect of a court order or an enforceable agreement between them&#8221; </p>

Within this context, it is important again to bear in mind that Art 13(b) looks to the situation as it would be if the child were returned forthwith to his or her home country and that the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to ensure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when he or she gets home.

However, given that [K] has not seen his mother for over two years, the instability he has experienced in his care arrangements and his expressed views about his mother, it would be difficult for him to move directly to his mother&#8217;s care if this court orders his return. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">It would be advisable that he initially stayed with</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">another family member while a welfare assessment of him</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and his mother is undertaken</span>.&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added). </p>

The mother, importantly, does not seek to impose herself on K by having contact with him, nor does she seek his immediate care.  It is likely that there will be schooling available for K; as mentioned above, I note that the father had taken steps to preserve K&#8217;s place at the Gymnasium in St Petersburg, perhaps not a step he would have taken if he had thought that K&#8217;s return would cause him grave psychological harm. </p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child&#8217;s views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically her own&#8221; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances&#8221;. </p>

The report from Ms King prepared in April 2018 reveals that at that time, K thought it would be &#8220;nice&#8221; to live close to his extended family in Russia; he spoke of liking his paternal aunt &#8220;a lot&#8221;; he identified with his Russian heritage, and spoke fondly of his maternal grandmother (K described her to Ms King as &#8220;the world&#8217;s greatest baker&#8221;) and paternal extended family.

		  <p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> For example, K told Ms Demery that his mother had &#8220;asked his father for a million pounds and that she wanted all his father&#8217;s money, or she said she would take away his children.

		</authorialNote>.   The &#8216;adult sharing of information&#8217; is, in my judgment, the likely explanation for K&#8217;s volunteering to Ms Demery of misleading information on a number of topics: his half-siblings; his denial that his father has a girlfriend (notwithstanding that the school refers to her); his description of St. Kitts and Nevis as his &#8220;motherland&#8221;, whereas the family have limited links with the country, and he had only visited it twice.

She was K&#8217;s primary carer until 2018, and now has no relationship with him. Two years ago, DJ Gibson considered that, in spite of the mother&#8217;s faults, K should spend half of each school holidays with her.  This is an order which has not been implemented through changed circumstances, and as Mr Turner accepted, K is now &#8216;alienated&#8217; from his mother.  There is reason to conclude (as Ms Demery suggests) that the father has infected K&#8217;s view of his mother by sharing adult information with K inappropriately.  I accept Mr Harrison&#8217;s submission that the prospects of repairing the relationship are poor while the mother and K are living in different countries.  It cannot be repaired through telephone or Skype contact but will require them to experience regular face-to-face contact which is more likely to be achieved in Russia.    </p>

Materially, he added that &#8220;she is nice and a good member of our family.&#8221;   Some of these comments chime with the earlier (2018) remarks reported in the first reports of Ms King (see [91] above).  These wider family relationships are often of importance to a young person whose parents are locked in post-relationship hostility; at present K is denied ready access to these relationships.  </p>

By contrast, the Russian Court is well advanced in its welfare enquiry; it has rejected a challenge to its jurisdiction; it has received already two professional welfare reports, and the report of Ms King; it has commissioned a psychological assessment of the family.  The father has long-standing and deep connections with Russia which is his natural home; he has lavish homes and successful businesses there; his wider family and the mother&#8217;s wider family are there; although L is educated in England, K has no other family or extended family in England. </p>

Moreover, this family live a truly international life, and the children have developed connections to at least three countries.

He suggests that this is a &#8220;paradigm case&#8221; for a stay or suspension given that the Russian court is already seised of the process, and has rejected the mother&#8217;s claim for an interim order that K lives with her.  I respectfully disagree.  I would be failing in my obligations under the Convention if I suspended or stayed the outcome in such a way as to thwart its purpose i.e. to &#8220;order the return of the child forthwith&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Article 12</span>). I agree with MacDonald J that the power to order a stay should only be exercised &#8220;in exceptional circumstances&#8221;, and those do not exist here. I am pleased to note that the Russian Court is seised of the process; this will, I hope, accelerate the final resolution of any welfare-based application. </p>

Her appeal against sentence was allowed in part on 21 August 2019.  In respect of this process, I have seen a number of relevant documents including but not limited to: </p>
