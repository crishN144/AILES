For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that the respondent has made out this exception and I will therefore order the child&#8217;s return to New Zealand pursuant to the Convention.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parents met in New Zealand in or around May 2021 and began a relationship.  Very soon afterwards the mother became pregnant.  There were difficulties in the relationship and in October 2021 the mother returned to the UK.  In March 2022 the father and the paternal grandmother travelled to the UK for the child&#8217;s birth.  The child was born in the UK and the father and the paternal grandmother returned to New Zealand in late April 2022.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parties decided to give their relationship a further chance (the mother describes it as &#8220;one last try&#8221;) and in June 2022 and the mother and child travelled to New Zealand.  The mother initially entered New Zealand on a tourist visa, applying for a work visa based upon her partnership with the father after her arrival in the country.  They moved back in together, although within a short period of time there were tensions in the relationship, the mother describing the father as being financially abusive.  As I will explain later in this judgment, the mother had four sessions of counselling in July and August 2022 in which she described herself as having &#8220;very little control over things&#8221; and &#8220;constantly unhappy&#8221;.</p>

Apart from a short visit to stay with the father, the mother and child remained at the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home until July 2023.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In July 2023 the mother and child returned to the UK.  They did so with the consent of the father, who agreed to the child travelling to the UK for a holiday until September 2023.  In her witness statement the mother accepts that at the time that she left New Zealand she had every intention of returning at the end of the trip.  However, as the date for return approached, the mother became increasingly concerned about doing so, and about the financial position that she and the child would face in New Zealand.  Eventually she stopped communicating directly with the father, using her stepfather as a conduit.  The mother and child did not return to New Zealand as planned and on 12 September the mother received a letter from New Zealand lawyers acting for the father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 27 September the mother, acting through New Zealand lawyers, issued an application before the New Zealand court for permission to permanently relocate with the child to the UK.   Those proceedings were subsequently adjourned pending the father&#8217;s application under the Convention to this court which was issued on 6 December 2023.  There is a direction in the New Zealand proceedings that in the event I order the child&#8217;s return, the father is to file a response in those proceedings within 10 days of my decision.</p>

Where the risk is serious enough the court will be concerned not only with the child's immediate future because the need for protection may persist.</p>

Within the context of this tension between the need to evaluate the evidence against the civil standard of proof and the summary nature of the proceedings, the Supreme Court further made clear that the approach to be adopted in respect of the harm defence is not one that demands the court engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the matters alleged as grounding the defence under Art 13(b). Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified.</p>

No doubt a court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk; and will, among other things, ask itself whether they can be dispelled. But in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span> it was this court's clear view that such anxieties could in principle found the defence. Thus, at para 34, it recorded, with approval, a concession by Mr Turner QC, who was counsel for the father in that case, that, if there was a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, &#8220;the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events lead to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child&#8221;. Furthermore, when, at para 49, the court turned its attention to the facts of that case, it said that it found:</p>

The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned. It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned.&#8221;</p>

However, as a UK national she is entitled to enter New Zealand without a visa as a tourist for a period not exceeding 6 months in any 12-month period.  She would not be entitled to work or receive publicly funded healthcare and would need to demonstrate that she had sufficient funds to meet her accommodation and maintenance costs (approximately $1,000 NZ per month of stay).

Ms Strickett described the mother&#8217;s prospects of obtaining such a visa as &#8220;challenging&#8221;.  The mother does not have any tertiary educational qualifications and her existing work experience is lower skilled.  The current economic outlook in New Zealand has cooled which means that there is less demand for overseas labour to fill these less skilled roles.

Treatment can include psychotherapy (including counselling, problem-solving and cognitive behavioural therapy) and medication.  The mother has previously been prescribed propranolol, but the continued use of drugs during pregnancy is something which would need to be carefully assessed.</p>

Indeed he considered that if the mother remained in England she would probably not need any treatment.  However, overall Dr Gamble was clear that he considered that the mother was a person of some resilience who had previously shown a capacity for independence and who had &#8220;a great deal of strength&#8221; in her character.  Whilst he recognised that a return to New Zealand had the potential to impose stresses upon the mother in a number of ways (for example if she was unable to obtain a visa, or was without suitable accommodation), his evidence was that he did not consider that there was an imminent risk of the stresses on the mother leading to a deterioration in her capacity to parent PZ.  Whilst he did not rule this out as a possibility, he felt that in order for this to arise it was necessary to imagine a &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; where everything had gone wrong.  </p>

In my view this is clearly sufficient time for the mother&#8217;s application before the New Zealand court to relocate to be properly considered by that court.  The New Zealand court is already seized of proceedings and by its orders to date (which require steps to be taken within 10 days of any decision of this court to order a return) it has made clear an intention to progress that application expeditiously.</p>

I consider that this is a matter for the New Zealand court to consider as part of the overall welfare assessment which it will need to perform within the relocation application.  It does not assist the mother in establishing a defence to a return order under Art 13(b). </p>

The father has offered a lump sum payment of $22,500 NZ (of which part is to be made available for a deposit for accommodation before the mother leaves the UK).  The mother has estimated that weekly rental costs will be between $590 and $750 NZ.  Adopting a mean figure of $670 NZ, would mean that the cost of accommodation for a six-month period would be $17,420 NZ.  This would leave a balance of around $5,000 NZ which could be used by the mother to supplement her maintenance or take steps to apply for a further visa should her application to relocate be refused.</p>

Even taken at its highest, I do not consider that the father&#8217;s alleged past behaviour would suffice to ground an Art. 13b defence.  In any event any risk in this regard is ameliorated by the protective measures that have been proposed.  On a return the mother and child will not be living with the father and the father is willing to provide undertakings (to be incorporated into an enforceable court order in New Zealand) not to threaten or use any physical violence against the mother or child and not to threaten, harass or pester the mother or child or come within 200 yards of their apartment.  I am satisfied that such an undertaking removes any risk to the mother and child from this source.  The undertaking not to bring PZ into contact with the father&#8217;s step grandfather also addresses any concern that might otherwise arise from the unconnected allegations that have been made about this individual.</p>

The reality of contested litigation means that it would be unreasonable to expect her to rely for emotional support upon the paternal family.  Nonetheless, there is evidence that she made some friends in her past stay in New Zealand, and she will be returning to a country with which she has some familiarity and there will be (as Dr Gamble has suggested) opportunities to join social groups and meet other parents with young children.</p>

Dr Gamble was clear in his evidence that although the stresses that will be experienced by the mother in New Zealand will be greater than those experienced if she remains in England, her ability to cope should &#8220;not be underestimated&#8221;.  Dr Gamble&#8217;s conclusion was that it was not likely that the mother&#8217;s ability to parent PZ would deteriorate to the point where she was at risk of harm, and for such a scenario to come about &#8220;everything would have to go wrong&#8221;.  </p>

As I have set out above, I am satisfied that on a return to New Zealand the mother will have an entitlement to stay for a minimum period of six months, which will be long enough for her relocation application to be determined.  She will be provided by the father with sufficient funds to accommodate and maintain herself and PZ.  She will have access to appropriate healthcare whilst in New Zealand.  Whilst previously living there she has been able to access counselling and medication for her anxiety.  The father&#8217;s proposed protective measures will ensure that she has access to weekly counsellor sessions; bi-weekly GP appointments and the costs of medication for any mental health issues for a 6-month period.</p>

However, in the light of Dr Gamble&#8217;s evidence and the protective measures that will be in place to ensure that other potential sources of stress and anxiety are ameliorated, I do not consider that this factor (either on its own or in conjunction with the other factors identified on behalf of the mother) means that it is likely that there is a grave risk that the child&#8217;s return would expose her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation.</p>

That is a decision which will fall to be taken by the courts of New Zealand in due course.</p>

There was dispute at the Bar as to the time period which I should allow for the mother and child to return in this case.  For the father, Ms Guha urged me to impose a short, 21-day, period for the return.  For the mother Mr Crosthwaite argued that I should recognise the effect that a forced return (and the inevitable lack of agency) would have on the mother and argued that it would be particularly stressful on the mother if she had to undergo a termination in New Zealand.  He therefore sought a minimum period of 12 weeks for the return to take place.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Given the very specific circumstances in which the mother finds herself, I consider that a 21-day return order would not give her sufficient time to reflect upon the outcome of this case and to make decisions in relation to the important matters now facing her.  A longer period will also ensure that she has adequate time to research and put in place accommodation for her return. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the 12-week period sought by Mr Crosthwaite is simply not consistent with the obligation under the Convention should be &#8220;forthwith&#8221;.  I have therefore concluded that I should give the mother a period of approximately six weeks from the date of this judgment before she is required to depart the UK.  I will therefore order that the return should be effected by 23.59pm on 21 April 2024 (New Zealand time).</p>
