In relation to No11 the issue is as to whether this is property in respect of which RH has a beneficial interest or whether it is the property of SB in its entirety and falls outside of the matrimonial acquest.</span></p>

A dispute with a third party must be approached on exactly the same legal basis as if it were being determined in the Chancery Division. It was essential, where a dispute arose in financial relief proceedings about the ownership of property which involved a third party, that the third party should be joined to the proceedings at the earliest opportunity; that directions should be given for the issue to be fully pleaded by points of claim and points of defence; that separate witness statements should be directed in relation to the dispute and the dispute should be heard separately as a preliminary issue before the financial dispute resolution hearing</span></p>

The key question for me is as to the intentions of the relevant actors at points of legal change of ownership and as to what this tells me as to the current beneficial interests held by RH in either property. It is important to bear in mind that it is for AW to prove the case she makes and not for the third parties to disprove her allegations. She bears the burden of proof and will discharge this if she establishes an event on balance of probability (being more likely than not). All the evidence is valuable in assessing whether this test has been met. </span></p>

The understanding of what took place is now shaped in the context of a matrimonial dispute in which AW is asserting claims against other family members. The combination of these family relationships; the dynamic arising out of the same; the conflicted interests and the passage of time mean the Court will naturally approach any fact finding with care and with an eye on available independent evidence.</span></p>

He acts via the office of the Official Solicitor and it is accepted he lacks litigation capacity. The parties obtained expert evidence as to his cognitive ability and this evidence suggested he would not be able to engage with the process of giving evidence. This was not challenged and so I simply have a position document taken from him on behalf of the Official Solicitor which supports the position taken by the third parties. He was supported by an intermediary. This naturally has impact on the weight I can attach to his case which is contained on instructions set out within a position document. I formed the view limited weight should be placed on this and I have been wary to adopt the position save where it is otherwise supported by my findings.</span></p>

I have treated her evidence with care but not rejected it.

AW&#8217;s, which I accept, is of collecting the rent and paying the same into a joint account (held in the name of the RH and PT from which the mortgage was paid). Later she was worried as to whether this was being used to pay the mortgage and started to withold the rent collected. I accept this evidence. This may have been the point at which the relationship broke down. It is not dated in her statement but the sense is of it being sometime after 2014. As with other dates in this case it was difficult to obtain satisfactory clarity. I note counsel for the third parties submits this was no later than 2017. I agree that it probably the latest time for the separation &#8211; given the divorce issued in that year - with the earliest likely date being sometime around mid-2014.</span></p>

She detailed her account of the separation of the parties and her case as to having made substantial contributions to No22 in both 2013 and 2019 by funding improvements. She accepted she could not provide any documents in support of the same and when questioned agreed a significant part of the expenditure in question had in fact come from the rental received rather than separately from herself. However, her direct contribution from savings could be measured at around &#163;20,000. It was suggested this did not fit with her income levels at the time but she did not agree. She agreed she had made no contributions to the purchase of No22 and it was purchased before she married RH. She agreed the rent paid the mortgage and that she had stopped passing this over when issues arose between her and RH. There had been no discussions with her at the time of the 2009 remortgage although she knew there had been issues between her mother-in-law and an ex-wife. She agreed she had not been involved with the purchase of No11 but RH had told her he was a joint owner of the property. She had expressed opposition to the remortgage in 2013 and this has upset SB. She explained a lack of supporting documents on the basis that her bank did not hold records going back to 2013 but could not explain why documents had not been obtained with respect to the 2019 improvements. It should be noted there is no fundamental dispute the improvements were carried out, or that the same were at least in part funded by rental monies. The dispute is as to whether there was a direct contribution from AW.</span></p>

She explained she wanted to be on the title as she wanted protection given she was on the mortgage. She agreed the mortgage had been paid from the rent although she had had no direct involvement in this process although it was paid at times through a joint account set up in the name of her and RH. Her only contribution was putting herself on the mortgage. She accepted when questioned by counsel that she had not been put on the title to have an interest in the property but rather to provide her with protection. Although in written evidence she claimed to have made direct mortgage payments from her own funds when AW withheld rent she confirmed she had not done this in live evidence. She was aware of the works undertaken on the property as she would visit the family but no-one had sought her permission for this to be done and she had not been involved with the same.

This is not a task to be lightly embarked upon. In family disputes, strong feelings are aroused when couples split up. These often lead the parties, honestly but mistakenly, to reinterpret the past in self-exculpatory or vengeful terms. They also lead people to spend far more on the legal battle than is warranted by the sums actually at stake. A full examination of the facts is likely to involve disproportionate costs. In joint names cases it is also unlikely to lead to a different result unless the facts are very unusual. Nor may disputes be confined to the parties themselves. People with an interest in the deceased's estate may well wish to assert that he had a beneficial tenancy in common. It cannot be the case that all the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of transfers into joint names using the old forms are vulnerable to challenge in the courts simply because it is likely that the owners contributed unequally to their purchase.</span></p>

Each case will turn on its own facts. Many more factors than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties' true intentions. These include: any advice or discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their intentions then; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names; the reasons why (if it be the case) the survivor was authorised to give a receipt for the capital moneys; the purpose for which the home was acquired; the nature of the parties' relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both initially and subsequently; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged the outgoings on the property and their other household expenses. When a couple are joint owners of the home and jointly liable for the mortgage, the inferences to be drawn from who pays for what may be very different from the inferences to be drawn when only one is owner of the home. The arithmetical calculation of how much was paid by each is also likely to be less important. It will be easier to draw the inference that they intended that each should contribute as much to the household as they reasonably could and that they would share the eventual benefit or burden equally. The parties' individual characters and personalities may also be a factor in deciding where their true intentions lay. In the cohabitation context, mercenary considerations may be more to the fore than they would be in marriage, but it should not be assumed that they always take pride of place over natural love and affection. At the end of the day, having taken all this into account, cases in which the joint legal owners are to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests will be very unusual.</span></p>

I find RH is solely beneficially entitled to the property. The change in 2009 was solely to provide PT with a safety measure in the event of future problems in that it would provide a financial guard against a later claim made against her on the mortgage. In reaching this conclusion I have regard to the following matters:</span></p>

It strikes me as most unlikely the parties (who were family members) would not have at least considered the implications for RH of this outcome given it was his only property (on his case) and given PT had her own property. I am not determining this case on a fairness basis and parties can of course largely agree whatever terms they wish for but this is distinct from an evidential gap arising in circumstances where the obvious objective unfairness of an outcome would have called for some level of discussion and yet none was had. The absence of the same is supportive of the notion that no unfairness was intended or expected and that no intention to share was expected or intended.</span></p>

The purpose was to compromise a claim against a property which was not owned by RH but appears to have been owned by PT&#8217;s and RH&#8217;s mother. They had at least a mutual interest in this regard (as would SB who was particularly involved given it was his ex-wife making the claim). I struggle to see this as anything other than a step aimed to protect the mother and hence in a broad sense the family. I do not accept that this would have been funded effectively from RH&#8217;s equity (as it was) and at the same time he would have lost half of the remaining equity to his sister to enable the same. Whilst the fact he was sharing occupation of the property might explain the former it really does not explain both.</span></p>

All of this speaks of a party who (as she said) simply wanted to protect herself against claims against her without having any interest in the property.</span></p>

It is somewhat surprising that this case has proceeded to a trial on this issue given the concessions made by PT at final hearing. It is clear to me the transfer in 2009 cannot be said to have been undertaken to defeat a future claim of AW but I fear the fact of this transaction has been allowed to be misused to later minimise the exposure of RH to AW&#8217;s claims. That the case fell apart on such gentle probing supports this view.</span></p>

So in the case of No22 I am asked to diminish the significance of PT being joined to the title and to focus on the lack of contributions made by her other than being on the mortgage. Yet in the case of No11 the opposite holds with RH also making no contribution aside from being on the mortgage such as to obtain interest relief. The only difference is as to timing between the two.</span></p>
