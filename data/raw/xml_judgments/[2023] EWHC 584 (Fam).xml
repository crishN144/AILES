	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This judgment follows a final hearing in proceedings under the Hague Convention 1980, within which a mother, has applied for a summary return to Spain of her daughter E aged 5 years She has a sister, R, who was born in May 2022, and is cared for by the mother. She is not the subject of these proceedings.</span></p>

He has appeared before me in person, although he is represented in concurrent Spanish proceedings which I will deal with later in this judgment.

Although the father has raised issues of consent in response to this application, neither party invited me to hear oral evidence under oath. I have received and read much of a full bundle of documents which extends to nearly 500 pages, in which are contained 2 statements from each party. I have heard oral submissions from the father, and from Mr Basi.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Aside from raising the issue of consent, the principal defence on which the father relied before me was that E was not in fact habitually resident in Spain on the date when he accepts that he travelled with her from that country to England, taking her from the care of her mother. That date was 30 November 2022. </span></p>

The father relies on the accepted history that, until June 2022, E had been habitually resident in England, and his case is essentially that her connections here were and have remained sufficiently strong to outweigh any connections which she may have made in Spain between June and November 2022, and that consequently, she never lost her habitual residence here. His case that she remained habitually resident in England throughout 2022 is supported, he says, by the fact that he himself contacted ICACU in September 2022 and alleged that E&#8217;s retention by her mother in Spain was in fact wrongful under the terms of the convention. Once he had brought her back to England at the end of November 2022, he gave notice in December to withdraw those proceedings.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">He also sought to argue that E&#8217;s strong connections with England now militate in favour of not making an immediate return order, but rather a delay until the end of the current school year in June 2023. If I do find that E was habitually resident in Spain immediately prior to her removal last November, however, and that a return order is merited, that question is one which should properly be considered by the court in Spain, which is already seised of issues relating to her welfare, with the father&#8217;s involvement as I will explain. The father has already agreed in those proceedings to an immediate return and to agreed arrangements for contact with E over that period.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The father also stated that E&#8217;s current connections with England were much stronger than those currently in Spain, where she had only been in school between late September and the end of November. However, the question for the court on an application such as this, where the removal took place less than 12 months ago, is not as to E&#8217;s current habitual residence, but rather as to where she was habitually resident immediately before her removal from Spain.</span></p>

That the father was to oppose this application was by no means clear up to the start of the hearing before me. On 7 March 2023 &#8211; 2 days prior to the date of this hearing &#8211; another hearing had taken place in Spain in proceedings initiated by the mother, at which the father and mother were both represented by Spanish lawyers. I received a translated copy of the Spanish order, which is expressed to be temporary, or interim. The key elements of its translated contents are set out as follow:</span></p>

The father would pay 300 euros for each child per month as maintenance allowance in favour of his children and half of the extraordinary expenses</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Given that the child E is currently residing in England with her father, the parties agreed that the father was going to hand in the child to her mother on the third week of March of this year. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">So, it was clear that in the Spanish proceedings the father had not only agreed, through his solicitor, to accept the jurisdiction of the Spanish court to make orders in respect of E, but had also agreed that there should be a custody order in favour of her mother, and that he would return her to the mother in the third week of March. He further consented to provision making arrangements for him to see both children after that had happened up to June of this year &#8211; the month to which he has now suggested to me that E&#8217;s return to Spain should be delayed &#8211; and then beyond into 2024.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">When I asked him how he justified this dramatic change of stance, he told me that significant pressure had been applied by the judge in Spain, indicating to his solicitor that no order would be made there which separated the two sisters, whereupon he said the terms of this agreement were negotiated and arrived at. Before me, he nevertheless questioned whether the Spanish court should have jurisdiction at all over E. I asked him whether he would seek to appeal or set aside the order in those circumstances, and he told me that he would only consider whether to make such application after the conclusion of this hearing. I therefore will treat the Spanish order as un-appealed.</span></p>

I remind myself that the father&#8217;s involvement in these plans, whilst relevant, is not an essential element in E&#8217;s integration. The mother was told that E would not be able to start at school in Spain until the following September, so it was agreed between the parents that she would stay in Spain to give birth, but that E would return to England to commence the school summer term with the father.</span></p>

Through this, E was registered at a bilingual English-Spanish school. From 12 August 2022, E had a Spanish ID card with her address. From 23 September she began to attend the school in Spain.

Within a few days, the tensions in the relationship between mother and father had already reached a head, with the father taking serious issue with the children&#8217;s maternal grandparents after an incident on 23 August. This led to court proceedings, which came to a hearing on 29 August 2022.

Notwithstanding his apparent unhappiness, there can be little doubt that as the autumn progressed, E&#8217;s integration into Spanish life continued. The mother describes swimming and Karate classes, and lists an array of cousins and friends with whom she had regular contact. Whilst the absence of the father must have been unsettling for her, and the many ties and friendships that she had doubtless left in England in June would have been easy to pick up again, by late November E had been in Spain for nearly 6 months.</span></p>

There is no issue but that the mother was exercising rights of custody over E prior to that removal, and the removal must therefore be considered to have been wrongful under Article 3. I must therefore order that E be returned to Spain forthwith. </span></p>

The parties then came to an agreement that the return would take place in the third week of March 2023, and I see no good reason why that agreement should not be fulfilled. I will therefore direct that E must be made available to be returned to Spain by no later than 22 March 2023, 12 days hence.</span></p>

Given all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that that is wholly appropriate and in E&#8217;s best interests and I will so direct.</span></p>
