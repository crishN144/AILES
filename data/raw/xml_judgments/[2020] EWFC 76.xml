The Court first made Interim Care Orders on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 which have continued to be renewed. The children have remained with their mother under the aegis of the Interim Orders. A fact-finding hearing was scheduled to be heard in May 2020 but was adjourned in consequence of the restrictions required by the public health crisis. The hearing was adjourned until 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020. It has been conducted as a Hybrid hearing, by which is meant that some of the witnesses have given evidence via a video conferencing platform whilst some have attended in person and spoken from the witness box. The children&#8217;s father and his legal team have been in court throughout as have the Local Authority&#8217;s. The Guardian, who was &#8216;shielding&#8217; for much of the case, has attended remotely and her lawyers have attended court as and when they considered it necessary to do so. The mother and her lawyers have also alternated between attending court and joining via video conferencing platform.</p>

The court is sizeable. It can accommodate 18 people under the regulations, though no more than 14 have ever been present. Court staff have been vigilant to ensure rigorous hygiene standards. I should like to pay tribute to them not merely for their considerable efforts but also for creating an environment in which all involved have felt comfortable and safe.

In response to a 999 call, made by the father, at 19:39, an ambulance arrived at 19:45. Paramedics identified that infant N (the youngest of the siblings with whom I am concerned) was pale, unresponsive showing poor respiratory effort. The paramedics commenced bag valve mask resuscitation. A second crew arrived minutes later and established the closest hospital as X Hospital. N&#8217;s airway was secured with a laryngeal mask airway and monitored. N&#8217;s heart rate began to drop and he went in to cardiac arrest. Intra osseous access was gained to establish a drug route and three cycles of adrenalin were administered along with Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This was all in accordance with Advanced </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">N&#8217;s breaths. The interval is disturbing to listen to and resulted in the operator immediately instructing F on the mechanics of CPR. It is important to note that F now denies that he was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;going to get a towel&#8221;</span> at the point he claims that N fell. He accepts, as he is bound to, given the recording, that he said this during the course of the call, but he is at a loss to understand why he should have said it. He attributes this error to his general distress at the time. Experience reveals that the first account of an injury may be significant both for the medical profession and forensically more widely. I highlight these passages because they are F&#8217;s first account of what he claims happened to his son.  </p>

I am also bound to observe that, notwithstanding the wide array of expertise garnered to assist this investigation, this rather striking detail has received little attention. I asked the father, in simple terms, how he thought N came to land in that position. He told me that he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no idea.&#8221;</span> Neither do I nor does it seem anybody else in the case has. Though I will analyse the mother&#8217;s circumstances later in this judgment, it seems to me pertinent to observe that this is a question that I might have expected her to ask F about and return to, given his own response, as I have recorded it. </p>

The key features of the account, as recorded, require to be set out: </p>

She gave him some Calpol before putting him to bed. On Friday morning mother took [N] and [K] to a Play Centre with some friends and he seemed fine. On Friday afternoon mother was getting [N] ready and putting him into the car seat ready to go and pick up his brother, [L], from school. He then had a fit with shaking of all four limbs and he became unresponsive. This lasted for 2-3 minutes. Mother called an ambulance; it took about an hour and a half for the ambulance to come by which time [N] was recovering. They were taken to X Hospital where he was assessed in A &amp; E and then transferred to the ward for a while. Mother said that when he arrived in A &amp; E he did have a fever. Mother says she spent some time with [N] in the A &amp; E Department and then went to the ward. At 11.00 p.m. on the Friday [N] was discharged with a diagnosis of a febrile convulsion due to viral tonsillitis. Mother said that on Saturday he was still &#8216;a bit off&#8217;, so not quite back to his normal self, but by Sunday he was back to normal. On Monday and Tuesday he appeared well and on Tuesday he was eating and drinking normally. Mother says she gave the boys their tea and then went out to work at about 5.30 p.m.. Father said he did his normal routine which included bathing [N] and putting on his pyjamas. He then put [N] in the top bunkbed in the children's bedroom along with his three year old brother, [K]. Father said that his seven year old brother, [L], was in the same room on his laptop. Father said that he left [N] at the pillow end of the top bunk. The ladder is at the other end, which is the only gap in the railings. [N] was on his back .. playing with a balloon when father went outside. Father went onto the landing to sort out the children's clothes and do some ironing. Father said the next thing he heard was a thud and went in and found [N] on the floor. His head was next to the ladder of the bunk bed. Initially [N] cried. Father picked him up and then he went floppy. Father said he noticed some blood in his mouth. He then decided to take [N] downstairs so that he was away from the other two children. Father says he put [N] on his side as he had been advised to do this after he had the febrile convulsion. Father then called the ambulance and was advised to put him on his back and to do CPR. Father said he was concerned that there was a lot of blood in [N&#8217;s] mouth so he did not do any breaths for him. He was advised to start chest compressions and was about to do this as the ambulance arrived. Father said that [N] had been very well and happy in his bath earlier that evening. Father had sent a photo to mother from his phone showing [N] looking happy. [N] was born at term by normal delivery. Apart from this attendance at X Hospital for the febrile convulsion he is previously fit and well. Developmentally he is crawling and rolling. His two older brothers are fit and healthy. There is no family history of any bleeding problems as far as parents are aware.&#8221; </span></p>

Subdural bleeding is most commonly the result of head trauma and can occur after accidental injury. In the absence of a history of a significant accident this pattern of bleeding raises the suspicion of a non-accidental head injury such as shaking or shaking and impact injury. Biomechanical modelling suggests rotational forces such as those generated by shaking with or without impact are important factors in causing subdural bleeding. The bleeding is described as acute which means recent. There was no bruising or swelling evident to [N&#8217;s] head. There was no evidence of any skull fracture on the CT scan. [N] was also found to have extensive swelling to his brain. During an episode of shaking damage to the brain itself which can occur via shearing and tearing forces through the brain. This causes secondary damage and swelling. [N] was also found to have extensive bilateral retinal haemorrhages. This means bleeding at the back of both eyes. Retinal haemorrhages occur in 70-80% of infants who have suffered subdural bleeding caused by shaking. Retinal haemorrhages can occur following severe accidental injury but again are strongly associated with inflicted head injury, particularly when they are extensive as described in [N]'s case. Miss A also described that [N] had perimacular folds in both his eyes. This is when there has been more extensive force to the back of the eye so that the retina is torn and this suggests significant major trauma.&#8221; </span></p>

It seems that developmentally it would be possible for [N] to have crawled to the ladder of the bunk bed and fallen out. However, from a fall from a height I would expect signs of some external injury such as bruises, swellings or skull fracture. I would not expect such a devastating brain injury or such widespread subdural bleeding or retinal haemorrhages from such a fall. As discussed above, [N&#8217;s] injuries are highly suggestive of a nonaccidental shaking injury.&#8221; </span></p>

Ms G described MGM, in the course of her evidence, as being visibly distressed at this point. This, according to the family&#8217;s evidence, was an uncharacteristic betrayal of her emotions as she steadfastly maintains a stoic &#8220;stiff upper lip&#8221; approach to adversity, as it has been described. At the XYCH L did not feel able to go to see his brother and say goodbye. L was spoken to by DC H at the XYCH, and later that evening spoken to alone at MGM&#8217;s home. This was an informal enquiry, though notes were taken by DC H&#8217;s colleague, RS. I am perplexed as to why L was spoken to at the hospital, given the distressing situation he was in, nor do I sense that a great deal of thought had been given to the scope and range of the meeting at MGM&#8217;s home. It struck me as rather free flowing and discursive. DC H is plainly an experienced and committed professional and I am clear that she was sensitive to minimise any distress to L. DC H was at pains to point out that this conversation was intended to be no more than a preliminary inquiry. The purpose was to evaluate whether L should be interviewed in accordance with Achieving Best Evidence (ABE) guidelines.  </p>

She told me in her evidence that things were being said about N in the classroom and that L, a characteristically reserved child, had his <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;head down&#8221;</span> and was obviously sad. Ms G took him out of class and asked him if he was alright. He responded without giving any detail, that N had fallen off the bed. Ms G </p>

He said dad came in and picked him up. Ms G asked <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Where had he fallen from&#8221; </span>and he said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the bed&#8221;</span>. Ms G recalls asking, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;was daddy not in the room?&#8221;</span> and L replied, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;daddy was ironing and he put N on the bed with K as he was ironing, he (daddy) had no trousers so he had gone downstairs for some trousers.&#8221;  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-style:italic">L </span>said his father ran in to pick N up, he told L to stay upstairs and his dad went downstairs with N. Ms G did not consider L&#8217;s blunt account, with its striking lack of detail as being in anyway out of character for this particular boy. She described how, though L could be fulsome and enthusiastic when engaged, he was rarely instinctively forthcoming. She observed that whilst other children would spontaneously volunteer lots of information to her when they arrived at school, L would merely say &#8220;morning&#8221; and move on to his desk. I have a strong sense that Ms G liked L, whose school work was of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;good quality&#8221;</span>, whose manners she saw as faultless and whose appearance she described as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;always immaculate.&#8221;</span> She later shared with him that she too had lost a sibling when she was 7 years old. She told L that he could come and talk to her about his loss whenever he wanted. L did not take her up on that offer. He had little opportunity to do so as he moved to junior school at the end of the academic year. Ms G described L as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a very black and white concrete thinker.&#8221; </span> She said that L lacked intuitive imaginative skills and drew from that a conclusion that L must be telling the truth. It is important to signal, as I did to Ms G, that L&#8217;s credibility is not in issue here. It is important to listen carefully to what he is reported as having said and to evaluate that in the broad canvas of the wider evidence. It requires to be emphasised that L does not recount seeing any fall and has never done so at any stage. I stress this because there are frequent references to &#8220;what L saw,&#8221; which has, on a few occasions, elided in to a misapprehension that he has said that he saw N fall from the bunk bed. He has not.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the commencement of these proceedings the Local Authority&#8217;s stated position was that it wished to investigate the evidence before advancing a positive case. By this I understood the situation to be that they intended to analyse the two competing hypotheses i.e. a fall or a shaking injury, before determining which they considered to be more likely, having heard all the evidence. Somewhat to my surprise, I am told that the Local Authority has been unable to resolve its dilemma and, at the conclusion of the case, is no further advanced in its thinking. Ms Heaton QC, on behalf of the Local Authority tells me that her clients remain securely pivoted &#8220;on the fence&#8221;. She has told me, twice, that she is &#8220;instructed&#8221; to advance a neutral position. Ms Walker, on behalf of the Children tells me that the Guardian is in the same position. For completeness, I record that the father contends this was an accident. The mother continues to support the father&#8217;s case. Manifestly, this puts the Court in an invidious position. Ms Heaton submitted that, notwithstanding the Local Authority&#8217;s inability to reach a conclusion, the Court could, nonetheless, properly determine that the injuries leading to N&#8217;s death arose in consequence of shaking and impact. Mr Vine QC, on behalf of F, submitted that the Local Authority&#8217;s position, when properly scrutinised, is that it cannot maintain that the &#8220;threshold criteria,&#8221; pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, can be met on the basis of a shaking and impact injury. Sitting on the fence, Mr Vine contends, can only mean that the Local Authority, on its own account, has not established this aspect of their case to the requisite standard i.e. the balance of probabilities. I agree with Mr Vine.  </p>

I am careful not to characterise these as concessions but rather as a correct understanding of the applicable legal framework. Mr Vine recognises that it is intrinsic to the Article 8 rights of both these subject children, that the central factual dispute at the heart of this hearing should, if possible, be resolved one way or the other. He also, responsibly acknowledges, that such an approach does not compromise F&#8217;s Article 6 rights to a fair hearing, F having been aware of the allegation he faced and having had extensive opportunity to challenge the evidence both by the instruction of experts and in cross examination, presented by leading counsel.  </p>

Thus, it seems to me, that in this investigative, non-adversarial, sui generis jurisdiction it remains open to me to make such findings as my analysis of the evidence requires. For the avoidance of any ambiguity, this includes findings other than those contended for by the parties. Each of the advocates supports this approach. It is not a comfortable position for the Judge to be placed in and in my view reflects an incomplete understanding of the approach of the court when weighing, assessing and generally evaluating the evidence at fact finding hearings. Logically, the Local Authority&#8217;s forensic approach should seek to foreshadow the court&#8217;s approach. It strikes me as necessary to consider the scope and ambit of the applicable law in greater detail than I had originally contemplated.  </p>

The conclusions of well-reasoned, carefully assessed expert evidence, free from dogmatism or defensive protection of amour propre, will always weigh significantly in the Court&#8217;s evaluation of the evidence as a whole. However, it will rarely, if ever, be determinative. Developments in medicine and imaging technology, most strikingly in the last 20 years, have displaced shibboleths and perceived orthodoxies across a range of clinical understandings and practice. Developments in neuro imaging, in particular, have enhanced understanding of the impact on the brain of a wide variety of organic illnesses and both accidental and non-accidental injuries. This progress has, or at very least should have, caused both the professionals and interested members of the public, to recognise that today&#8217;s mainstream prevailing professional consensus may, in the future, be disproved or refuted.   </p>

It is therefore crucial that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and works in a collaborative way with the other experts in order to see if a diagnosis/cause can be reached. This means that each expert must defer to the expertise of others more qualified to comment on certain areas such deferral must be made not grudgingly or reluctantly, but in ready acknowledgment of the greater expertise and knowledge that the other specialists may have in relation to certain aspects of the case.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important to emphasise both facets of Wilson LJ&#8217;s reasoning in the above paragraph. A court should not dismiss a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8220;highly unusual&#8221;</span> hypothesis merely because it is rarely seen. However, there must be some <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8220;demonstrably rare feature&#8221;</span> that establishes a possible <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8216;nexus&#8217;</span> between that feature and the injury, and which should be the subject of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8220;specialist appraisal at an early stage&#8221;</span>. The emphasis above is mine. It seems to me that these words have particular resonance in this case. By parity of analysis, a free-standing hypothesis that cannot root itself within, or gain any traction from the available evidence, becomes mere speculation. It may be that such speculation has a range of plausibility from &#8216;possible&#8217; to &#8216;highly unlikely&#8217; but to achieve evidential weight it must, in some way, be connected to reliable identifiable evidence. That may be within the wider medical interdisciplinary material but need not be confined to that and may be rooted in lay evidence, where that is found to be credible.  </p>

The controversy to which such cases gives rise should come as no surprise. A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or childminder. That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened. Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct as best they can what has happened. There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child. Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case. Such a temptation must be resisted. In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, an unknown cause. As R v Cannings, para [177] teaches, even where on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown. </span></p>

During the course of the trials a large number of medical experts were called. In two of the appeals what was asserted to be 'fresh' medical expert evidence was called. These three cases highlight a particular feature of cases where it is alleged a baby has been shaken in the care of a single adult. The evidence to prove guilt may consist only of expert evidence. It must never be forgotten that that expert evidence is relied upon to prove that the individual defendant is lying in the account he gives, either at the time or at trial. The correct management of such evidence is, therefore, of crucial importance in cases such as these. The correct approach to such evidence must be identified. If a conviction is to be based merely on the evidence of experts then that conviction can only be regarded as safe if the case proceeds on a logically justifiable basis. That entails a logically justifiable basis for accepting or rejecting the expert evidence (see R v Kai-Whitewind <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1092" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1092" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1092</ref>, [2006] Crim LR 349, para [90]).

By way of example, only rarely will there be a witness to a baby being shaken. That does not, however, mean that at the conclusion of a trial, having considered all the evidence, a judge is prevented from making findings on the balance of probabilities, that the cause of death was shaking, and to identify the unseen perpetrator. In reaching such conclusions, a judge will rightly have looked at all the evidence, contemporary, written and oral.  </span></p>

The inherent improbability of a devoted parent inflicting such widespread, serious injuries is high, but then so is the inherent improbability of this being the first example of an as yet undiscovered medical condition.

Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings. So, in a case of this kind, the court will not conclude that an injury has been inflicted merely because known or unknown medical conditions are improbable: that conclusion will only be reached if the entire evidence shows that inflicted injury is more likely than not to be the explanation for the medical findings.   </span></p>

Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent's Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions' enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.&#8221; </span></p>

He is a member of the Ophthalmic non-accidental injury working party, convened under the aegis of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists which published the guidance in this area. It is also pertinent to note that Professor Lloyd was a member of the Child Protection Ophthalmology Injury Group which critically surveyed and appraised the Ophthalmic literature concerning shaking injuries.

However, he emphasises that bilateral haemorrhaging to this degree is entirely atypical in the context of a fall. Usually retinal haemorrhages following a fall are minor, unilateral (this he stresses as significant) and occur on the same side as a co-existent intracranial haemorrhage. Additionally, they are characteristically constrained to the posterior pole of the eye. Retinal haemorrhages in such cases are usually mild and do not extend to the peripheral retina.

To put it another way, if we as clinicians and pathologists regard our findings as near incontrovertible to incontrovertible evidence of a non-accidental event based on sound prior shared and agreed experience such a position nevertheless needs to be reconsidered when supplemented by additional evidence seriously challenging such a position. For example, if CCTV imaging is obtained confirming an accidental injury event previously regarded as implausible, the whole equation changes &#8211; to insist that a nonaccidental injury event remains on balance the most likely explanation might still be valid as a general rule, but becomes untenable in the particular case under scrutiny. Should the relevant circumstantial evidence obtained in this case prove credible to any Court I would have to accept that father&#8217;s account is true. The specifics of the accidental scenario under consideration in this case might further be an exceptional explanation for the fatal outcome and full injury profile obtained, but in my opinion such specifics (height and possible manner of fall and impact) introduces a reasonable prospect of causing a fatal head injury, allowing me to reconcile the account provided with the tragic fatal outcome.&#8221; </span></p>

Dr Stoodley&#8217;s area of expertise lies in the interpretation of imaging investigations of the brain and spinal cord. He has a specific expertise in the neuroimaging of children. In the context of the neurological evidence he contributes a perspective of experience from a specialist regularly evaluating paediatric head injury in children, the majority of whom survive their injuries. Self-evidently, this is a very different perspective from that of the pathologist whose experience, by definition, must concentrate on the examination of patients who have died from various pathological processes.

The central hypothesis, as I have foreshadowed, put to Dr Stoodley and to Professor Lloyd, is that the angular mechanism of the fall might have mimicked flection/extension of the kind seen in shaking cases. It was suggested that some whiplash reaction to the fall could contribute to the mimicking of the neurological and ophthalmological signs. Dr Stoodley made, what I consider to be, a real attempt to reconcile this hypothesis with the neuroradiology.  He was clear that a consultant in this sphere should <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;never say never&#8221;</span> but his approach was to seek to contextualise the possibility of a fall by reference to the totality of the imaging and from that perspective he concluded that if the court found that a fall from the bed had occurred as described, he regarded it as very unlikely that any injury sustained from such an episode could be reconciled with or unify the scan features. In response to Mr Vine&#8217;s direct question, Dr Stoodley stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel I can reasonably explain the constellation of imaging findings as an impact injury; even where short distant falls give rise to fatality the imaging is very different.&#8221; </span>Dr Stoodley agreed with Mr Vine that &#8220;every fall is different&#8221; but insisted that in the context of a domestic head trauma he would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not expect to see brain injuries, particularly bleeding in the spinal canal&#8221;</span> and, further, that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in the range of trauma he has seen&#8221;</span> he had not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;seen anything like this&#8221;</span>.

The brain with its pial covering (the pia mater) lies within a covering of another fine membrane (the arachnoid mater); a much tougher and thicker membrane lies between the arachnoid and the inner aspect of the skull (the dura). Fluid between the pia and arachnoid membranes (i.e. in the sub arachnoid space) Dr Stoodley says is &#8220;normal and entirely innocent&#8221;. Fluid in the subdural space (which is really a potential space in the absence of fluid) is always due to a pathological cause i.e. trauma or infection.  </p>

The older the blood, the less bright it becomes until such point (which can be between one to three weeks) as it returns to the same attenuation as the underlying brain, before deteriorating to &#8216;lower attenuation&#8217; (darker than the underlying brain). </p>

Professor Lumb also observed that the line contained haemorrhage which identified it as a fracture. The haemorrhage extended along the suture line for a further 2cm.

Neither does the extensive research that I have been referred to establish that they may occur in such a context. Again, I emphasise loudly and unambiguously that none of this drives me, automatically, to exclude this possibility. Dr Cartlidge considered that if N fell onto his head, in &#8216;free fall&#8217;, that might have been a sufficiently high energy impact to explain the neurological and ophthalmological signs. I am inclined to accept Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s view that N was not at a sufficient stage of development to be able automatically to break his own fall. I do not understand any other witness to take issue with this. I note that, in his report dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2020, Dr Cartlidge recognised that on his interpretation this was a &#8216;statistically unusual case&#8217;, but he perceived it to be unusual in any event for <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a 9 month old infant to free fall such a distance&#8221;</span>. I interpret that to mean the distance is considered by Dr Cartlidge to be the unusual feature rather than the &#8220;free fall&#8221; mechanism. It would seem to me to follow from Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s reasoning, that any infant of this age, of normal development, would be unable to break a fall instinctively.   </p>

I hope Dr Cartlidge will not think me in anyway discourteous, but I considered his remark, in fact, to be illuminating rather than clumsy. Doctors in clinical practice must of necessity evaluate the reliability of the account given to them in order to factor it in to a differential diagnosis. Doctors by and large assume their patients are being truthful if not always entirely accurate. Lawyers do not start with that same assumption. Whether F&#8217;s account is reliable is a matter for the court to assess, having had the benefit of evidence across a wide range of medical and factual issues. Dr Cartildge&#8217;s conclusion is inextricably linked to his assumption that because he can reconcile the clinical features with the &#8216;proffered history&#8217; F&#8217;s account becomes the most likely cause. Whether there was a fall or not is a matter to be determined by this court. </p>

Veins bridging the subdural spaces and subarachnoid spaces may then rupture resulting in widespread, multicompartmental, acute subdural and subarachnoid bleeding. Rapid, forceful, movement of the spine and limbs, during shaking could cause damage to the nerve roots with evidence of bleeding and damage to the nerve tissue as seen in N. The act of shaking would require the perpetrator to grasp the infant around the chest. Bruising might be expected to occur at the points where the infant was held.

With such a mechanism, one would expect there to be external evidence of injury in the form of soft tissue swelling over the site of impact, skin abrasions, bruising or lacerations. However, it is possible for infants to suffer intracranial injury without soft tissue swelling. A skull fracture might be expected but it is also possible that a skull fracture could be absent following impact trauma causing intracranial injury in an infant. The presence of a skull fracture and scalp swelling is disputed in this case and it is for the court to decide on the presence or absence of a frontal fracture beneath an area of scalp swelling that was seen at post-mortem but not on clinical examination. A fall from a height of approximately one and a half meters onto a carpeted floor would be sufficient to cause a traumatic brain injury. The severity of the traumatic brain injury suffered by N is considerably more severe than would be expected following a fall from such a height. The distribution of injuries is also inconsistent with an impact trauma where a predominance for one side over the other might be expected, causing more localised traumatic lesions. There is evidence that low level falls can cause significant, lifethreatening brain injuries in infants. Plunkett performed a retrospective review of falls in infants and children and found 18 cases of death following low level falls. However, the specific pattern and anatomical location of injuries seen on N&#8217;s scan and at post-mortem would be unusual following impact trauma. The spinal and nerve root injuries seen at post-mortem are more difficult to explain following an impact trauma compared with a shaking trauma. Rotational movement of the body at the point of impact would be required if the fall was the sole cause of the injuries. Death in infants following a fall from one and a half meters is extremely rare, therefore, robust evidence from post-mortem studies does not exist that might help us understand whether such spinal and nerve root injuries, suffered by N, are an expected or recognised finding. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">MRI is becoming more common following various different mechanisms of trauma, and it is evident that spinal subdural blood is not a frequent finding following accidental trauma. The spinal and nerve root injuries identified at post-mortem may also not be evident on clinical imaging in children who have survived the injury. Consequently, it may be appropriate to state that the injuries suffered by N are unlikely, on the balance of probability, to have occurred following the fall, but insufficient evidence exists to safely state that it is not possible for the injuries to occur following the mechanism described.&#8221; (my emphasis) </span></p>

I do not want in any way to shrink the scope and ambit of the medical evidence that I have heard, but I do consider it necessary to identify a clear consensus to the effect that whilst a shaking/impact injury most readily explains the key medical evidence, it does not exclude the theoretical possibility of it having been caused by a fall from the upper bunk, if that fall mimicked the rotational/accelerative/decelerative forces more commonly seen in shaking/impact injury. There are shades of difference between the experts as to how likely &#8220;the fall&#8221; explanation is but all agree that the starting point is that it is unlikely. I should record that Dr Cartlidge did not seem to agree this enthusiastically, perhaps not at all.

They were invested in the appearance of their home as well as themselves and their children. F particularly liked everything to be tidy and organised. M was rather more relaxed. This was reflected in their different parenting styles. NX described M&#8217;s style as much more casual, she perceived an unrestrained easy-going approach to parenting. F, she described as the one <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;who would do the shouting&#8221;</span>. She told me this without my sensing any criticism of either approach but merely advancing a neutral observation of the difference between the two. In her evidence, M recognised these features of her personality and her parenting style, as described by her sister. I assess this to be a genuine recognition though I have noticed that M is predisposed to agree with what others say and sense that she struggles to assert her own opinion.  </p>

She told me she enjoyed this as it gave her a bit of time to herself and she got along well with the people she worked with. She has worked there for a number of years, save for maternity leave and, on average, as I understand her evidence, has worked three evening shifts per week, usually between 6 to 11pm. There was some flexibility as to the days she worked but invariably it would include one of the weekend days. F would take over the care of the children on these occasions, which would have involved bathing them and getting them to bed. M had usually provided a meal for the children before she left.  </p>

M told me that sometimes, apart from bank holidays etc, it would be quiet in the evening at work and, though she was not supposed to take her mobile phone on to the shop floor, she and the others would usually do so.

M now had the three children she had hoped for. The evidence before me made it clear that M was almost unable to prevent herself photographing and taking short videos of N, often many times a day. He was an extraordinarily well photographed little boy.  </p>

Before N was born the boys would go to bed &#8220;at about 8pm&#8221;. They often had their iPads &#8220;for a bit before falling to sleep&#8221;. F told me he would &#8220;do other things around the house&#8221; when the boys were in bed. He gave examples of doing the washing up, ironing, generally tidying, the cleaning and emptying the bins. I have not the slightest doubt that all this is accurate. It is clear that cleanliness, tidiness and order was and is very important to F. I am left with an equally clear impression that M regarded this as not entirely a blessing. F did not feel that M was as invested in such domestic order as he was. Both unhesitatingly remembered a row where F complained that M had left the inside of the car too messy. There was another big row a few weeks before 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June which both spontaneously recalled, and which had &#8220;lingered longer than usual&#8221; on M&#8217;s account. </p>

Both the language they used and the incidents they alight upon have a striking similarity. I considered that F seemed to display little, if any, insight into the impact of some of his more fastidious traits on M&#8217;s general sense of well-being. As I have said, both parents identified the example of an argument which arose because of F&#8217;s displeasure with untidiness in the car. It did not seem to occur to F that a mother with three children under 7 might be permitted some latitude when it came to keeping the inside of a car clean. Nor did M seem entirely to grasp that it might be F rather than herself at fault in this situation.  </p>

Her identification of what I find to be underlying stresses in her relationship with F, however, was both spontaneous honest, entirely free from vindictiveness and was not, in my assessment in anyway designed to undermine his case. Paradoxically, this only serves to make her evidence about the difficulties in the relationship all the more compelling. I sensed that M was too tired, too overwhelmed by her grief even to sense that some of Ms Heaton&#8217;s questions on these issues were guided to identifying any dynamics within the parent&#8217;s relationship which might indicate heightened levels of stress within the household which might have elevated N&#8217;s vulnerability.  </p>

The contact is supervised by the maternal grandmother (MGM). It is obvious from what everybody has said that F and MGM hold each other in some esteem. I am sure the social workers consider that MGM must have sufficient objectivity about the issues in the case and the risk F must be deemed to present, to be able to exercise authoritative and independent supervision.

Though M asserted that she and F were happy prior to 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019, my impression was that their differences in parenting style and their approach to general standards and routines around the home was longstanding.

The supermarket is only ten minutes away, but M left at 5.30pm. Both the parents explained that she sometimes did this because of the delay at traffic lights. M and F told me that there had been no problems between them that day. Neither expressed themselves to be under stress due to the pace of their lives or their respective workloads. Though N was teething at the time, both parents said this had caused no trouble or extra burden to either of them.

Unfortunately, the injection, which was to have been given on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 could not go ahead. F accepted, in response to questions from Ms Heaton, that he was sometimes in pain during the day, particularly when he had been standing. He had been prescribed Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory.

I held him under his arms facing me so I could look at him. I saw blood on his mouth and then his eyes started to roll back, his head lolled back and he went floppy. I was worried he was going to have another fit. The hospital had told us if he did we should lie him on his side. I told the boys to stay in their room and took [N] straight downstairs holding [N&#8217;s] body against my chest. I cannot remember if I supported his head or not. I put [N] on the living room rug on his side. I saw blood in his mouth and he was struggling to breath at this point. I therefore rang 999 and asked for an ambulance. I think that this was at about 7.40pm. From this point I stayed on the phone to the 999 operator. I remember that she was asking for lots of details such as [N&#8217;s] date of birth and all I wanted was an ambulance to come. At some point I think the boys had come downstairs as I remember they were there when the ambulance arrived&#8230; I have read in the papers that it is said I asked [K] if he had pushed [N].

There was no such explanation, F said he left N on the top bunk because <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;N was happy and so I didn&#8217;t put him to bed&#8221;</span>. I interpolate at this point my observation that &#8220;happy&#8221; is precisely the word used by L in his explanation of these events.    </p>

I find these descriptions fall considerably short of accurately reflecting the degree of parental failure involved. They trivialise the tragedy they purport to describe. The language is not consonant with the event. It simply lacks the grief, guilt and despair that would consume any parent in such a situation. As I have noted, Ms KB, Paramedic, was instantly alerted to safeguarding issues on these related facts alone. It strikes me that if this had truly been the mechanism by which N came by his fatal injuries F would not have described them in this manner. In the intense focus on the competing medical hypothesis, these simple realities have been lost sight of. F is describing an accident which involves him acting entirely out of character, for no apparent reason and describing the event in language which is incongruent and jarring.  </p>

On his belly with his, crying with his head up. Urm, but if he had gone&#8230; head forward, I don&#8217;t know how he would have landed on his belly but that is, that is how I found him, like, in that position&#8221;</span>. In the interview room F demonstrated this physically, lying on the floor by way of illustration. He also drew a plan. I asked him, in the witness box, whether he had, since his interview, developed any idea of any manner of fall that could have led to N landing in this position. He told me that he could not. I am bound to say neither can I, nor has anybody else suggested how landing in this position might have occurred. Mr Vine&#8217;s riposte to this is to draw from the medical evidence the undoubted fact that the position in which the body lands is not an indicator of the mechanics or nature of the fall. This I accept but, with respect to him, that is a different point. Whether a fall involves the accelerative/decelerative features that might mimic a shaking injury is a different question from the simple enquiry as to how, whatever the nature of the fall itself, N&#8217;s body could have landed face down at the bottom of the ladders.  </p>

However, Ms KB who was the last paramedic to arrive at the scene noted what was said, filed a statement in these proceedings and gave evidence. A transcript of her safeguarding referral, made shortly after N had been taken by ambulance to hospital, has been filed in these proceedings. The following extract is relevant: </p>

In any event I consider it likely that L will have heard the call. It is also clear that R may well have overheard discussions within the family about a fall. The grandfather is reported as urging the family to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;keep it down&#8221; </span>when discussing what had happened in order not to be heard by the children. This occurred after N had been taken to hospital on the night of the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019. If, as is contended, L was &#8220;fixed to his computer&#8221; and did not see a fall, it seems to me likely that he would have accepted F&#8217;s account as he overheard it. As his teacher said, he is a concrete thinker, somewhat lacking in imaginative capacity. He would have had no reason to disbelieve his father.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The emphasis in the above extracts is mine, to assist in contrasting L&#8217;s own responses to DC H. During his &#8220;preliminary interview&#8221; L volunteered, apropos of nothing,: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Dad has put N on top of the bunk bed before&#8221;</span>. As is clear from the above, this is said by F to have happened on only one previous occasion. F volunteers in his interview: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[L] would have been there&#8221;</span>. I note that F does not say &#8220;L was there&#8221;. I also note that F was not describing anything remarkable, merely having placed his son on the top bunk on a previous occasion when absolutely nothing happened. Accordingly, I can see no reason why L would even have noticed this, let alone remembered it and, entirely uncharacteristically, volunteered it in interview. I was struck by how Ms G was so clear that L was rarely forthcoming in ordinary social exchanges and I remind myself again that she described how L would never volunteer anything to her unless she probed it by questioning. She told me that when she did ask L about e.g. what he had done over the weekends he would happily tell her. Left to himself he would simply say &#8220;morning&#8221; and move on. I have already recorded DC H&#8217;s observations relating to L finding it easier to respond to closed questions (see para 21). When I consider the notes of DC H&#8217;s interview it is striking that apart from the above L rarely, if at all, volunteers&#8217; information which is not in direct response to the specific and usually closed question asked. Virtually the only piece of information spontaneously volunteered in the interview is this line: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Dad has put N on top of the bunk bed before&#8221;</span>. This was a response to a different question namely: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;How was Dad before [N] fell?&#8221;</span>. R&#8217;s response to the question, proffered at the very end of the interview, does not strike me as authentic, it is far more consistent with the delivery of a message that L feels he is required to. I do not know whether L is repeating something he has heard or whether he has been coached by F. I am satisfied that L is unlikely to be relating his own recollection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In her evidence M told me that she did not think it was appropriate to speak with L about events surrounding N&#8217;s death. However, she unexpectedly volunteered, during the course of cross examination, that as long ago as October 2019, L had spoken to her about that night and told her that N was going to the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;edge of the bed&#8221;</span>, and so he went to find F who said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;just a minute&#8221;</span>. M told me that she confronted F about this. She considered it to be so important that she waited outside the house in order to avoid being overheard by the children. As Ms Heaton points out this is not significantly different to what L had told DC H. It is difficult to see what emphasis M was placing on it and why she felt it necessary to confront F outside, in the way she tells me she did. She created the very clear impression that she had been troubled by what L had said and was unhappy, even angry, with F. On M&#8217;s account F seemed equally troubled by what M told him. Despite M&#8217;s attempt to keep this from the children, she told me that F went inside the home and went straight upstairs to confront L about it. NX, who was in the house at the time, manifestly thought his behaviour was inappropriate and said to him words to the effect of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t be doing this&#8221;.</span> There is no doubt that this was a significant confrontation but the dissonance between what is reported to have been said and the reaction of the adults is striking. I infer that something far more troubling than I have been told was related that day. NX of course, was entirely right in her admonishment of F. He should not </p>

This, I assume, was one of the reasons NX was there to supervise F&#8217;s contact and to ensure that L was protected from such questioning. It is equally clear that F went upstairs with the purpose of straightening out L&#8217;s recollection and that by acting in such a hasty way against the advice of his partner and her sister his interests in speaking to L were his own and not his sons. All this serves to enhance my concern, set out above, relating to the authenticity of some of L&#8217;s observations to DC H.  </p>

It was, of course, M&#8217;s birthday. Given that the couple had barely spent any time together that day, M&#8217;s lack of response seems odd. Similarly, given the horrific news F communicated to M after the ambulance had arrived, the reasons M gives for failure to respond to F&#8217;s subsequent phone calls, does not strike me as convincing. This was plainly an emergency. Additionally, the couple rarely communicate, I was told, by telephone but prefer to send SMS messages and snapchat. I am bound to say that I would have expected M to have had the phone close to her and, given that she responded to F&#8217;s original call, I cannot see that she would have put her phone on silent mode. I emphasise that M has not said that she put her phone on silent, she insists that she had only one priority, namely to get home. Accordingly, I am asked to accept that she drove home listening to her phone ring out and declining to answer it. Again, I understand entirely the instinct M articulates, nonetheless I struggle to understand why, in such extremis, she did not respond at all to F&#8217;s insistent calls.   </p>

There is all manner of reasons why one would have expected M to answer the phone in the heat of such a crisis&#8230; most obviously F might have been telling her to go directly to the hospital. On his account, which M does not dispute, F told her, on that short phone call, that the ambulance was already there when he was calling her. Both parents have denied that there was any argument or upset between them that evening, but I am unable to rely on the disavowal of either.

Once the court comes to the conclusion, as here, that the adult&#8217;s account cannot be relied upon, it is driven back to the wider evidential canvas which, inevitably, can only be constructed from the available thread. The task of the court remains: to identify such facts as it can; to evaluate each of the expert opinions; to identify reliable evidence from which inferences may reasonably be drawn. The court will then weigh this evidence to arrive at such conclusions as it can, on the balance of probabilities.  </p>

In fact, on reading Ms Heaton and Ms Walker&#8217;s closing submissions, it strikes me that they do not, ultimately, follow the logic of their own reasoning to its inevitable conclusion. Both cast significant doubt on F&#8217;s reliability as a witness. On the evidence that I have identified they were, in my judgement, bound to. Ms Walker correctly identifies that an assessment of F&#8217;s credibility is intrinsically linked to the plausibility of F&#8217;s account of the fall. It follows that if F is himself implausible, as a witness, the account he advances is also weakened.  It does not follow, automatically, that as I am unable to rely on F&#8217;s evidence his explanation of a fall must be discounted. I have reminded myself that individuals in such circumstances may lie for a variety of reasons. I considered L&#8217;s evidence with particular care to see whether it can lend real credence to the explanation F advances. For all the reasons analysed above I have come to the conclusion that L&#8217;s evidence does not provide such support and not merely because he has never given any account of seeing a fall.  </p>
