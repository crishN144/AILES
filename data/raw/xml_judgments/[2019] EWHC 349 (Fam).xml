		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;Before leaving the relevant legal principles, it is in my judgment also relevant that the limitation period which has now expired in this case is one imposed under the Inheritance Act. It is both of a special type in the sense that it confers upon the court a discretionary power to permit a claim to be made out of time on well-settled principles and it exists for a particular purpose, namely to avoid the unnecessary delay in the administration of estates to be caused by the tardy bringing of proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and to avoid the difficulties which might be occasioned if distributions of an estate are made before proceedings are brought, requiring possible recoveries from beneficiaries if those proceedings once brought are successful &#8221; </p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">That is plainly a good reason for the existence of the limitation period, but it is, surely, not the only reason.  Litigation is intrinsically stressful and extremely expensive. The time limit must be there to protect beneficiaries from being vexed by a stale claim, whether or not the estate has been distributed. Similarly, the time limit must be there to spare the court from being burdened with stale claims which should have been made much earlier. A robust application of the extension power in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> would be consistent with the spirit of the overriding objective, specifically CPR 1.1(2)(d) </p>

In fact, I doubt whether the exercise is correctly to be framed as one of &#8220;discretion&#8221; at all. Fundamentally, the court must be satisfied that the claimant has shown (a) good reasons justifying the delay and (b) that she has a claim of sufficient merit to be allowed to proceed to trial.

Rather, he wished his trusted trustees to do so on her behalf. Further, he wished to retain within the hands of his trustees the flexibility to deploy all that remained of the estate after the death of the claimant for the benefit of his descendants, his stepchildren and the charitable purposes which he had identified.

However, in May/June 2016 the claimant and the first defendant were able to agree a regular monthly payment of $17,250, which commenced in April 2017 when a backpayment of $207,000 to cover the hiatus was additionally made.

On 20 February 2017 Farrer &amp; Co sent the claimant and her sons an equally exhaustive exposition of the structure and effect of the will. On the same day the sixth defendant, the claimant&#8217;s son Jerry, replied that the will and the wishes were &#8220;simple and clearly laid out&#8221;. Nonetheless they wished to take the advice of a UK lawyer. They were put in touch with Helen Cheng, a private client and tax lawyer of Withers in San Diego. She contacted the London office and wrote them an email on 28 March 2017 as follows: </p>

This is confirmed by an agenda sent by Jerry to Farrer &amp; Co on 5 November 2017 in anticipation of a telephone conference on 7 November 2017. At the beginning of that document he defined the goal to be to &#8220;define relationships between us and the trust.

Plainly, as Lord Clarke pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Abela</span>, there is a difference between the two processes. I note that his reasoning was recently approved by Lord Carnwath in <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of AR) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2018/47" uk:canonical="[2018] UKSC 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKSC 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] 1 WLR 4079" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] 1 WLR 4079</ref> at [60].
