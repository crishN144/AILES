	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case first came on before me on 14 November 2005.  The local authority initially sought a final hearing.  The Guardian had reservations about this for 2 main reasons.  There was concern about the mother&#8217;s understanding of the proceedings.  It was felt that she needed the opportunity to absorb any adverse judgment.  Secondly the natural family in Nigeria though aware of the proceedings did not know that the local authority&#8217;s care plan envisaged placing both children for adoption.</p>

There was a contested hearing on the causation of the injuries.  I gave judgment on 18 November.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of the 21 marks found on M, the local authority relied upon 8 of them as being deliberately inflicted injuries of which the mother was the perpetrator.  I found that in respect of 7 of the 8 injuries they were deliberately inflicted by the mother.  They had caused her significant harm.  The evidence of how that happened is appalling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of the 7, I held that 5 were the result of deliberate burns.  One was caused by the infliction of force sufficient to make marks without puncturing the skin.  The final one, 3 parallel marks on her back, were caused as a result of the use of a whip.  The mother denied that she had caused any of them.  She said they were all accidental.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a ring on the right aspect of her arm and a smaller scab on her knee.  I held that these were caused in all likelihood by a cigarette being held to the skin.  There were the lateral scars on the right trunk which I found consistent with whipping.  In addition there were 4 small lesions and 2 circular marks below the right eye and finally a pale coloured abrasion above the right eye which was consistent with a burn.</p>

Following the injuries inflicted on M, they seek to prove that both she and K are also likely to suffer significant harm if returned to the care of the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am then able to go on to the second part which is to make a decision about the local authority&#8217;s care plan.  I only agree its recommendation for adoption or long-term fostering away from the mother if the local authority satisfy me that it is in the children&#8217;s best interest because their welfare is my paramount consideration.  I balance that against the mother&#8217;s wish for both children to be returned to her care.  I bear in mind the strong presumption that a child should be brought up in its own family.  Strong compelling evidence is required for any other course.  That is the exercise I now undertake.</p>

The mother does not consent to this.  It is not sufficient that I find, as I do, that such an order is in the best interests of both children.</p>

Mrs O completed a form.  In that she stated she did not consent to adoption.  She was informed that she was entitled to free legal aid.  She has not responded further.</p>

With the mother&#8217;s uncooperative and at times hostile attitude to the local authority, I do not see how any rehabilitation could be planned nor supervised.  There is no alternative in this case if both K and M&#8217;s best interests are to be met.  Accordingly I approve the care plan as amended.  It is a matter of regret that neither M and K&#8217;s father nor M&#8217;s mother has proposed any alternative placement.</p>
