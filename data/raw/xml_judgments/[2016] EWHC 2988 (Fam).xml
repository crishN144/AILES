	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The resources in this case total, subject to as yet unquantified tax, in the region of &#163;50/55 million.  Although his is a long marriage and although the parties had no wealth when they married in 1980, both seek a departure from an equal division.  I will determine the substantive issues raised by the parties but the husband, in particular, has litigated in a manner which is contrary to the duty placed on parties &#8220;to help the court to further the overriding objective&#8221;: r. 1.3 FPR 2010.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This failure can be demonstrated by the husband&#8217;s contention that he should be awarded the additional sum of &#8364;17,622 to compensate him for the wife&#8217;s unequal division of the balance in an account.  I appreciate that a number of small sums can add up to a significant amount.  I also recognise that, if the court too readily ignores what might be tactical accretion or expenditure of small amounts, parties might be encouraged to engage in such behaviour.  However, to descend to this level in this case having regard to the available resources is, frankly, absurdly disproportionate.</p>

Following the end of the marriage they have fallen out so this will no longer happen.  Nicholas has set up another property business.</p>

A substantial part (approximately &#163;40 million) is held in a number of special purpose onshore and offshore property owning companies.  The largest by value, and representing approximately half of the value of these companies, is called Docklock Ltd.  This owns properties in North London including 66/70 Parkway.  Some of the shares in these companies are held in the wife&#8217;s name.  It is the husband&#8217;s case that the wife holds these shares on trust for him.  This would not be a relevant issue but for the fact that whether the shares are beneficially owned by the husband or the wife will have different tax consequences.</p>

Based on these factual assertions, it is the husband&#8217;s case that three of the London properties and all of the Cypriot properties are not marital assets.  It is submitted that funding from the husband&#8217;s parents was the &#8220;genesis&#8221; of CC and, in the husband&#8217;s opening submissions, that <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the Cypriot properties came to the husband via his father.  </p>

The wife&#8217;s then solicitors asserted that &#8220;the proceeds of this account are derived from (the wife&#8217;s sister&#8217;s) various personal shareholdings and property interests and therefore do not constitute matrimonial funds in any way&#8221;.  This was untrue, as the wife accepted during the course of her evidence.  She also accepted that what she had done was a mistake and said she was sorry for having done this.  The monies were subsequently transferred into the joint account referred to above.</p>

The expert was not called to give evidence.  Her report notes that the conclusions which can be drawn from an examination of the questioned signatures (on the declaration and a letter dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014) &#8220;are limited by the fact that only poor copies of these signatures are available&#8221;.  Further, the husband&#8217;s signatures are &#8220;extremely simple and variable&#8221; and &#8220;vulnerable to simulation and difficult to authenticate&#8221;.  In her opinion there is &#8220;more support for the view&#8221; that the signatures are simulations.  She gives the lowest positive qualitative conclusion, namely that there is weak evidence that the signatures are not genuine.</p>

When assessing his evidence I have, of course, considered the extent to which it is based, for example, on faulty or mistaken recollection or the absence of documents.  I have come to the clear conclusion that his evidence, when dealing with contentious issues, was largely based on an indifference to the truth and was motivated by what he seeks to achieve in these proceedings rather than on his true recollection of events.  I am satisfied, from the way in which significant elements of the husband&#8217;s factual case have mutated during the course of these proceedings and from the way in which he gave his evidence, that this has, to a significant extent, been deliberate.</p>

In his oral evidence the husband said, baldly, that very little of this belongs to the family companies.  Given my view as to the reliability of the husband as a witness, he will have to supply a breakdown of the relevant balances and the sums due to the companies, as at the date of the distribution of the companies between the parties, to ensure that he is not able to manipulate the figures and seek to obtain a larger share of the marital wealth by retaining funds within CC, which has not been ascribed a value in the asset schedule.</p>

If the husband was already the beneficial owner there would have been no need to transfer the shares to him to seek to avoid the crystallisation of UK capital gains tax, as referred to in the letter.

Indeed, the husband has been unable to advance a consistent or, in my view, plausible case as to the creation of any trust.  There are important elements in the evidence which are contrary to his case, including the 2014 advice in respect of the DL shares and the husband&#8217;s evidence that the declarations of trust (in respect of the offshore companies) were left blank because their completion would depend on the &#8220;situation arising&#8221;.

He would be responsible and, as between himself and the wife, solely responsible for obtaining this improper profit.  If he has taken advantage of the wife&#8217;s family in the way alleged, it would, in my view, be inequitable if I were to make the wife contribute to the costs of dealing with the consequences.  I would not have reached this conclusion save for the fact that the victims of his actions (I stress, again, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> Lotigol is successful) are members of the wife&#8217;s immediate family.  It is this element of the conduct which makes it inequitable to disregard and not the nature of the conduct in itself.  I refer to this last point to make it clear that this is not an argument which I would expect to be capable of being more widely deployed in respect of business impropriety.</p>

Indeed, she says that the former was called Alexander&#8217;s house and the latter Nicholas&#8217; house.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband seeks the allocation of these properties to him based significantly on his case that they are not marital assets.  Additionally, he relies on the fact that Silikou is his family&#8217;s ancestral village and that he lives in Cyprus and makes use of the larger holiday home.  In his oral evidence the husband gave this property as his address.  However, he had not used this as his address for any of his statements which are in the bundles for the hearing.  The only address in Cyprus which he gave (on one statement) was his address in Nicosia.  Otherwise he gave his address as 73 Park Way, London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I propose to order that these properties are allocated to the wife.  I accept that the parties always intended that they would be given to the children.  This is also the only means by which it is likely that the children will retain a family connection with the ancestral village.  The husband explained that the properties have to be allocated together because they rely on a common water supply.</p>
