	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither the mother nor the father, both of whom are represented by experienced Solicitors and Counsel, came to court yesterday for the first of what had been intended to be a three day hearing. It is, I need hardly say, extremely unusual for the parents of any child to absent themselves from court proceedings at which orders leading to adoption will be sought.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Their positions were explained by Counsel both of whom had spoken over the telephone with their respective clients during the course of yesterday morning. The parents know of the plan that judgment will be given at 2pm this afternoon, 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December. There was some indication that the mother might attend for judgment. The father knew that unless he attended for a meeting with his lawyers and the local authority social workers today then there would be no opportunity for a final, &#8216;farewell&#8217; contact visit next week. As it turns out, both parents are here to listen to the judgment; and they have already participated in a meeting with social services in relation to contact next week.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is rare for a court to convene a final hearing in relation to a 10 week old infant. Ordinarily, more time would elapse before it was appropriate to confront the making of final decisions. In this instance, I am convinced that it is right to proceed and even although the orders sought represent the most serious kind of state intervention, namely permanent separation between the child and her natural family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child who is the subject of this application is LRP. Her mother is CH; her father is RP. They are also the parents of two older children, both boys, TLP and ARP. In February this year, both parents participated fully in a three week fact finding and, so far as their two sons were concerned, &#8216;welfare&#8217; hearing. Judgment was given on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March &#8211; [2013] EWHC 2133.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Various findings were made in relation to both RP and CH, all of them significant insofar as LRP is concerned. In brief, they substantiate the following &#8211; that RP poses a risk of significant physical harm to any child or adult with whom he resides; that CH is unable to identify and thereafter respond appropriately to the risk of harm; that she does not accept RP poses a risk of harm to her, children or other adults; that RP holds unhealthy and or unwholesome attitudes to sexual relationships; that as at 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March, RP, CH, RP&#8217;s mother and step father (against whom serious sexual findings were made) presented as a cohesive, enmeshed and well defended unit content to share their lives irrespective of the risk presented to any child; that CH was unable to make any kind of break between herself, RP and his family notwithstanding that first TLP and then ARP had been removed from her as the result of the risks associated with her continued connections.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a section of my March judgment (paragraphs 117 to 123) devoted to the question of whether CH was capable of separating herself from the influences of RP and his mother. CH and RP sought to persuade me, unsuccessfully as it turned out, that their relationship at the time of the February hearing was Platonic. LRP&#8217;s birth on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October demonstrates just what a blatant lie that was. There is no suggestion that anyone other than RP is LRP&#8217;s father. The mother was about two months pregnant with LRP at the time of the March judgment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My decisions about TLP and ARP, then 19 months and 6 months old respectively, were that on any consideration of their welfare needs nothing short of adoption would be adequate. They had to be protected from harm and there was no basis for believing that either then or within an appropriate timeframe CH would be able to so safeguard  them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">LRP was born seven months after the March judgment. The local authority began care proceedings at a time when LRP and the mother were still in hospital. On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, I was asked to sanction their separation under an interim care order so that LRP might be looked after within a foster home pending final decisions. I refused to approve of the separation plan mindful that the risks to the baby&#8217;s safety could not have been described as immediate or pressing, given that the mother was indicating a strong wish to continue looking after her new born baby and would do &#8220;whatever it took&#8221; in terms of separating from RP.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, and responsive to my indications, the local authority arranged for the mother and LRP to be placed together in a specialist mother and baby foster home in West Sussex. They moved there on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, after just a very few days apart because the hospital had been unable to continue to accommodate them. </p>

It&#8217;s is no exaggeration to say that, seemingly, she was very content. She was beaming. The initial signs were encouraging as to her being able to look after LRP in the absence of RP.</p>

The next and as it turned out the last time there was any contact between mother and baby was on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October at or after a Review Child Protection conference. The father attended that conference as well and was due to have contact. He became extremely aggressive and threatening towards professionals, swearing and shouting, whilst holding LRP. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November there was a brief hearing at which I agreed that before RP could be reintroduced to LRP at contact, there would have to be a meeting with social workers, attended by his lawyers, so as to ensure there was no repetition of what happened on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. The other development at that early November hearing, consequent upon the mother&#8217;s departure from the foster home was to enlarge the scope of this fixture to deal with final orders in relation to LRP. Three days were set aside. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On their own, the findings made at the end of the February hearing as against each parent provide the foundation so as to satisfy the s.31 &#8216;threshold criteria&#8217; in relation to LRP. Mr Perkins&#8217; document contains a little more, derived from the recent history. There is no suggestion, nor could there be, that the s.31 criteria are anything other than emphatically established in relation to LRP and I so find.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the interval between then and now, the most important assessment work was carried out by Amanda Gillard, independent social worker.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gillard has seen the mother alone on several occasions and also together with the father. She has had good opportunities to discuss the issues with both parents, to consider their responses to the anxieties about their apparent inability to respond positively to the need for intervention as well as their reaction to the various findings made at the February hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gillard does not consider there are any services or support systems which could be put in place so as to effectively ensure LRP&#8217;s safety and well being were she to be back at home with her mother. The mother and father have candidly stated that they wish to be together as a couple. They, particularly the mother, have no wish to separate and even although they recognise the almost inevitable consequences of that decision for their daughter.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gillard is concerned that even although the parents have had ample opportunity &#8211; since about this time last year &#8211; to demonstrate a real commitment to achieving change, they have failed to do so. The timescales, forecasts Ms Gillard, are indeterminate; and she does not believe there is a good enough prognosis to recommend that LRP should be placed either with her mother alone or with her parents together.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">RP has done nothing so far as anyone can judge to address the difficulties brought sharply in to focus as the result of the last substantive hearing. At court on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, he suggested he was in touch with mental health services and would be able to produce some form of report from his treating psychiatrist. On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, RP&#8217;s Counsel confirmed that he there had been no such engagement and there could be no report from anyone within the mental health services. There was no treating psychiatrist.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are, says Ms Gillard very real question marks as to whether either the mother or father is motivated to respond to any help offered. The risks, she suggests, are as they were before. There would need to be a period of treatment and engagement with interventions such as DVIP (domestic violence intervention project) and anger management before there could be any review in relation to RP&#8217;s relationship with the mother and possible involvement in LRP&#8217;s life.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, it is Ms Gillard&#8217;s view that although the mother wishes to care for LRP, her own emotional needs are such that she would struggle in any situation, even if supported, if she were unable to be with RP. He is not minded to address his difficulties. The mother is unlikely to be able to utilise support and guidance so as to benefit from it in any meaningful way if she remains in a relationship with the father.</p>

It seemed as though the mother had done no more than make a telephone call to a particular resource (IAPT) which could provide her with counselling. It was all &#8220;very flimsy&#8221; observed Ms Gillard. In relation to the mother&#8217;s suggestion of a placement at the Cassel Hospital, Ms Gillard said they had not discussed such an extremely intensive psychoanalytical intervention when they&#8217;d met. Ms Gillard commented that neither parent had made any progress such that they might be suitable for such an intensive programme. Her forecast is that the minimum period of any treatment plan would be &#8220;at least a year.&#8221;</p>

The mother&#8217;s personal needs override her ability to prioritise her child. Ms Gillard would be very, very surprised if there are not a number of adoptive placements available. Long term foster care would &#8220;certainly not be&#8221; Ms Gillard&#8217;s first choice for LRP because such a placement would not offer her the security which can only arise from becoming part of an adoptive home.  </p>

The following is a summary of what I was told. The mother knows about the hearing and also that the local authority has issued an application for a placement order. She understands that is part of the necessary process when there is a plan to place a child with adoptive parents. The mother is content not to attend court and not to give further or more detailed instructions although she &#8220;does not want it to happen.&#8221; The mother, said Mr Squire, is keen to attend a final, &#8216;farewell&#8217; contact and together with the father. She knows that RP must attend a meeting with social workers before any such contact can be arranged; and that it would be a pre-condition of her own contact, given that she will only attend in his company. As for contact after LRP has moved to live with her adoptive family, the mother would ask that indirect contact should include photographs.</p>

He confirmed that he finds the proceedings particularly difficult given their proximity to the earlier February hearing. In the father&#8217;s mind, it has been likely &#8220;all along&#8221; that adoption would be the eventual outcome. He accepts there has been ample time for him to engage with his Solicitors and the proceedings. He knows the placement order application is available and understands the legal processes as the result of his experience in relation to TLP and ARP. He has no complaint about and is fully aware that the hearing will proceed in his absence. Miss Moore had no instructions to apply for an adjournment. He does not wish for the decision to be made that LRP should be made the subject of a placement order. If such an order is made, he would wish for there to be indirect contact as there is for the two boys and his two daughters by a previous relationship.</p>

Long term foster care is an extraordinarily precarious legal framework for any child, particularly one a young as LRP. Foster placements, long or short term, do not provide legal security. They can and often do come to an end. Children in long term care may find themselves moved from one home to another sometimes for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Long term foster parents are not expected to be fully committed to a child in the same way as adoptive parents. Most importantly of all in the current context, a long term foster child does not have the same and enduring sense of belonging within a family as does a child who has been adopted. There is no way in which a long term foster child can count on the permanency, predictability and enduring quality of his placement as can a child who has been adopted.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The disadvantage of making a placement order is that LRP will be deprived of an upbringing within her natural family. She will not be brought up by a mother who is obviously able to demonstrate pleasing emotional warmth and affection for her child or by a father who, similarly, can be appropriately tender when minded to show that side of himself. It may be, as Ms Gorbutt suggests, that in future LRP will need some professional assistance so as to deal with issues of loss and identity if she is not to be brought up within her natural family. But experience suggests that so long as the adoptive family deals openly and sensitively with those matters &#8211; and age appropriately as the child grows &#8211; the potential for problems is markedly reduced, even eliminated.</p>

They fail to recognise the realities, well known to all professionals who practice in the field. I mention the most obvious. First that the younger a child is placed within his / her permanent alternative family, the better the chance of a very successful outcome. Second that LRP is an infant child born to &#8220;White British&#8221; parents of average to good intelligence so that &#8216;family finding&#8217; for her should be entirely straightforward. Third, that there should be no difficulty at all in identifying a culturally appropriate placement.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The advantages of a placement order are many and obvious. Prospective adopters are required to submit themselves to a rigorous and very thorough assessment process over many months. Those who satisfy the selection criteria are ordinarily of the highest calibre. They may be confidently expected to provide extremely good parenting to any child who is matched with them in all areas of his / her development. They will protect LRP from harm of whatever kind. The overwhelming probability is that they will be able to provide her with the priceless gift of a happy, secure and stable childhood from which she will derive life-long advantages. </p>

In their heads and in their hearts they knew that their desire to be with one another would mean, almost certainly, that they would not succeed in being able to keep LRP.
