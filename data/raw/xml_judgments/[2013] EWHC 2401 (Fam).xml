The LA seeks a declaration that, in fact, her date of birth is [a date in] 1999. They are supported in their applications by Ms Smith, DN&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

Secondly, the judgment dated 24 May 2013 [2013] EWHC1433 (Fam) where I set out my decisions relating to welfare and made directions for this hearing to be listed today.</p>

I continued interim care orders in relation to DN as a result of the outstanding issue regarding her age and I made directions on that occasion so the court could consider that issue today. The harsh reality for DN is she has no family in this jurisdiction and efforts to trace her family in Cameroon have unfortunately been unsuccessful.</p>

She had recently been superseded by Jacqueline Graham, who has become the new allocated social worker for DN.  I also have an age assessment of DN from Ms Green, who is experienced in relation to assessing ages of children as she sets out in her assessment.  She has nine years of post qualifying social work experience, which includes four years&#8217; experience of assessing ages for the London Borough of  A and the London Borough of B.  She has two further years&#8217; experience of working with unaccompanied asylum seeking children with the Immigration Advisory Service as a legal caseworker.  In addition, I have a report from Ms Smith, who is an extremely experienced CAFCASS Guardian.  She too has experience in relation to undertaking age assessments in her previous life as a LA social worker.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">In terms of jurisdiction, Ms. Fottrell has very helpfully set out in her skeleton argument, supported by Mr. Church in his skeleton argument, an analysis of to the legal position.  The majority of cases that have dealt with age assessments have been within the context of judicial review proceedings, generally in the context of an issue as to whether an unaccompanied minor who has arrived in this jurisdiction and seeks assistance from the local authority is, or is not, eligible for that assistance as a result of their age.  Generally, the context is that LA has made an age assessment which takes them out of the LA obligations to that individual under the Children Act. The issue therefore is whether that assessment is susceptible to any legal challenge.</p>

There have been two previous cases that have considered this issue.  Firstly, in <span style="font-style:italic">E v London Borough of X [2005] EWHC 2811 </span>the then President, Sir Mark Potter, made a declaration as to age within wardship proceedings. The issue in that case was whether the child who was the subject matter of wardship proceedings was 16 years or 19 years.  He made a declaration as to the child's age, which had consequences as to whether a court had jurisdiction within wardship.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">Whilst these cases were primarily concerned with the issue of whether or not a person was a child, it is submitted that does not preclude the court from exercising its discretion as to issues of welfare from making a declaratory finding. In this case there is no issue, on either scenario regarding DN&#8217;s age, that the court would have jurisdiction to make a care order. This is not a case where the declaration would be determinative as to whether the court has jurisdiction or not, but it is submitted that DN's welfare demands that a declaration is made, in particular the welfare issue concerning her identity. I agree.  It is clearly a relevant consideration not only from the welfare checklist, one of the factors set out in section 1(3) is the child&#8217;s age, but it goes wider than that. In exercising its welfare jurisdiction (even in relation to a child who is on either scenario within the relevant provisions in the Children Act) it is important that the court should determine whether it is dealing with a child who is 13 </p>

She gave a different surname, a different date of birth and gave details of two brothers. She described her school in Cameroon. The statement records DN stating that her identity information was forged in order for her to gain entry to the UK, she was given a different date of birth by the father as she did not speak English and this would help her gain additional education. DN says she was told to call the parents &#8216;dad&#8217; and &#8216;mum&#8217;.  Following this information the LA has instructed a private investigator to make enquiries in Cameroon regarding DN. Unfortunately that has, to date, not revealed any tangible information. Ms Green acknowledged from DN`s perspective clarity regarding her age was needed, sooner rather than later as she is due to leave primary school this summer. If she was born in 1999 rather than 2001 that has implications for the arrangements for her secondary school education, which need to be planned in advance of the start of the next academic year.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">That position has been maintained by DN.  Ms Smith in her oral evidence in May and in her report repeated that is what DN had told her.  She reports DN being frustrated at having to live a lie.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">The need to make a declaration on welfare grounds is clear.  Up until June this year DN has been in primary school. Arrangements were made in June for DN to move to her secondary school where she is now.  She is going to go back to her primary school for a couple of social events before the end of term. She is going to do her year eight exams at the end of this academic term.  The effect of it is that she will be starting year nine in September 2013. She is going to have to cope with missing the first two years of secondary school.  Her welfare needs clearly demand that as much certainty as possible should be given in relation to her age prior to her starting the next academic year.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">Taking all those matters into account, I am entirely satisfied on the information that I have that in fact DN is older than she had been told to be by the Second Respondent in the care proceedings and that, on the balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that her date of birth is 20 October 1999, so she is 13 years and nine months. That is the declaration I will make.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">In terms of the care plan I have been asked to approve, I have considered its terms carefully.  There is no issue between the parties about that care plan being approved, although there are a number of matters that should be added in.  It is agreed that the local authority is going to instruct independent solicitors to establish the immigration position and make any necessary applications. In addition, the local authority will pursue a CICB claim on behalf of DN.  Those two matters will be in the recital to the order made today and also put in the amended care plan. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">Both of those matters are important for DN.  She has had to live a lie for a number of years for reasons that were beyond her control.  She now has clarity in relation to her situation, which will serve her well in the future and the two additions are also important for the security and stability that she clearly needs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.51in">The only other observation I would make in relation to the care plan is that the local authority remains concerned about the cultural appropriateness of DN&#8217;s placement.  Obviously, that is an important consideration for the local authority to review and consider.  However, on the information that I have, having been in this case for some time now, I would urge caution in relation to that.  If DN is settled where she is, if she has the benefit of contact with the younger three children and there is communication between the respective foster carers, the benefit of stability of placement, bearing in mind all the turmoil that has been going on in her life, particularly in relation to her education, may be of enormous benefit to her. </p>
