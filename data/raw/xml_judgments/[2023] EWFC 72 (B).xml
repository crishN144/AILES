Her parents are E and G.  I have reached my decision  after hearing a day and a half of evidence and submissions regarding contempt of Court in which I have already given judgment, and then the hearing of further evidence yesterday with submissions this morning about the ongoing child arrangements.  I have taken all the evidence over the last three days into account.</span></p>

The first order in this case, as I understand it, I have not seen it, was made by District&#160;Judge&#160;P in 2012, and that order split X&#8217;s time over a fortnight with eight&#160;nights spent with Mother and six&#160;nights with Father which is the closest that the arrangement has come to the 50/50 split that Father seeks.  In 2016, Her&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;C made an order splitting X&#8217;s time nine&#160;nights to Mother, five to Father with a section&#160;91(14) order.</span></p>

A penal notice was attached to that.  It is not clear to me from the papers, I do not have exactly what the breaches were, but there clearly had been non-compliance with the order by the father.  The effect was that District&#160;Judge&#160;B reduced the time that the child would spend with the father to indirect, supervised contact only, in January 2021.</span></p>

Father was focused instead on his conviction that the right order was for X to have half her time with each parent, and he was not prepared to accept less.</span></p>

She did also recommend that there might need to be a psychiatric assessment if a more detailed assessment was necessary.  Her report, to my mind, was inconclusive about the difficulties suffered by father but she did record that he had an inability to be reflective about his own behaviour and how it was harmful to X.  Dr&#160;Bailham did not think that the mother had a personality disorder and she did think that she showed some reflective thinking, although also her behaviour was influenced by some anxiety about X.</span></p>

By that time, there had been no order for X to spend time with her father since January&#160;2021.  If the orders had been adhered to, X would not have spent any time with him since that time.  However, in spite of the suspension of the previous order for contact, time together had in fact continued by way of father waylaying X on her way to or from school.  It is clear that during this period, X wanted to see him, and there are texts and reports by the Guardian which show this.</span></p>

He considered the idea that there should be no contact at all.  He considered continuing the order in similar terms to the order of October&#160;2020, and that is what he did, rejecting in clear terms a 50/50 split of time, but taking the view that a controlled and positive order was better and more likely to achieve a positive outcome for X than no order at all.  In fact, he increased the order slightly so that it included the child spending time with the father on Wednesdays as well.</span></p>

He was also clear that the problems for X were caused by the father.  He recognised that if there was more fighting and refusal of contact offered or refusal to comply with the order, his hopes would prove to have been misplaced.  That, sadly, is where we are now.

At that hearing, the Guardian made it clear she was intending to apply for committal, and directions were given to accommodate that, the application in fact being made on 11&#160;October.

The Guardian having, in June, started by recommending a very significant restriction on any sort of contact, had given it further thought and then recommended continued direct contact.  Before the Court this week, she has changed that view given the developments that have occurred since.  There were a number of considerations.  The child no longer wants to see any professionals.  The child has had enough after 10&#160;years and more.  The Guardian&#8217;s view was that it is impossible to know what the child wanted.  The child is torn between the parents.  The child needs some peace, and so the Guardian recommended no direct contact.  The Guardian could not see a way it could be made to work without it being used to apply pressure, or being breached and causing conflict.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s evidence.  It is thoughtful and considered, and it is given after a long acquaintance with this case.  That is not to suggest it covers the full length of the case; I realise in those terms that she has relatively recently been appointed, but it is still significant.</span></p>

It remains to be seen how long that will last, and I must take into account what has happened in the past.  His change of heart is apparently because of fear of going to prison, not because of contrition or an understanding of the effect of his behaviour.  He continues to show a lack of insight into his own responsibilities.  He continues to blame the mother and pursue his own agenda.  Through his evidence, he blames the mother, for example, for the incident in July last year, for coming to the house at all.  He appears to have expected others to accept, and when I say &#8220;others&#8221; I mean the mother and the Guardian, to accept his assurance that the child was fine, without allowing them to speak to her.  I find it difficult to understand why he thinks that is reasonable.  Also in fact, Mother&#8217;s evidence was that the child has since then said the opposite to the mother, that she was not being allowed to contact them.  Indeed, if X was fine, I do not understand why he did not let her speak.  Behaving in that way, and keeping X beyond the time she was meant to be with him, beyond the morning of 21&#160;July, is what caused the situation to go out of control.  It is not what the mother did.</span></p>

He gave his word that he would walk away from the conflicts.  He said an order for her to spend time with him would stop the conflict.  I recognise that it is hard for any parent when a couple splits up because it means inevitably that they cannot spend as much time as they used to with the child.  It is also hard for the child because most of them want just for their parents to get back together.</span></p>

I expect that in the future that will include a relationship with him, and I believe that Mother will encourage it if the conditions are right.

I am able, under section&#160;42 of the Family Law Act 1996 to make an order of my own motion, and that is what I am doing.  The terms need to be reconsidered.  When the prohibited steps order was considered before the Court, towards the end of last year, Father&#8217;s objection was that he wanted to be able to go to the supermarket when he liked.  I was satisfied that that was obstructive, that he could manage without going to the supermarket at precisely the moment when X was going to school, but I do recognise, I have not heard submissions about it, that there may be occasions when he needs to go somewhere else and leave first thing in the morning.  It seems to me that that can be dealt with by saying that he is restricted from going onto that road, on foot, between the hours of eight and nine, and three and four, and similar terms can be reflected in the non-molestation order.  If he is in a car, he should still not approach X.  That would be just as damaging as if he were on foot.</span></p>

Bearing in mind also that X has not wanted to speak to the Court, I am considering writing a letter to her, directly after these proceedings.  I would like to hear what the Guardian thinks about it, but it would be a short, simple letter.  It is not an easy letter to navigate because of course it must not upset her.  However, it is likely to say something along the lines of that her father loves her, her father wants to spend time with her, but the Court has decided that that is not the best thing for her at the moment.</span></p>
