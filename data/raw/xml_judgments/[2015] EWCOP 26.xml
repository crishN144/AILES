		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;In the following months the realisation came that the appointment type had been wrongly entered on the EPA. I did not discuss this with my sister at the time due to our difficult relationship but hoped that she would come to this conclusion herself before the EPA needed to be registered. It seems that mum did not discuss it with her either. Some time during the spring/summer of 2008 mum and I discussed this with her sister Norma Ball and I reprinted the front pages from the internet. We changed the second page of the EPA to reflect mum&#8217;s wishes of joint and several attorneys, since we all agreed this to be in her best long term interests especially given the contact between my sister and me. We were aware that the option to draw up a new EPA had then passed. On this occasion I filled in the detail on page 2 as requested by mum, as she often asked me to do since she was finding writing increasingly difficult probably due to a small TIA (mini stroke) affecting the fine controlling of her right/dominant arm, diagnosed in 2007. It did not occur to any of us that this amendment should be dated and signed &#8211; either through naivety or ignorance but certainly not through malevolence. With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see the error of our ways and that we should probably have drawn up an LPA at that point. This document was them effectively &#8220;put in a drawer&#8221; and forgotten about until 2013.&#8221; </p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The respondents disagree about whether they and ED were present at the execution of the EPA or what discussions had taken place about it with their mother. Both agree that ED was a frugal person and did not want a solicitor to be involved in the process.</p>

		  </subparagraph>
		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">They differ too on why the choice of appointment as joint was made &#8211; GB saying it was ED&#8217;s active choice to ensure that both daughters acted together; JD saying that this was based on her mistaken understanding of the term, presumably a mistake made by ED.</p>

		  </subparagraph>
		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The Public Guardian&#8217;s position is that the guidance on the EPA forms at the time was reasonably clear and in simple language. ED is no longer able to confirm how much understanding of the two forms of appointment she had. Of the two statements it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of JD would misunderstand the difference in appointment types when it seemed so important, and would not think to contact a solicitor, the OPG or some other source of legal information before signing.</p>

		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">GB makes no comment on this, on the basis that the EPA was not within her control after it was signed by the parties.

		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Again, while this seems plausible, it is alarming to see an attempt by reasonably educated people at amending an important legal document without any witnessing being attempted or legal advice being taken, and which, if JD is to be believed, only compounded the first error.</p>
		    </content>
		  </subparagraph>
		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In any event, the position of the Public Guardian remains the same as previously &#8211; that, as the document was incorrectly amended after execution the deed presented to the Public Guardian was not the same deed as the donor created and has no legal effect. The court is therefore invited to revoke the registration of the EPA since it cannot be &#8216;rescued&#8217; by either means suggested by the respondents.</p>

Accordingly we recommend that anyone who makes a statement in his registration application that he knows to be false in a material particular should be guilty of an offence.&#8221;</p>

The master considered that that fact alone rendered any one of them unsuitable to be Mrs W&#8217;s attorney. In my judgment such hostility may well have such consequences but it all depends on the circumstances. For example, had the estate of Mrs W been complex and had it required strategic decisions in relation to its administration, one would expect the attorney to have had to consult and work with her siblings in relation to the administration. In such circumstances the evident hostility between them would impact adversely on the stewardship of the attorney, no matter who was at fault in creating the hostility in the first place. &#8230;</p>
