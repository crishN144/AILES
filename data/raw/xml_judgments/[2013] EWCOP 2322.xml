	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal issue to be determined in this judgment in proceedings brought in the Court of Protection is whether a 24-year-old man, whom I shall hereafter refer to as TZ, has the capacity to consent to sexual relations.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue falls to be determined by the court in somewhat unusual circumstances in that, whereas the applicant in the proceedings, namely the local authority for the area in which TZ lives, and the Official Solicitor, who is acting as TZ&#8217;s litigation friend in the proceedings, both agree that he does have capacity to consent to sexual relations, the expert psychiatrist instructed in these proceedings, hereafter referred to as Dr X, is of the opinion that he does not have that capacity. Thus this court must make the decision on that issue.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to capacity to consent to sexual relations, issues have been raised as to whether TZ has other capacities namely (1) to litigate (2) to make decisions as to his residence (3) to make decisions as to his contact with other people, and (4) to make decisions as to his care needs. All parties and Dr X are agreed that TZ lacked the capacity to litigate and I shall accordingly make a declaration to that effect. So far as the capacity to make decisions as to residence is concerned, the applicant contends that TZ lacks that capacity but the Official Solicitor submits that it is unnecessary to make any declaration as to that issue because TZ is currently settled and no decision as to his residence arises at this time. For reasons explained below, I accept the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission on that issue. As for the other capacities in issue &#8211; the capacity to make decisions as to contact with other people, and as to his care needs &#8211; it became apparent in the course of the hearing that I should adjourn those issues for an addendum report from Dr X and further legal argument. That is unfortunate, particularly as these proceedings have been continuing for over two-and-a-half years before finally coming before me, but I reluctantly conclude that a further adjournment is necessary to enable the court to make the right decision on these points. For TZ, the key question which he is anxious to be resolved is as to whether he has the capacity to consent to sexual relations.</p>

His mother was only 17 years old when he was born and struggled to look after him and his younger brother. In 1992, TK and his brother were taken into the care of the local authority and placed with foster carers, Mr and Mrs Z. In 1994, both boys were adopted by Mr and Mrs Z. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his teenage years, there were various reports of inappropriate sexual behaviour between TZ and his brother. In January 2010, TZ left the home of his adoptive parents and sought out his natural family. His spent some time with his mother and other relations. Through them, he came into contact with a number of people who, it is now clear, took advantage of and ill-treated him. In the course of 2010, he took on the tenancy of a flat but professional agencies involved in providing him with support became concerned about a range of matters including his lifestyle, spending, personal hygiene and health. Towards the end of 2010, he re-established contact with his adoptive parents but then fell out with them again. </p>

A district judge made interim declarations pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> that there was reason to believe that TZ lacked capacity to litigate, to make decisions about where he should reside, and to make decisions about the contact he should have with A and others. In March 2011, with the assistance of his adoptive parents, TZ left the flat at which he had been living with A. He subsequently repeated his assertion that he had been sexually assaulted by A. That allegation was investigated by the local constabulary but they decided not to pursue any charges against A. </p>

An injunction was made against A to prevent him from attempting to remove or encourage TZ to leave H Home and further restraining A from having any contact with TZ. Directions were also given for the future conduct of the case, including permission for the parties to instruct an expert psychiatrist, Dr X, to advise as to TZ&#8217;s capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his first report dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2011, Dr X concluded that TZ lacked capacity to litigate in these proceedings, make decisions regarding his residence and care, make decisions as to his contact with other people, or to consent to sexual relations, whether heterosexual or homosexual. Subsequently the parties addressed certain supplemental questions to Dr X who provided answers in an addendum report dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012. In that addendum, he confirmed his previous opinion as to TZ&#8217;s capacity, and advised that the contents of his report should be disclosed and discussed with TZ.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following that addendum report, a further series of directions hearings took place before His Honour Judge Tyzack QC, to whom the case had been transferred. By an order dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012, the court authorised a care plan for TZ to reside at H Home. The learned judge further directed that a hearing should be listed before a judge of the High Court to determine the issues concerning TZ&#8217;s capacity. By a further order dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012, Judge Tyzack declared the court had reason to believe that TZ lacked capacity to make decisions about contact with members of his birth family and make interim orders restricting his contact with them. </p>

It was further declared that it was in TZ&#8217;s best interests to receive an appropriate package of sexual education to facilitate his capacity to consent to sexual relations. Furthermore, it was agreed that the conclusions of Dr X&#8217;s report would be reduced to a written statement in terms that TZ would be able to understand and the contents of that statement shared with TZ at a specially convened meeting. Furthermore, the court gave permission for the parties to instruct an independent sexual health specialist to provide a report setting out how much knowledge a person should possess to be deemed to have capacity to consent to sexual relations and where TZ lies along that spectrum of knowledge. </p>

In addition, TZ participated in a programme of sex education. A further report was prepared by a consultant physician specialising in sexual health, Professor R, who concluded:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;TZ has some knowledge of the mechanics and risk of sexual intercourse, and the potential for these risks to be reduced by using condoms. In my opinion, and in making comparison with the general population of sexually active individuals, his level of knowledge does reach the threshold of &#8216;rudimentary&#8217; for the mechanics of sexual intercourse, awareness of associated health risks with respect to sexually transmitted infections (and that a condom can potentially reduce these risks) and that sex between the man and the woman may result in pregnancy.&#8221;</p>

Following the implementation of the directions made by Judge Tyzack, the matter was listed before me for a full hearing in July 2013. </p>

The first stage, sometimes called the &#8220;diagnostic test&#8221;, involves determining whether the person has such an impairment or disturbance. The second stage, sometimes known as the &#8220;functional test&#8221;, involves determining whether the impairment or disturbance renders the person unable to make the decision &#8211; that is to say, as provided in s.3, unable to (a) understand the information relevant to the decision; (b) retain that information; (c) use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or (d) communicate his decision whether by talking, using sign language or any other means.

It is well established that capacity to marry is to be assessed in general and as a matter of principle and not by reference to any particular proposed marriage: see the decision of Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sheffield City Council v E</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 326</ref>, approved by the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PC</span> case (supra) at paragraph 23 of McFarlane LJ&#8217;s judgment.

One does not consent to sex in general. One consents to this act of sex with this person at this time and in this place. Autonomy entails the freedom and the capacity to make a choice of whether or not to do so. This is entirely consistent with the respect for autonomy in matters of private life which is guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

Far from it. I do think, with the greatest possible respect, that there has been a conflation of capacity to consent to sex and the exercise of that capacity. There is also a very considerable practical problem in allowing a partner-specific dimension into the test. Consider this case. Is the local authority supposed to vet every proposed sexual partner of Alan to gauge if Alan has the capacity to consent to sex with him or her?&#8221;</p>

Specifically, he would have difficulty with the question: &#8220;if I do this with that person, how is this going to work out?&#8221; The problem lay not so much with his cognitive difficulties but rather with the impulsivity that is a feature of his ADHD, coupled with &#8220;his social tendency to trust people in an unexamined way&#8221;. It was suggested to Dr. X that this was confusing an incapacitous decision with an unwise one. It was further suggested that his reference in the passage in his report (cited above) to a &#8220;complex analysis of risks and benefits often in the abstract and hypothetical&#8221; was imposing too high a test.

In his own evidence &#8211; which took the form of a relatively informal discussion in the well of the court &#8211; I formed the clear view that TZ had an understanding of the mechanics of the sexual acts involved in both homosexual and heterosexual relations. He also demonstrated an understanding of the health risks involved in sexual relations and of the methods of avoiding and dealing with those risks. I consider that his knowledge about those matters was more than rudimentary. He plainly has, in Munby J&#8217;s phrase, an understanding of the sexual nature of the act. In this context, it is significant that he has an understanding of his own sexuality, and of how it has evolved from bisexuality to homosexuality. TZ was clear about his own orientation, but in any event it is plain that he does understand that sexual intercourse between a man and a woman can result in pregnancy. It was also clear to me that he had retained information given to him at various stages about these matters, including information imparted during the sex education sessions he has attended.

Impulsivity is a component in most sexual behaviour. Human society would be very different if such choices were made the morning after rather than the night before. As <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(4)</ref> of the MCA reminds us, a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me, with respect, that Dr. X is making a similar error as that made by the expert in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">D Borough Council v AB</span> when he stipulates that the ability to use and weigh relevant information before consenting to sexual relations involves &#8220;a complex analysis of risks and benefits often in the abstract and hypothetical&#8221;.  In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">D Borough Council v AB</span>, the expert suggested that one essential ingredient of capacity to consent to sexual relations was &#8220;an awareness that sex is part of having relations with people and may have emotional consequences&#8221;. Mostyn J observed in response (at paragraph 37):</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;This criterion is much too sophisticated to be included in the low level of understanding and intelligence needed to be able to consent to sex. Apart from anything else, I would have thought that a great deal of sex takes place where one party or the other is wholly oblivious to this supposed necessity.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most people faced with the decision whether or not to have sex do not embark on a process of weighing up complex, abstract or hypothetical information. I accept the submission on behalf of the Official Solicitor that the weighing up of the relevant information should be seen as a relatively straightforward decision balancing the risks of ill health (and possible pregnancy if the relations are heterosexual) with pleasure, sexual and emotional brought about by intimacy. There is a danger that the imposition of a higher standard for capacity may discriminate against people with a mental impairment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, I am satisfied in this case, having spoken to TZ myself, that he does have an understanding of the need to weigh up the emotional consequences of having sexual relations. This was evident to me from his comment that he would rather not rush things, but would rather wait to see if he could trust the man and by his observation that &#8220;sometimes it&#8217;s easy to make the right choice, sometimes it isn&#8217;t, but I would try to make the right choice.&#8221; This insight seemed to me to be well above the level of &#8220;rudimentary&#8221; ability required. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I find that TZ does have the capacity to use and weigh the information to the degree required for capacity to consent to sexual relations. I think he has been significantly helped in that regard by the sensitive programme of sex education he has received. Like most people, he may behave impulsively at some point in the future, and in his case that tendency may be accentuated by his ADHD, but I do not consider that this tendency means that he lacks the ability to use and weigh the relevant information.</p>

I would be grateful if the parties&#8217; advocates could agree a form of words for a further order setting out my findings in this judgment.</p>
