	      <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">A Transparency Order was made by Mr Justice Mostyn on 6 November 2020. It prohibits the publication or communication, or anyone causing, enabling, assisting in or encouraging the publication or communication, of material and information that identifies or is likely to identify the person who is the subject of these proceedings, any member of her family, any member of her treating team who has taken part or being referred to in these proceedings, or where those persons live or are being cared for, or any material that identifies or would be likely to identify the applicant Trust or the second respondent local authority. His order remains in force but, following application by PA Media Group, made after I delivered my <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment at the hearing, but before publication of the judgment in writing, I have amended the order and directed that the parties shall be referred to as follows: </p>

She has physical disabilities requiring support aids for walking more than short distances, and suffers bilateral optic nerve atrophy. KB is an adult but her learning disability means that she is not capable of independent living. Her communication is largely non-verbal and confined to a very few words. </p>

Until recent events, daytime care was provided by members of her family, sometimes at KB&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home, and two personal assistants who were funded by direct payments. KB also attended a day centre three times a week, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic she has been unable to visit there since March 2020. </p>

I have also read witness statements from the consultant obstetrician, midwife and consultant anaesthetist who are leading KB&#8217;s management and care at the hospital where she will give birth. Even with support and assistance KB is wholly unable to understand that she is pregnant let alone what that will entail in terms of her need for obstetric care. Significant care has been taken to try to support her to understand that she is pregnant and how to recognise and report symptoms that might indicate difficulties for the baby or for her, such as headaches, bleeding or reduced fetal movements. The consultant obstetrician says that at her first meeting with KB, when she was present with her mother, &#8220;My clear conclusion was that she had no understanding of the pregnancy, of a baby growing within her and of the reasons for the examination.&#8221; The midwife has tried at a series of meetings with KB to assist her understanding but says &#8220;My assessment is that KB lacked capacity to understand the information shared.&#8221; That is also the clear view of the ASW. </p>

The expected delivery date is 3 December 2020. The Trust submits, and the other parties agree, that it is in KB&#8217;s best interests to undergo an elective Caesarean section under regional anaesthesia on 16 November 2020 and to receive the necessary obstetric and other care as the clinicians deem appropriate as set out in the birth plan. </p>

She does not know that she is pregnant, she would not be able to understand why she would need anaesthesia, or what would happen at a vaginal delivery or a Caesarean section. Her antenatal and obstetric care will be likely to involve interventions such as examinations, the use of needles for taking blood and for intravenous access, the insertion of a catheter, monitoring, the administration of analgesia, anaesthesia, and the Caesarean section itself. KB would not understand what was happening to her or the reasons for any of those interventions. Her lack of understanding due to the brain damage suffered at birth, is such that it is not possible to ascertain her beliefs and values or her past and present wishes and feelings about the proposed obstetric care and manner of delivery of her child. She has had the support of an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate as well as the Official Solicitor. They and her mother and sister agree with the recommendation for an elective Caesarean section as the most appropriate mode of delivery. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">The plan for elective Caesarean section at 38 weeks gestation is designed to achieve delivery prior to spontaneous labour. Caesarean section is a serious surgical intervention. It does involve risk.  However, the alternative is to trial vaginal delivery at or around term. The process of labour is complex and involves hour by hour, sometimes minute by minute, decision-making. Multiple examinations would be required. Urgent decisions might well have to be made. The process of labour and vaginal birth would be particularly distressing to KB because of her lack of understanding of what was happening to her.  It is very unlikely that she would understand or be able to comply with instructions that might have to be given such as not to push, to move position, or to control her breathing. It is very unlikely that she would be able to communicate to the clinicians her pain or symptoms. Apart from the distress caused to KB, these difficulties would increase the risk of complications. A trial of vaginal delivery would not prevent the risk of the need for assisted delivery or even an urgent or emergency Caesarean section, and KB would be unable to understand what was happening let alone be able to contribute to the urgent decisionmaking required in such circumstances. It would be unconscionable to put KB through the experience of labour and trial of vaginal delivery when an elective Caesarean section is an alternative choice. </p>

Second, because the proposed treatment may require a degree of restraint.

KB is a very vulnerable woman who would not comprehend why she was being taken to hospital. The evidence to date is that KB has been entirely compliant with visiting hospital, and examinations, save for recoiling when palpated during one examination. Nevertheless, authorisation is sought as set out above in the event that she is not compliant in the future. KB has human rights under Art 5 and Art 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and it is troubling to be asked to authorise the deprivation of her liberty and the use of restraint if necessary, but the far more alarming prospect is of her not receiving the obstetric treatment that she will obviously need in the days ahead of this hearing.

Ultimately no decision was made whether or not it was in her best interests to undergo a termination. It was not possible for KB to undergo a termination after the consultant obstetrician saw KB on 27 August 2020 by which time she was over 25 weeks pregnant. The Official Solicitor&#8217;s concern is not that it would have been in KB&#8217;s best interests to undergo a termination in early August 2020, but that the question was not properly addressed in a timely fashion. </p>

The first antenatal appointment with the Trust was on 5 August 2020 when it was recorded that KB was 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">+3</span> weeks pregnant. The issue of termination was raised on numerous occasions in early August at safeguarding meetings, and in correspondence. There was concern that KB&#8217;s mother would be strongly opposed not only on religious grounds but also because she did not seem to be unhappy that her daughter was pregnant. I do not know if those perceptions were justified or not, having not heard from KB&#8217;s mother. On 8 August, when KB was 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">+6</span> weeks pregnant the consultant obstetrician was copied in to correspondence from a midwife which raised concern that the first appointment with the obstetrician would not be until 27 August when KB would be over 24 weeks pregnant and it would be too late to consider whether to terminate the pregnancy. That is exactly what happened. The consultant obstetrician says by the time she saw KB it was in effect too late to consider a termination and that termination would involve inducing labour which would be traumatic for KB. </p>

The Official Solicitor&#8217;s concern that a best interests decision about termination should have been taken promptly in the exceptional circumstances of this case, appears to me to be justified. However, the role of the Court of Protection is forward looking and it is not for me now to make a detailed inquiry into why that was not done at the time. I am pleased to note that the order includes a recital that the Trust and the Local Authority have agreed to review the circumstances of this case in respect of the decision regarding termination.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">In the present case the Official Solicitor was notified weeks after the date when she should have been. As a result the Official Solicitor has had to deal with a complex and sensitive case at very short notice. The Trust recognises that there was delay in this case. The delay has not prevented KB from receiving what appears to be exemplary clinical care. The court and the Official Solicitor recognise that the current Covid-19 pandemic places restrictions on the Trust and that this is a complex and difficult case involving an allegation of rape, consideration of termination, and liaison with many different professionals and agencies. Those factors provide more reason than otherwise to involve the Official Solicitor as soon as possible. The </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">The issue of contraception, including by sterilisation is complex. I do not need to go into the principles to be applied in this judgment because the parties are agreed that directions should be given today with a view to resolving the issue in early 2021. I am not being asked to make any final declaration or order about contraception and I am content to make the directions sought. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">An order for the non-therapeutic sterilisation of a person with learning difficulties would be a draconian step and one only rarely authorised by the court. In this case, decisions about contraception, including sterilisation, are entwined with issues concerning KB&#8217;s care and safeguarding. As has been noted by the allocated social worker, if KB were in a safe environment she would not need contraception. The current position is that the perpetrator of the sexual assault on KB has yet to be identified. His identification will inform decisions about safeguarding, residence, and care in the future. Depending upon those arrangements, the need for this court to make any decision on contraception may resolve itself. The directions will allow for further evidence to be obtained, a round table meeting in January, and court directions if needed in early February 2021. </p>
