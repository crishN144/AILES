He confirmed that he would file the documents required by r.15.5(4).

She has become increasingly distressed, easily overwhelmed, fatigued, panicky and at times desperate. Her mood is one of hopelessness and depression and she lacks any normal sense of pleasure and enjoyment from activities that she would normally enjoy. She is able to function at a very basic level on a daily basis using daily tasks as a distraction from the distress that she feels. Her sleep is currently disturbed by recurrent waking and she feels unrefreshed on waking. Panic attacks occur most days lasting ten to f&#8204;ifteen minutes characterised by shortness of breath &#8216;freezing' and not knowing what to do or what she is doing at times. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">My impression is that Mrs Richardson is suffering from a major depressive episode arising as a direct result of the above Court proceedings, their complexity and her inability of late to pay for legal representation. She saw her General Practitioner shortly before Christmas who started her on antidepressant medication, however she was unable to tolerate this and stopped after a few days. Her condition is of a severity that further pharmacological treatments in addition to continuing with psychotherapy is indicated, however in view of the current time scale with Court proceedings and the fact that most antidepressants take two to four weeks before a therapeutic response can be seen, I felt it was better to delay any further pharmacological strategies until the present hearing is over particularly given that the side effects are common in the early stages of treatment. In terms of the current proceedings, I do not think that Ms Richardson is well enough to represent herself. The toll that this has taken on her is considerable and I can only see her condition worsening particularly given that indecision as well as focus and concentration issues are common depressive symptoms which will make it extremely diff&#8204;icult for her to make rational decisions and also an inability to deal with such complex legal issues that she is not trained in. I would respectfully request that the Court allow for this pending funds being available for appropriate legal representation.&#8221;</p>

He answered the questions that were put to him directly without any embroidery or rhetoric. It was a model of how expert evidence should be given. He was taken to sections 2 and 3 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and asked to give his opinion as to the wife&#8217;s capacity as defined by the statute. He was asked to consider a number of hypothetical analogues such as making a will, negotiating damages after a personal injury, and buying a house with restrictive covenants and other title issues. He was then asked to consider the husband&#8217;s variation applications with which the wife was to be confronted as a litigant in person on 21 January 2021. His evidence was consistent and clear. In each of these scenarios he was of the view that the wife would have capacity to make the relevant decisions if, and only if, she had the benefit of legal advice and representation. If she did not have legal advice then he did not think that she would be capable of navigating the legal complexities in each scenario. He considered that acting alone she would be disabled by her medical condition from being able to make the necessary decisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Second, it means that in relation to the capacity to conduct litigation, that capacity does not have an absolute quantum, but rather varies depending on the presence, or otherwise, of legal advice and representation.

In truth, such judicial statements, made in the context of a different issue from that with which we are concerned, are of little assistance. But they serve to reinforce the point that, on the defendant&#8217;s argument, the claimant&#8217;s capacity would depend on whether she had received good advice, bad advice or no advice at all. If she had received good advice or if she had received no advice at all but brought her claim as a litigant in person, then she would lack the capacity to make the decisions which her claim required of her. But if, as in this case, she received bad advice, she possessed the capacity to make the decisions required of her as a result of that bad advice. This cannot be right.&#8221;</p>
