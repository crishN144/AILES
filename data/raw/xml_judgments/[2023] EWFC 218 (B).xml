Nottinghamshire County Council (<span style="font-weight:bold">"the local authority"</span>) applies for&#160;a&#160;care order.  The first respondent is BE.  She is G's mother (<span style="font-weight:bold">"the mother"</span>).  The second respondent is LE.  He is G's Father (<span style="font-weight:bold">"the father"</span>).  In my first judgment concerning these parties the father&#8217;s name was incorrectly reversed. That was an error all the advocates also fell into up until the middle of the first day of this hearing.  I apologise to the father for that.  I did not mean any discourtesy to him by relying on the witness statements and documents prepared by his solicitor which reversed his name incorrectly.  I will refer to the mother and father collectively as <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;the parents&#8221;</span>.  The third respondent is G himself.  His interests are represented by the children's guardian (<span style="font-weight:bold">"the children's guardian"</span>).</p>

Amongst other things, I was told that Dr Rukhsana Farooqi, the most recently instructed independent social worker, would give oral evidence.  There were no written questions or answers to written questions in the bundle, which I had fully read by that date.  I replied to the advocates to say such a request would not be considered in the absence of an application for relief from sanctions under rule 4.6&#160;of the Family Procedure Rules 2010&#160;("<span style="font-weight:bold">the Rules</span>") and Dr Farooqi would not give oral evidence in the absence of relief being granted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">On Tuesday 29&#160;August, the child's solicitor filed an application for relief from sanctions.  In her witness statement Ms&#160;Davis apologised for&#160;a&#160;genuine oversight and said the challenge to Dr&#160;Farooqi was at the heart of the child's interests.  The application was supported whole-heartedly by the local authority.  The parents did not oppose relief being granted, although they rely on the report&#8217;s contents and do not challenge it.  I was satisfied it was in the interests of justice to grant relief as cross-examination of the report strikes at the heart of the issues in the case and that it would be unfair to hold the parties strictly to my orders. The Court was informed by the parties that Dr Farooqi would give evidence remotely.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">By my order of 12&#160;May 2023, directions were made for the management of this hearing.  That included prohibiting examination-in-chief, given how close to this hearing the parties' witness statements were prepared, and confining all examination and submissions to two, four hour days.  In Ms&#160;Howell's email, I received&#160;a&#160;witness template proposing 15&#160;hours 25&#160;minutes of court time for examination of witnesses and that did not include any time for submissions, judicial consideration of the case and time for delivering judgment.  Ms Hodges told me the times allocated to her name were not prepared by her.</p>

I invited representations from the parties on the allocation of their times prior to exercising the Court's powers under rule 1&#160;and rule 22 of the Rules&#160;to control the evidence.  The Court received only the briefest of representations.  I therefore exercised these powers by limiting cross-examination.  In doing so, at the heart of my exercise of these powers was the need to ensure the fairness of the proceedings and promote the overriding objective in rule 1 of the Rules.  </p>

He had not prepared written evidence.  That request was formally opposed by the children's guardian.  Given what is at stake in the case and the positions put forward by the parents, I judged on balance it was fair to permit examination of PK, despite the impact this would have on the management of the hearing.  To accommodate PK's evidence, the first day of the hearing concluded at 5.15&#160;pm.  </p>

Much can be lost in the process, including glitching, it being difficult to hear questions and answers, as well as being able to clearly see the participants.  Unfortunately, there were times when both the Court and the advocates were required to stop Dr Farooqi or ask to repeat her evidence because it could not be heard clearly.  The technology was sub-optimal.  In addition, Dr Farooqi was not always helped by questions that invited more wide-ranging answers when they may have been more focused.   Considering all the above, I ensured I exclude from my evaluation of Dr Farooqi&#8217;s evidence the form and manner in which it was given and instead studied the underlying quality of the evidence and the analysis presented to the Court.  </p>

The social worker does not consider it would be in G's best interests for him to experience the stress involved in being assessed within the family home and considers there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the parents would not be able to meet G's needs if he was returned to their care, even considering the proposed support plan.</p>

I do not accept her evidence that she understands why professionals think this is needed for G.  It is noteworthy that, despite the No.1 judgment and despite all the meetings the mother had with Dr Farooqi and other professionals, Dr Farooqi tells the Court that it was not until the "last meeting [the mother] accepted she needed to do this".

She is likely to cause significant harm to G because she is not attuned to his needs and unable to effectively manage his dysregulation.

The harm to G of losing his placement would be profound, as if taking him to &#8220;another planet&#8221;.  It would cause the inversion of his world, significant disruption and, as I sit here, I do not know where he would go.  That is&#160;a&#160;risk to G which I do not take lightly.  </p>

He would have the smells, sounds and experiences of his family home that bring him peace, comfort, pleasure and help him avoid dysregulation.  His cultural and religious needs would be met and alongside him being with his parents, he would have&#160;a&#160;care team that would support him whilst he is with them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">There are, however, significant disadvantages that would flow from making&#160;a&#160;care order on the basis that G lives in his parents' home.  I judge the parents would quite quickly drift from implementing the advice of professionals in preference for their own views.  I judge the mother would likely resume&#160;a&#160;significant role in caring for G because the mother's view as to the necessity of her stepping back is not one which she accepts or understands.  G would likely suffer all the disadvantages described in the Court&#8217;s evaluation of the application for him to be assessed at home under section 38(6). </p>

It is not the Court&#8217;s task to look at the local authority's proposal and measure it against whether it would be better than the parents' care or whether G would develop better in Spring Home, because&#160;a&#160;final care order on such&#160;a&#160;plan must be necessary and the Court must be willing to tolerate harm and imperfections resulting from parental care for the reasons outlined by Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Care: threshold criteria)</span>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment,&#160;a&#160;care order and approval of the local authority's plan is necessary.  It is&#160;a&#160;proportionate response to the risk of significant harm that G faces if he is in his parents' care, which I judge cannot otherwise be ameliorated.  The harm that G will suffer by remaining in local authority care under its plan is outweighed by the greater risk of harm he faces if the Court does not make that order.  There is no other order that can achieve that end.  It is in G's best interests.  </p>
