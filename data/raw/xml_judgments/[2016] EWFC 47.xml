	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has a most unusual litigation history, which will be apparent from what I have outlined above, and discuss more fully below.  To set the scene, reference should usefully be made to the judgment which I delivered at the conclusion of a Case Management hearing on 6 May 2016 (<span style="font-style:italic">Re RA (Baby Relinquished for Adoption: Case Management)</span> [2016] EWFC 25).  I summarised the issues then before the court at [2] ibid., and set out the essence of my case management decisions at [5].  It will be seen that at that stage, in spite of the wish of the birth parents to relinquish RA without involvement of their families, MGM had been identified as a potential carer for RA, and a provisional assessment of her had been undertaken.  At that time, I requested the Central Authority of Latvia to file a full assessment of MGM, I gave permission to the prospective adopters to file evidence, and I directed an expert report on RA&#8217;s nationality.  I directed the listing of the final hearing before me.  Funding issues for MGM frustrated attempts to list the case in July, so I arranged for it to be heard during vacation so as to reduce any further delay and anguish for the families involved.  Funding difficulties continued to bedevil the case, and I am particularly grateful to those who for periods of time worked <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> in order to prepare the case for final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A three-day hearing took place from 30 August to 1 September; for reasons more fully explained below, the birth parents played no part.  I heard evidence from the prospective adopters, MGM, the social worker, and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  I reserved judgment.  The decision on the applications identified at [1(i)] and [1(ii)] above, and an earlier version of this judgment in draft, was circulated to the lawyers for the parties (but not to the parties themselves) on 9 September with an indication that the judgment would formally be handed down on 29 September. On 22 September, the solicitor for the Local Authority wrote to my clerk in these terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">In light of this, I indicated that I would not after all hand down judgment on 29 September, and I convened a hearing on notice to all parties on 4 October.  The mother, appearing in person, confirmed at that hearing her wish to oppose the adoption, and indicated that she had made an application to that effect, supported by a statement. I therefore listed her application for leave to oppose on 10 October.  At that hearing, I received additional written evidence from the local authority and Children&#8217;s Guardian, and heard oral evidence from the birth mother (the birth father was not in attendance), the social worker and Children&#8217;s Guardian; I received submissions of the parties.  This judgment deals with all of the applications.</p>

RA's parents took him straight to hospital where they left him; they did not return to visit him, and have not seen him since. He remained on the Special Care Baby Unit until 24 September 2015. The Local Authority was notified of RA's presence on the ward on the day after his birth, and the social worker urgently contacted the parents to discuss plans for his care. On RA's discharge from hospital, and with parents' agreement, he was placed with a couple, Mr. and Mrs. D, who are 'Early Permanence Foster Parents' (foster parents approved to adopt). He has been with them ever since &#8211; altogether 30 weeks, more than three-quarters of his life at the present time. </p>

Of the wide assortment of considerations which will be relevant to the court's appraisal of their situation, Mr. and Mrs. D are likely to be able to demonstrate to a convincing degree that many of them point to a conclusion that it would be in RA's best interests for an adoption order to be made; they can surely maintain (among other considerations) that RA will benefit from the continuity of care which they have provided to him, that RA is settled in the only home he has known and has formed attachments to them, that he has been introduced to and has fledgling relationships with the wider extended family, that he is geographically close to his birth mother, father and siblings should he wish to contact them in the future.&#8221;</p>

The depth of their feeling towards RA, who is in every sense an integral part of their lives, was virtually tangible.  The Ds expressed themselves keen to foster RA&#8217;s heritage as a Latvian child by birth, and have researched ways of doing so. They are keen to embark on life story work, and give the strong impression of being a couple who are not fearful of opening RA&#8217;s eyes to his birth family in that context. They support mutual indirect contact between RA and his birth parents and separately with MGM.</p>

Emotionally, however, they simply cannot bring themselves to consider it at all.  I accept Ms Branigan QC&#8217;s submission that the Ds would undoubtedly do their best for RA whatever was required of them, even if it meant handing him over to his natural parent or relative.  But they would, in my view, be emotionally torn apart to have do so.   Significantly, when asked to consider this scenario, I was struck by the fact that it was the likely effect on RA of removal from their care which was their first and instinctive concern, not their own feelings. </p>

The psychologist described MGM as having &#8220;a level of responsibility&#8221; towards her grandson; this sense of duty to offer RA a home was a strong theme of her evidence.  Although advancing a case to assume the care of RA at this hearing, she told me (as indeed she had told the psychologist) that in fact the best outcome would be for RA to be cared for by his birth mother and father; unsurprisingly, therefore, at the hearing on 10 October, MGM supported the mother&#8217;s application for leave to oppose the adoption.</p>

Ms. Branigan relied on comments of Sir James Munby P in the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (A child)(Early Permanence Placement)</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 983 in seeking to make good this case.  I consider <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> distinguishable on its facts in a number of respects, most notably that the EPP carers in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> were, at the time at which their role was being debated, only at the <span style="font-style:italic">fostering</span> stage and had not been approved for <span style="font-style:italic">adoption</span> of the child.   Since January, RA has been with the Ds in an <span style="font-style:italic">adoptive</span> placement.  RA has lived with them virtually all of his life (not the &#8220;unexceptional time&#8221; for which the carers had cared for the child in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> &#8211; see [51]).  The legal status of the placement at the point of the challenge is significant, as is the reasonable expectations which accompany that status (irrespective of any potentially misleading representations which were made by the local authority at the time, see [30] below).  A further, final, and crucial point is that RA is oblivious to whether Mr. and Mrs. D are at any one time fosterers or prospective adopters; he just knows them as his parents. </p>

The case proceeded on the basis that in the event that the adoption application failed, they would seek to care for him in preference to RA being placed with MGM (as the mother had indicated in her April 2016 statement). It is fair to observe that while initially the birth parents rationalised their relinquishment of RA by reference to their own perceived practical difficulties in caring for him and their wish to promote an English life for him, by the time of the hearing they seemed &#8211; from their discussions with professionals &#8211; much more focused on what they saw to be the reality of RA&#8217;s strong attachments to his carers and the risks to him of disturbing those. </p>

MGM&#8217;s &#8220;connection with&#8221; RA (<span style="font-style:italic">section 10(9)(b)</span>) is as a blood relative but there is no emotional content to the relationship. There is little doubt that MGM&#8217;s application in itself has caused a degree of &#8220;disruption&#8221; to RA (<span style="font-style:italic">section 10(9)(c)</span>), given that the adoption would otherwise have long since been concluded had she not put herself forward as a carer, and her case (if successful) envisions far-reaching &#8220;disruption&#8221; to RA (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Care: Contact: Grandmother&#8217;s application)</span> [1995] 2 FLR 86).

Moreover, I consider that it is likely ultimately to be in RA&#8217;s best interests (even though this is not a paramount consideration in this evaluation) that RA should know in due course that I considered his grandmother&#8217;s claim to care for him truly on its merits and did not reject it at the gateway stage.</p>

In short, these changes in circumstances did not operate on the birth parents to cause them to make this application.

The irreversibility of this outcome must have looked stark to the birth parents and was plainly painful to them.  It provoked an emotional response in them &#8211; a wish to have him back.

I accept the evidence of the social worker that they were offered practical support in caring for RA at his birth, but the birth parents rejected this.

I am wholly satisfied that it is not in RA&#8217;s best interests for there to be any further litigation about his future, with the inevitable associated delay (<span style="font-style:italic">section 1(3) ACA 2002</span>), and the equally inevitable disruption to his carers and therefore in all probability to him.  Of course I recognise the inestimable benefits to RA, as to any child, of being raised within his or her natural family, and with his full siblings. But I am satisfied that at this stage in this case, such a powerful consideration would nonetheless be significantly outweighed by the damage to his emotional wellbeing of being uprooted from the only parents he knows, with whom he has undoubtedly forged strong mutual bonds.  Mr. and Mrs. D have demonstrated extraordinary commitment and devotion to RA from the earliest days of his life, from which he has benefited and from which he will continue to benefit; their loving care has provided rich and fertile terrain into which he has already burrowed roots.  By contrast, while the improvement in the birth parents&#8217; home circumstances is pleasing to note, on the mother&#8217;s evidence to me it continues to look precarious; the father is still out of work, and searching for employment.  The mother told me that if RA were returned to her care, she would give up her work for a while to care for him; while this may well be necessary in order that RA should have consistency of care, it seemed to me that this may well pitch the birth parents back into the very situation in which they found themselves when RA was born, and which provoked the decision which they now wish to reverse.  Further, RA will always carry the legacy of having been relinquished at birth; there is little cause to believe that RA&#8217;s emotional welfare in the long-term would be better served by being placed back with the parents who chose to relinquish him, rather than by causing him to be raised by the parents who rescued him and offered him a home.   I have conscientiously considered the negatives and the positives of the outcomes, either giving or refusing the birth parents&#8217; permission to oppose.  In summary, the parent's ultimate prospect of success of resisting the making of an adoption order if given leave to oppose does not enjoy the &#8216;solidity&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span>, below at [59] and [74]) which I am enjoined to look for.  </p>

I am extremely doubtful that MGM could offer such an emotionally secure home, given the difficulties which I find RA would be likely to encounter in transferring his primary attachment from the Ds, the complexities of transition which on any view is likely to be fraught, and the potential for exposure to family conflict. I have some concerns about the birth parents&#8217; ability to offer security and stability, given the lateness of their bid to care for him, their change of position driven by emotional reflex rather than well-thought-out practicalities, and the unformed and somewhat tentative plan for his care which they have presented to the court.</p>

All professionals, and indeed the lay parties, have struggled significantly with how this could be accomplished in any realistic way which would not be harmful to RA.  Ideally (I emphasise, ideally), the guardian opined, RA would be enabled to move <span style="font-style:italic">gradually</span> from the Ds to his grandmother, over a period of days extending possibly into weeks, in England, with support and permission from the Ds for that move to be made.  But it is acknowledged by all that this will not happen &#8211; not because the Ds would consciously obstruct such a course, but they simply would not be able to participate in such an exquisitely painful endeavour.   It seems to me that they would find a transition of RA to the birth parents no less distressing.</p>

However carefully planned, it seems to me to be inevitable that RA would experience a traumatic rupture of the secure attachments which he has undoubtedly formed with the Ds, and this would be likely to play out in challenging behaviour to his grandmother, which I fear she would be ill-equipped to deal with: she has no experience of RA, she speaks no English (and would therefore struggle to comfort RA in words that he would understand), has little insight into the strength of the attachment with the Ds (see [17] above), shows limited flexibility, and is not good at recognising her weaknesses (see [14] above).  </p>

The birth parents&#8217; plan would be for the mother to give up work temporarily, and for the care thereafter to be shared between them.

The &#8220;effect&#8221; on him of becoming an adopted person will impact more greatly on issues around his identity, and perhaps poignantly the impact on his emotional development of learning in due course of his original relinquishment.  The Ds have demonstrated more than adequately that they are attuned to the &#8220;effect&#8221; on RA of losing his Latvian nationality culture and heritage if he were to be adopted by them, and have taken appropriate steps to address this.  Any potentially damaging effect on RA of having ceased to be a member of his birth family will I hope be mitigated by the fact that there will be mutual indirect contact which will maintain the link between RA and the birth family.  His &#8220;background and &#8230; relevant characteristics&#8221; (</span><span class="para2text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">section 1(4)(d)</span><span class="para2text1" style="color:initial">) include not only his heritage (see above) but also consideration of his position in the sibling group, and his loss of a potential sibling relationship with his sisters.  But it is only that &#8211; a </span><span class="para2text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">potential</span><span class="para2text1" style="color:initial"> relationship.  If he were placed with his grandmother, he would be unlikely to enjoy any significant relationship with his sisters.  It was revealing that the mother apparently (according to MGM, but I emphasise that I make no finding about this) threatened her younger sister with the severance of all family contact with the girls in the event that she disclosed to MGM the existence of the premature baby.  Whatever the truth of that assertion, it is plain that the young maternal aunt carried a significant family secret for eight months or more.</span></p>

The prospective adopters are clearly included within that category of person; they can of course offer RA something unique, which is continuity of care from shortly after his birth, throughout his childhood.  They have the benefit of being able to assert and rely on an established &#8216;status quo&#8217; for RA which has benefits recognised both socially/emotionally (Bowlby et al) and neurologically (see </span><span class="para3text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Re M&#8217;P-P (Adoption Proceedings)</span><span class="para3text1" style="color:initial"> [2015] EWCA Civ 584 (at [47-50]). Apart from the obvious blood tie to MGM and the birth parents, RA has no actual relationship with any of his family members; he has never met MGM and last had any contact with the birth parents when they left him on the neo-natal unit as a premature baby.  This reduces significantly the &#8220;value&#8221; (see above) which can be attached to such a relationship, let alone its continuation.  The &#8220;willingness&#8221; of MGM to offer RA a secure home is not in doubt; I am impressed with the way in which she has pursued her ambition through to the conclusion of this final hearing.   It is however her &#8220;ability&#8221; to do so which I find is wanting.  The &#8220;willingness&#8221; of the birth parents is only of very recent origin.   The &#8220;willingness and ability&#8221; of the Ds to offer a secure home to RA is tried, tested and proven for a period of over one year.</span></p>

It may indeed give RA some comfort to know that &#8211; in the end &#8211; all key members of his natural family showed a clear interest in claiming him, and wanting to raise him.  I take into account too that exactly a year ago the birth parents gave their clear consents to adoption; they expressly repeated this consent more than once over the last year, and appeared until the last moment to be supportive of the Ds&#8217; application.  As a matter of law, their consents remain in place (see [40] above).

The risk of disruption to the secure attachments which RA has forged with the Ds cannot in his interests be taken.  I consider that the prospects of him ever forging an equally, or even a sufficiently, strong attachment with either his birth parents or MGM are poor, given their respective plans for his future care.  The consequences for RA if he failed to achieve that level of security could be catastrophic for his emotional well-being and development.  I am as confident as I could be that the Ds can and will continue to meet RA&#8217;s global needs.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be important as RA grows through childhood into adulthood that he learns fully about his Latvian heritage.  It is also important that he comes to know that his grandmother, and indeed ultimately his birth parents, laid a claim to care for him.  I felt that MGM&#8217;s stance was honourable; she felt a strong sense of duty to offer RA a home; the presentation of her case proportionate and dignified.  I equally recognise and understand the birth parents&#8217; emotional reflex as they saw their son standing on the brink of an irreversible legal and emotional commitment to other parents; I don&#8217;t dispute the genuineness of their yearning to care for him which they had suppressed for much of the last year.  Had the circumstances in which I had come to decide this case been different, it may well have been that the birth parents and/or MGM would have had a stronger claim, but I have tried the applications on the facts as they developed, and as they stood at the time of this judgment.
