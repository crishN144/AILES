She submits that the father&#8217;s relationship with Z, actual as it now is or prospective at the time Z was born, implicates both the father&#8217;s and Z&#8217;s rights under article 8. She relies, if need be, upon the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Anayo v Germany</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2010) 55 EHRR 164" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">(2010) 55 EHRR 164</ref>, paras 57, 60 (though note the comment of Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re G (Children: Sperm Donors: Leave to apply for Children Act Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 1334" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 1334</ref>, para 120).

I referred to the fact that, for the moment, his position had been secured by making him a ward of court, though commenting that in the nature of things this could not provide a permanent solution. In an order which I made on 10 September 2015 I directed that Z was to remain a ward of court and placed him in the care and control of his father. In order to avoid the need for the father to be making constant applications to the court (see Lowe &amp; White, Wards of Court, ed 2, 1986, paras 5-2, 5-6, 5-16), the order gave him permission to (i) temporarily remove Z from the jurisdiction as he sees fit, (ii) agree to any medical examination or treatment that Z may require and (iii) apply for a British passport for Z. I understand that the father subsequently applied for a British passport for Z which was issued in November 2015.</p>

It is accepted that there is a difference in treatment between a single person entering into a lawful surrogacy arrangement and a couple entering the same arrangement. This difference in treatment, namely the inability to obtain a parental order, is on the sole ground of the status of the commissioning parent as a single person versus the same person were he part of a couple.  The Secretary of State accepts that, in light of the evidence filed and the jurisprudential developments both domestic and in Strasbourg, including for example <span style="font-style:italic">Mennesson v France</span> (Application no. 65192/11) taken with <span style="font-style:italic">Wagner v Luxembourg</span> (Application no. 76240/01), this difference in treatment on the sole ground of the status of the commissioning parent as a single person versus being part of a couple, can no longer be justified within the meaning of Article 14.&#8221;</p>

There has been no suggestion in any of the Strasbourg cases that the provision of adoption in surrogacy cases instead of another form of recognition, is a breach of Article 8. It is only because the UK has a different method which is available to couples but not to single people, that the issue arises. This is in reality, a discrimination case. That is the basis of the concession. </p>

We accept however, that the exclusion of [Z] and [the father] from obtaining a parental order on the sole ground that [the father] was not part of a couple is discrimination contrary to Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.&#8221;</p>
