This hearing was formally listed in the Royal Courts of Justice Cause List &#8216;For Hearing in Open Court&#8217;, as it should be.  I personally sat, robed, in a court in the West Green Building to hear the case.  The court was opened for members of the public but in fact no person attended.

This was issued on 21 April 2020.  This is the second such application, the first having been dismissed by Judd J on 14 January 2020.  I indicated at the outset of this hearing that it would be inappropriate for me to consider this application to vary at the same time as the application in respect of the alleged contempt.  I indicated that I would deal with the contempt aspect first; I wanted to avoid the situation in which PA may feel effectively deprived of the right of silence as he tries to field separate applications.  It was recognised by all that this would be a serious procedural error<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

The property is owned by a company of which PA is the sole director and MM the sole shareholder. On 22 March 2019, a freezing order was made, restraining the parties from disposing of or dealing with the company income or assets except to enable the company to meet its tax or other liabilities. In November 2019, a further order required PA to produce the company bank statements. These showed that he had used the company bank account to make payments amounting to over &#163;25,000 in respect of his personal living expenses and legal fees, some &#163;18,000 of which post-dated the freezing order. PA did not dispute that he had caused the company to make the payments but claimed that they were made in respect of the company's liabilities, namely in paying him a salary, in repaying loans he said he had made to it, and in discharging the company's alleged liability for legal fees.&#8221; </p>

She points to the fact that PA has had sole control over the relevant bank account held by Pier, and has used it as his &#8220;personal piggy bank&#8221;.  Consistent with this she refers to the fact that within three days of the freezing order, PA used Pier&#8217;s &#8216;frozen&#8217; account, evidently (having regard to the nature of the payment) for personal use (i.e. a supermarket purchase).  Over the course of the following months, PA made altogether 562 further withdrawals and/or payments from Pier&#8217;s account; it is evident (again, having regard to the nature of the payments) that the vast majority were for his personal use.  A schedule of the payments from the account has been presented, and is agreed.  This activity in the account was only revealed after I had ordered PA, at a case management hearing in the &#8216;Ownership Proceedings&#8217; in December 2019, to produce the Pier bank statements. </p>

His explanations for his use of the account over the months following the 22 March 2019 order are, in my judgment, contrived and disingenuous; this is demonstrated in part by the internal inconsistency of his narrative, the inconsistency between his narrative and the disclosed documentation, and imprecision (indeed, even confusion) on key aspects.  I found PA to be evasive when challenged in cross-examination, and prevaricated when asked questions which called for simple answers.  He sought to brush off apparent flaws in his case by pleading &#8216;laziness&#8217; in preparation for the hearing, a lack of time to prepare his response (by way of reminder, the application for &#8216;sanction&#8217; was made in January 2020, five months before the hearing, and indeed this was the second such hearing), a lack of &#8220;care&#8221; while &#8220;under strain&#8221;, and &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; omission of relevant information.

I find that he treated the account as his personal account.  It is obvious that he used the funds for his own ends.  He used it repeatedly for his grocery shopping and for local travel; he purports to have paid &#8220;rent&#8221; to his new partner under a &#8220;lodger&#8217;s agreement&#8221;, and made &#8220;repayments&#8221; of a loan for his personal legal fees provided by his new partner.

It appears that compliance with these orders has been materially compromised by the lack of funds in the Pier account, and I am keen that the issue of sanction is therefore listed soon. </p>

In the interests of speed and cost, I have offered to deal with this on the basis of written submissions.  Given the imminence of the final hearing, it may be that such an application has become somewhat academic; if there is a need to determine it, perhaps it could be addressed as an ancillary point once the ownership of the shares in Pier has been resolved. </p>
