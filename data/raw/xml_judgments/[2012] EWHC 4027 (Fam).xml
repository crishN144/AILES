	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Just after 8 o&#8217;clock during the evening of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2011 a &#8216;phone call was made to emergency services by the mother of an 8 week old baby girl who, after a bath, had been sick, turned &#8220;pure white&#8221; and was unconscious. The infant was admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital where she was found to be pale and floppy with no respiratory effort and a poor pulse. A CT scan showed extensive blood in and around the baby&#8217;s brain. She was transferred to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, arriving there at around 1 o&#8217;clock in the morning of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October. Sadly, very sadly, at no time after her admission to hospital did the baby show any brain function; there was no spontaneous movement and no reflexes of any kind. Neither was there any respiratory effort. Treatment was withdrawn and she died at 18.10 on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The primary purpose of this hearing has been to establish the cause of death and also how other, older injuries were sustained. If there was non accidental, that is inflicted, injury then it is my task to identify if possible who was responsible. And the reason for so doing is that the parents of the child who died have two other children together, a girl who is almost five and a boy who is two and three-quarters. It is obviously necessary when considering the long term arrangements for those two children to have an adequate understanding of the circumstances surrounding their younger sibling&#8217;s death; and to establish whether either parent presents any kind of risk either as an individual who has inflicted  injury or knowingly failed to protect from physical harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The baby who died was E; she was born in August 2011. The eldest child of the family is K. Her younger brother is H. The children&#8217;s mother is 27 years old. Their father is aged 30. They met in about May 2003 and started to live together at about Christmas time 2004. Since E&#8217;s death there have been times when they have lived together and other times when they&#8217;ve been apart. Most recently, on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012, the mother removed her belongings from the family home and went to live with her grandmother.</p>

Providing them with a long term and secure placement is now a priority and must be achieved, if at all possible, before the date set for the next hearing, namely 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Archer, Counsel for Buckinghamshire County Council, has produced what he describes as an Advocate&#8217;s Chronology. It extends to 26 pages and contains, amongst other things, an almost minute by minute account of events on the day of E&#8217;s collapse, including many important extracts from the medical records, parts of the statements made in these proceedings as well as salient material gathered by the police. The entire chronology is helpfully cross referenced to the source documents. If he will permit me to say so, it is unquestionably one of the best documents of its kind. For me, and others I suspect, it has been an invaluable forensic tool; and it would be an unnecessary duplication if I were to include details already fully set out there. I am quite content to adopt it as the framework for my consideration of the several issues for decision.</p>

Moreover, notwithstanding some bold suggestions made to four medical experts in cross examination, particularly by Mr Routley on behalf of the father, the expert consensus remains unchanged. It is that in all probability E died as the result of non accidental head injury with associated bruising and rib fractures; and, in addition, she sustained inflicted posterior rib and tibial fractures within the period 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, so between 10 to 14 days of her death. </p>

Dr Sprigg would have expected the person with the baby at the time of injury to recognise the infant had been handled with excessive and inappropriate force and that the baby was in pain. </p>

Symptoms of irritability lasting for a few days after the event might be misattributed to the infant being unwell for other reasons. A non perpetrator may not realise there were rib fractures or a limb injury.</p>

In evidence he said it would have been a matter of seconds only between the insult and deterioration in E&#8217;s condition though it is very difficult to say exactly what happened. This &#8220;sort of injury&#8221; can occur within a very short time.</p>

He said that in some cases the child will become unconscious; the change in behaviour results from the hypoxic ischaemic injury which is instituted at the time of the causative event. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Sprigg&#8217;s view is that given the extensive changes seen on the scans, it is likely that whatever caused her brain damage would have been associated with rapid deterioration in clinical state rather than an event happening several hours earlier followed by neurological deterioration a while later.</p>

That the evening had been uneventful. After the children had been fed, both parents went upstairs to get the children ready for bed. The father had got into the bath with H and K. The mother had passed E to him. She was held on his lap. The mother then went downstairs to start tidying up. She was there for about 10 minutes before going back upstairs where she took H out of the bath and prepared him for bed, giving him a bottle and putting him into his cot. She then went back into the bathroom, took E out of the bath, got her dressed and ready for sleep. She had sat on the bed, given her a bottle, winded and then placed her into the Moses basket. E had been a bit grizzly or grumpy but this was not unusual after coming out of a warm bath. The mother had given E her dummy. The father had said he would settle her down whilst the mother finished tidying up downstairs. Overall, the mother estimates she was upstairs for about 15 minutes. She went down and started to Hoover.</p>

She had run upstairs, saw E lying in his arms; she had looked both very floppy and very pale. The mother could see she was not breathing properly. He had explained to her that E had started choking. He had stuck his fingers down her throat to try to clear any obstruction. She had been sick on the carpet. The father had explained that when E had not responded, he had thrown her up in the air and shaken her so as to try to get a response. He had also thrown some water over her face.</p>

She accepts that E was normal when she had been in the bath with her father and siblings. She didn&#8217;t know whether E had been whingeing or crying loudly enough in the bedroom for it to be heard by the father who was in the bathroom, as he has suggested. The mother said the bathroom fan makes a loud noise and whilst E might have been whingeing for her bottle she wouldn&#8217;t say she was crying loudly. </p>

Then E had been given her bottle, been winded and put her in the Moses basket with her blanket and &#8220;cuddles&#8221; (which I took to be some soft toys).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s evidence about events that evening appears substantively within his written statement of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011. The account is lengthy and very detailed. In evidence he said it had taken three to four weeks to make the statement. His version of events is a follows: that whilst he was getting dressed after the bath, the father heard a gurgling and choking sound. H was drinking his milk and not making any noise. He went over to E, pulled up the hood of her Moses basket and could clearly see she was choking. He had picked her straight up, placed her on his arm and patted as well as rubbed her back. She was still making choking sounds so he thought there might be something obstructing her airway. He placed his first two fingers in her mouth to check for obstructions and accidentally pressed down on her stomach whilst holding her. She vomited whereupon he took her into the bathroom and shouted for the mother to come upstairs. He cleaned E&#8217;s mouth with some water. He looked at her and she then &#8220;appeared to be breathing fine&#8221;. In evidence, he added she had looked at him and also gripped on to one of his fingers with her hand.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father then took E back into the bedroom. As he laid her on the bed he could smell that her nappy needed to be changed and he did so. Whilst changing her, E seemed to be normal. After the nappy change, he noticed her face was becoming pale. He lightly touched and tapped her face. E&#8217;s eyes were open; she was looking at him; but when he touched her face she was not responding. She was not moving her arms and legs. He had shouted for the mother to come upstairs. E was limp. He held her at his eye level and shook her to make her wake up. The father believes he may have squeezed E whilst holding her in his hands but she did not respond. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In cross examination by Miss Mitchell, the father said E had thrown up two to three minutes after he&#8217;d put his fingers down her throat. The vomit had all gone onto the carpet as far as he knew; there had been about a tablespoon and a half. In response to further questions by Mr Archer, the father said the nappy change had only taken a couple of minutes and it had been a normal change. He had only become aware of the need for a change as the result of the smell. He had only shaken E to try to get her to regain consciousness and, so he said, he had told the medics &#8211; the paramedics and the doctors at Stoke Mandeville as well as at the John Radcliffe Hospitals &#8211; &#8220;exactly what had happened&#8221;. The father did not agree he&#8217;d said to the paramedic that E had vomited heavily; and asked about the remark attributed to him, namely that E had opened her bowels uncontrollably, he said he had &#8220;meant she was breaking wind when he was pushing on her stomach&#8221; (during the course of attempted CPR). He might have said she had opened her bowels when she was choking.</p>

But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what has happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it. The inherent probability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied&#8221;.</p>

They may do so for a whole host of motives. Not necessarily because they are culpable but, for example, to protect someone else; or in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or from a wish to conceal shameful behaviour from their family. The mere fact that a potential perpetrator lies is not in itself evidence of guilt. It would almost never in this situation be sufficient evidence of culpability to establish that someone had lied. It is an altogether more subtle and delicate process than that. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I would have to say this has been a most unusual hearing. The forensic challenges to the factual information provided to the police by lay witnesses has been non existent though there is evident disagreement on the part of both parents with some  elements of what was said, particularly about events on the night of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October. Several facets of the police material have been used to test the parents&#8217; evidence through cross examination and also to bolster their versions of events in certain areas. The maternal grandparents, Mr and Mrs F, each gave police statements but neither was called to give evidence at this hearing. They might well have been able to shed light upon the dynamics of the parents&#8217; relationship both historically and in more recent times as well as comment upon their interaction with the children. But they were not called and I did not suggest they were vital to resolution of the case; clearly, they were not.</p>

The mother began mid afternoon on Thursday 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, continued on Friday but could not complete her evidence that day. She was weak from having eaten very little, tired from lack of sleep and had pains in her chest, as I understood it. At all events, she did not finish her oral testimony until just after noon on Monday 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. The father began immediately thereafter, gave evidence for the rest of the court day and finished just before lunch on Tuesday 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. In the result, I have had ample opportunity to consider the information the parents have provided, to make assessments of their credibility, to consider the dynamics of their relationship and to arrive at an overall conclusion as to how E died.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My overall finding is that E&#8217;s death was caused as the result of a traumatic shaking-type injury which included an element of impact. She was injured shortly before the call to the emergency services at 20.12 on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October last year, almost certainly as the result of a brief but violent loss of control by one of her parents. It is not possible for me to say whether the mother or the father was responsible for her collapse and ultimate death. Either parent could have inflicted the ultimately fatal as well as the earlier bony injuries sustained between 10 and 14 days prior to E&#8217;s admission to hospital.</p>

Mr Routley&#8217;s brave suggestion is that it is &#8220;entirely possible&#8221; even &#8220;likely&#8221; that E &#8220;experienced an ALTE&#8221; as described in a research paper emanating from the Netherlands, annexed to Dr Stoodley&#8217;s report. In response to that submission I am bound to say there is no medical evidence of any kind to support such a hypothesis. But more important still, there was outright rejection of the suggestion by both Professor Risden and Dr Stoodley when cross examined by Mr Routley. </p>

He went on to say that &#8220;this child had clear pathology at post mortem and the whole point of his examination is to discover the aetiology for a sudden collapse&#8221;. In this instance, in Professor Risden&#8217;s opinion, the fatal injuries resulted from a combination of shaking and impact.</p>

He said he was not aware of any naturally occurring medical condition which could reasonably account for the scan abnormalities in E&#8217;s case. Subdural bleeding is strongly associated with head trauma and he added that the pattern of E&#8217;s bleeding was not what would be expected in an accidental injury. Neither was the pattern of injury to the brain itself.</p>

It is more likely, in Dr Sprigg&#8217;s opinion, that whatever caused the diffuse brain damage happened immediately prior to E&#8217;s collapse rather than being caused by &#8216;resuscitative&#8217; shaking.  </p>

The cause of her collapse, as I find, was inflicted head trauma; and the acute fractures to her ribs and clavicle almost certainly resulted from the application of excessive force at the time of the &#8216;shaking with impact&#8217; insult.</p>

First and foremost, on an overall assessment of the factual information, I simply do not know when exactly E&#8217;s deterioration began or which of her parents, if only one, was in the room with her at the moment of injury. What does emerge as clear is that when the three children were in the bath with their father, E was fine. Thereafter, there is far less clarity. Each parent was alone with E for a period in the bedroom &#8211; the mother when she was preparing her for bed, drying, dressing and feeding her; the father when he emerged finally from the bathroom. Prior to that, he had been &#8220;popping in and out&#8221; but the evidence as to that was somewhat vague. I gained no impression that he&#8217;d had a good look at E until after the mother had gone downstairs.</p>

The salient extracts from the records are set out in full between pages 7 and 9 of Mr Archer&#8217;s chronology and therefore it is unnecessary to repeat them here. It is sufficient to note that appraisal of the totality gives rise to the very real possibility that E had already been injured by the time she was placed into her cot by the mother and at a time when the father was still in the bathroom. </p>

Quite the reverse. As the most detailed history &#8211; that provided to Dr Harris in the paediatric intensive care unit &#8211; reveals, the parents gave information which suggested what might be termed a relentless decline from the moment the father checked on E and found her making a funny noise in the back of her throat. She was pale. He thought she was not right. She seemed &#8220;very loose&#8221; and was starting to go blue. Taking her to the bathroom and putting water on her head brought about &#8220;no change&#8221;. When the mother came upstairs, E was in the father&#8217;s arms and &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>

The mother told the police in interview that she &#8220;did not want the baby and (the father) didn&#8217;t either&#8221;. Whilst the pregnancy could not be said to have been concealed in the sense that those around the mother must have known she was expecting a baby, she did not keep ante natal appointments and she kept it secret from her parents. They were not told of E&#8217;s arrival until about two weeks after her birth and then by text message. They, the Fs, had not seen the family since February, at about the time of H&#8217;s birthday celebrations. The mother said in evidence she hadn&#8217;t told them she was pregnant because they might have been &#8220;cross&#8221; with her because she hadn&#8217;t &#8220;let K and H grow up a bit and because (she and the father) were not working.&#8221; More strangely still, when at the John Radcliffe Hospital the mother told Dr Harris she had not known she was pregnant until she went into labour. That was a downright lie as the mother&#8217;s medical records from April 2011 reveal. She was seen by a consultant obstetrician on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, was described as being about 22 weeks into her third pregnancy and given an estimated delivery date of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2011. </p>

She said she could not control him; he would not listen to her and was &#8220;a real handful&#8221;. In evidence, on three separate occasions, the mother related how H had been a &#8216;Mummy&#8217;s boy&#8217; when little but that as he grew older he would never listen to her and became a &#8216;Daddy&#8217;s boy&#8217;. The mother protested she did not find H difficult but &#8220;felt upset&#8221; that he wanted to be with his Dad. Ultimately, she accepted there were big problems between herself and H &#8220;where he doesn&#8217;t listen&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I pause to remind myself that when E was born, H was only 18 months old. When she died, he was 20 months old. He was quite simply so young and immature in developmental terms that it was unrealistic, in my assessment, to expect him to absorb anything other than the most basic instructions and necessarily to do as he was told.   I was left bemused at the mother&#8217;s preoccupation with the issue of how H would not listen to her. It was another sign that all was not well as between her and the children.</p>

The father says, and the mother does not disagree, that on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October in front of a group of paternal relatives, the mother said she wanted nothing to do with H; that &#8220;it was all H&#8217;s fault&#8221; and she would not go back to her parents&#8217; home if he was going to be there. </p>

I cannot draw the same inference. In fact and because it is such an absurd allegation, I see it as suggestive of personal guilt. Put another way, I regard it as very suspicious indeed that the mother would contend her 20 month old son could have been responsible for E&#8217;s death. The fact that she did so, to my mind, is more indicative that she herself was implicated than that she was not. Measured against the range of possible parental reactions to the death of an infant, the notion that responsibility should rest with a toddler sibling defies belief.</p>

Within her police interview, the mother was asked whether H had ever picked E up. She replied, &#8220;No, never&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; in response to a similar question about K. Both claims cannot be right. </p>

It seems to me that the mother&#8217;s clear and unambiguous denial of the children picking E up is the more likely scenario; and that her attempt to infer they may have caused rib fractures is both ridiculous and again arouses suspicion that she was seeking to deflect attention onto others because she herself was responsible.</p>

Mr Archer was right to draw my attention to the document drafted as recently as 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September in which, on the mother&#8217;s behalf, Miss Mitchell describes &#8211; for example &#8211; her client&#8217;s lack of knowledge and inability to speculate as to how E sustained her fatal injuries but mentions the resuscitative shake as the only event which might explain what occurred. An overall reading of the mother&#8217;s document leaves me far from convinced that in fact she has been as consistent as suggested.</p>

They travelled together on the Underground to Ealing Broadway and for a while sat with one another in a park. According to both of them, their conversation included expression of a shared wish that they could go back to being a normal family again. The mother agreed that the father had said he missed and still loved her; and also that his head &#8220;was all over the place&#8221; with everything that was going on. The mother had said to him that she &#8220;felt the same way&#8221; but explained in evidence she did not love him as she had before. She continued by saying it felt as if she had lost everything &#8211; E, the kids; she is &#8220;still in shock&#8221;, her &#8220;mind is all over the place&#8221; so returning to him was as much for comfort as anything.</p>

Miss Mitchell recognises that the mother would seem to be &#8220;very vulnerable and child-like&#8221;. Miss Mitchell invites me to accept that the father was the dominant, controlling parent and prays in aid the maternal grandfather&#8217;s police statement in which he comments that the father was controlling. It should also be recognised though, that Mr F remarked favourably upon the quality of the parents&#8217; relationship with one another, saying it was good, as well as to how well they interacted with their children. </p>

For sure, it would seem that some of the most prejudicial comments which had been thought to relate to the father and a prison sentence have nothing whatever to do with him. Those extracts concern a young man, B, who was known to the mother as a friend but not a boyfriend. Any comparison of the records with the evidence given by the mother suggests that some really quite bizarre things were being said and recorded which may have had very little to do with the truth.</p>

Everyone in court strained to hear what she said &#8211; a phenomenon which lasted throughout the many hours of her testimony which, of itself, is quite unusual. Ordinarily, in my experience, the extremely nervous witness relaxes somewhat as the process wears on and as s/he becomes just a little more confident about speaking in such unfamiliar surroundings. The mother remained seemingly terrified throughout. There never was a time when she appeared to be less on edge.</p>

I am afraid to say that the father is probably not very bright. I doubt he had the slightest idea as to why his initial accounts to the paramedics and doctors are or might be so significant. I question whether in fact he has been able to understand the medical evidence sufficiently well to see that E could well have been injured by the mother whilst he was in the bathroom. He may have retreated into &#8216;mantra&#8217; style evidence of what happened when he shook E so as to revive her because he truly believes or has been led to believe that what he did in trying to elicit a response caused her collapse. He may have thought that by so doing he had the best chance of emerging unscathed. In simpler terms, he probably believed that he (and also the mother) would be in less trouble if he stuck to what was in his statement. But most of that is speculation, as I freely admit.</p>

All I would say is that the medical evidence, particularly the opinion of Dr Sprigg, does not support a conclusion that the parent who did not inflict injury must nonetheless be seen as having failed to protect. The symptoms and signs in the hours and days following upon the earlier rib and tibial fractures are non specific and would not necessarily have been obvious to the non perpetrator. A vigilant and attuned parent could have picked up that when s/he grasped the infant around her rib cage or grasped her ankle whilst changing a nappy there was pain and discomfort. Equally well, s/he might have concluded there was some other perfectly explicable reason why E was irritable.</p>
