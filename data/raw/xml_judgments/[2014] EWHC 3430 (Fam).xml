Ultimately, I have decided that this has been a vain task because the husband has failed so comprehensively to comply with his obligation to provide full and frank disclosure and to give clear evidence that his case does not permit of such an exercise.  It became apparent to me that the evidence in this case is not such as would enable me to produce a comprehensive account into which all the various pieces of evidence could be fitted.  Notwithstanding the quantity of documents which have been produced, there are far too many gaps for this to be an attainable objective.  As I commented during the hearing, the result of the way in which the case has developed is that a great deal of energy has been expended by the husband on seeking to establish what he is not worth rather than the more conventional focus being on seeking to demonstrate what he is worth."</span></p>

As my Lord, Patten LJ, put it in argument, perhaps at that stage the evidential burden passes to the debtor, whilst not of course undermining the obligation on the creditor to discharge the burden of proof.  Plainly in a case where there has been some major and unforeseen financial development which removes from the payer the ability to pay which he had at the date of order, the ordinary expectation is that he would be the applicant to the court seeking the variation of the order either under the limited powers of the court to revisit in the light of some volcanic development or perhaps simply to seek some relief by way of deferment of the date of payment or perhaps future payment by instalments.  So although of course the rule is and must remain that the burden of proof rests on the applicant, I think in a case such as this that burden is lightly discharged and an evidential burden may switch to the debtor."</span></p>

He also said that PRL was no longer trading in crude oil.  In his section 25 statement, he said &#8230;:</span></p>

As a result I have had no regular income from PRL since that time.  This is causing me to suffer financial problems and so I have been interviewing for a full-time position with other trading companies.  At present I have yet to secure a position.'</span></p>

This is an example of a deliberately evasive answer.  I have no doubt the husband is aware of all the trades being conducted by all the companies.  It later emerged from documents produced during the course of the hearing that substantial trades continued to be made by companies within the group being probably either Vermont Petroleum and/or Nevis.  It follows that the suggestion in the husband's statement that his source of income has dried up, is clearly also false.</span></p>
