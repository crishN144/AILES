But, no, it was not.  It related then to a girl called S, who was born on 18 April 1997 and so who is twenty-one now and will be twenty-two in April of this year.  Litigation concerning her has been going on, on and off, in this country and in Australia for most of her life, I think, including her father being imprisoned in Australia for, I think, two charges of either making threats to kill or conspiracy to kill the mother.   </p>

That was the fourth clause of a fairly standard non-molestation injunction under the Family Law Act, but what was unusual about it was that it was not time limited because of the highly exceptional circumstances that confronted Mr Justice Jonathan Baker then.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">On 1 October of 2018, the father  issued an application which was to vary the terms of the Family Law Act order and the draft orders which were originally sought back in October and which were sought when it first came before me in January of this year, were, in effect, to seek a request by this court or a direction by this court to the police service in Australia to identify the whereabouts of S and to serve on her the application; really with the intention of seeing whether S wished to communicate or contact the father. But that application, I think, was issued on 1 October <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> and Mr Justice Jonathan Baker, in probably on one of his last acts as a High Court judge before his elevation to the Court of Appeal, directed that it be heard on notice and so it came before me in January of this year.  But, at that stage, still the application had not been served on the respondent mother. So I gave directions on 22 January for the service of the application and for the filing of statements or position statements in response.  It seemed to me, and I think the father agreed at the time, that really the thrust of his application for a variation was targeted on paragraph 1(d) of the non-molestation order of April 2015 because the orders he was seeking would provide for other means by which communication could be sent to and from S.  So that is what I have been treating it as.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.92in;margin-right:0in">Bexley Magistrates&#8217; Court, on 18 May 2016, in exercise of their criminal jurisdiction, made what is called a violent offender order which prevented the father or an agent acting on his behalf from contacting nine named individuals, but, significantly, the mother and S.  That order came into force on 17 May 2016 and expires on 16 May 2021.  It is in stricter terms than the non-molestation order made by this court because it precludes any contact being made at all.  The violent offender order records that the father is a qualifying offender because he has been convicted of the incitement to murder of  the mother; and, whilst awaiting sentence, further conspired with others again to have her killed; and has acted in such a way that there is reasonable cause to believe it is necessary for the order to be made on the ground that the mother  now lives in fear of her life and her family and friends have been subjected to threats; and she has now been placed under protective services to threats worldwide to protect her identity. So the order is then made in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/4/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/4" uk:canonical="2008 c. 4" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</ref>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">As I pointed out in the course of exchanges with the father in January, any amendment to the Family Law Act order would not avail him of any advance in his position in relation to communication with his daughter because the violent offender order was in more stringent terms.  Since then, the father has, I think, filed an application with Bexley Magistrates&#8217; Court, on possibly 4 February, in order to seek a variation of that order.   </p>

Of most significance are the communications from S. One is dated 2 October 2018, which is clearly in response to a communication from Ms Judd arising out of the hearing which took place on 1 October, when Mr Justice Jonathan Baker made some, I think, disclosure orders or dealt with a disclosure application and also dealt with the <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> application for variation of the non-molestation order.  In that e-mail, which is redacted to remove various relevant details which I assume might tend to disclose her whereabouts, she says:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.92in;margin-right:0in">The father suggests that the last sentence is troubling because at court on 1 October no mention was made of him having an interest in or capability in protecting her and nor was that either the terminology or thrust of his application.

There is no reason at all to suppose that the contents of Ms Judd&#8217;s statement or the documents exhibited to it are anything but genuine and that they express the true sentiments of S, communicated through a legitimate means to Ms Judd who has evidenced them to this court. So it seems to me that the evidence is clear that S&#8217;s views are before the court and there is no reason at all for me to treat them as anything other than genuine and an expression of her true wishes.   </p>
