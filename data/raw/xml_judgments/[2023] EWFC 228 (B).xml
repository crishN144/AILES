The application concerns his son W who was seven at the time of the application but is now nine years&#8217; of age.  The respondent is W&#8217;s mother.  The application stated that father initially wanted contact but he considered that his son may be at extreme risk and he sought an order to decide with whom the child lived.  He applied for an order without notice to the mother on the basis of his safety concerns.  In the C1A supplemental form, the father alleged that the child had been assaulted by the mother since birth, that mother had made a series of allegations against the father and had assaulted him.  He referred to social services knowing about those issues but choosing to believe the lies put forward by mother.</span></p>

He has not submitted any final evidence to the Court.  Whilst it is recognisable that the journey from Sheffield would take around two hours in a car or on the train, this Courthouse is easily accessible from the train station and at no point has the applicant father indicated difficulties with attending Court.  His failure to attend today must be considered alongside his failure to file evidence and other failures that I will refer to in this judgment.  I conclude that father has effectively abandoned his application, perhaps in the light of very significant safeguarding concerns in relation to him.  I have no optimism that father would comply with directions to file evidence or to attend Court even if I were to adjourn proceedings and make such further directions.   No other party has asked me to adjourn the case today, and I remind myself of the lengthy proceedings in this application and the totality of litigation involving this child.</span></p>

She agreed that the real issue was whether father should continue to have the opportunity to have indirect contact with the child or whether there should be no contact at all.  She told me of her concerns that father would not utilise indirect contact.  Not only had he not taken up indirect contact following the order dated 2017, she had offered to support him with indirect contact after the section 7 report. She had a lengthy meeting with father after the report was prepared; she described father as being entirely focused on the inaccuracies in the report and criticising mother.  He had not taken up the offer to get indirect contact started.  Ms M had seen the psychological report that had been prepared in the public law proceedings which had described father as highly manipulative, obsessive and narcissistic. She said that any communication she had with father was not focused on the child. Father had absolutely no insight into what he needed to change preferring to complain about agencies and individuals. She concluded that indirect contact would not be beneficial for W with father likely to be inconsistent with indirect contact at best and his focus upon criticising mother.  The child had added vulnerabilities in terms of his suspected autism and needed to be protected from father&#8217;s presentation.  She did not recommend that mother provide monthly updates to father about the child because she considered that this would fuel the conflict and increase the risk to the mother and the child.</span></p>

She said that there had been a lot of litigation concerning W which she found exhausting and had fuelled her anxiety and depression. She simply wanted the proceedings to end.  She was more comfortable with Ms M&#8217;s updated recommendation because she considered that father was not motivated to form a relationship with W.</span></p>

Applications have been made in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020 and this case started in 2021 despite a two-year barring order being made by Her Honour Judge Dowding in August 2017.  W has been the subject of litigation for almost all of his young life.  I have read the comprehensive judgment of Judge Dowding in 2017.  It sadly reflects father as a person intent on discrediting and undermining the mother.  The judgment demonstrates that father has failed to comply with Court orders or prioritise his relationship with the child.  He has used whatever platform he has had at his disposal (i.e. the Court proceedings, social services referrals) to continue his own agenda and in the process has consistently abused mother</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">.</span></p>

W is my paramount consideration.  In reality, the child has no ongoing relationship with his father and recalls very little about him.  I entirely accept that he would want to know about his father, and have a relationship with him if it were safe and beneficial to do so.  Children do better when they have a good relationship with each parent when parents are separated.  W would not want a relationship with his father if that relationship were unhealthy, abusive, unsafe or undermining of his residence with mother.  This child has a need for routine and support having regard to his additional needs.</span></p>

She understands his additional vulnerabilities and works closely with the school and other agencies to ensure that W has the best opportunities and provision.  There is nothing from what I have read to indicate that W would be better off living with his father, or that he would not be looked after and protected in the care of his mother.  </span></p>

There are persistent and objective concerns from a number of sources to indicate that father&#8217;s motivation is focused on his relationship with mother and not his desire to cultivate a good relationship with his son.  He has never been in the position of being the long-term primary carer of this child or demonstrated that he can meet his needs.  Indeed, he has been negatively assessed as regards a non-subject child in other proceedings.  There remains very real concern about father&#8217; s presentation.  </span></p>

Without any commitment to indirect contact, father can have no reasonable expectation that the Court would make any order of direct contact or that the child stay/live with him. The father is a stranger to W.  Judge Dowding found no evidence of mother alienating the child from father and neither do I.  The child is curious about his father.  The scuppering of father&#8217;s relationship with his son is his own doing. </span></p>

Five years after Judge Dowding&#8217;s judgment, father presents at least the same level of risk to the child and mother, if not more.   The only commitment he has demonstrated is to his campaign to abuse the mother without insight into the impact on the child.  There has been no positive change and the risk to the mother and child in my view are heightened by father&#8217;s failure to acknowledge concerns about his presentation, his inability to reflect and address his presentation, his lack of commitment to the child, the child&#8217;s advancing age which means that he will be more aware of father&#8217;s actions now than before, the known vulnerabilities of this child and the ongoing police investigation regarding father. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:12pt">I have had to consider the ongoing benefits of an order for indirect contact. No indirect contact is happening and because it has not happened, it difficult to evaluate the risk of any previous indirect contact.  There is a risk of emotional damage to the child in starting a relationship with father through correspondence for it to subside suddenly or not be maintained.  This child needs consistency.  Even when agencies such as the school and the Cafcass officer have tried to engage father about the child, he was unable to contain his derogatory views of mother. I place significant weight on the observations of independent and objective agencies about father&#8217;s presentation, motivation and aggression.  I have little to conclude that father would be able to engage in contact in a beneficial way for W.  He has not demonstrated that he can so engage or mitigate his focus on mother for the benefit of the child.   Indirect contact gives this father a potential platform for further abuse.  Both mother and W must be protected from that.  Father was warned in 2017 that an abuse of his parental responsibility may lead to the termination of his PR.  Whilst that is not an application before me, that may be something that will be considered in the future, if required, as well as any restrictions that the school or agencies may place upon father in how they will engage with him.</span></p>

On balance, I have concluded that the child&#8217;s welfare lies with an order that there is no contact.  In reality, this does not change the status quo as no indirect contact is taking place.  If father shows a commitment to change, he may apply to vary this order.  Until such time, the risk to the child and mother must outweigh the remote possibility that this father will beneficially and healthily engage in indirect contact.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:12pt">The law regarding section 91(14) orders has changed since 2017 and arguably it is now easier for the Court to conclude that such orders are necessary in the welfare interests of the child.  Even applying the same criteria as Judge Dowding did in 2017, there is ample evidence that father seeks to use litigation as a mechanism to further abuse the mother and this impacts on her mental health, and therefore on the child.  The litigation has been relentless, and father has disengaged with this application after almost two years of Court proceedings.  I am satisfied that is necessary for me to make a further barring order to prevent father from making applications under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in relation to W until the child is 16 years of age.  This does not prevent father from applying for permission to make an application but the Court will pre-screen that application to prevent proceedings starting without a real triable issue being identified and some substantive change on father&#8217;s part.  The Court expects father to demonstrate that he had addressed his obsession/fixation on mother and that he understands the impact of his previous behaviour on her and W.    In practical terms, this is likely to be a report from a practitioner showing father&#8217;s engagement with a programme of therapy, attendance at a domestic abuse programme and pre-prepared communications that he intends to send to the child demonstrating his commitment to healthy indirect contact.</span></p>
