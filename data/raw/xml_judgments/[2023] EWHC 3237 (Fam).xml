She did so until 2pm on the 17 November 2023. There was a hearing on 28 February 2023 at which the father was represented by Mr Basi, counsel. The father was represented by Mr Gration KC and Mr Basi at a directions hearing in mid-March when the matter was listed for a three day final hearing to start on 10 July. At the pre-trial review (&#8220;PTR&#8221;) on 15 June, Roberts J made a detailed order requiring the mother to make the children available at a named contact centre on specific dates in the run up to the final hearing. That was so that they could spend time with their father, whom they had not seen face to face since 7 June 2022, prior to the start of the trial. The father attended the March and June hearings remotely from America.</span></p>

On 10 July, he again attended remotely from America represented by the same counsel. In the week prior to the final hearing, he sought an adjournment on the ground that the expert immigration evidence was incomplete. The mother agreed to that. The final hearing was adjourned and on 13 September 2023, the court sent notice of a four day hearing (day one to be a reading day) starting on 13 November. There was an entirely remote, second PTR in mid-October at which the father was represented by Mr Basi alone.  The Order directed the father &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">to attend in person if possible</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; at the November trial but permitted him to attend remotely if personal attendance was not possible.</span></p>

As the Order permitted remote attendance, I accepted that explanation without enquiring further or requesting a medical certificate.</span></p>

When asked why, he explained that he had received information from an acquaintance of both parties, which he considered to be credible, that were he to travel to England, his personal safety would be in danger from the mother&#8217;s family. He was not prepared to name the acquaintance because if he did, that person&#8217;s safety would also be in jeopardy. He declined to say anything about what caused him to consider the information reliable, the nature of the threat, or the identity of the person likely to carry it out. He said that he had been made aware of the threat in July and it was one of the reasons he did not come to England for contact (others being practical matters such as the contact centre being fully booked). He had not mentioned the threats in his July statement because at that stage, he was not sure how reliable the information was. Since July, all his devices had been hacked and he had lost e mails and messages. He could only assume this was the work of the mother and/or her family. He was adamant that it was too unsafe for him to risk coming to the UK now or in the future.</span></p>

The father speaks four languages: Russian (his first language), Ukrainian, Polish, and English. He has lived and worked in the US on and off from the age of 23. For many years he has been a qualified and licensed realtor in the state of Chicago. During the pandemic he gained a like qualification and license enabling him to practice as a realtor in the state of Florida. Despite that, he asked to give evidence through an interpreter. His understanding of spoken English and his own spoken English were good. However, it was clear that he could express himself more fluently and with greater ease and precision in Russian. As his legal team had not had confirmation that the court had arranged an interpreter, they had done so themselves. This interpreter did his best and we made progress, but there were delays in sound transmission and mother reported that some interpreted answers were incomplete. The court staff were able to secure the excellent services of an in person interpreter who attended on the afternoon of day two and on days three and four. Generally, only interpretation of the father&#8217;s answers to questions was required. On the rare occasion when he did not understand a question, he asked for it to be interpreted.</span></p>

Specifically, he had wanted her to be cross examined on her written application for a divorce and maintenance in the Ukrainian court which, as originally filed, failed to mention Alex&#8217;s existence. This was an issue he had addressed extensively in both of his statements. The point, going to credit, was that in Ukrainian law, a couple cannot apply for divorce if they have a child under twelve months, which Alex was when the application was filed. In that context, the father contended that the application constituted, in his words, fraud, forgery, deception, deceit and deliberate misrepresentation.  (The mother&#8217;s written response was that the omission of Alex&#8217;s name on the form was a mistake on her lawyer&#8217;s part which had been corrected). </span></p>

This evidence was relevant to shared parental intention to live in America on a long-term basis. Finally, he wanted me to see and take into account photographs of himself and Fred on the beach in Miami on 9 May 2022, the mother&#8217;s oral evidence having been that none of them went to the beach that day.</span></p>

With the assistance of Mr Hames KC and Mr Evans we went through the chronology of prior hearings. The father agreed that he had had the July trial bundle prior to 10 July. We established that that bundle was around 740 pages and the bundle for the November hearing around 800 pages. The difference was accounted for by additional expert immigration evidence and a short, procedural statement from the mother. After completing that exercise, the father did not disagree either that he had had ample time between July and November to consider the bundle&#8217;s content, or that he was well aware of the contents when the final hearing started.</span></p>

I said that I would hear from him last so that he could respond to the mother&#8217;s submissions. We then had a fifteen minute adjournment so that he could prepare. When we reconvened, the father refused to continue. At this point he said, as he had not before, that he had been misrepresented not just at this final hearing but throughout the whole proceedings from their beginning in January 2023. He felt unable to proceed without lawyers and would not be participating further. After the father left the hearing, I heard closing submissions on behalf of the mother and reserved my decision.</span></p>

The parties lived at more than one rented address in Florida and at least one twelve month lease was in the mother&#8217;s sole name. The father&#8217;s case was that the leases evidenced a shared parental intention to live in America permanently, or at a minimum on a long-term basis. I am satisfied that the leases and sub-lets (from which the father benefitted financially) were arranged and funded by him. The evidence was of routine trading arrangements whereby blocks of time in apartments in the prestigious tower blocks on the Miami beach are bought and sold so that people may spend the winter months in that part of the world. Those, like the father, who understand this market can make good money by taking out a twelve month lease, sub-letting during the lucrative high season, and residing there in the low season. Given the fluidity and impermanence of these residential arrangements, I did not find the evidence about the Florida leases helpful in determining parental intention or the wider issue of habitual residence.</span></p>

On 27 February they made it to a large private hospital which had converted its basement into a temporary facility for pregnant and postpartum mothers and which was welcoming all comers. They did not leave the basement until 7 March 2022. It was safe but chaotic with expecting, labouring, and just delivered mothers all check by jowl, beds in the corridors, fathers and children everywhere, whole families camping out, and people arriving with their cats and dogs.</span></p>

When I asked him about the interview, he said that he had misspoken because of his limited English and meant to say that they lived in Florida. The video shows him talking in a fluent, relaxed manner, the language he uses is not complicated, and he is precise in what he says. In cross examination he said that he had been intending go back to the US in November 2021 to rent an apartment for them to spend the winter in. My sense is that the father&#8217;s real centre of gravity was always America, specifically Chicago. Miami was somewhere that suited him and the mother when they were newly married, and where they became stuck during the pandemic. When asked by a stranger in this setting, he identified as living in Chicago. The mother&#8217;s case is that when they went to Ukraine in June 2021 it was on a long term basis. Further, that the shared intention was for them to live in Ukraine for at least a year, after Alex&#8217;s birth. That fits with the father renting an apartment in Kyiv for a year and Mrs X&#8217;s evidence that she remembered sitting round the table in the parents&#8217; Kyiv apartment and understanding from what they said that they intended to be there for Alex&#8217;s birth. It fits less well with the newspaper interview where the mother suggests that they had been intending to return to the US before Alex&#8217;s birth.</span></p>

On arrival, the accommodation was in a remote, converted monastery in a forest with no hospital close by. It did not feel like a safe place to give birth so after one night they travelled on to Lombardy where the family of the Italian husband of Mrs X, the mother&#8217;s old school-friend, had a holiday home.

Her aunt lives in Birmingham. Fred&#8217;s godmother and Alex&#8217;s godparents all live in London. The mother and the boys meet up with all of these people regularly. Fred goes to nursery. In October 2023, the mother filed for divorce in England and Wales.</span></p>

The US was home for both parents, they had prior links to the environment to which they returned and the intention was to stay there long term.

They think it doubtful that Alex was. The oral evidence of the mother and Mrs X was illuminating. It provided a vivid picture of what, from the point of view of each child, was an idyllic time. Fred had endured flight from a war zone, ten days encamped in a hospital basement, and a tense and epic days&#8217; long car journey across Europe. That instability ended with arrival at a luxurious mansion with gardens and a playground, abundant adult attention, and for much of his time there a child of his age to play with. He had family days out with his parents who were more relaxed and happy than he will have experienced them being in America.</span></p>

It is significant in my judgment that his parents chose to have him baptised in Italy not in America: they knew that there was in Italy the integration into a social and wider family environment that they could not provide for Alex in America. Neither parent was habitually resident in Italy and neither intended for the stay in that country to be anything other than a stop-gap. But the habitual residence test is not determined by parental intention, is focussed on stability not permanence and requires that the viewpoint is that of the child, not the adults. Further it is the quality and not the quantity of time spent in the country that is important. From the children&#8217;s perspective, this was a period of stability and one in which they had the requisite degree of integration into both a family and a social environment.</span></p>

In my judgment he lost that habitual residence during the car journey across Europe. Therefore, the alternative to finding that both children became habitually resident in Italy during their time there (two months for Fred, six weeks for Alex) was that they had no country of habitual residence. The application of the legal test to the relevant facts about their time in Italy does reasonably yield the conclusion that they were habitually resident there, and that finding accords with their best interests. The departure from Italy was definitive and they lost their habitual residence there when they arrived in America.</span></p>

I accept that such a finding is exceptional and not in the best interests of either child. However, these were exceptional months in the life of each child. The carefully laid plans for an integrated, stable family life in Miami, fell to pieces on arrival there. After a month the situation was so intolerable for the mother, and in her view injurious to the children&#8217;s welfare, that she removed the boys to Europe. For the next three months they had a nomadic existence, living out of suitcases, and travelling between countries to which the mother had no geographic, family or social connection searching for a place where they could drop anchor and put down roots. Their arrival in England on 2 September 2022 pursuant to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which provides three year visas, achieved reunification of the boys with all of their Ukrainian family save for their great-grandparents, and marked the start of a period of stability and significant integration into a social life. </span></p>

(The mother also argues financial uncertainty and difficulties in America given she does not know where the father lives. None of this reaches the Art 13(b) threshold in my view. Further, travel to America could be made conditional on the father first providing adequate funds, and practical matters could be satisfactorily resolved by lawyers.)</span></p>

It is difficult to see that there is a real risk that the mother and father would find themselves together in a situation where the father had an opportunity to threaten, alarm, harass or lay hands on the mother in a way that would affect the children directly or indirectly. The mother&#8217;s address could be kept confidential and any handover of the children would occur at a third party venue: either a contact centre or a lawyer&#8217;s office. Even if the father did find out where the mother was staying, she would not grant him entry and could move. She could also complain of any abusive conduct by the father to both sets of lawyers and, if necessary, to the police.</span></p>

This was said to arise in two ways. First, the mother might not gain entry to America for immigration reasons. That concern was comprehensively allayed by Mr Heller&#8217;s expert evidence and was not a live concern at the time of the November hearing. Second, the risk that the father would seek to have her prosecuted for child abduction or fraud and that any such complaint might result in the mother&#8217;s separation from the children. A particular concern is that the father might make a complaint to the police unbeknownst to the mother, causing her to be arrested at the airport.</span></p>
