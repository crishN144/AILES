First, the meaning and impact of a post-nuptial agreement which both parties signed about five years after the marriage.  Second, whether or not the husband made what is known as a  special contribution such that the amount now payable to the wife should be less than it otherwise might have been. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The relationship and marriage were of relatively long duration amongst those that end in divorce, namely about 20 years.  At its outset both parties were young, in their early to mid twenties.  They had similar modest incomes.  They had no capital.  The parties are now in their mid to late forties.  Entirely during the marriage, the husband was to earn considerable wealth.  The wealth later reduced in value but he still admits to net wealth of around US $225,000,000, or about &#163;144,000,000.  There is, therefore, more than enough to go round, and this is not a needs based case. </p>

Out of that she would have to house herself, as well as provide an income for herself.  He, meanwhile, would keep the parties&#8217; luxurious house in Kensington, London, worth about &#163;30,000,000 and also their fabulous holiday house in Aspen, Colorado, worth about $29,000,000 or &#163;18,000,000.  </p>

As I have repeatedly pointed out to them, this should be the easiest of cases to settle.  There is plenty of available capital and liquidity is not a significant issue.  The case is, and particularly was at the outset of the hearing, pregnant with litigation risk for both sides.  Further, a huge advantage of a carefully negotiated settlement would be that there could be a carefully negotiated division and allocation of particular assets, from large portfolios in funds to individual works of modern art.  Finally, a settlement would have given to the parties ownership of their agreed outcome and preserved their dignity.  Instead, the hearing has been one of unedifying and destructive pugilism. </p>

I only know that the husband has not budged on his open offer of $5,000,000 (all of it already her own assets) and not, as I understand it, a penny more.  Since the introduction of the modern rule in Family Procedure Rules, rule 9.28, the respondent is required to make an open proposal which clearly must be a genuine one, and it is on the fairness of that open offer and proposal that his reasonableness will be judged. </p>

Press have attended most of the hearing.  They have agreed not to mention in any report the names of the parties&#8217; two children, nor the schools they attend, nor the actual address of the home in Kensington, and I am confident that I can rely on their integrity in that regard. </p>

At one point we had the absurdity of going to one bundle for a letter and another bundle for the reply.  There was a pre-trial hearing before a circuit judge on 3rd December 2014.  He had no other involvement in the case either before or after that day.  Amongst many other directions, he did formally give &#8220;permission for the trial bundle to be extended to six lever arch files...&#8221;  I asked Mr Tim Bishop QC, who appeared on behalf of the wife, and who was present on 3rd December 2014, whether the circuit judge had exercised his own independent discretion in agreeing to six bundles, or whether he had been seduced by counsel.   Mr Bishop immediately and frankly said that the judge had been seduced by counsel and that it was not an independent assessment by the judge.  It was rubber stamped.  This is not how the very important Practice Direction 27A is intended to be applied.  Further, the cardinal and over arching words of the practice direction are the opening words of paragraph 4.1: &#8220;The bundle shall contain copies of only those documents which are relevant to the hearing and which it is necessary for the court to read or which will actually be referred to during the hearing ...&#8221;   However many bundles the court may </p>

Second, it did not, in fact, come from Ron Kesterson, but is merely hearsay as to his recollection, although Ron Kesterson appears to be alive, well, and available, and there is no explanation why he could not have sent his own direct response.  Third, there has been no opportunity to cross-examine or ask Ron Kesterson any follow up questions.  Finally, the email is no more than a statement of what Ron Kesterson recalls (14 years later) the husband and his counsel to have believed.  There has been no opportunity for any enquiry of the husband&#8217;s then counsel.  In the upshot, I entirely ignore the first sentence of that email.  The agreements are formal legal documents, prepared and drafted by lawyers, not by the parties themselves, and I simply do not know and will not speculate why there were two rather than one. </p>

But even if that was the only intended purpose and effect of clause V, the clause could only achieve that effect if it gave a real and not an illusory right to the wife.  An agreement which says that you can apply but you cannot receive anything is, to my mind, tantamount to excluding the jurisdiction of the court.  If that was the only purpose of clause V (upon which I disagree with Mr Vanden Eykel) it in any event does not achieve it. </p>

The answer is that exceptional earnings are to be regarded as a factor pointing away from equality of division when, but only when, it would be inequitable to proceed otherwise.

Nevertheless in practice, and for a self-evident reason, the claim to have made a special contribution seems so far to have arisen only in cases of substantial wealth generated by a party&#8217;s success in business during the marriage.  The self-evident reason is that in such cases there is substantial property over the distribution of which it is worthwhile to argue.  In such cases can the amount of the wealth alone make the contribution special? Or must the focus always be upon the manner of its generation?

Sometimes, by contrast, it will immediately be obvious that substantial wealth generated during the marriage is a windfall - the proceeds, for example, of an unanticipated sale of land for development or of an embattled takeover of a party&#8217;s ailing company -   which is not the product of a special contribution.&#8221;  </p>

The greater concern, however, is the obverse risk that it might encourage a court to discern special contribution in the generation of wealth above the threshold in circumstances in which it should not properly do so.

It may lead, as it did in this case, to the rather crude question to (in this case) the husband: &#8220;You don&#8217;t describe yourself as a genius, do you?&#8221; Not surprisingly, the husband, like any person with a modicum of modesty, was </p>

In this connection some reliance is placed upon the fact that soon after the separation the wife went on a long and lavish foreign trip with Mr H.

It would also have been deeply upsetting to the children, whose home it also was, and is, and who were, as I have said, much affected by the breakdown and the apparent reason for it, namely the affair with Mr H.  For a further two years the house has continued to be the home of the husband and the home to which the children return when not at boarding school, or in Aspen, or on other luxury holidays abroad.

The relatively small investments owned by the wife, but currently possessed by the husband, must be made available to her and, of course, taken into account.  The overall net worth must be calculated, using the husband&#8217;s discounted figures, and the balancing figure calculated which accords to the wife, overall, one half of all the assets.  That figure must be paid by the husband to the wife as a lump sum. </p>

Following argument during the subsequent working out of the order this period of 90 days (but not the 28 days for the first $60 million) was, by agreement, increased.] </p>
