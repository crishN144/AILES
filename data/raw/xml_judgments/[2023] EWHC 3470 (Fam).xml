      <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment was delivered in private and a Transparency Order and a reporting restrictions order are in force.   The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved.   All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so may be a contempt of court. </p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s proposed order extends beyond restrictions relating to the family proceedings, to restrictions relating to criminal proceedings. It is supported by P, who is the First Respondent and father of the older two children; by Mr&#160;Osborne, who is the father of the younger two children; Q, who is the maternal grandparent; and the Children's Guardian.  It is opposed by the BBC, which is represented at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appalling circumstances giving rise to the Local Authority's application for public law orders is that on 15 May 2023, Marcus Osborne murdered both the children's mother, Katie Higton, and another man, and raped another woman.  I&#160;know who that other woman is but there is no need for me to name her or to give any details now.  I understand the children were in the house at the time, or in the vicinity, and they witnessed some of the aftermath of this appalling event.</p>

HHJ Hillier made a transparency order on 18 May 2023 and later revised it on 23 August 2023. It allows for reporting of the family law proceedings by pilot reporters even though those proceedings are heard in private.  They may not only attend the private hearings, but they can report on them subject to the restrictions within that order.</p>

They are Section&#160;12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 and Section 97 (2) of the Children Act 1989.  Section&#160;12 provides that: </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[22] The Court has power both to relax and to add to the automatic restraints. In exercising this jurisdiction, the court must conduct the balancing exercise described in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication)</span> [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, [2005] 1 FLR 591, and in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v W, L, W, T and R (by the Children's Guardian)</span> [2005] EWHC 1564 (Fam), [2006] 1 FLR 1.  This necessitates what Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> at paragraph 17 called 'an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in an individual case'. There are typically a&#160;number of competing interests engaged protected by Article 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention.  I incorporate in this judgment, without further elaboration or quotation, the analyses which I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure)</span> [2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, at para [93], and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Webster; Norfolk County Council v Webster and Others</span> [2006] EWHC 2733 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 1146, at para [80]. As Lord Steyn pointed out in Re S, para [25], it is "necessary to measure the nature of the impact &#8230; on the child" of what is in prospect. Indeed, the interests of the child, although not paramount, must be a primary consideration, that is, they must be considered first though they can, of course, be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations: <span style="font-style:italic">ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166, para [33].&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[23] I should add two further points. The court may, by an appropriate injunction, extend the anonymity of the child beyond the point at which section 97 of the 1989 Act ceases to have effect in accordance with Clayton v Clayton [2006] EWCA Civ 878, [2006] Fam 83, [2007] 1 FLR 11. But it is important to note the views expressed in that case by each of my two immediate predecessors as to the likely need for specific orders protecting a child's identity beyond the conclusion of the proceedings. Both were sceptical. Sir Mark Potter P said this (para [51]):</p>

There is a clear and obvious public interest in maintaining the confidence of the public at large in the courts. It is vitally important, if the administration of justice is to be promoted and public confidence in the courts maintained, that justice be administered in public &#8211; or at least in a manner which enables its workings to be properly scrutinised &#8211; so that the judges and other participants in the process remain visible and amenable to comment and criticism. This principle, as the Strasbourg court has repeatedly reiterated, is protected by both Article 6 and Article 10 of the Convention.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is not the role of the judge to seek to exercise any kind of editorial control over the manner in which the media reports information which it is entitled to publish.

But judges are not arbiters of taste or decency &#8230; It is not the function of the judges to legitimise 'responsible' reporting whilst censoring what some are pleased to call 'irresponsible' reporting &#8230; And as the Strasbourg jurisprudence establishes (see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris; Attorney-General v Harris</span> [2001] 2 FLR 895, at [373]), the freedom of expression secured by Art 10 is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received, or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or any section of the community. Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. It is not for the court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. Article 10 entitles journalists to adopt a particular form of presentation intended to ensure a particularly telling effect on the average reader. As Neill LJ recognised [in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Wardship: Publication of Information)</span> [1992] 1 FLR 99] a tabloid newspaper is entitled to tell the story in a manner which will engage the interest of its readers and the general public."</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[32] There are a number of specific consequences of the grant of an injunction as asked for in this case to be considered. First, while counsel for the child wanted to confine a ruling to the grant of an injunction restraining publication to protect a child, that will not do. The jurisdiction under the ECHR could equally be invoked by an adult non-party faced with possible damaging publicity as a result of a trial of a parent, child or spouse. Adult non-parties to a criminal trial must therefore be added to the prospective pool of applicants who could apply for such injunctions. This would confront newspapers with an ever wider spectrum of potentially costly proceedings and would seriously inhibit the freedom of the press to report criminal trials.</p>

It is easy to visualise circumstances in which attempts will be made to enjoin publicity of, for example, the gruesome circumstances of a crime. The process of piling exception upon exception to the principle of open justice would be encouraged and would gain in momentum.</p>

If the newspapers choose not to contest such an injunction, they are less likely to give prominence to reports of the trial. Certainly, readers will be less interested and editors will act accordingly. Informed debate about criminal justice will suffer.</p>

Even for national newspapers that is, however, a costly matter which may involve proceedings at different judicial levels. Moreover, time constraints of an impending trial may not always permit such proceedings. Often it will be too late and the injunction will have had its negative effect on contemporary reporting.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"> [36] Fifthly, it is easy to fall into the trap of considering the position from the point of view of national newspapers only. Local newspapers play a huge role. In the United Kingdom according to the website of The Newspaper Society there are 1301 regional and local newspapers which serve villages, towns and cities. Apparently, again according to the website of The Newspaper Society, over 85% of all British adults read a regional or local newspaper compared to 70% who read a national newspaper. Very often a sensational or serious criminal trial will be of great interest in the community where it took place. A regional or local newspaper is likely to give prominence to it. That happens every day up and down the country. For local newspapers, who do not have the financial resources of national newspapers, the spectre of being involved in costly legal proceedings is bound to have a chilling effect. If local newspapers are threatened with the prospect of an injunction such as is now under consideration it is likely that they will often be silenced. Prudently, the Romford Recorder, which has some 116,000 readers a week, chose not to contest these proceedings. The impact of such a new development on the regional and local press in the United Kingdom strongly militates against its adoption. If permitted, it would seriously impoverish public discussion of criminal justice.&#8221;</p>

Firstly, it binds all persons and all companies who know the order has been made.  To that extent, it has further reach than the transparency order. As Mr&#160;Tyler KC rightly told the Court, the transparency order has a different purpose than a reporting restrictions order. The former is designed to allow the reporting of private family proceedings within a&#160;pilot and reporting by those who actually attend the hearing. A&#160;reporting restriction order has a&#160;wider ambit and is designed specifically to restrict reporting rather than to promote reporting.</p>

It includes, as prohibited information, the genders of the children.  It applies to the name of any party to the proceedings, which would include the Local Authority, whereas the transparency order allows for the reporting of the Local Authority. It includes prohibitions on publishing photographs or images of the children or &#8220;any other identifying person&#8221; which would, in fact, encompass images of either parents, or indeed, of the First Respondent in the proceedings, because those would be &#8220;identifying persons&#8221; &#8211; identifying them would be liable to identify the children to the section of the public that knew of the family.</p>

The final provision under 13, as currently drafted, is too wide as it does not restrict the provision, as is the case in Section 97 (2) of the Children Act, to information that the subject child, or former child, is the subject of proceedings under the Children Act 1989 or the Adoption and Children Act 2002.</p>

The fact that no reporting restriction order has yet been made in the criminal proceedings does not mean that this court should necessarily pre-empt the decision of the criminal court, to make one.  It is in my view very likely that the sentencing judge will be asked to make a&#160;reporting restriction order in relation to the children who are the subject of the proceedings before me.  Contact could be made now by the Local Authority or the Guardian with the Crown Prosecution Service to make enquiries about such an application being made, and that may serve to give the elder children in particular, some reassurance that an application will be made and it will be considered by the judge in the crown court. From the submissions to me and the evidence before me, it appears to be highly likely that there will be no opposition to such an application and that, if it is considered necessary, the application will be made and granted.</p>

The evidence provided to me concerns the distress caused to the children from being identified because their mother and Mr Osborne have been, and will be, identified by the media when reporting on the criminal proceedings unless prevented by a reporting restriction order.
