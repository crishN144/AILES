After a few years they moved to England until, in 2011, after the birth of their third child, the family moved to Y where the mother had lived for a while when a child, and where some of her own family still resided. In April 2013, mistakenly believing that his wife had been unfaithful, The father took a sharp, metal implement to the mother&#8217;s head, striking multiple blows. He pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated assault and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He had served time in prison on remand, was released after four further years, and was then deported to the United Kingdom in 2017. In September 2019 the mother brought her children to England where they have since remained. She resumed her relationship with the father and moved in with him shortly after arrival. The family lived together again for a few weeks before the applicant Local Authority became aware at the end of October 2019 and obtained an interim care order on 17 December 2019. </p>

The Local Authority now applies for final care orders in respect of the children, seeking their placement together in long term foster care. J and G have instructed solicitors. H is represented by their Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Rush. By the conclusion of the hearing before me it, none of the respondents contended that the threshold was not met, but they all oppose the Local Authority&#8217;s application that the children be placed in long term foster care. The Guardian has proposed a Supervision Order for J, a Care Order with placement at home for H, and a similar order, or a Supervision Order in respect of G. </p>

A great deal of evidence was submitted shortly before and during the hearing.

Her mother remained in Y and she and her husband have been separated, but not divorced, for many years. The mother says that she was accepted at universities in Y but her family would not allow her to go. She has reported that as a child, her father beat her, once tying her up and whipping her when he mistakenly believed that she had drunk alcohol.  He was generally quick to temper and, according to her, once badly beat her mother. The mother came to live in England at the age of 18. She undertook courses in estate agency and in childminding. She married the father in 2003 when she was aged 23. J was born in 2004, G in 2008, and H in 2010. The family moved to Y in 2011. The mother now lives with her three children in the town of Z.

The children did not witness the attack and there is no evidence that they saw their injured mother, but the father saw them and hugged them before he was taken away by police. At that moment they lost both parents &#8211; their father going into custody for a prolonged period, and their mother being admitted to hospital, unconscious. The children were taken away from their home by police, the house was sealed as a crime scene, and they were then looked after by their maternal uncle and maternal grandmother.

In November 2015 local children&#8217;s services became involved after the mother reported that her brother and mother had been physically and verbally abusive to her. She moved into a shelter with the children but swiftly returned back to the family home. Children&#8217;s Services maintained an involvement with the family until November 2018. It was unable to verify the mother&#8217;s allegations and no injuries were observed even after she made specific accusation about suffering bruises or about being poisoned. Children&#8217;s Services were concerned that the children were frequently exposed to adult conflict within the home and that the mother was unable to refrain from arguing or spreading false information about other adults in front of the children, even when workers from Children&#8217;s Services were present. The mother was noted to be unable to manage stress, she would not take medication for depression that she had been prescribed. The mother had been observed to &#8220;wail, rock, and hit herself when confronted about child protection issues.&#8221; </p>

Staff at the shelter reported concerns about the mother neglecting the children&#8217;s basic needs. Once again the mother and children returned to the family home. Thereafter workers at Children&#8217;s Services were concerned that the mother had left the children unsupervised. They advised members of the extended family to apply for custody of the children and on 17 December 2018 the court ordered that the children be in the temporary care of the maternal uncle and maternal grandmother. An agreement was signed under which the mother&#8217;s contact with the children was to be supervised by members of the family, but it was not adhered to. Although the tenor of these reports is that the mother was the source of disharmony, there is evidence, for example a recording of a complaint by G, of physical force being used by family members against the children, and the mother. Many of the mother&#8217;s actions during this disruptive time might be viewed as steps taken by her to protect her children. Furthermore, she was still on the long road of recovery from a severe brain injury. </p>

She did not inform members of her family of the reason for the trip but in England she visited the father. According to his evidence they discussed issues and decided to reconcile. On 24 July 2018, back in Y, the mother informed a Children&#8217;s Services worker that she had reconciled with the father and planned to move with the children to the United Kingdom. Relations within the family grew ever more tense until a proposal was put forward for a cousin of the mother, who lived in another city, to care for the children with the mother living with them. This arrangement began in September 2018. The family file was transferred to Children&#8217;s Services in that city, who worked with the family until August 2019. The mother indicated in early 2019 that she was unhappy living in the new city. It later transpired that the mother had moved out of her cousin&#8217;s house in January 2019 to live in a basement apartment with the children until March 2019 when she moved with the children to a shelter in another city. They moved to another shelter in the same city in April 2019 and then moved to an apartment there in June 2019. </p>

J travelled to England earlier than their mother and siblings, having initially attended a wedding in Europe, and in fact stayed with the father for a week in August 2019. The rest of the family left Y on or about 16 September 2019. The father met them at the airport and he stayed with the mother, G and H at a hotel for a few nights.

It seems that the family moved to the two bedroom flat at the end of September 2019. Children&#8217;s Services contacted the NSPCC in England and the NSPCC made a referral to local Children&#8217;s Services who, in late October 2019, found that the children were living with the mother and father in the two bedroom flat in the town of Z. On 29 October 2019, the father agreed to move out whilst an assessment was carried out. The father had lived with the family for approximately one month.

Perceptual reasoning (measuring non-verbal reasoning) and working memory were in the Extremely Low range.

While there are no diagnosable mental health difficulties at this time for J and G, the impact of frequently moving house and schools and being witness to conflict within the family cannot be underestimated. H is selectively mute and has significant learning needs, both of which may have been exacerbated by the instability of the past few years. School are currently applying for an EHCP. Nevertheless, the children all seem to have positive attachments to their mother and wish to remain in her care. They do not appear to have a significant attachment to their father.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">In oral evidence Dr Chalmers-Brown confirmed that her findings as to the mother&#8217;s cognitive impairment and mental state had been similar to those of Dr Ziyal. Dr Leyla Ziyal is a Chartered Consultant Clinical Neuropsychologist who has provided three reports on the mother, dated 22 November 2020, 14 December 2020, and 23 February 2021. It was only in the third report that she was able to comment on CT brain scans from Y. The first report is a general assessment; the second is an investigation of the impact of her brain injury on the mother&#8217;s parenting ability, risk awareness and therapeutic needs. Dr Ziyal assessed the mother remotely or in person on four occasions before providing her reports. Her written and oral evidence is marked by attention to detail and a desire to understand the mother&#8217;s abilities as well as her deficits. She found that the mother demonstrated Borderline to Very Low cognitive levels ranging between the 1st and 5th percentiles for verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. Her memory performance was more effective than her cognitive abilities. Her executive performance was well below average, testing revealing executive function between the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentiles, but language difficulties may have had an impact on performance. Her mood state was stable with no indications of depression, anxiety or hopelessness, but she scored highly for &#8220;tough-mindedness&#8221;, indicating a possible tendency to repress expression of emotion, and low levels of sensitivity and empathy, and for dissimulation. Dr Ziyal explained in oral evidence that the high score for dissimulation was not necessarily an indication of false reporting. A high score might also indicate a na&#239;ve or &#8220;un-streetwise&#8221; individual who is answering genuinely that, for example, they never disobeyed their parents, rather than someone who says that in order to impress or to create a false impression of goodness. Given that the mother did not seek to impress in her answers to the toughmindedness questions, Dr Ziyal interpreted the mother&#8217;s high scores for dissimulation as indicative of naivety rather than conscious or unconscious false reporting.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">In her first two reports, Dr Ziyal was reluctant to ascribe the mother&#8217;s low functioning on assessment to the brain injury sustained in 2014, not least because of the absence of information about pre-injury functioning and the fact that she did not have access to the CT brain scans. She also advised in her second report that it is &#8220;highly probable that the mother&#8217;s present cognitive profile is an underestimate of her true potential. In addition to impaired vision, socio-cultural/educational and linguistic variables would have had an adverse effect on her effectiveness in each of the three domains under investigation.&#8221; On making suitable adjustments, the mother&#8217;s results indicated low average levels at the 27th percentile of her peers for verbal effectiveness, and good average to low average memory function. Executive function, adjusted, was still &#8220;well below average and ranges between the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 0<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentiles&#8221;. [E327]. Dr Ziyal found consistency of performance in testing and no evidence of mental illness, poor impulse control, poor emotional regulation or post traumatic stress disorder. Her assessments indicated self-confidence in her parenting effectiveness. They also showed lowest attachment and communication with J, highest with H. However, Dr Ziyal told the court that these were simple tests of attachment, not an exploration of whether there was any attachment disorder. </p>

She recommended that an occupational therapist be engaged to oversee the support work that the mother receives and should continue to receive, and that psychological therapy should be deployed, both interventions being likely to improve her ability to structure her daily life, deal with practical arrangements, and have greater insight into the impact on her and the children of her limitations. Dr Chalmers-Brown effectively deferred to Dr Ziyal on the question of further rehabilitation. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">Dr Parsons assessed the father. He reported that in April 2013 the father had been ruminating for at least a week about the idea that his wife had been unfaithful. His thinking was distorted and based on trivial incidents. For about two hours prior to the attack his anger had built. He went to look for an implement with which to strike the mother. His assault on her was not planned long in advance but it was clearly premeditated.  The risk of the father acting in the same way again had to be considered in the context of his distorted thinking at the time of the attack, his understanding of why he acted as he did, and his commitment to preventing himself from repeating such thinking and action. Dr Parsons noted the father&#8217;s evidence that he had not written the entries in the worksheets for his prison work during sessions directed at controlling his offending behaviour. He described this as very worrying. If true, then the father may have misled prison authorities in Y, who had released him early in part because of his work in these sessions, or he was misleading the court now because he did not want to be associated with comments in the written work about exercising control over his family, or the work done was slipshod and could not be relied upon. In any event, the father&#8217;s evidence gave rise to increased concern about the risk he posed to others. Dr Parsons&#8217; view was that the father has yet to confront his own conduct and the consequences of it. He expressed a professional opinion that the lack of empathy shown in the father&#8217;s final statement to this court was remarkable. He said that the father was capable of empathy - he was not psychopathic - but showed none for his wife or his children. His expressions of remorse might as easily be for the impact of his conduct on his own life as for its impact on his family. Dr Parsons advised that it was unlikely that the father would re-offend in the same way, and that the risk of him doing so was &#8220;low&#8221;, but it was &#8220;real&#8221;.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">A Parenting Assessment was performed by the local authority parenting assessor, dated 4 December 2020. It is a very lengthy document and the parenting assessor&#8217;s oral evidence took some time also. Whilst her approach was thorough, it was clear that because of the timing of her assessment process and report, she had been unable fully to reflect on developments since the autumn of 2020. She had not, for example, assessed the children&#8217;s wishes and feeling since some six months before the hearing. I was concerned also that she set the bar very high in terms of her expectations of the mother&#8217;s parenting, and by focusing on the mother&#8217;s limitations, she sometimes missed the larger picture. For example, she concludes that the mother is not providing good enough care practically (as well as emotionally) to all three children, but the mother has sole care of J who is well-dressed, well-nourished, healthy, and has good attendance at school where they are making excellent progress. Even if J is relatively self-sufficient, it is very difficult to understand how a conclusion could be reached that the mother is not providing good enough practical care for J. The same applies to G.  The parenting assessor told the court that certain interventions had not been forthcoming because the mother did not think she needed it, or that a particular support service was not in place because the mother did not engage with it. The fact that the mother&#8217;s impairments might compromise her ability to understand her own limitations and to organise her time, did not seem to be at the forefront of the parenting assessor&#8217;s analysis.  </p>

She had some word finding difficulties, problems with ordering memories, and she displayed very concrete thinking. Nevertheless, she showed some insight, she had clearly reflected on the evidence in the case, and she appeared to give sincere and genuine answers to the questions put. Dr Chalmers-Brown has certified the mother as having capacity to conduct proceedings [E21] and there is no hint in the evidence that she lacks capacity in other spheres of decision-making such as residence or contact with others. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">The mother clearly loves her children. She showed a good understanding of their individual characters and needs. She showed awareness of some of her limitations but has a lack of understanding of the extent to which her brain damage affects her executive functioning in terms of planning and organisation. My overwhelming impression however was of a woman of remarkable resilience. She had a very difficult childhood, suffering physical abuse and witnessing physical abuse of her mother. She was in a coma for several days after the attack in 2013, awoke from that unable to walk or see, and has made an impressive recovery to her present condition. During the past eight years she has brought up three children sometimes in the face of very difficult relations with her mother and brother in Y, sometimes resorting to living in sheltered accommodation. She has moved countries and has negotiated a potentially very difficult relationship with the applicant Local Authority whilst remaining courteous, co-operative, and optimistic. Whatever concerns there might be about her ability to protect and care for her children, the fact is that J is an impressive young person doing excellently at school, G is a well-liked young teenager who is making good educational progress, and H is a much-loved child who has close bonds with their mother and siblings. They have significant educational needs but is beginning to make some educational progress. All three children are reported to be well-mannered, respectful, kind, and helpful to others. Given the circumstances, the mother must take credit. </p>

The mother has missed a number of appointments with professionals, but one of the consequences of her brain injury, as Dr Ziyal&#8217;s evidence made clear, is that the mother&#8217;s executive function is now &#8220;well below average&#8221;. Impaired executive functioning means that she is deficient in organising and planning. She needs help to attend appointments on time and would benefit from repeated reminders of appointments. She needs help with planning how to travel to an appointment and with how to manage with obstacles such as an ill child, or a missed bus. In addition, the mother&#8217;s visual impairment means that she cannot read correspondence. Criticism of her for missing appointments or failing to take the initiative in relation to support services, fails to acknowledge the mother&#8217;s disabilities. </p>

At one point during her rehabilitation in Y she used a cane. She ceased needing a cane and has not used one since being in England. The parenting assessor says at paragraph 5.5 of the Parenting Assessment report [E243], &#8220;She refuses to use a cane despite numerous accounts of falling over and she has been unwilling to engage with counselling via the [local] Association for the Blind&#8221;.  I have a letter from that Association at [J324-325] which refers to contact with the mother and does not mention any recommendation that she uses a cane. It does state that she is &#8220;a very kind and gentle lady. I believe she has been misinformed every step of the way on her journey as someone who has recently lost their eyesight. [She] has not been provided with sound advice.&#8221; One source of unsound advice is identified as the light/energy therapist.

He was a quiet, undemonstrative witness who nevertheless became upset when asked about the impact of his attack in 2013. He said that other people were jealous of the relationship he had with the mother prior to the assault in 2013. He did not raise a hand to her or the children, or anyone else before the assault, and he has not done so since then. He expressed remorse for what he called his &#8220;heinous crime&#8221; and acknowledged that it has had a deep effect on the children, as well as the mother. At the same time, he deflected responsibility for what he had done, telling the court that if only his wife&#8217;s Uncle, with whom he had visited the shops shortly before the attack, had taken him to one side, or if only his wife had been with one of the children when he found her (already with a sharp metal implement in his hand) then the assault would not have occurred. He denied that the assault was pre-meditated and told the court that the sentencing judge&#8217;s remarks were just the judge&#8217;s opinion about what had happened. The father told me that he had wrongly believed that his wife was being unfaithful to him but that he had only thought of harming his wife when he took some items he had bought at the shops to the basement, saw the open toolbox, and reached for an implement. The implement he took hold of was a sharp metal tool. He then went up two flights of stairs to the master bedroom and on seeing his wife come out of the en suite bathroom he attacked her. He did not know what had come over him. He was unable to tell me what feeling he had at the time. The attack ceased when the maternal uncle entered the room and told him to stop. The father told me that he himself called the police to report what he had done. The children had been in another bedroom on the same floor where the attack took place. They were brought downstairs and he spoke to them and hugged them before the police took him away. </p>

He said that the course provider would spend 20 minutes a day with him after the 40 minute group session talking through the course content with him. This happened every day for three months, according to the father. There are no separate records of this additional work and no evidence that the course provider had made alterations to the hand-written entries on the documentation that were made by other inmates. Accordingly, the course notes are of very little value to this court and do not assist to demonstrate that the father has undertaken any valuable rehabilitation work. </p>

The reason he gave for staying together at a hotel on arrival in England was that he desperately wanted to spend time with the children after a gap of so many years. The reason he wants to have contact with the children is because they are the focus of his life. His determination to dedicate his life to making amends supports the view that he firmly believes that it is in their best interests for him to play a more active role in their lives. </p>

H is the most likely of the three siblings to want to talk to their father but conversations between H and their father have been observed to be one-sided, with H chatting persistently about whatever is on their mind without requiring much response from the father. </p>

There are no such problems reported at home. The Guardian reports that &#8220;H appears to be content in the care of their mother. They have a good relationship with their siblings and mother.&#8221; Their wishes and feeling are difficult to discern, according to the Guardian, but &#8220;I think that H wishes to continue to be placed with their mother wherever that may be.&#8221; That accords with all the other evidence in this case. </p>

They have been receiving specialist tuition and reports are that they are working hard, doing fine and want to learn, have a good attitude, are very organised, and have improved a lot. I have received a Personal Education Plan from December 2020 [J371] which notes &#8220;more than expected progress&#8221; in most subjects, that G felt they had &#8220;settled very well&#8221; into the school and had made friends with a small group of children, and that they had made &#8220;good progress&#8230; their behaviour and uniform excellent however attendance needs to improve.&#8221; </p>

G looks to J for guidance and as an advocate on occasions, but they have made their own views very clear. In their Position Statement G tells the court that they want to stay with their mother, that their mother is able to take care of them and their siblings, and that if they were removed from their mother&#8217;s care &#8220;I would feel angry, mad and sad. I don&#8217;t want to go!&#8221; They are reluctant to have contact with their father. They are close to both siblings. It upset them to be brought to England and to find themselves living with their father. They initially expressed a clear wish to return to Y but they appear now to be more settled in England and in any event accept that they would prefer to stay in England if moving to Y meant they would be separated from their mother and siblings. </p>

J themselves do not see it that way and is anxious to correct the notion that the contributions they make are out of the ordinary. They certainly express no resentment on that account. What they does resent is having been removed from Y. Earlier in these proceedings they had a firm wish to return as soon as possible. Now, they wish at least to complete their GCSE&#8217;s here before making any decisions about their future. They are contemplating applying to university, and that is a realistic goal for them. At their request I met J (remotely) with their solicitor before the hearing. They talked about their education and about their feelings regarding this case. They struck me as an insightful and intelligent young person. They clearly do not wish to be moved to a foster carer. At some point they would like to return to Y &#8211; they do not enjoy living in England by comparison &#8211; but they will wait for an appropriate break in their education. J is 16 years 5 months old. They are described by others as dutiful and compliant, but they also have their own views about where they should be living and with whom. They are loyal to their siblings but do not wish to live with a foster carer. They are old enough simply to refuse to move to a foster carer or to leave foster care following a placement.   </p>

In my judgement, having regard to the evidence as a whole, I believe that their concerns are over-stated. Both the mother and J are strongly opposed to being separated from each other. There was some conflict between them in relation to the events of late 2019. J is articulate and, whilst dutiful, independent-minded. Their mother loves J, as she loves all her children, but a 16 year old with different ideas about where and how they should live, may pose challenges for any parent, not least one who has the impairments that the mother has. However, I do not perceive the relationship between J and their mother to be dysfunctional or a source of harm to J.  </p>

That speaks highly of the mother who has brought them up all their lives and has done so without their father for the last eight years, and amidst family conflict in Y. They have a strong bond with each other and they all strongly wish to remain living with their mother. The children will not pressure the mother to reunite with the father, quite the reverse. Whilst J has helped their mother to cope over the last few years, the evidence does not persuade me that they have shouldered an unreasonable burden which ought not to be placed on a young person. In that I disagree with the parenting assessor&#8217;s analysis and prefer J&#8217;s own characterisation of their role as being within the norm for a young person in their culture. </p>

One called it &#8220;inhumane&#8221;. They all appeared genuinely to understand that the father represented a risk to the mother and the children should he live with them in the future. They were all very supportive of the mother but assured the court that they would inform social services or authorities if they knew that The father was in the home, or if they believed that the mother needed help.  </p>

She has formed a good understanding of each child and was realistic about the mother and father. Her reports and oral evidence were well-reasoned and I give them significant weight. Ultimately her recommendations were that the children should stay with the mother, with a supervision order in relation to J, a care order in relation to H, and either a supervision order or care order in relation to G. Her overwhelming concern was the risk to the children from the father&#8217;s involvement in their lives but she considered that this could be adequately managed with the children remaining with their mother. She did not believe that J would accept long term foster care and there was a risk that G might not do so either. Therefore, the Local Authority&#8217;s plan risked separating the siblings which was against their wishes and their interests. Separation for their mother would add disruption to their lives just as they are benefiting from some stability and would risk H&#8217;s current progress being reversed.  </p>

He says that he was carrying out building work in the basement of the house and that the sharp metal implement was in a toolbox there. He has told this court that the attack was not premeditated. I accept that it was not planned days ahead, but I reject his evidence that he did not think about what he was going to do in advance of attacking his wife. The father told the court that he was in such a disturbed state when he was shopping with the maternal uncle in the two hours or so prior to the attack, that the uncle ought not to have left him alone when they returned to the house. Although the father was unable to say what emotions he was feeling at the time, on his own account he was in an agitated state for some time before the assault, and during the time he returned to the house, went to the basement, picked up the sharp metal implement, went up two flights of stairs, and found the mother. He did not act spontaneously in the heat of the moment. He discussed his belief in his wife&#8217;s infidelity with the maternal uncle, collected a weapon, went upstairs, found his wife, and attacked her. In any event, when benefiting from legal representation, the father agreed to a set of facts as the basis for his plea and sentence. It appears that, as a consequence, the charge of attempted murder against him was dropped, and a plea to aggravated assault was accepted by the prosecution. I do not have a copy of those agreed facts but the sentencing judge referred to them and observed that they showed that the attack was pre-meditated. The father benefited from that agreement by avoiding trial for attempted murder. It is of significant concern that he has not come to terms with what he did, that he now seeks to persuade this court that the attack was not pre-meditated. I am entirely satisfied that it was pre-meditated. </p>

The father&#8217;s suspicions that his wife was having an affair were based on the most unremarkable behaviour, such as going to a late night supermarket. There is no evidence that he spoke to his wife about his suspicions. There was no argument or accusation. She had no opportunity to explain. Without any warning he attacked her with a sharp metal implement. This was not an act of stupidity, as he now explains it, but was an act of callous brutality. He could well have killed the mother and only stopped hitting her with the sharp metal implement when her uncle came into the room. And yet he tells this court in a statement that, &#8220;I never wished to harm my wife to the extent that I did&#8230;&#8221; Quite clearly he intended to cause her serious harm, administering multiple blows to her with a sharp metal implement.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">It maybe thought to be na&#239;ve to accept that this violent outburst occurred as a huge, solitary wave in an otherwise calm sea. However, the evidence does not disclose any evidence of previous control, coercive behaviour or violence by the father against the mother. The father&#8217;s prison worksheets do refer rather obliquely to his desire to exercise control, but for reasons already given the evidence is not reliable and in any event does not provide cogent evidence about their relationship. The family members, the contemporaneous reactions of those close to the couple as recorded in the records from Y, and the mother&#8217;s own evidence, all point to a warm relationship prior to this terrible event. I accept that the warmth of the relationship may have existed because the mother was generally submissive to the father, but I have received no evidence to suggest that there was any conduct that might be considered to be domestic abuse prior to the explosive violence in April 2013. </p>

Before she arrived, the father had told LM that the couple had reconciled. J had already come to England via a family wedding in Europe and had stayed for a week with the father in England. They are adamant that they viewed the trip as a holiday and fully expected to return to Y to resume their education there. That is also G&#8217;s view. They travelled to England with their mother and H. The mother&#8217;s account is that she too expected the trip to be a temporary one. As already noted, her account is that she wished for H to see the light/energy therapist but had to wait in England to make contact with him. Social services intervened before she managed to make contact and see him. In fact, H did see him in January 2020.  </p>

Documentary evidence from Children&#8217;s Services in Y confirms that the mother told them, in advance, of her flight to England with the younger two children, and that the purpose was to then connect with the light/energy therapist so that H could receive therapy. The Social Worker, also knew that J had spent a week in England with the father and he spoke with both J and the father about the time they had spent together. He recorded that there were insufficient concerns to prevent the mother from going with the children overseas. The mother&#8217;s trip to England with G and H was not made covertly. </p>

The records from Y show contact between the Y social worker LM and J on 27 September 2019 in which they informed him that they were &#8220;going to live with their parents. Parents&#8217; plan was for J and mother to come back to Y to take care of loose ends and then they would move permanently back to England.&#8221; Both the mother and father told Y Social Services that they had reconciled in 2018. They apparently had not told the children. J and G wanted to come back to Y and live with their grandmother. </p>

In this conversation we discussed the family coming to join me and it is clear the Y Authorities were aware of the developments. LM did not have significant concerns about the family reuniting and this made me feel secure that my wife and I were making the right decision for the sake of the family.&#8221; The notes made by LM [Y bundle at 2340] do record a conversation with the father on 13 September 2019, before the mother left Y, in which the father said that they &#8220;wish to live together if possible.

It is also possible that the father and mother may have wished for different outcomes from the trip to England. However, it is sufficiently clear from the records made by LM in Y, and I find, that both parents planned that the mother and children would have a fairly substantial stay in England, that one purpose of the visit was for H to receive therapy from the light/energy therapist, but that another purpose was to spend time together again as a family, with a view to making that a permanent arrangement at some point in the future. The father secured a two bed flat for himself and the whole family. They did not discuss the plan with the children. Had it not been for the visit of social services at the end of October 2019, it is likely that the family would have continued to live together in the flat for at least some weeks or months. The mother continued to pay rent on her home in Y and, on balance, I accept her evidence that she intended to return there after the trip to Europe. She did not buy return flights because she did not know when the therapy would end. However, the parents clearly did look forward to a permanent reuniting of the family in England at </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">There is no evidence that the father has caused any physical harm to his children. The harm he has caused them is emotional and psychological harm by attacking their mother and causing her severe, lifelong injuries. This harm was aggravated by the fact that they were in the house at the time. As a result of his actions the children were suddenly without either parent able to care for them. Their mother has permanent visual and cognitive impairments &#8211; with significant consequences for the children&#8217;s upbringing. In addition, they effectively lost their father on the night of the attack. To that extent there is ongoing harm to the children. However, the most significant risk to consider is that which would arise if the family were to reunite and the father were to live with the mother again, or at least have substantial contact with her and the children. Dr Parsons&#8217; persuasive opinion was that there is a real continuing risk that the father might violently assault a member of his family or someone else close to him in the future. Further, his closer involvement in the children&#8217;s lives represents a &#8220;significant risk&#8221; of immediate emotional harm to them. No risk of violence towards a stranger has been identified. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">The father&#8217;s assault on the mother in 2013 came from nowhere so far as the mother was concerned. One of the mother&#8217;s friends from her support network who gave evidence convincingly told the court that the father was a mild-mannered, quiet man who everyone had considered was non-violent. The police documents from Y show that the immediate reaction of relatives after the assault had been the same &#8211; there had been no previous abuse or violence within the relationship. However, he acted with explosive and uncontrolled violence in April 2013 and it would be na&#239;ve now to regard him as a non-violent person, particularly in the absence of compelling evidence of self-awareness as to why he acted as he did. He has proved himself capable of extreme brutality towards someone close to him. Nor did it take very much to provoke him to extreme violence. Even from the father&#8217;s own account, his anger was wholly disproportionate to the circumstances as he perceived them to be. His perceptions were distorted and even now he shows little to no empathy towards those harmed by his actions. It is difficult therefore ever to rule out a repeat of such behaviour. His violence sprang from nowhere and it could spring from nowhere again were he in a close relationship with the family. His behaviour did not significantly change in the days before the attack and no-one had any grounds to believe he would act as he did. So, there must be a risk that if he felt the same way again, no-one would be able to see the violent outburst that was coming. The father is clearly a continuing danger to his wife. Dr Parsons&#8217; opinion accords with all the other evidence in this case: there is a low but real risk that if the father were to reunite with the mother, then he could perpetrate serious violence against her again.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.09in">Aside from the risk to the children from the impact of further physical violence by the father, there is a risk of emotional harm to them from any greater involvement of the father in their lives, especially were he to live with them again. Dr Parsons identifies this as a significant risk of immediate harm. The father&#8217;s lack of empathy for the children is exemplified by his decision, together with the mother, that he should stay with G and H in a hotel immediately on their arrival in England in 2019, and then, shortly afterwards, move the family into the two bedroom flat shortly afterwards. G, for example, had been five years old when the father had hugged them having brutally attacked the mother, and was taken away by the police. On arriving in England six and a half years later, G had not seen their father in person since that night in 2013. Without any apparent thought for their feelings, the father made arrangements for them to live with him again. The fact that G, or the other children, might have deep and troubled emotions about him and their relationship with him, about their safety and their mother&#8217;s safety, and about numerous other aspects of the family dynamics, did not stop him. Whereas I discerned the mother now to understand the harm and the potential for further harm that this caused the children, I did not discern any similar depth of understanding on the part of the father. I accept Dr Parsons&#8217; view that the father lacks empathy for his children and that his greater involvement in their lives would present a significant risk of causing them immediate emotional harm.  </p>

All the evidence suggests that if the mother&#8217;s ability to care her children is impaired, it is due to her disabilities, and not related to any malice or wilful neglect on her part.  In relation to her ability to protect them against the risks that arise from their father, the picture is a little more complex. Many comments have been made by those assessing the mother that she does not understand or appreciate the severity of the harm caused to her by the father. She has observed on at least one occasion that he is the only person who has not hurt her. She also came to the United Kingdom and chose to live with the children in a flat in the town of Z. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, it seems to me that there are a number of reasons for the mother&#8217;s difficulty in accepting that she is at risk from the father: </p>

It is troubling that she reconciled with the father in 2018, that she allowed J to stay with him in 2019, that she later brought the younger two children to England in 2019 and readily reunited with the father and started living with him again, and that she did so without including the children in that decision. I note that the social work records from Y show that when the social services in England intervened on 29 October 2019, whilst the father was calm and co-operative, the mother was said to be &#8220;hysterical&#8221; and pleading with them to allow the father to stay. Her actions and mindset in September to December 2019 demonstrate that at that time she did not think that there was any risk from the father, she did not adequately consider the risk of emotional harm to the children from re-uniting so suddenly with the father, and she was not able to protect the children from harm stemming from the father&#8217;s return into their lives. </p>

The evidence establishes that the mother has had some contact with the father, for example by telephone, but there is no evidence to show that he has spent time in the family home or with the children other than as allowed by the Local Authority. I also take into account the evidence of the witnesses from the mother&#8217;s support network. They impressed me as caring, thoughtful and properly informed women who understood the importance of supporting the mother to keep the father out of the family&#8217;s daily lives, and to manage her children as effectively as possible. The mother has shown herself able, with professional help alongside such informal support from friends and family, to play her part in managing the risk that the father poses to the children. She has not undermined the agreement for the father to stay away.  I have no evidence that she has met him on the sly and I accept her evidence that she has not done so. She has therefore played her part in protecting herself and the children from the father since October 2019. The question is whether she is able to continue to protect the children from the risk of harm from the father in the future. </p>

The history of the case gives reason to treat her assertions with caution. Not only did she decide to bring the family together in September 2019, but even as late as August 2020 the mother informed the court that she and the father were in a relationship together. Why should the court believe the mother now when she says she will have nothing more to do with the father other than to inform him of major issues in the children&#8217;s lives and to allow supervised contact? </p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s proposals for foster care have had a salutary effect on the mother. However, even if that threat is removed, I believe that the mother will continue to understand that her choice is whether to prioritise her children or her husband, and that she will always choose the former. The mother appears to have genuine faith in the views of professionals and respect for the court. She understood the social worker LM as having permitted her to go to England and stay with the father &#8211; reading his notes I understand why she believed that. She has worked well with the allocated social worker. And she has paid a lot of attention to Dr Parsons&#8217; views about the risk to the children posed by the father. I have no doubt that she has listened attentively to the advice of her legal representatives. Professional advice and then the threat of foster care for her children, which the Local Authority raised in January 2021, have combined to bring home to her the choice she has to make &#8211; her husband or her children. She recognises that she cannot choose to live with both, she has to choose one or the other. Once that stark choice became evident to her she had no doubts &#8211; she will put her children first.  </p>

For so long as he is not living with them and has a very limited involvement in their lives, that risk will be significantly reduced. The mother&#8217;s actions in 2019 in collaborating with the father to bring the family together in England, exposed the children to a risk of harm. She ought not to have put herself or the children in that position. However, I accept that the mother has genuinely listened to advice and she has realised that if the children are to continue to live with her, she must keep apart from her husband. I am satisfied that she now understands the necessity of keeping the father distant from the family and, with support, she will be able to ensure that that distance is maintained, and the risk to her and the children kept effectively managed. </p>

Although her assessment report was written in December 2020, the Local Authority&#8217;s threshold document, dated 21 January 2021, relies only on the risk posed by the father, and the mother&#8217;s inability to protect the children from that risk. Concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to provide practical and emotional care to her children were not considered to be sufficiently significant to be included as a ground for claiming that the threshold for a care or supervision order was met. In relation to J and G, that is not surprising. Obviously, they have been adversely affected by their father&#8217;s attack on their mother &#8211; in a moment they lost both parents&#8217; care. Even when their mother had recovered sufficiently to care for them again, she was cognitively and visually impaired and could not offer them the same level of practical and emotional care as she had previously been able to offer. Nevertheless, by the time social services intervened in England in October 2019, J and G had been brought up by their mother for over six years after the attack. There was no evidence of physical, emotional or other harm to them. Their development was as should be expected. They were angry for having been removed from Y, and rightly there were concerns about the risk to the children presented by the father and their close proximity to him but, in relation to their day to day care and their emotional, social and educational development, their mother had, in the face of great difficulties, been a &#8220;good enough&#8221; parent to them.  </p>

Arguably, the date of the Local Authority&#8217;s first intervention, 29 October 2019, when they secured the agreement of the father to leave the then family home, is the relevant date. At either date, the children had only relatively recently arrived in England. J and G were unhappy to be in England, had been removed from their daily lives and relationships in Y without prior planning, had not been asked about spending so much time here or about living with their father, and had both expressed a wish to return to Y which their parents appeared to be disregarding. H was selectively mute. Concerns were raised that they could not read or write. The mother had suffered a severe head injury and there were well-founded concerns about her decision-making and ability to protect herself from physical harm from the father, and the children from emotional harm. All three children were or had recently been living with the father who had so seriously injured their mother, whilst they were in the house, in 2013. He had agreed to leave the flat on 29 October 2019 but in the absence of a care order there were good reasons to believe that the mother and father would reunite under one roof once again, as they had so recently chosen to do. The children were living in very unstable and disorientating circumstances: in a country in which they did not want to live, with their violent father very much back in their lives, and under the care of a mother who had not taken proper steps to prepare them for the enormous changes happening to them.  </p>

Accepting Dr Parsons&#8217; evidence, I am sure that the father presented an ongoing and significant risk of immediate emotional harm to the children. He also presented a low but real risk of physical harm to their mother and to them. The consequences, if the risk of physical harm had materialised, would have been catastrophic, not only in terms of physical consequences to the victim but also in terms of the emotional harm to the rest of the family. The mother was not, at that stage, acting adequately to protect the children from such harm. She had taken steps by bringing them to the UK and then moving in with the father, even if that was intended as a temporary arrangement, that exposed them to these significant risks of harm. </p>

In principle, they are continuation of placement of the children with the mother, kinship care, long-term fostering, special guardianship, or a child arrangements order for the children to live with their mother with orders for contact with the father. However, kinship care and special guardianship are not options in this case because no family member or friends have put themselves forward as potential long term carers. The only realistic options are therefore that the children continue to live with the mother under a care order, supervision order, or subject only to a child arrangements order, or that they are placed under a care order in long term foster care. I have to consider the options by reference to the welfare checklist in relation to each child and keeping within the legal framework set out earlier in this judgment. Each child&#8217;s welfare is paramount. </p>

It is understandable that J&#8217;s wishes and feelings have changed over the past few months, and that G&#8217;s have too. Firstly, as time has passed they have become more integrated into life in England, in particular in their school. Secondly, they have learned more information about what a return to Y would entail for them. As they have been given more information, their views have evolved. All three children strongly wish to avoid going into foster care. The evidence to this court is that placement in long term foster care would be devastating to these children, and that is how the children themselves see it. They wish to stay with their mother, albeit that J does not like living in England and wishes, at an appropriate point, to return to Y. The children wish not to be separated from each other. J is at an age where they are contemplating leaving home to pursue further education. Their wish to return to Y might also lead, in time, to  separation of the siblings. In one sense this would be a natural development in a family: that the eldest child will leave home as they begin further education and their first steps to an independent adult life. The wishes and feelings of the older two siblings are strongly held, H&#8217;s less forcibly expressed. I take into account the ages of the children when considering the weight to be given to their wishes and feelings. </p>

J might be the most robust in dealing with such a change, but I accept that the change would be devastating to them. I do not believe that they would accept long term fostering and it is likely that they would remain with their mother. In those circumstances they would be divided from their siblings, assuming G was compliant with a foster placement, which would be traumatic for them as well as to the other children. The impact of a change to foster care would also be devastating for G.  </p>

The background of all three children was in Y. J and G have wanted to return to their home country for most of the duration of these proceedings, but they are more settled in England now, they want to remain together as siblings and with their mother, and in my judgement J will see out their education in England before considering their options for higher education in Y as well as here. The children&#8217; background in Y after the attack in 2013 was disrupted by several changes of home and location. The stability they have had more recently has been beneficial to them. The children have a religious and cultural background and the proposed foster carer is, I am told, a religious but not cultural match. At present, and certainly once the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, they are surrounded by a support network that shares their backgrounds. </p>

I have already addressed the ongoing risk of harm from the father. I consider there would be a low but real risk of physical violence against the mother and children should he live with the family again. There is the risk of physical violence perpetrated against the mother, which would be likely to cause the children emotional harm. There is the risk of physical violence perpetrated by him against one or more of the children, which would cause physical harm to the child assaulted, and emotional harm to their siblings. Were such risks to materialise, the consequences would be very severe for the children. It is difficult ever to envisage the risk of harm from the father ever disappearing. In this case the risks of harm have to be balanced. However, the evidence, and in particular the opinion evidence of Dr Parsons, shows that the father is likely to comply with court orders to keep away from the family home. Whilst he is not living with the family, the risk of his committing a further violent attack on the mother or a child, is significantly reduced to a manageable level. If he were to live with the family, then the risk would be a real and continuing one.  </p>

In my judgement, one of the incentives for her to abide by agreements or orders for the father not to enter the family home, has been her desire to continue to care for her children. With that incentive removed, the risk of her allowing the father into her home would increase, and so would the risk that he would commit another violent act against her, with consequential emotional harm to the children. It would not require the children to be present in the home at the time of any future violent assault by the father on the mother, for them to suffer emotional harm by reason of such an assault. Indeed, they might suffer greater emotional harm following any future assault on their mother, if they had been removed from her care and into foster care. They might well also experience great anxiety knowing that that the mother was alone and vulnerable to the father. Long term foster care would remove the children from the family home, and therefore serve to protect them against physical violence against them by the father, but it would not protect them against emotional harm consequent upon any future attack on their mother, indeed the risks of that happening would, if anything, be higher were the children to be removed from the family home and the care of their mother. </p>

Unsurprisingly she has some clashes with her teenage children, and she helped to cause upset to J and G by her actions in bringing the family together in England in 2019. The parenting assessor concludes that the mother is not able to care for the children on her own without the support from another adult. The parenting assessor reported that the mother struggles with basic care needs, providing stability, setting boundaries to the children, establishing consistent daily routines and ensuring that the children&#8217;s emotional needs are considered. I am sure that the mother does struggle in those respects: she has had a very difficult eight years since being brutally attacked by her husband, but, against the odds, she does meet her children&#8217; basic needs. The house is clean, the children are healthy, the elder two are doing well at school. I am satisfied that the mother manages to meet the children&#8217;s physical needs, and provided that they can be kept safe from risk stemming from their father, I have no doubt that the mother will be able to meet their physical and emotional needs in the future if the children were to remain in her care. I note the Adult Services plan. I assess the mother&#8217;s capabilities in the context of the support she will and ought to receive as a result of her own impairments. The proposed help will support her to be a capable mother to her children. The mother&#8217;s impairments do impede her ability to help the children with their education. J has taken those matters into their own hands. They are keen to investigate their educational options and have shown some maturity in that respect. They are excelling at school. G is progressing well at school and their educational needs are being met and are likely to be met in the future were they to live at home with their mother. H has significant educational challenges and their mother is unable to help them as well as she would have been but for her injuries and ongoing impairments. However, H is making some progress, there will be ongoing intensive support for them from publicly funded services, and the evidence shows that there would be a significant risk that their education progress would be reversed by the emotional upheaval of being separated from their mother. </p>

The parents have been compliant to date with the agreement that the father should not go to the family home. I acknowledge the risk that once these proceedings are over, the level of scrutiny and monitoring may diminish, and the risk of the mother agreeing to the father becoming more involved in the children&#8217;s lives might increase. However, my assessment of the mother is that she will abide by any court orders and that she is now committed to putting her children&#8217;s needs above those of her husband. The father too is anxious to prove that he has changed and he can demonstrate that by abiding strictly by court orders designed to manage and minimise the risk that he presents to his family. He and the mother would be very likely to comply with an order restricting his contact with the children and preventing him from living with the mother whilst she has care of the children. The time the children spend with the father can also be subject to an order to continue with supervised, indirect contact only. The father has parental responsibility in relation to each child. The Court has the power to make Prohibited Steps Orders to restrict the father&#8217;s exercise of parental responsibility and thereby his involvement with the family, so as to reduce risk further. </p>

Her current house would not be suitable for the three children. She would stop working for a period of time after the transition of the children to her care. She plans to move to a house with her sister who is also an approved foster carer. I am reassured by the assessment that the proposed foster carer is committed and capable, however she has not looked after three siblings previously, and the challenges of managing three children aged from 10 to nearly 17, who do not want to be in foster care, the youngest of whom has educational needs, and with the background that these siblings have, would be considerable. The carer&#8217;s ability to provide good enough care for these children is contingent on her stopping work, moving home, and receiving help from </p>

Were he to live with the mother and children that risk would be low but real. The consequences for the children were the father to commit a further assault on their mother or on one of them would be potentially catastrophic. In my judgement the risk can be managed and kept to a minimal level by the children remaining with their mother but with court orders to restrict the father from being in the family home. This protective measure can be supported by the assistance of the support network. The mother will also have the assistance of adult services and that will add a layer of protection from any risk that the father might move back into the family home. In any event, I am satisfied that the mother can now be trusted to keep the father away from the family home.  Her very strong motivation for keeping the father at arm&#8217;s length is that she knows that she has to do that to keep her children in her care. I am also satisfied that the father will abide by an order to that effect. He has done to date, he has assured this court with apparent sincerity that he will continue to do so, and his long term interest is served by complying with the court&#8217;s requirements. </p>

However, with assistance through Adult Services, Children&#8217;s Services, and an Educational Health Care Plan, the mother is capable of meeting the needs of the three children.

Were it not for the risk from the father, and concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to protect them from him, I would have no substantial concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to care for them. The suggestion that the  mother is unable satisfactorily to meet their needs and that she is not a &#8220;good enough&#8221; parent to them is, in my judgement, unreasonable.

I bear in mind the family&#8217;s Article 8 rights, in particular those of the mother, and that a Care Order can only be justified if it is necessary and proportionate to the risk of harm. In this case the risk of harm which a Care Order, or Supervision Order, is being directed to is the risk that comes from the father. I am satisfied that orders to keep the father away from the family home are sufficient to reduce the risk of harm to a minimal level. Such orders can be in place until H and G are 18. I have found that the mother and father are likely to abide by such orders. The purpose of a Supervision Order would be to support each child so as to help enhance the stability of this family and embed and secure the continuing progress that each child is making. It will also serve to help the mother to protect them from risk, with a view to her being able to continue in that role after the end of the Order. If continuation of the Supervision Order is required to meet and manage ongoing risk from the father then extensions can be sought, potentially until H is 13 and G 16. A Supervision Order for each child is sufficient and proportionate. A Care Order is not necessary and would be disproportionate to the risk in my judgement. The Court should impose the least restrictive order that is sufficient to meet the risk. A Supervision Order for each of H and G will do that. </p>

This option best serves the children&#8217;s welfare. The mother is able to protect them from harm from their father, particularly as she will be supported by suitable orders to keep him away from the family home. Supervision Orders will help to protect the children and to keep them with their mother when separation from her, and potentially from each other, would be so harmful to them.   </p>

The fact that their father was living with them put them at significant risk because of what he had done to their mother in 2013.
