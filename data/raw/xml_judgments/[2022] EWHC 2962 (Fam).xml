Her mother developed a severe mental illness which meant that she was no longer able to care for B (although she did and does have contact). B&#8217;s father left the family home shortly after she was born, and has not seen her since. Social workers in country A reported him to be threatening and under the influence of alcohol when they visited him for the purposes of preparing their adoption report.  B was brought up by her maternal grandparents for many years.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Unfortunately the maternal grandparents both developed health problems, including diabetes and high blood pressure in the period around 2014-2015.  It became increasingly difficult  for them to care for B, as they not only had their own health problems but were caring for their son who, like B&#8217;s mother, suffers from a severe mental illness. As a result, the  family agreed that the best plan for B would be for her to come and live in England with her maternal aunt and uncle (the applicants) and to be adopted by them.  The applicants accordingly started the process by approaching the authorities in country A in 2016 with a view to achieving a Convention Adoption. </span></p>

The first condition, pursuant to s47(2) is that the court is satisfied that either the parent or guardian consents to the making of the adoption order.  The second is that the parent or guardian has consented under section 20 and does not oppose the making of an order. The third is that the parent or guardian&#8217;s consent should be dispensed with. These provisions all apply in a Convention adoption, just as in a domestic one (Regulation 52 Adoption with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005). </span></p>

Nonetheless, and after hearing the submissions on behalf of the applicant, the local authority and the Guardian, I have come to the conclusion that this step is necessary and justified in the very unusual and difficult circumstances of this particular case. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">First, this is a 1993 Convention adoption where the State of origin is entrusted with the responsibility for obtaining the consent of those with parental responsibility and ensuring that it is given freely and with a full understanding of the consequences. Those consents were obtained from B&#8217;s father and her maternal grandmother.  The professional assessments in country A were thorough and careful. There is no doubt that the mother has not been able to exercise parental responsibility for B for many years as a result of serious and long term mental illness. This was recognised by the authorities in country A long ago. The Central Authorities in both countries were satisfied that consent from the relevant parties had been provided when coming to the Article 17(c) agreement.  It is somewhat anomalous that the mother is not considered to have parental responsibility in the State of origin where she remains habitually resident, but is considered to retain it here. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Secondly, the adoption process has been going on since 2016 and has taken its toll on B. She has suffered very significantly as a result of her precarious circumstances in country A (I have not set them all out here, but her living circumstances there were very emotionally damaging), and has had to make a difficult adjustment when coming to live in this country. Despite the difficulties in her life before, she was very homesick and lonely when she arrived here. With the love and nurture she has been given by the applicants she has adjusted and has made enormous strides. If there are further delays there is a risk she will have to return to country A whilst matters are sorted out. If that happens she will lose her college place which is very important to her.  Her mental health is fragile and losing her college place and/or returning to country A is likely to cause her emotional harm. It will seriously affect her prospects of settling down here and obtaining qualifications which will enable her to work and thrive.  For many people this would be merely a setback, but I am satisfied in this case that the effect upon B could be much more serious and long lasting. Even the fear that this will happen affects her. The situation so far as she is concerned is urgent. </span></p>

The plan for adoption by the applicants is one which was devised and approved by the maternal family as in B&#8217;s best interests. The psychiatrist who assessed the mother in August 2022 noted that she believed that the adoption had taken place years ago. B does speak to her mother quite frequently, and is sad that her mother has never been able to care for her, but there is no question as to the role she has and will play in B&#8217;s life. </span></p>

It is equally clear that she has a strong bond with the applicants and their children who consider her a full part of their family.  </span></p>

It provided details of the mother&#8217;s mental illness, and that of the maternal uncle too.  B was neglected and ill treated by her mother when she was very young. Her father was asked to leave the home as a result of his drinking and he did so, and has had no relationship with his daughter since. As a result of the parents&#8217; problems, B&#8217;s care was taken over by her grandparents. In 2013 the mother was diagnosed with mood disorder, bipolar type, with psychotic features.  She was prescribed medication but was and is not compliant.  In 2017 her diagnosis was changed to schizo-affective disorder. </span></p>

B lived with them from a very early age. Although she moved to live in the UK following her marriage, the applicant maternal aunt and her husband visited the family home in country A regularly and kept in close contact. B has therefore known both applicants well over several years. The grandmother informed the authors of the report that she and the grandfather had problems with their health and were physically no longer able to care for B. B told them that she wished to be adopted by the applicants.  No other family members in country A were able to provide her with a home, and the father, when spoken to by the social workers, was unsure even of his daughter&#8217;s name. He showed them that he was carrying a firearm, which they took as an indirect threat.  </span></p>

She is very close to the applicants&#8217; older children and has made friends locally.  Importantly, the Guardian considered that she demonstrated a mature ability to understand and reflect on the concepts of adoption in both a practical and emotional sense.  She understands that the order is for life.  The Guardian reports that B is unequivocal in her expressed wishes to be adopted by the applicants, who she refers to as &#8216;mum and dad&#8217;.  Her primary requirement now is for stability and a loving family unit to surround her as she works towards securing a future for herself.  There is no prospect of her birth mother or father being able to provide for her in an emotional or practical sense.  She will keep in contact with her mother by Facetime as she has done ever since she came here.  </span></p>

Although B was homesick when she first arrived in the UK, she is now settled and very much wishes to be adopted by her aunt and uncle. She considers their children her siblings.  B has suffered from disruption and uncertainty during her childhood as a result of her mother&#8217;s inability to care for her, and the subsequent deterioration in the health of her maternal grandparents.  An adoption order will not sever her relationships with her family, because the order proposed is in favour of the maternal uncle and aunt.  She has not been cared for by her mother for many years, and in any event maintains contact with her.  B will also keep in touch with her maternal grandmother, who is very much in agreement with the proposed adoption.  The effect on B of being adopted will be to give her a secure family in this country, which will give her the best chance of reaching her potential as she develops her independence and far beyond. She is attending college and is hoping to become a nurse.  </span></p>

It is true that this court could make orders under the Children Act (for example a Special Guardianship or a Residence Order) or indeed no order at all, but it would leave B without the legal security of having the applicants as her parents. They are her family, of course, but B would continue to be left without any real parents, certainly in law.  B&#8217;s immigration position would remain precarious, and her path to remaining permanently in this country would be unclear.  If, for example, there is any delay to the making of an order, she is likely to have to return to country A to re-apply for a visa.  If that happened she would have to relinquish her place at college.  </span></p>

Having read the report of Dr. ST it is clear that the mother is unable to make a decision to refuse or consent to adoption because she cannot understand the information even when explained to her simply. She is unable to retain what is said to her, or use the information as part of the process of making a decision. Nor did she seem able to communicate in any coherent form. During the assessment she was unable to follow what she was being told, and indeed to comprehend that B had not already been adopted.

The use of the word &#8216;or&#8217; at the end of paragraph 1(a) suggests that in such a case, once the court is satisfied that it is in the child&#8217;s best interests to be adopted it does not have to be satisfied of the imperative contained in the wording of s52(1)(b) in quite the same way as is necessary when a parent withholds their consent and does have capacity.  Nonetheless, it is important to record that I do consider that the imperative is satisfied, and that B&#8217;s welfare does require her to be adopted.  The alternatives are (as I have recited above in the welfare section) to make a Special Guardianship order, a residence order, or no order at all. Neither and SGO or a residence order would last beyond B&#8217;s 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> birthday, and none of these alternatives would provide her with the lifelong security of being able in law to have the applicants as her parents and their children as her siblings, which is so important for her future development. Further, the making of an adoption order will secure her immigration status in this country which is also extremely important given the lack of secure family support in her country of origin.  I recognise that an adoption order is a grave interference with the rights of the mother to respect for her private and family life pursuant to Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights, for it severs the legal ties with her daughter. Even though the mother has not cared for her for many years, this is still a serious infringement of the mother-daughter relationship.  I am satisfied, however, that this interference is necessary and proportionate in order to safeguard B&#8217;s future welfare. I note the mother believed the adoption order to have been made a long time ago and so, inasmuch as she is able to understand the situation, this is something she has accepted.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There were a number of problems with their application.  It did not contain the names of B&#8217;s parents, only her grandparents.  There was no Statement of Facts and the Annexe A report had not been prepared.  A number of the documents were illegible. It appears that the requisite fee was not paid.  This caused delay at the local court where the application had been made.  Some of these difficulties were ironed out, but the Annexe A report was not ready until April 2022.  Thereafter the application was ready for issue and this was done in May. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">During this period, the applicants were getting anxious about the passage of time, given that B&#8217;s visa was due to expire in September 2022. They sent a number of emails to the court expressing their concern.  When the case was transferred to me my clerk received a number of emails, particularly from one of the applicant&#8217;s friends, expressing concern about the delay and pressing for early hearing dates. Whilst I understand their motivation and anxiety, I wish to emphasize that the reason (in my judgment) that there have been delays in the proceedings is as a result of confusion on the part of the applicants and the local authority as to what the application process required. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">When this case came before me for the first time, there did not appear to have been any input from lawyers at all, even from within the local authority who were not even represented at the most recent hearing in September (when at least the applicants had been able to secure some pro bono representation).  The applicants are of modest means, and I can well understand that they could not afford representation at the hearing itself.  Nonetheless this is a complex process which has suffered from the lack of any legal input until very recently. Had there been any lawyers instructed I am sure they would have ensured that the application was accompanied by all the right documents and information at the start.  A lawyer representing either the local authority or the applicants (or even giving advice in advance) is likely to have realised that the mother&#8217;s situation needed to be given more consideration from a legal perspective. The Convention Process is very thorough, and I can therefore appreciate that the local authority and adopters may have assumed that the application in this country was straightforward and somewhat administrative.   In some cases that may be so, but not here. </span></p>

I am extremely grateful to Mr Niven-Phillips for his assistance in this case, and I am sure that the applicants are too. They were also very fortunate that counsel, Mr Lamb, was prepared to act for them, pro bono, at the final hearing. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt"> Luckily the most significant of the gaps, that of the birth mother&#8217;s capacity, was able to be dealt with very swiftly due to the successful instruction of Dr. TS, albeit not swiftly enough to enable her to be represented by a litigation friend for this hearing.  The question of the birth father&#8217;s parental responsibility was also dealt with quickly by the authorities in country A. It has been possible, for the reasons set out above, to make the order now and avoid causing emotional harm to B by subjecting her to more uncertainty and delay.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Nonetheless it is important to emphasise the fact that an application for an international adoption under the 1993 Convention may not be at all straightforward. Local authorities must be aware of this and should consider obtaining legal advice in an appropriate case. They should also advise applicants accordingly so that they do not have unrealistic expectations of what the process entails. </span></p>
