An obvious example is that testamentary provision for the child may be open to challenge. Another is that without any order they have no parental responsibility for the child, even though the child is in their full time care. As a matter of English law unless a parental order is made the child&#8217;s legal mother will remain the surrogate mother. If she was married at the relevant time and her husband consented to the arrangement, he will be the legal father. This is irrespective of the legal position in the country where the child was born. In this case the surrogate mother and her husband, who remain in India, are the legal parents of C and D, even though they have never cared for the children.</span></p>

There were a number of stresses on the relationship, such as the couple&#8217;s inability to conceive children.</span></p>

There was no psychiatric review during this time; repeat prescriptions were issued at intervals. In October 2011, her GP suggested a psychiatric review; it appears because she had not had one for many years rather than being due to any concerns. That review resulted in the daily dosage being reduced from 10mg to 5mg.

The Respondent went on a rant and proceeded to verbally abuse me. The Respondent then picked up D and walked off. I was petrified that he had run off with her. I telephoned the Respondent to find out his whereabouts. The Respondent told D to inform me that they were at home.&#8217;</span></p>

When I started medication I was better in weeks. During the fertility treatment I did not take any medication. I saw numerous medical practitioners &#8211; none of them saw any mental problems. Over time my dosage was reduced and I was taken off medication all together. [B] pressurised me into taking medication even when the GP said it wasn&#8217;t necessary. In August/September 2013 [B] wanted me to go to visit the GP in order to get further prescriptions. He told me I should tell my GP that I was abused as a child and that this must be noted in my medical records. My GP refused to make further prescriptions and I made no claims about abuse to my GP...I only know now that I have been the victim of domestic violence for a very long time before I was prescribed any medication. I did not realise this when I approached the doctor about depression and would have to ask if my doctor&#8217;s diagnosis would be different if I had discussed the domestic violence.&#8217;</span></p>

This has to be seen in the context of the difficult and deteriorating relationship between the parents where B was trying to establish what A&#8217;s position was regarding her medication. There was the serious assault in 1997 and the difficulties that resulted in the medication being prescribed in 2004/2005. Just taking those matters alone B&#8217;s concerns about A&#8217;s mental health had some foundation, although he was probably not justified in the way he raised it with various third parties (for example, the local authority in July 2014). Whilst A may have misinterpreted B&#8217;s concern about her mental health, it did not amount to coercion as she alleges.
