Soon after the parties began living together they bought the Howard Hotel in Temple Place.  He says that over a period of a decade, presumably the 1970s, fifteen hotels were purchased.</p>

It was the sale of the Ellerman chain of pubs and breweries in 1990 which led to H becoming non-resident and non-domiciled in England from 1990-2014, during which time he was resident and domiciled in Monaco.  H and DB lived in neighbouring apartments there.</p>

It is a very large apartment over 3 floors, with 5 principal bedrooms in a beautiful position in St James&#8217;s and extending to over 6000 sq. ft, including a ballroom.  The purchase price inclusive of staff flats and garages was a little over &#163;30m and a further &#163;8.6m was spent on works.  The purchase was funded to a significant extent by commercial borrowing of &#163;24m, with the balance of the funding met by a loan from ARB Overseas Ltd (ARB being Amanda&#8217;s initials), which is a BVI company owned by a trust of which H was the settlor but of which he is not now a beneficiary.</p>

It was purchased for just &#163;2.3m in the joint names of the two brothers. The freehold is held as tenants in common, but the brothers have granted a long lease.  A very large property was built on the island and it became the main residence of DB and his wife.  Other members of the family, including H, had their own individual quarters. H says that he has not visited the island since a brief trip over the New Year 2014-2015.</p>

W explains that not only were the brothers very close but they were also highly competitive, both with one another as well as with outsiders, and at times in great conflict with one another.  In or about 2014 there was a major falling out between them and the relationship was never repaired.  No doubt it was a matter of great regret to H that his brother died recently without there having been any restoration of relations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H says that in the mid-1990s he and his brother began to discuss how to pass on their wealth to the next generation.  He says that the principle was agreed that DB&#8217;s 3 children by his first marriage (their shares being subsequently adjusted to provide for his son by his second marriage) and Amanda were to share equally in what had been built up.  Each was to receive 25% of the business empire.  This required H to gift half of what he had to the 3 nephews.  Thus it was that H&#8217;s 50% interest in the empire (as he himself describes it) was settled into trusts of which only one half was to benefit him or his daughter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Impetus to the arrangements was given by H&#8217;s desire to return to England.  In March 2013 DB settled 5 trusts, each holding a valuable property.  In each instance H was within the beneficial class.  W was not a beneficiary.  They included the Chester Square property.  As far as I can tell, all these properties remain in these trusts for Amanda&#8217;s benefit, apart from the Chester Square property which was sold for around &#163;7m and the proceeds then used to reduce the mortgage against Cleveland Court in 2019.  In addition H bought for Amanda a valuable property in Holland Park and possibly other property as well.  </p>

The funds for the payment came from the family underlying businesses.</p>

He explained that there was no difficulty until they found out that H was ferreting around to ascertain the true debts of the businesses.  H gained information from the banks and from senior employees that revealed that the debts were very much less than he had been told and that his nephews were not telling him the truth.
