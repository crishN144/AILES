		</authorialNote>. She is 15 years old, and an extremely vulnerable young person, with complex needs.  She is the subject of an interim care order in favour of East Riding of Yorkshire Council (&#8216;ERYC&#8217;).  Samantha is currently living as the only young person in a holiday cottage in rural North Yorkshire which has been rented by ERYC solely for the purposes of accommodating her.  She is living with, and is supervised day-by-day by, up to three adult members of staff employed by an independent care agency.  This placement is unregistered, and therefore unregulated by Ofsted<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>.  The current holiday short-term let is due to expire in mid-June; if the lease is not extended, Samantha and her adult carers will then have to move.  This will be her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> move of &#8216;home&#8217; (if it can be so called) in the last 12 months. </p>

Samantha, again like many similar young people, is the subject of an order authorising ERYC to deprive her of her liberty in material respects while in her placement.  This order has been made in her own interests.  The local authority applies today to renew that order. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Samantha&#8217;s case is depressingly all too familiar to those working in the Family Court, and is I believe indicative of a nationwide problem.  There is currently very limited capacity in the children&#8217;s social care system for young people with complex needs who need secure care; it appears that demand for registered places is currently outstripping supply. This is the frustrating experience of the many family judges before whom such difficult cases are routinely presented.  It is also the experience of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner to whom I forwarded a number of redacted documents in this case, with the agreement of the parties.  I have set out her response, having seen those documents, in full at [28] below.  She has indicated that she would like the issues raised by this case, which she accepts are illustrative of similar cases up and down the country, to be raised directly with the Secretary of State for Education, the Rt Hon Gavin Williamson CBE MP.  With my explicit permission, it shall be. </p>

The application was before me again today, 28 April 2020, for the same reasons.  Samantha attended the hearing on 27 February, and I was able to speak with her; she politely and respectfully observed the formalities of the court hearing.   She listened attentively to the proceedings.  She told me that she simply wants an &#8220;ordinary life&#8221;.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Samantha&#8217;s parents separated about three years ago.  Shortly afterwards, (late 2017), Samantha began to abscond from her mother&#8217;s home, where she lived with T; support to manage Samantha&#8217;s behaviour was offered to the family by ERYC&#8217;s Youth and Family Support Services but with limited success.  In May 2018, Samantha took an overdose of prescribed drugs; this was the first of at least four such incidents.  In the following month, ERYC placed Samantha and her brother on Child Protection Plans.  The parents felt increasingly unable to allow Samantha back into their respective homes when she absconded, conceding that they could not cope with her behaviour.  Samantha spent a number of months moving between her parents&#8217; homes, foster homes, and the homes of her friends&#8217; families.  She threatened to burn down a foster home, and was arrested and interviewed by the police; although she was already known to the Youth Offending team, no action was taken.  She was first formally accommodated by ERYC under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>&#8217;) on 6 March 2019 and placed in a residential children&#8217;s home on 13 March 2019.

She absconded from the hospital, but was apprehended and returned by the police.  She underwent surgery in an attempt (which failed) to remove the several shards of razor blade and other metal objects identified on X-Ray. She is believed on other occasions to have swallowed glass.  She has seriously self-harmed in many other ways. </p>

For a period, Samantha was placed in St Catherine&#8217;s Secure Accommodation Unit near St Helens, Merseyside. Although Samantha received therapy and education in this placement, it was not without its difficulties; despite a period of relative stability at St Catherine&#8217;s, Samantha&#8217;s behaviour deteriorated.  She continued to self-harm, and assaulted staff members.  In October 2019, St Catherine&#8217;s gave notice that they could no longer manage to provide care for Samantha. </p>

With no immediate substitute placement in sight, in November 2019, HHJ Heaton QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, made the first of a number of orders authorising ERYC to deprive Samantha of her liberty in accommodation other than secure accommodation.  Samantha initially spent time at a training flat (supervised by trained staff) owned by ERYC (unregistered care and accommodation provision) before being moved to a holiday cottage in Lincolnshire (unregistered provision); she was the only child in the placement, supervised by three members of staff.   Her disruptive behaviour continued. </p>

When located and returned to placement, Samantha has often been assessed to be under the influence of drugs.  Samantha was, and is, also assessed as being at serious risk of child sexual exploitation by reason of her repeated abscondences and her vulnerability, particularly given that she did not, and does not, fully acknowledge the risks to herself. She was known to associate with older males who have the potential of harming her or coercing her into actions that are a risk to herself or others. </p>

In the period from November 2019 to January 2020, ERYC attempted to support Samantha&#8217;s placement back with family members &#8211; variously with parents and relatives.  Each family placement broke down.  I should emphasise here that Samantha&#8217;s parents love her, and, despite their personal difficulties, would dearly like to care for her, but accept that she is currently beyond parental control.   All this while, ERYC continued to look (see below [25-26]) for therapeutic secure placements. </p>

On a further occasion, having absconded, Samantha was followed by staff for 6 miles during which time she threatened to throw herself under moving vehicles and threatened to harm staff.

This placement was necessarily short-term.  For one weekend in early March, Samantha and the staff were required to vacate, as the cottage had been let to holidaymakers.  Other emergency short-term holiday-let accommodation (unregistered provision) had to be found for them.  They then all moved back to the holiday cottage in North Yorkshire (unregistered provision) where, by the time of the hearing today Samantha is still resident.  This home is over 30 miles from where her parents live.  By the standards of some cases, Samantha is at least reasonably close to her family; many children in unregistered placements are many miles from home. Samantha has been settled in her current placement since the second week of March 2020 without any notable incident of concern; this is the longest period of stability she has had since her stay at St Catherine&#8217;s.  The current placement is available until mid-June 2020.  Provisional plans are being laid for what happens thereafter. </p>

All those working in the Family Court are familiar with the situation of a child who at a point of crisis is placed, or is to be placed, in an unregistered children&#8217;s home, as an often unavoidable, urgent and temporary measure.  The urgency of a situation, however, does not truly make it any more acceptable.  It is important to emphasise that it is a criminal offence to run a children&#8217;s home without the appropriate registration (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CSA 2000</ref></span>); concerns have been widely raised across the professional spectrum about the quality of the care, support and </p>

According to the LAs concerned, these children are very difficult to place in registered provision and they place them in unregulated settings as a short-term measure, while suitable registered provision is located and/or an assessment is undertaken to determine a young person&#8217;s needs. The children involved range from 11 to 17 years old and include some for whom LAs are looking to obtain a secure placement.&#8221; </p>

The concern is not so much because of the pressure that this places on the court system, or the fact that local authorities have to engage in a more costly court process; the concern is that young people are being placed in units which, by definition, have not been approved as secure placements by the Secretary of State when that approval has been stipulated as a pre-condition by Parliament&#8221;. </p>

I was, and am, satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that, if I do not exercise my powers to deprive Samantha of her liberty, she is likely to suffer significant harm and there is no other way available to ERYC for her to be protected.  Samantha herself accepts these conditions. Overall, therefore, I am satisfied that these conditions remain in her best interests and I will make the declaration sought by the local authority. </p>

But I wish to stress that the problems raised in this case are not related to the pandemic.  The absence of satisfactory secure provision is a chronic problem, which in recent years has become ever more acute to the significant detriment of a large number of very damaged young people in our society.  It should not be forgotten that in this case, as I point out above, ERYC, has been looking for a place for Samantha since well before the pandemic arose.</p>

She is, as the Children&#8217;s Commissioner observes, one of those young people who has a &#8220;very high level of need&#8221;.  She appears at times to struggle to regulate her emotions; when she feels scared, out of control or restrained, she has resorted to &#8220;fight or flight&#8221;, and has harmed herself or others, and/or has absconded.
