That would require a welfare enquiry for which this hearing had not been set up. Thus, by way of example, there was relatively limited written evidence (particularly from M) about proposed long-term welfare arrangements, and no Cafcass report. I provisionally expressed the view that, if I did not make a Hague Convention return order to Portugal, or alternatively I stayed such an order because it could not in practice be implemented, it would be appropriate to give directions at this hearing as to the competing welfare proposals whereby M&#8217;s case is that (absent return to Portugal) S should live with her in Pakistan, and the case of F, U and A is that S should remain living with U and A in Manchester. Counsel agreed with this analysis at the Pre-Trial Review, and again at this hearing.</p>

This is because there are a number of ways in which a spouse might be said to have been abandoned or stranded abroad or in which the other spouse might have sought to achieve this.

There is a particular risk that an expansive application of article 13b, which focuses on the situation of the child, could lead to this result.

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span></p>

As was said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:10pt">, at para 52, "'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'". Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g., where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</span></p>

Fourth, article 13b is looking to the future: the situation as it would be if the child were to be returned forthwith to her home country. As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. </span></p>

There is obviously a tension between the inability of the court to resolve factual disputes between the parties and the risks that the child will face if the allegations are in fact true. Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221;</span></p>

In Convention cases, however, there are general policy considerations which may be weighed against the interests of the child in the individual case. These policy considerations include, not only the swift return of abducted children, but also comity between the Contracting States and respect for one another's judicial processes. Furthermore, the Convention is there, not only to secure the prompt return f abducted children, but also to deter abduction in the first place. The message should go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among the Contracting States. </span></p>

My Lords, in cases where a discretion arises from the terms of the Convention itself, it seems to me that the discretion is at large. The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy, alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child's rights and welfare. I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in para 32 above, save for the word "overriding" if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</span></p>

That, it seems to me, is the furthest one should go in seeking to put a gloss on the simple terms of the Convention. As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be. </span></p>

It was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations. In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country. </span></p>

In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances. </span></p>

In settlement cases, it must be borne in mind that the major objective of the Convention cannot be achieved. These are no longer "hot pursuit" cases. By definition, for whatever reason, the pursuit did not begin until long after the trail had gone cold. The object of securing a swift return to the country of origin cannot be met. It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors, which may well, as here, include the child's objections as well as her integration in her new community.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">M is 23 years old; F is 26. On 9 December 2016, they entered into an arranged marriage in Pakistan by a Nikah ceremony, conducted by videocall with M and members of the F&#8217;s extended family present, but not F himself who was living with his parents in Portugal and did not attend. F is a dual Portuguese-Pakistani national. So far as I understand, all members of his extended family to whom reference has been made are Portuguese nationals, of Pakistani heritage. M is a Pakistani national. Upon marriage, M lived with her parents in Pakistan, while F remained in Portugal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In May 2018, nearly 18 months after the marriage ceremony, M travelled with F&#8217;s mother and F&#8217;s two sisters to Portugal under a spousal visa (granted to her in April 2018). There she lived with F and other members of F&#8217;s family in Lisbon. Initially they resided at the house of F&#8217;s cousin, D, for 6 months. After a period of time, they moved to the home of F&#8217;s uncle, E, in Lisbon. During this period, M also spent 5 &#189; months with F&#8217;s parents in England at F&#8217;s insistence; he took her there and simply left her before returning to take her back to Pakistan, whilst occasionally travelling to England for business. She had no real say in the matter. To my mind, this was indicative of the control exercised over M by F once she had moved to Portugal. In July 2020, F and M moved within Lisbon to the home of another of F&#8217;s uncles, G. </p>

Having heard both parties, and having reached the broad conclusion that M has told me the truth, unlike F, I am satisfied that F, during the relationship, regularly punched M, slapped her and pulled her hair. I am quite sure that the relationship was unhappy, not least because of M&#8217;s lack of autonomy. She lived throughout her time in Portugal, and England, with F&#8217;s extended family. She had no bank account of her own, no job or income, and no independent means. Her computer memory stick was (I accept, although denied by F) removed from her by F. She was financially maintained, and thereby dependent upon F and his family. True, she had access to F&#8217;s credit card, but that enabled F to monitor her spending in a way that might not have been possible had she been the sole name on a bank account. I am satisfied that M was, throughout the marriage, and particularly after the move to Portugal in 2018, subject to the control of F and F&#8217;s family (notably the male members thereof), and was in practical terms unable to lead an independent life.</p>

On the contrary, I am satisfied that M was told by F and his family that S would be removed to live with U and A in Manchester. F had decided to bring the marriage to an end and, with the express or implied approval of his family, took steps to ensure that (i) the marriage would be dissolved by him and on his terms, (ii) M would be removed to Pakistan, where she would experience the shame of being a single mother deemed to have abandoned her child, and stranded with no job or financial means, and (iii) M would be cut off from S, who would be brought up in England exclusively by F&#8217;s family, with no maternal involvement.</p>

It seems to me to be likely, and I so find, that the document was prepared by F or a member of his family in order to give a veneer of lawfulness to the planned removal of S from Portugal. It also seems likely to me that M&#8217;s signature was forged by F or a family member. Even if she did indeed sign it, she cannot have done so with any understanding or appreciation of what she was signing. Either way, in my judgment this was a deliberate contrivance by F and his family to facilitate the removal of S against M&#8217;s will, no doubt intending that it could be used to show relevant to authorities in Portugal and England should any questions be asked. To my mind, far from supporting F&#8217;s case, this document forms part of the overall landscape of evidence portraying a picture of control, coercion, artifice, and ruse, all designed to erase M from the marriage and S&#8217;s life.</p>

F told M, falsely, that if she returned to Pakistan, S would be brought to her in that country.

They carried M&#8217;s travel documents which had been given to them by F. In Pakistan, she was taken to their home and then told to leave.

In December 2020, with the assistance of her brother V, she sent letters of complaint to the Overseas Pakistani Foundation and to the local Pakistani police, and in January 2021 Umar sent a letter to the Federal Investigation Agency in Pakistan. During 2021 further pleas for help were transmitted by M to other organisations in Pakistan. In December 2020 (as is clear from the records), M contacted both the UK police and NSPCC to give an account of the circumstances of her departure to Pakistan, and S&#8217;s to England. F could not explain why M made so many referrals both in Pakistan and England shortly after S was removed from her care. In my judgment, there is no plausible explanation for these communications other than to affirm M&#8217;s case that the events of which she complained had in fact happened. If she had left Portugal in the manner alleged by F, why would she have made so many referrals to authorities in Pakistan and England? The truth is obvious; these near contemporaneous communications were not contrived, but genuine, and corroborative of M's account. </p>

When asked to produce a copy of the message, he told me he could not because his account had been hacked, although it transpired that the hack took place in December 2021, long after these proceedings started, and long after he had filed evidence within which he could have produced a copy of the message.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The timing of the divorce document, immediately after S&#8217;s removal to England, and the same day as M&#8217;s departure to Pakistan, in my judgment is consistent with determined intent on the part of F to render M as impotent and isolated as possible. At that point, the truth must have become abundantly clear to M, namely that she was being cut off from F, his family and S. The document, with its prejudicial social connotations in Pakistan, was posted on Facebook by F&#8217;s family for a number of days. The deed states that S &#8220;is currently in the custody of [F], will be in his custody forever&#8221;. M had no forewarning of this dissolution document, and I do not accept F&#8217;s case that it was instituted by him at M&#8217;s request. Weighing up the divorce deed in the context of the other evidence, I am quite satisfied that it was pre-planned, and executed at the time of M&#8217;s departure from Portugal, so that (i) her spousal visa would no longer be valid, thereby disentitling her from travelling to Portugal or England and (ii) to cement the intended arrangements (in the minds of F and his family) whereby M would play no part in S&#8217;s upbringing and (iii) to bring any ongoing relationship between M and F to an immediate end. </p>

Throughout, it has been the written case of F, U and A (in their &#8220;Answer&#8221; and in narrative statements) that there should be no contact of any nature between S and M, albeit in oral evidence that position was slightly softened. To my mind, this approach to contact has been indicative of a continuing resistance to M playing any role in S&#8217;s life, or in any way interfering in F&#8217;s extended family. It is part of a set of deep-seated, controlling, and manipulative instincts whereby M is to be airbrushed out of S&#8217;s life. </p>

The report says, and I accept, that there are no issues with the daily care given to S by U and A. S is well looked after and there are no safeguarding concerns. It is important to note that this report addresses principally the meeting of physical needs and does not address, in any detail, the emotional needs of S. Understandably, the report does no more than note the disputed circumstances of S&#8217;s removal from Portugal, without seeking to resolve the dispute. In other words, although it is gratifying to record that S is properly cared for in a day-to-day sense, the report is inevitably somewhat superficial in respect of the emotional and psychological needs of a child separated shortly after birth from his mother. Of some significance, in my view, is the section of the report which records &#8220;&#8230;.the family advise that the long-term plan is that [S] will be formally adopted by his maternal uncle and aunt&#8230;&#8221;, thus severing all links with M, a proposed course of action which is entirely of a piece with the extended family&#8217;s overall pattern of behaviour M.</p>

This was, therefore, a wrongful removal and the respondents (who have been legally represented until recently) have not argued otherwise, either in written or oral presentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As to the Article 13(b) defence, F has not provided me with any basis on which to find that the defence is made out, certainly in the event that M is able to enter and reside in Portugal. Portugal was the country of habitual residence of M, F and S. M would be able to live with a relative. F continues to live there. F is a Portuguese national as are his extended family, and as is S. F has made some unsupported allegations about M&#8217;s mental health, but with no specificity or evidential basis. In any event, I am quite satisfied that the Portuguese authorities are well able to deal with such matters, and the courts are seised. F cannot care for S (albeit his case in Portugal appears to be different), but M can; there is nothing entitling this court to conclude that M is in some way incapacitated from looking after S in Portugal, until the courts there reach final welfare determinations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">If, however, M is unable to return to Portugal, then in my judgment the defence is made out, albeit not for the reasons advanced. S would be returned to a country where his father is unable or unwilling to care for him, and is, on my findings, guilty of domestic abuse of very grave proportions. He would be parted from U and A who, I accept, have provided good care, to a country where there is no obvious carer and a state placement (e.g in foster care) might be the only viable alternative. I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs for this child. </p>

I must weigh up the competing factors, having at the forefront of my mind S&#8217;s welfare. S has been in the care of U and A for most of his life, and it might be unsettling, at least in the short term, to be reintroduced to M. On the other hand, indirect contact has taken place and M is, after all, his mother form whom he was wrongfully, and disgracefully, removed. In my judgment, there is no obvious reason why S should not spend time with her. I propose to order (as I told the parties before sending out this judgment) that unsupervised contact shall take place on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, from 1pm-4pm, unsupervised, with M to collect S from the house of U and A and return him there at the end of contact. I anticipate that this should progress fairly swiftly and will review the position at the hearing on 18 February 2022. </p>
