In relation to the second, it appeared agreed by the end of the hearing that whilst this was an important feature it was not the key priority. The fees had been paid and a level of understanding arose under which the Respondent would settle this in its entirety (not as to 50%) additionally from the proceeds of the share sale.</span></p>

It is agreed the Respondent bears liability for the same and will continue to do so in its entirety. However, there is a dispute as to how this should be met given they require settlement in full or substantial measure prior to September 2024 if J is to resume her education at her school. There are then some residual issues relating to the need if any for further formal structure around the payment obligations. The application leaves for the Court&#8217;s determination an appropriate form of enforcement and I will need to examine the agreement and consider whether additional terms are required to ensure the payment is made. Finally, there is a dispute as to the Respondent&#8217;s responsibility, if any, for a tax levy paid by the Applicant&#8217;s mother when realising funds to settle the arrears as noted above. </span></p>

Whilst the language might suggest the Court is engaged in a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">de novo </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">assessment the better view is that the Court has the freedom to structure the hearing in whatever way it thinks best, including conducting a narrow review of any change in circumstances.

I have regard both to his written evidence and to his live evidence. In his written evidence the Respondent confirmed he has no meaningful savings  with the school fees needing to be met out of income. His income comprises regular salary and discretionary bonuses. He argued it was the receipt of bonuses which made the fees affordable. He explained that &#8216;towards the end of 2023&#8217; he was late in paying fees but this was not unusual as a bonus was due in January 2024 (c. &#163;60k net), the business has been trading well and so there was no concerns he would not be in funds to pay. However, he then detailed that &#8216;towards the end of 2023&#8217; the business was suffering with serious problems which I need not detail. He then received an invoice for J&#8217;s fees from 2022 onwards which had previously not been received. It then became clear a bonus would not in fact be received and as a result he spoke to his mortgage company about extending his mortgage to pay the fees. Unfortunately, his fellow directors then took steps to remove him from his post. This was confirmed to him in early 2024 as a result of which he had to withdraw his mortgage application. He explains that he immediately notified the Court of this.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> He explains a consequent level of mental health breakdown in March/April 2024 and he left his post on 1 May 2024. He received a compromise payment (described it seems to me inaccurately as a redundancy payment) and retains his shareholding, although the same is neither liquid nor readily realisable. The impact of losing his post means he simply will not be able to pay the future fees without obtaining replacement employment and the prospects of the same is far from clear. He explained his primary asset is his shares in the business. There is a business plan which would lead to the shares being sold in 2026 and his shareholding will realise around &#163;1m gross.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">In live evidence the Respondent made clear he was not trying to evade his responsibility for fees. He accepted the arrears (paid or otherwise) should be paid by him. He sought to explain the circumstances in which he had not addressed J&#8217;s fees for nearly two years on the basis that the school had made an administrative error in not billing him and that he had a default plan by extending his mortgage. He dealt with his spending patterns and told me he had reasonably not expected the situation to deteriorate as it had and that prior to this the state of the business permitted him sufficient confidence not to budget the fees from his salary but to await his bonus. He told me he was looking to sell a boat for &#163;16,000 but was having no luck and might need to reduce the asking price to achieve a sale during the Summer selling period. He discussed his living circumstances. He is marketing his property for rental and will move in with his partner which will reduce his outgoings to a &#163;1,000 per month contribution towards costs there. He married his partner in the days prior to the hearing, she paid for the wedding at a cost of about &#163;20,000. He agreed he had paid monies to her in the form of a purchase of a second boat but this was for convenience&#8217;s sake as these funds were his contribution towards regular expenses. When he rents his property he will have an excess of rent over mortgage costs, however he was unsure whether tax would be payable on this rental. With hindsight he realised his spending patterns were wrong but viewed at the time on his expectations they had not been. He argued the Applicant could additionally meet J&#8217;s arrears given she had funds representing monies inherited on the death of her grandfather. He felt she could pay the arrears on the basis that she would be paid back from the sale share. He raised the issue of whether alternative schooling could be obtained for J either in the private or state sector. He felt the poor payment record should not hamper this given J only had one further year in private education</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:8pt"> It is agreed all children will leave private education on the conclusion of their </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:8pt">GCSE&#8217;s</span></p>
	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> and these fees could be paid in advance. He referenced a cashflow spreadsheet setting out his compromise payment and how it would come to be spent. It transpired the net figure received over three payments (May, July, and November 2024) approximates &#163;112,000.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The Applicant in her written evidence explained how on 11 March 2024 she received a letter &#8216;out of the blue&#8217; from H/M&#8217;s school. The letter indicated the Respondent had given notice to withdraw the boys and sought her consent. When she indicated she did not agree the school confirmed there was &#163;13,241 outstanding in fees with a further equivalent sum due within a month and that the Respondent had told the school he could not afford to pay. I pause to note the Respondent alone is contractually linked to the school fees. The correspondence surprised the Applicant as the Respondent had been raising the possibility of  more expensive boarding education and had taken the children skiing in February 2024. Shortly thereafter she received a confirmatory email from the Respondent setting out his position. The Applicant calculated the remaining school fees to end of GCSE&#8217;s as being approximately &#163;157,500 (this included the Summer 2024 fees at that point). She noted the Respondent&#8217;s earnings up to that point and his failure to use this meet the fees. She then consulted with H/M&#8217;s school and went on to settle the arrears and fees for Spring/Summer Term 2024. This involved her mother cashing in funds to help and incurring a loss of &#163;7,287.55 as a result. It subsequently came to light that J&#8217;s fees had also not been paid leaving additional arrears of c.&#163;45,000. If this is not settled J will not be permitted to return to the school after Summer 2024. The school would accept a significant contribution to the arrears with the balance being settled in relatively short order. I permitted the parties to seek clarity as to what was meant by a &#8216;significant contribution to the arrears.&#8217; I have now seen an email from the school which confirms the arrears are &#163;44,130 and they would accept &#163;36,681 by the end of August with the balance being paid in instalments between September and December 2024.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

She has made application to local schools but none have space at this time and this would in any event mean a curriculum change at the very worst point in time. She questions whether a new private school would accept J given the payment history. The Applicant notes that fees for J have not been paid by the Respondent for three of the four years of her attendance. It was clear from her evidence that the Applicant has a good line of dialogue with the remaining directors within the Respondent&#8217;s former business. It seems clear she both trusts and relies on the information they have provided with the Respondent&#8217;s consent. This information has confirmed the intention to achieve a share sale in 2026 and an expectation that this will provide to the Respondent a sum significantly in excess of the sum payable to her (after taxation and settling of a Director&#8217;s Loan). The Chairman has informed her they have a clear direction and instruction to pay her first before other deductions. In evidence both parties appeared to accept this was a form of irrevocable instruction. The Applicant was critical of the Respondent&#8217;s spending, decision making and failure to prioritise school fees. She noted a number of features in support of her position. She felt he could reduce outgoings by renting his property immediately, had incurred significant expenditure on a further boat, skiing and a large wedding. She felt he could and should obtain immediate employment to meet his obligations. The Applicant was questioned about her investment fund. In her Form E1 she indicated it had a net value of c.&#163;341,000. She explained this is the balance of an inheritance. However, she is indebted to her father for a sum of about &#163;220,000 which represents monies lent to her to assist with previous litigation. Whilst there is no contractual agreement her father will need this money to assist with his likely care home needs and those of his wife. Having regard to this she has little of the balance available to pay arrears. In any event this should not be her responsibility given the Respondent&#8217;s financial mismanagement.</span></p>

I explained and found this figure was a ceiling on spending needs and in doing so noted a number of items within this budget which were not needed or justified and reduced the spending needs to &#163;7,500 per month. This sum included repayment of a debt to the business for funds borrowed. This had not been required for school fees but reflected the Respondent&#8217;s lack of control over his spending. The loan repayment was &#163;1,500pm without which spending needs would be closer to &#163;6,000pm.

This significantly exceeds the P60 figure leading me to consider whether the additional sums reflect director loans. This reflects the previous practice of the Respondent to extract funds in a tax efficient manner. In any event the sums were received and it seems spent. In addition, the Respondent appears to have taken out a further loan of &#163;10,000 on 29 September 2023 thus increasing his net resource to almost &#163;184,000 for the year (&#163;15,333 averaged per month).</span></p>

I find that answer puzzling given his stated dependence on the same to meet his needs, but it is his evidence. It follows the Respondent had absolutely no justification for falling into arrears or failing to meet these fees throughout the period. Yet he has gone on to spend the funds he received.

Rather, he took the opportunity to spend the excess funds on the basis he would find a solution later. I also find troubling his case of being able to rely on likely bonuses from employment given (a) at the last hearing he was doubting the likelihood of the same; (b) has no recollection of receiving any bonuses since, and; (c) tells me from late 2023 the position was concerning in such regard. Yet he continued to spend as detailed above. Now the Applicant and children are left to face the consequence of his behaviour. I make the point again that on my calculation he could both have met the fees and spent in excess of the sum I assessed. On my assessment he could have continued to spend close to &#163;10,000 per month on himself and still pay the fees. I note this is the figure he uses in his current cash flow.

He tells me two further tranches are due in July 2024 (&#163;32,500) and November 2024 (&#163;32,500) amounting to &#163;110,662. These are net of tax. Given this would be a period of unemployment I can see no basis on which the Respondent should have expected to spend (or should expect to continue to spend) in excess of the sum I provided for him in November 2022. In fact, on his cashflow his repayment of directors&#8217; loans reduces to &#163;500 thus reducing my assessment to &#163;6,500pm.

I should make clear he might improve his position by choosing not to holiday this year. He might also benefit from the surplus of rent over mortgage which he predicted, although I have not allowed for this in my calculation. This will give the Respondent until April 2025 to find replacement employment. I can see no logic or attraction in an artificial calculation under which the remaining funds are stretched over a longer period to guard against a failure to find such employment.

I bear in mind the Applicant will now need to use a significant part of this to fund the future school fees. This was never anticipated when the agreement was reached. The premise of the original consent agreement appears clear in that the Applicant would keep the family home to house the children and the Respondent his business. His business permitted an income to pay school fees whereas the Applicant&#8217;s did not. It does not appear there has been any need to have recourse to capital to meet fees as shown by both this and the November judgment. As such other things being equal there would be a fair balance with the Applicant having capital in the property and the Respondent capital in his business. Now both will have to dip into capital to settle future fees. But why should the Applicant be compelled to dip into capital to meet fees for a period when the Respondent could and should have paid the same as set out above? That is a more troubling suggestion. In my assessment if it came to it the Applicant might have to avail herself of these funds to address not only future fees but also the current arrears. The fact she must use the fund to some extent makes the point. Her agreement compels her to use the funds to a point where she cannot repay her father in full unless she herself is repaid. If she is repaid then this will cover future fees and arrears. Further, there is something in the point made by the Respondent as to underlying lack of logic of transferring the full funds to the father in circumstances in which a tax liability might then arise on his death. It would seem more likely payment might be staged. If this is so then there may be no demand for a period of time and after the funds are repaid by the Respondent. I note there is an absence of documentary evidence as to timing of payment. Having said all of this I do accept the central thrust of the Applicant&#8217;s case, that she considers herself obliged to repay the fund whether this is a legal obligation or not. Finally, though I note the funds were advanced at a time when there could be no guarantee of repayment and they have in fact not been repaid. I say this as it seems likely the Applicant did not have the inheritance at that point, otherwise why would she have borrowed the funds? This suggests the father made the transfer without a guarantee he would be repaid. He undoubtedly did this as he wanted to help. The need for help has not changed although the prospects of substantial, if not entire repayment now exist.</span></p>

The Applicant has received independent confirmation from the Chairman of the business and appears to accept the same. She appears to accept there is a structure for her being paid first.

Whilst this would most likely have been an interest charge in my assessment it matters little it took a different form. This will be added to the sum and will be payable as above.

This will likely leave a balance of arrears of &#163;34,130. In my judgment the Respondent can and must pay these arrears and must do so over the course of the next 8 months out of his compromise payment. Deducting this off the figure at &#167;21 above will leave him &#163;4,500 per month for the same 9 months [(&#163;74,728 - &#163;34,130)/9]. I am unwilling to vary the order to pay fees until Autumn Term 2024. The Respondent had the chance to pay these fees and chose not to. He can still do this although the hardship for him will be greater than it would otherwise have been but it will be achievable.</span></p>
