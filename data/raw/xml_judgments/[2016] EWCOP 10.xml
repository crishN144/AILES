	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This is an application by a Hospital Trust for orders in respect of a young woman, who I will refer to as CS, who is said to lack capacity and in respect of whom the Trust seeks an order that it would be in her best interests to undergo surgery terminating her current pregnancy.  This hearing is being conducted in the Court of Protection in open court in accordance with the Rules but subject to a reporting restriction order which I made earlier this afternoon.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The facts can be summarised very briefly.  CS has two children already.  She was, until shortly before Christmas, in a relationship with the father of her younger child.  It is alleged that the relationship gradually became characterised by domestic violence perpetrated on her by her partner.  In early December 2015, CS discovered that she was pregnant by her partner.  Thereafter, she told a number of people, including her sister (who has given evidence before me today) that she did not intend to keep the baby, that she did not want to have another baby by her current partner in her current circumstances, that she wanted to have an abortion and wanted her sister to accompany her to the clinic.  It is important to note that some years earlier CS underwent a termination and on that occasion her sister had also accompanied her to the clinic.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">A day or so after this conversation with her sister, CS was allegedly violently assaulted by her partner, as a result of which she sustained serious injuries, including serious head injuries, comprising fractures, intracranial bleeding and brain damage.  Her partner has been arrested and is at present remanded in custody.  As it is likely that there will be criminal proceedings, I propose to say little more about the alleged attack or the injuries.  Suffice it to say that CS was admitted to hospital, run by the applicant Trust, and received emergency treatment over an extensive period and currently remains in that hospital receiving care and treatment.  Her injuries continue to give rise to serious concern and the prognosis is at present far from clear.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The medical evidence, which I have seen today, from her consultant neurosurgeon, the consultant in rehabilitative medicine responsible for treating her, a consultant psychiatrist and a consultant obstetrician, demonstrates that the injuries have had a profound effect on her.  She has become agitated, restless, disruptive and extremely unsettled in her behaviour.  This is said to be inconsistent with the anticipated pattern of recovery following injuries of the sort that she has sustained and is a cause for growing concern.  At present, the doctors are finding it difficult to explain exactly why things have taken this course.  She is wandering, occasionally assaulting staff in hospital and falling.  Her latest fall earlier this week led to a further head injury which necessitated another CT scan.  No further injury was detected on that scan as a result of the fall but sadly the scan showed no evidence of recovery.  The rehabilitative medical consultant advises that she is unable to lay down any new memories at present, that is to say that she is suffering from post-traumatic amnesia and it is difficult to predict when she will emerge from this condition.  It is proposed that she should shortly be transferred to a specialist rehabilitative unit equipped to manage patients with this condition and who demonstrate this type of behaviour.  It is predicted that she will emerge from this but it is not clear when this will happen.  At present, however, she has no insight into her condition.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The urgency of the situation now arises because the time during which a surgical termination of pregnancy can be carried out is limited; it will in fact expire next week.  Thereafter, under current medical guidelines, it will still be possible for a termination of the pregnancy to be achieved medically but for that method to be used her cooperation would be required and that cannot be guaranteed.  Therefore, the Trust makes this application to the court.  That application was filed this week.  It came before me earlier this week at a hearing at which I gave a number of directions, including an invitation to the Official Solicitor to represent CS under directions for medical reports and statements.  The matter came back before me this afternoon for a full hearing and I had before me the evidence of written reports from those specialists previously identified, statements from a number of relatives and friends of CS&#160;and oral evidence briefly from her mother and sister.  They painted a moving picture of a family that has rallied round to support CS in this crisis, caring for her two young children and generally being at her bedside whenever possible.  I have nothing but admiration for the dedication that the family has shown to CS and her children at this very difficult time.</span></p>

The burden of proof therefore lies on the party asserting that P does not have capacity.  In this case, therefore, the burden of proof lies on CC to prove that KK lacks capacity.

Thus the test for capacity involves two stages.  The first stage, sometimes called the &#8216;diagnostic test&#8217;, is whether the person has such an impairment or disturbance.  The second stage, sometimes known as the &#8216;functional test&#8217;, is whether the impairment or disturbance renders the person unable to make the decision.  S. 3(1) provides that, for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 2</ref>, a&#160;person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable (a) to understand the information relevant to the decision; (b) to retain that information; (c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or (d) to communicate his decision whether by talking, using sign language or any other means.  Important guidance as to the assessment of capacity generally, and the interpretation and application of the four components of the functional test in particular, is set out in Chapter 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> Code of Practice.</span></p>

In many cases, perhaps most cases, the opinion of the expert will be confirmed by the other evidence, but inevitably there will be cases where the court reaches a different conclusion.  When taking evidence from P herself, the court must plainly be careful about assessing the capacity to understand, retain and use and weigh up information, but, whilst acknowledging the important role for expert evidence, the assessment is ultimately a matter for the court.</span></p>

She is unable to retain information due to her post-traumatic amnesia and frequently unable to provide or communicate coherent answers to even simple questions.  She is unable to understand or retain relevant information, including the options for termination, the extent of her pregnancy, her previous views about pregnancy, her personal circumstances and ability to care for her existing children.  It is, submits Mr. Sachdeva, unlikely that she will regain capacity within the next few weeks before the deadline for a surgical termination is reached.  The Official Solicitor agrees with this analysis.  The diagnostic test is plainly satisfied.  As for the functional test, the evidence of the psychiatrist is that she appears to find it difficult to understand and retain information generally, including as to the issue in question.  Thus, for example, she thought wrongly that she had been pregnant for only seven weeks when the psychiatrist spoke to her recently.  The psychiatrist advises that she would not be able to take account of her memory and cognitive problems when seeking to balance relevant information.  She is unable to concentrate for more than a very short period of time.  </span></p>

It is very difficult to ascertain her present wishes.  Insofar as she says anything coherent on the topic it has been, on occasions, supportive of her previous position. In a hesitant and inarticulate way, she has confirmed to her mother that she did not want to keep the baby.

However, it seems to me impossible for this court to attach any significant weight to them bearing in mind her patent lack of capacity, the manifest difficulties she has in understanding, retaining and weighing up information concerning the pregnancy.  Overall, I consider that the clear and unambiguous views that she expressed prior to the injury are the crucial factors in this case.  A termination also accords with her best interests in other ways.  It is plain that continuing her pregnancy will involve a greater risk of injury to her physical health.  In saying that, I have regard to the opinion expressed by her consultant obstetrician that if she continues with the pregnancy it is more likely than not that as she becomes larger she will become more prone to falls and cause herself significant injury, particularly if she continues to exhibit the type of behaviour that she has been demonstrating in the last few weeks.  It is therefore in my judgment likely that termination will promote her physical recovery and rehabilitation.  I also, of course, have to take into account the medical risks of termination but they are, on the evidence, relatively low. They are of course risks that she has taken previously in respect of her earlier termination.  The obstetrician supports the termination of the pregnancy within the criteria of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Abortion Act 1967</ref> on the basis that continuing the pregnancy would involve a greater risk of injury to her physical health than if it was terminated.  </span></p>

I declare that she lacks capacity to consent to medical treatment, in particular to the termination of the pregnancy, coupled with a general anaesthetic and ancillary treatment.  I will order and further declare that it is lawful and in her best interests to undergo termination of the pregnancy by surgical means and in the course of that process to undergo general anaesthetic and ancillary treatment.  </span></p>

I therefore direct that the Trust should file and serve on the Official Solicitor a further short plan setting out how those eventualities would be met.  Because it is conceivable that it will be necessary for restraint to be used in the course of the procedure, I declare that it will be lawful for the Trust to use proportionate force for that purpose.  </span></p>
