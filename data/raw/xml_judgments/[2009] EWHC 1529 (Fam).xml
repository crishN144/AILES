Those rules, in essence, did two things: First, they introduced into the Family Proceedings Rules 1991, SI 1991/1247, a new rule 10.28 dealing with what was referred to as &#8220;Attendance at private hearings&#8221; &#8211; in other words, dealing with the question of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">access</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> to family proceedings. Second, they repealed rule 10.20A and substituted for it a new Part XI in the Family Proceedings Rules dealing with &#8220;Communication of information&#8221; but (and this is important to realise for present purposes) only in relation to &#8220;proceedings relating to children.&#8221;  The Rules say nothing as to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">reporting</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> of proceedings.  </span></p>

In my judgment, rule 10.28 applies to any proceedings, whether commenced before or after that date, and, indeed, applied to any hearing which on 27 April 2009 was part-heard.  The fact that the proceedings in the present case began with the issue of the Countess&#8217; petition on 26 September 2006, shortly thereafter followed by her Form A on 2 November 2006, does not of itself exclude the rule.

The application failed but, in the context of explaining why, Charles J, at paragraphs 17-18, contemplated that there might be other means of protecting particular pieces of information which would avoid the need for complete media exclusion;  in particular, he seems to have contemplated that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the Administration of Justice Act might apply.  </span></p>

Judges do not give advisory opinions, least of all when they have heard no adversarial argument on the point.  And whereas, of course, if a judge makes an order, anybody who disobeys that order is liable to the penalties of contempt, it is no contempt for anybody to disregard a mere expression of opinion by a judge if that opinion is not embodied in some order binding upon the parties or the world at large.  The fact is, as it seems to me, that what I am being invited to do is to give an advisory opinion and to offer advice to the media &#8211; advice which it is insinuated will carry the more force because it comes from a judge.  The difficulty is that although persons, the media included, may be obliged to obey the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">orders</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> of a judge, if the judge offers advice they are entitled to accept or reject that advice as they wish, just as they are entitled to accept or reject advice from any other quarter.

But, as it seems to me, Lord Steyn&#8217;s analysis is entirely general.  And if it be the case, as the House of Lords has now taught us, that the foundation of the jurisdiction to restrain publicity in such cases derives from the Convention, it does not seem to me that any previous distinction between a power in the court to grant such injunctions where children are involved, and the perceived lack of power to grant such injunctions in cases where adults are involved, can have survived the explanation in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">In re S</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> of the effect of the Human Rights Act.

Adults and children are equally entitled to the protection of the Convention.  Moreover there are, as Mr. Mostyn readily accepted when I put the point to him, a number of decisions in recent years in the Family Division where judges have granted such injunctions to protect vulnerable adults without there being any doubt as to their jurisdiction to do so.  </span></p>

And that public interest is protected by Article 6, quite apart from Article 10.  But that interest typically pulls in two different directions.  Viewed from the perspective of the media, and the market which the media are serving, that public interest is to be promoted and public confidence in the courts is to be maintained by justice being administered in public, or at least in a manner which enables its workings to be properly scrutinised, so that (and this is the modern Convention version of the age-old Benthamite principle) the judges and other participants in the process remain visible and amenable to comment and criticism.  This is the argument that Article 6 points in the direction of openness, specifically in this context in the direction of the media being permitted to remain in court.  </span></p>

There is no great point of law or principle involved in this case, other than the satellite point upon which I am currently giving judgment.  It may be, but it is hard to imagine that the judgment, when I come to give it at the end of the substantive proceedings, will be of the slightest interest to law reporters.  The parties are agreed that this is a case to be resolved in the circumstances on a traditional &#8216;needs&#8217; basis.  Mr. Marks and Mr. Mostyn point to the fact that were this case to involve more anonymous and less well known people the media would, as they assert, have no interest in it at all.  They suggest that the reason for the media&#8217;s interest is nothing to do with any profound point of principle at stake.  It is not to do with the circumstances of the case at all, save for the circumstance that the litigants are well known.  The mundane quotidian facts of this particular case are no different, as they say, from many such cases, yet the case will nonetheless be of interest to the media reading and media watching public.  Not, they say, because there is any genuine public interest in the matter, but, so it is said, because there is an insatiable appetite in the public for reading about such matters.  Not because the public has any interest in such matters as such, but because there is an insatiable public interest in reading about the affairs of the famous, the well known or the celebrity.  </span></p>

It seems to me that this is potentially dangerous, very dangerous, territory, because it has the potential to privilege one group of the community &#8211; those who attract the attention of the media &#8211; over and above another group who do not.  Plainly the fact that the media are interested, if only because of the identity or character of the particular litigants rather than because of the nature of the underlying dispute, is a matter which is relevant.  But it can hardly be determinative, unless we are to have one law for the celebrity and another law for those who live their lives in tranquillity and anonymity.  </span></p>

He says that one must have regard to the fact that the driver for the change in the law was, as he suggests, concerns, particularly in the media, about so called &#8216;secret&#8217; justice in the context of children cases &#8211; so the driving force behind the change in the law was not, he suggests, ancillary relief proceedings at all.  He submits that the parties here, when they embarked upon these proceedings, had a legitimate, reasonable expectation of privacy and did not envisage that they would be overtaken by this radical change in the law.  They would, he says, until very recently, have had every expectation that these proceedings would be carried on, as indeed they would have been before 27 April 2009, in private and without the attention of the media.  That fact, he says, distinguishes this, and other transitional cases, from the general run of future ancillary relief cases where there will not of course be, at least in relation to those who issued their petition on or after 27 April 2009, any such expectation of privacy.  </span></p>

As is also well known, Lord Falconer performed what is popularly known as a U-turn when, in June 2007, he published a further Green Paper &#8220;Confidence &amp; confidentiality: Openness in family courts &#8211; a new approach&#8221;, Cm 7131, announcing a radically different policy.  </span></p>

For, as was made clear in the White Paper, and in a statement which the Lord Chancellor made to the House of Commons the same day, the government&#8217;s plan was (see page 31) to permit the media access to all family proceedings coupled with a judicial power to exclude in appropriate cases.  </span></p>

That may be so.  But, whatever one&#8217;s views may be as to the lack of consultation, and the unfortunate fact that the change in the law has not thus far addressed the equally important question of reporting restrictions, I and, more importantly, the parties have to take the law as it is.  </span></p>

In other words, as it seems to me, the parties may have had a hope, and a hope which may well have been encouraged by the seeming succession of vacillations by the Government, that the Ancien regime would have survived at least a little bit longer; but they cannot have been altogether surprised to discover, albeit very late in the day, that the system was in fact to be as had been flagged up some time before.  </span></p>

And no-one has suggested or could sensibly suggest that that itself involves any breach of the Convention.  So I have to take the law as it is, namely that the new arrangements apply to pending cases and, indeed, as I pointed out, to cases part-heard in which hearings happened to straddle the implementation date of 27 April 2009.  </span></p>

However, that feature is unlikely in the general run of such cases and certainly, in my judgment, in the present case is insufficient, to justify an order excluding the media from the proceedings altogether.  This branch of paragraph 5.4 of the Practice Direction focuses upon the case of a specific witness who, there is credible reason to believe, will either not give evidence at all, or not give full or frank evidence, if the media are present.  In other words if the case postulated by the Practice Direction arises it is, as it seems to me, properly a basis for excluding the media from that particular part of the proceedings where the condition is satisfied in relation to a particular witness.  But it will not be in the general run of cases and in the present case certainly cannot be &#8211; indeed, I have some difficulty in seeing how it could ever realistically be &#8211; a reason for excluding the media from the hearing as a whole.  </span></p>

Is it to be said that, generally speaking, the media are to be excluded from such cases?  Of course, every case must be determined on its own particular facts.

It may be that, because of their public profile, they will not merely be exposed to the publication of facts and matters which they prefer to keep private, but also be exposed to comment of the kind which they would rather not be exposed to.

I am not, of course, suggesting that the fact of the public standing of the litigants in this particular case is an irrelevant consideration.  Far from it.  After all, one does not have to be unduly cynical to accept, fairly readily, the factual proposition which lies behind the argument that the media are present today only because of the identity of the parties involved.  One could hardly move in the Royal Courts of Justice on 27 April 2009 without seeing some representative of the media, yet the fact is that the media, with the exception of only a few cases, have been conspicuously absent from family courts ever since.  And certainly the fact is that, although I have been involved in ancillary relief cases since 27 April 2009, this is the first occasion that the media have appeared in my court in such a case &#8211; or, indeed, in any case.  So I do not dispute, and am content to proceed on the basis of, the factual assumptions as to the reason for the media&#8217;s interest which underlie the submissions from Mr. Marks and Mr. Mostyn. </span></p>
