	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties are Algerian by birth.  They met in Algeria, and were married there.  The mother&#8217;s parents live in Algeria, as do the father&#8217;s; other family members (including parental siblings) reside in Algeria and France.  This was the second marriage for the mother; during her first marriage she lived in England having moved here in 2001.  B was the only child of that union, and was included as a subject of these proceedings at one time (the father maintaining that he treated her as a child of the family), but she is no longer so included.  The mother&#8217;s first marriage came to an end in 2005 and the divorce from her first husband was obtained (I have been advised) through legal proceedings in Algeria; the financial remedy proceedings relevant to that marriage were conducted here.  Following the end of the mother&#8217;s first marriage, she spent a period of several months in Algeria; there was some dispute at this hearing as to whether this was an extended holiday, or reflected an intention to make a more permanent home there (the dispute is not of significance to my decision).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These parties married on 6 February 2008.  Prior to and during the marriage, the father maintains that the couple had discussed, and agreed, that any children of the marriage would be raised in England; the mother does not I believe contest this.  They moved here after the marriage, the father being sponsored by the mother to do so, and they made their home in Bradford.  On one occasion, when S was only 8 months old, the family travelled to Algeria for a holiday. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The marital relationship deteriorated in 2011, and the parties separated in December of that year; at that time, the father travelled to London in search of work, the mother remaining at the family home in Yorkshire.  The parties agree that the mother effectively brought the marriage to an end during a telephone conversation on 27 January 2012, though the precise content of that call is in dispute.  The father maintains that in that telephone call the mother told him that (a) she planned to take the children to Algeria, where they would be raised by their maternal uncles, (b) that he could expect to receive divorce documents from Algeria, and (c) that the father would face the full force of the law, intimating the involvement of the police.  The mother denies these aspects of the call (identified in (a)-(c)). </p>

It seems that may have contacted her multiple times over the following weeks, for in March 2012, he was interviewed by the Bradford police on suspicion of harassing her.  The father was not in fact charged with any offence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the spring of 2012, though I am unsure precisely what date, the mother issued divorce proceedings in the Al Harrach Family Court in Algeria.  Her divorce papers reveal the fictional assertion that at the time she was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">residing</span>&#8217; at an address in Bordj Kiffan, a suburb of Algiers; this is in fact her parents&#8217; address.  The divorce documents appear further to bear the father&#8217;s parents&#8217; address in Bordj Kiffan as his residence. At the material time, both the mother and father were permanent residents in England.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2012, the father issued an application for a PSO to restrain the mother from removing the children from the jurisdiction.  The application was listed before District Judge Hickinbottom on 12 June <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> and he made the order requested, pending a further hearing on 22 June.  DJ Dodd confirmed the order at that later hearing.  By the time of the hearing before DJ Dodd, the father had been served with the Algerian divorce papers and he produced them to the court.  After hearing evidence, the District Judge confirmed the PSO, relying principally (though not exclusively) on the evidence that the mother had chosen to litigate her divorce in Algeria rather than &#8211; as he would have expected &#8211; England: </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic">mother&#8217;s explanation was that it is easier for her to do this in Algeria because she could not keep coming to court in the United Kingdom with small children.  The reality, of course, known to anyone who asks &#8211; and free advice is available &#8211; is that the divorce will occur almost certainly without a hearing. &#8230; it is odd on the face of it to seek monetary relief in Algerian dinars if you are settled in the United kingdom&#8230;</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>(&#167;8 of the judgment).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nine months later, on 26 March 2013, the mother made this application to discharge the PSO.  At that time her claim was framed by her solicitor in these terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be quite apparent, given the chronology, that the weddings have now taken place; neither the mother nor the children attended.  The mother nonetheless wishes the PSO to be lifted so that she has the freedom to take the children to Algeria at some point in the future, possibly next summer (2015) &#8211; to visit her family, and to give the children an opportunity to experience their undoubtedly strong culture which they have inherited from both of their parents.</p>

She has no specific plans.  She maintains that she has built up her life here, pointing out that she has been living here for the best part of 13 years now; her children are also settled and in school here.  The father of her older daughter lives here, though he sees B for contact only during the school holidays.  The mother has a private rented housing authority home.</p>

She offers security in the sum of &#163;4,000; during her evidence she indicated that she was no longer in a position to offer that security, though I was advised by her counsel in submissions that this sum could in fact be raised by her parents if required.  It is acknowledged by counsel that a &#8216;security&#8217; rather than a &#8216;surety&#8217; would be appropriate here, given that those raising the funds live outside the jurisdiction; it was further agreed that if I considered that financial security would be required, I could impose such a requirement as a pre-condition to travel, and it would then be for the mother to find the money.  If I took that approach, I would of course take into account the means of the mother, and her evidence generally about the difficulties of raising even &#163;4,000.</p>

I garner no comfort in the circumstances from noting that she returned from such a trip.  I recognise that the mother has lived here for many years, and that she proclaims a wish for this to continue; however, while she has ties to this country (in terms of schooling for the children, and a rented home), there are none which represent profound investment; these are ties in fact which are reasonably easily severable. </p>

That threat was, in my judgment, inevitably heightened by the mother&#8217;s actions in launching and pursuing divorce proceedings (together with the full range of ancillary orders) in Algeria.  I share DJ Dodd&#8217;s concerns about the mother&#8217;s motivations in seeking her divorce in Algeria, and more specifically in seeking financial relief in Algerian dinars. Although Ms Tai indicates that the mother needed the divorce orders in Algeria, in the absence of a letter from the father, in order to authorise her travel, this explanation first appeared (somewhat as an afterthought in my view) only in the written statement of the mother a year after the issue had first arisen (May 2013).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a statement dated 15 June 2012 (&#167;13), the mother postulated that the father had only brought the application for a PSO because she had indicated that she wished to commence divorce proceedings in Algeria (i.e. not indicating that she had in fact done so); in fact by the time of that statement, divorce proceedings <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been issued there (certainly by 5 June 2012).  I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s delay in bringing the proceedings was attributed to his hope that he and the mother would reconcile; the urgency of the process was caused when the mother intimated imminent divorce process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother was unable in evidence to give a good explanation for the fact that her divorce documents suggested that she was residing in Algeria at the time of those proceedings, and only &#8216;currently living&#8217; in Bradford (see undated letter from the mother&#8217;s Algerian lawyer); she was unable to give any explanation at all for why the father was said also to be residing there at that time.  Given that, on Mr. Lahouasnia&#8217;s evidence it was unusual for the process to be conducted wholly in the absence of the parties, I was left concerned about this misrepresentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not believe that I have heard materially different evidence about this conversation, and accordingly afford proper respect to DJ Dodd&#8217;s conclusion.  Inevitably discussion of it featured in the oral evidence of the parties at this hearing and I have, like DJ Dodd, considered the parents&#8217; differing accounts.  I do not consider that memory of events so long ago is likely to be so accurate that the witnesses could remember the precise words used, but I am satisfied, having seen and heard both parties, that the father&#8217;s account is indeed (as DJ Dodd found) to be preferred.  I accept that the mother told him that she intended to take the children to live in Algeria and be raised by maternal uncles.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The expert legal advice makes clear that the father is impotent in the event that he should seek to enforce in Algeria any order made here.  He is in no stronger position in seeking to pursue proceedings there; indeed it appears that he is vulnerable to a &#8216;severe penalty&#8217; for the non-payment of the maintenance award, made in his absence in the proceedings in the Al Harrach Court, were he to travel there.  He is, I accept, genuinely fearful of the consequences of travelling to Algeria, telling me in evidence that he had not visited for his father&#8217;s funeral there, and was to be in the next few days meeting up with his mother &#8211; but in Tunisia rather than in their home country. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have pointed up, in this concluding section of the judgment, those areas of the evidence in which I have found the mother to be an unsatisfactory witness, and someone on whose word I would find it difficult to repose any or any significant trust.  The court&#8217;s trust is essential if an applicant is to attract support from the court for foreign travel to a non-Hague country such as proposed here.   Overall, I found the father to be a more satisfactory witness, even if at times somewhat verbose, whose account was &#8211; where their versions differed &#8211; to be preferred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking matters overall, I am satisfied that it is not in the interests of the children to discharge the prohibited steps order.  There is, in my judgment a clear and identifiable risk that any order for the children&#8217;s return would be breached; I am not satisfied that the mother has been candid with the court on issues of importance to my deliberation.  I consider that if the mother were to go to Algeria, even with the intent of returning but change (or be persuaded to change) her mind, then the consequences for the children would be grave; they would be effectively dislocated from all that they have known, deracinated from their homes in Bradford, and put beyond the effective reach of the father.  The safeguards discussed are ineffective to mitigate these risks.  Ms Tai conceded in submissions that Mr. Lahouasnia&#8217;s evidence offered her no comfort; the safeguards discussed by him do not have any &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">real and tangible effect</span>&#8221; in Algeria and are not &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent</span>&#8221; (namely the father, here).  I cannot in the circumstances say that I am &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">positively satisfied</span>&#8221; that the advantages to the children of visiting Algeria outweigh the risks to their welfare which the visit will entail. </p>

I am not by this judgment saying that the children should never have the chance to visit Algeria.  There may come a time when they express the clear wish to go themselves, and when, with maturity and greater autonomy, they may be able to provide for themselves a degree of self-protection against the unilateral actions of their parents. </p>
