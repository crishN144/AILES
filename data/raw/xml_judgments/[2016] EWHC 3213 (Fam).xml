It is summarised in the chronology and has been set out in previous judgments and I do not propose to recite it in full detail here.  The mother is a British national and the father is an Egyptian and British national.  The parties met in Egypt in 2005 and married in that country in 2007.  E was born in Egypt on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2007.  She has dual Egyptian and British citizenship.  Later that year the parties moved to the UK.  In 2011 they separated.  At that stage E remained with her mother, with contact with the father.  In December 2011 the parties travelled to Egypt.  It is the father&#8217;s case that while they were there they agreed that E would remain in Egypt with her paternal grandmother.  The mother denies that such an agreement was ever reached.  The mother returned to the UK without E at the end of the year.  The father returned shortly afterwards.  </span></p>

He ordered the father to return or cause the return of E to the jurisdiction, repeating orders made on a number of previous occasions, and he further ordered the father to provide information to the mother&#8217;s solicitors as to the whereabouts of the child.  He also ordered the father to arrange contact by telephone or Skype for the mother.  Despite these orders, no contact took place at this stage, no information was produced about the whereabouts of the child and the father remained in custody.</span></p>

He has not made the slightest attempt to do so.

In saying that, of course, he was referring to the criminal offence of abduction.  He was, however, faced with the fact that the father had on repeated occasions committed a contempt of court.  He noted that Parliament had fixed a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment for contempt of court.  He further noted that the father had by now served the equivalent of twice the statutory maximum.  He then continued at para.24:</span></p>

He asserts that he cannot comply with these orders.  Judges, including myself, have been sure that he can comply and is, rather, choosing not to comply, but that is the stance which he has taken.  Although successive orders are legally permissible, the reality in this case is that from day one this father has manifested an absolute determination not, under pressure of court orders, to reveal the whereabouts of his child and not to cause her return to England.  That is a very grave contempt of court in the circumstances of this case but it was no less grave at the outset than it is now.  The reality is that he has made very plain indeed at a very early stage that he would not comply with these orders.  For that flagrant contempt he could of course have been sentenced to the maximum term.  The maximum term was two years imprisonment.  It seems to me the court has to be very cautious indeed not to subvert altogether the will and intention of Parliament when enacting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.14</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> by now contemplating sentencing for aggravated periods that are more than double that term.

Further, the order records that the mother informed the court through counsel that if E was returned to this jurisdiction, she could reside with her father in the first instance.  The learned judge continued the wardship, which had been continued by successive judges since the original order of His Honour Judge Horowitz and made further directions, including the direction that the father should by 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2014 file and serve a statement setting out all practical proposals for the return of E to this jurisdiction.

On that occasion Hogg J ordered that E be joined as a party to the proceedings and that Mr. Mellor of the CAFCASS team should act as her guardian.  The judge recorded in her order that the father had on that occasion made arrangements with the paternal grandmother to telephone him at court and make E available on the phone to talk to her mother and, indeed, that happened in the presence of Mr. Mellor.  That was the first time, as I understand it, the mother had spoken to her child for two years.  The judge made further orders to facilitate the return of E to this country, for example by providing that the port alert should be lifted to prevent any member of the father&#8217;s family being arrested should they bring E back to this country.  The judge made a series of further orders, including renewing the order that the father should immediately return or cause the return of E to this jurisdiction.  Shortly afterwards the parties attempted mediation through Reunite but that organisation concluded that mediation was not suitable because the father was asserting that he had no power over his family in Egypt.</span></p>

In September the matter returned to court, when Hogg J noted in her order that, although there had been some contact, she was concerned that the father had been apparently unable to set up regular Skype contact.  She renewed orders for the child&#8217;s return and made a further order that Skype contact should take place on a regular basis, ordering the father to make E available for Skype contact each Saturday.  In other words, it is clear from that order, as from the other numerous orders in these proceedings, that the learned judge took the view that the father was in control of what happened to his daughter.  A further order in similar terms was made in October 2014 when Hogg J ordered the father to make arrangements for contact every Friday at an agreed location between E and her mother on a laptop computer.  Eventually, in late 2014, weekly Skype contact between E and her mother started.  The arrangements were, as I understand it, that the father took his laptop computer to the offices of the mother&#8217;s solicitors in Leeds, where contact took place.  </span></p>

In order to facilitate contact the learned judge was persuaded to lift the restrictions on the father leaving this country and she discharged the order on him leaving the jurisdiction and also the port alert.  As a result, in December 2015 the father travelled to Egypt and in the following month the mother travelled there too.  She travelled in the hope that contact would be arranged if she went there herself.  In the event, however, no contact took place.  Furthermore, although there had been some indirect contact in the less restrictive circumstances provided by Roberts J&#8217;s order, namely between the mother and E on the mother&#8217;s iPad without the father being present, those indirect visits have come to an end suddenly in January 2016.

The father indicated to the court that he was not aware why this had not taken place.  The father indicated to the court that he travelled to Egypt with both his British and Egyptian passports and entered Egypt with his Egyptian passport but that his Egyptian passport was retained in Egypt by his brother at his brother&#8217;s request.  The father stated that he then left Egypt, using his British passport and that his English passport was stamped on exiting Egypt.  The court directed that a copy of his British passport and stamp were provided to the court and to the mother.  The father commenced giving oral evidence to the court, during which it was quickly established that the father appeared unwell and stated that he had in the preceding nine hours taken four 45mg tablets of a medication, mirtazapine, prescribed for him.  This was in excess of the prescribed dose of one 45mg tablet each day at night time.  Consequently, a paramedic was called to court to assist the father, who recommended the father go to hospital for a further health assessment, although such an overdose was not toxic.  The father refused to go to hospital until his British passport was returned to him.  The court reconvened at 2.15 p.m. to hear argument in relation to the father&#8217;s passport and refused the mother&#8217;s application that the father&#8217;s passport should be held either by the Tipstaff or by the father&#8217;s solicitor but made a passport order in respect of the father&#8217;s Egyptian passport.  The father left court for hospital immediately his British passport was returned into his possession.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The matter came back before me on 4th July.  On that occasion the father gave evidence. His evidence was very much in line with what he had said on previous occasions.  It is unnecessary for me to read out in full what he told the court on that occasion.  He confirmed that he travelled to Egypt in the first week of December 2015 and returned in March this year.  He gave an account of where E was living.  He said he did not know the address but she was staying in a villa at a resort, which he described.  He described how he had had contact with E on a number of occasions during his visit.  He said that, when he tried to raise the subject of the long-term, there had been a reluctance amongst his family members to talk about the matters.  He said that decisions were taken by his grandfather&#8217;s brother, who was effectively the head of the family, and it was not a matter for him to decide what should happen to his daughter.  He was not able to contact that gentleman directly.  If he wished to speak to him, he had to go through one of his own younger brothers.  He knew that there were proceedings had started in Egypt, to which I shall return later, but said that he was impeded from taking part in those proceedings by the freezing order imposed in this case.  He accepted that it was a good idea for any child to be in a relationship with both parents but told the court that E had formed a resentment against her mother because of the way in which she perceived the mother had treated the father, in particular causing him to be imprisoned.  He had no information about where the child was at school or how she was doing at school.  He said that he had asked his family members but had been told: &#8220;please don&#8217;t ask.&#8221;  He said that he did not take any photographs when he was visiting her on this occasion.  He reiterated that E did not want to speak to her mother at present.  No orders or findings were made on that occasion because of a shortage of time and the matter was adjourned until today for submissions to be made about what course the court should now make.  However, subsequent to that an application was made by the father in person to lift the port alert order so that he could travel to order and, after further email communications, which I need not describe in any detail, I agreed to lift that order.  However, the father did not travel to Egypt in the summer, he says because he did not have sufficient funds to do so.  An application by him to have funds released by further relaxation of the freezing order was rejected by Holman J at a further hearing on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August.  </span></p>

Before going on to the submissions that have been put before me today by the parties I should refer briefly to the Egyptian proceedings.  I have only limited details of those proceedings.  What is known is that proceedings have taken place in Egypt and that orders have been made on two occasions that the child should be placed in the mother&#8217;s care.  It is not clear to me what role, if any, the father has played in those proceedings.  It is his case that he has played little, if any, role.  Furthermore, it is not clear to me what steps, if any, have been taken to enforce the order made by the court, save that I do know as a result of a translation of a document put before me today that in May this year the Egyptian court appears to have passed a prison sentence on the father because of his non-compliance with a court order.  Other than that, it seems to me it would be unwise for this court to draw any further conclusions as to what has happened in the Egyptian proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The question for me now is whether or not these wardship proceedings should continue.  On behalf of the mother, Mr. Jarman argues that they should.  The child has been separated from the mother for several years, despite many orders to the contrary made by this court and, it seems, the Egyptian court.  The mother has had no direct contact now for five years and has had very limited indirect contact via Skype over a short period of time between 2014 and early 2016. That contact has come to an end suddenly without any real explanation and there has been no contact now for nine months.  Mr. Jarman describes it as intolerable and contrary to E&#8217;s welfare interests.  As a result, he submits that these proceedings should continue to provide a means by which the relationship between the mother and her daughter can be restored in E&#8217;s best interests.  Mr. Jarman submits that judges have repeatedly found that the father has openly defied court orders.  Judges have simply not accepted his argument that his family is in control of what happens to his daughter and that he is powerless to decide what should happen to her in the future. Mr. Jarman submits that the father has chosen to stop indirect contact and that it is within his power to restart it.  He submits that the father has failed to engage with the Egyptian court.  He submits that, insofar as the father feels aggrieved about what has happened to him in the course of these proceedings, it is entirely self-inflicted.  </span></p>

Holman J was plainly of the view that the father had not committed the criminal offence of abduction but he was equally plain the father was in breach of orders and he made no criticism of the approach of the previous judges in passing prison sentences for those breaches.  Indeed, he himself had passed such a sentence only a few months earlier.  Holman J&#8217;s view was that it was inappropriate to make a further sentence given the overall sentencing powers of the court for contempt of court.  He emphatically did not criticise any of the earlier decisions about how the father&#8217;s disgraceful behaviour and contumacious contempt should be dealt with.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I listened carefully to the father&#8217;s evidence on the last occasion.  I did not believe much of it.  In particular, I do not accept that he is powerless to influence his daughter&#8217;s future and totally in the hands of his family.  I consider that he is presenting a false case to the court in putting forward this argument.  I note that that is a view which has been reached by judges on previous occasions.  I have no doubt, however, that, if the father wanted to do so, he could arrange for his daughter to return to England and could do so within a few days.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In my view, this father is behaving in a disgraceful, manipulative and abusive way towards E and her mother and the court.  His assertion that all would be well if the wardship came to an end is, in my view, totally implausible.  I do not believe him.  He has demonstrated a willingness to refuse to comply with court orders and has defied a number of judges on many occasions at many hearings.  I find that the steps that he offers to take in the letter in the passage that I have read out are steps that he could take if he chose to do so immediately, whether or not these proceedings continue.  In other words, I see no reason why he could not bring about an immediate resumption of indirect contact, nor any reason why he could not talk to E about how it is important to have contact with her mother.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">That, of course, does not mean that these proceedings should necessarily continue.  In making that decision, it is E&#8217;s welfare that must be my paramount consideration.  Although she has not been in this country for several years, and although no contact has taken place, I do consider that these proceedings have served a useful purpose, and are continuing to serve a useful purpose, by providing a forum wherein her future can be considered in this jurisdiction, and furthermore by applying some pressure to the father, who, I am satisfied, is in control of events, to persuade him to bring about a resumption of relationship between daughter and mother.  In my judgment, it is important for these proceedings to remain alive so that this court can do what it can to help.  It may be that only a minimal amount can be achieved in the circumstances but this court is not going to desert E.  Accordingly, the application for dismissal of the wardship proceedings is refused.</span></p>
