	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns an application for an order recognising and declaring enforceable protective measures made in respect of a protected person (&#8220;SV&#8221;) by the High Court of the Republic of Ireland on 16 November 2022. Those measures require SV&#8217;s placement at a specialist eating disorder unit in London, there being no comparable unit in Ireland. I granted the application at a hearing on 24 November 2022 for reasons to follow in writing. This is my judgment giving those reasons. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Hague Convention of 13 January 2000 on the International Protection of Adults (&#8220;the 2000 Convention&#8221;) was signed by the United Kingdom on 1 April 2003 and by the Republic of Ireland on 18 September 2003. It has not been ratified by the Republic of Ireland. Curiously, it has been ratified by the UK only for Scotland (on 5 November 2003, the first country to ratify the Convention) where it entered into force on 1 January 2009. Scotland is now a member of a group of 14 European countries where the 2000 Convention operates. The 2000 Convention is implemented in Scotland by the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.</p>

An application may be made by &#8220;any interested person&#8221; under Article 23 for <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">recognition</span> by State B of a protective measure issued by State A.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 2000 Convention contains the familiar strictly limited grounds, such as public policy, where recognition of an incoming measure can be withheld by State B. But the merits of the measure made by State A cannot be reviewed by State B (Article 26), and findings of fact by State A establishing its jurisdiction are binding on State B (Article 24).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to recognise that the role of the receiving court of State B is subsidiary and ancillary to the primary role of the issuing court of State A. So, to be clear, in common with the 1996 Hague Convention on Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, recognition by State B of a measure made by State A is intended to be almost automatic unless one of the very limited grounds for non-recognition can be shown. Those limited grounds categorically do not include State B disagreeing with the measure on its merits. However, once a measure has been recognised by State B then the conditions of its implementation are governed by the law of State B (Article 14).</p>

An enforcement application can be made under Article 25(1) and may only be refused on those same grounds where recognition may be withheld (Article 25(3)). All contracting states must offer a simple and rapid procedure for determining an enforcement application (Article 25(2)). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When State B determines a reciprocal order application, it recognises the <span style="font-style:italic">sui generis</span> nature of the scheme of the 2000 Convention, and on most substantive (as opposed to procedural) issues refrains from deploying its own domestic legal principles in their determination. There are a number of exceptions of which the most prominent is the requirement of State B to satisfy itself that the measure in question conforms to the standards and principles deriving from Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, as indicated above, the domestic law of State B has to be applied in determining whether the implementation of a proposed reciprocal order would be lawful.

Those protective measures were issued by Hyland J in the High Court of the Republic of Ireland in a judgment and order issued on 16 November 2022 (which was supplemented, amended and clarified for technical reasons, but without altering their substance, by two further orders made by the same judge on 23 November 2022). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In doing it this way Parliament bypassed the procedures for ratification at the Hague. Importantly, giving effect to the Convention in this way meant that it would apply in England and Wales as a receiving country in respect of qualifying incoming protective measures wherever made. Therefore it does not matter whether State A is, or is not, a contracting state under the 2000 Convention. The disadvantage is that implementing the 2000 Convention by this route did not, of course, give rise to reciprocity. It did not have the effect that protective measures made here would be automatically recognised and enforced overseas, even in those countries operating the Convention.</p>

In theory there are circumstances where all that is needed is a declaration of recognition. But where the measure in question is a foreign protective measure relating to welfare rather than property, recognition alone will never suffice as the terms of the measure will invariably require positive action to be taken, and this in turn requires &#8220;enforcement&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> In contrast, under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, Schedule 3, para 8(1) &amp; (2) a foreign measure recognised under para 7 can only become &#8220;as enforceable as a measure having the like effect granted by a court in Scotland&#8221; if  it is registered in Scotland in accordance with rules of court.

This is because mere active opposition to the application is likely to amount to a prohibited attack on the merits of the primary decision of the foreign court. A plausible argument therefore needs to be advanced by or on behalf of P in support of her/his application for party status that there has been some fatal procedural defect in the foreign proceedings and/or that there are good reasons justifying non-recognition within the terms of Schedule 3. </p>

My response to such pedantry would be that it reflects an implied finding.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It would be perilous, in my opinion, for applications under Schedule 3, to be routinely directed to be heard in open court but subject to a &#8220;transparency&#8221; order made under COP PD 4C para 2.1 containing reporting restrictions. That would be an example of us applying our own insular domestic standards to this stand-alone piece of legislation which incorporates an International Convention. In this case, it would be singularly inappropriate to do so in circumstances where the primary proceedings, the result of which has been afforded near automatic recognition here, were heard <span style="font-style:italic">in camera</span> in Dublin. Further, I personally am very reluctant to make routine orders of this nature in circumstances where I have serious doubts as to whether the present arrangements are &#8220;correct&#8221;: see my decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2022/31" uk:canonical="[2022] EWCOP 31" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWCOP 31</ref> at [40] &#8211; [45].

That direction should be copied to Mr Farmer of the Press Association by the applicant. At the hearing the Court should, subject to submissions made by the press or any party, relax the prohibition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 12(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> (and curtail the freedom in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12(2)</ref> to publish fully the terms of the final order), to permit anonymous publication of the proceedings, the judgment and the order.

Of course, this judgment anonymises P. There is no reason why the world should know her identity. Of course, the judgment of Hyland J annexed to this judgment has been anonymised by me for the same reason. Of course, her identity will be redacted from the copy of the order annexed to this judgment, again for the same reason. But the actual sealed order which gives effect to my decision, and which regulates matters between SV, the HSE and the Irish court should unquestionably bear her name. The order made by Hyland J bore SV&#8217;s name and it would be bizarre, to put it mildly, if we decided to anonymise our reciprocating order when the primary court did not do so in the principal order.</p>

She said that she did not appear to appreciate the risks to her physical health were she to continue to engage with self-induced vomiting, and to severely restrict her oral intake, and she did not appear to appreciate the risks to her physical health due to medical complications associated with starvation and severely low BMI.

She has identified certain actions that took place when SV was recently on leave in respect of the taking of medication that was not prescribed for her and how that demonstrated a disregard for her cardiac risk. She identified that there has been no change in her thinking in relation to treatment. She identified that SV has never said to her that she wants treatment.

She identifies that the first requirement of the test of capacity is the ability to understand the information relevant to a decision. She comes to the conclusion that SV was superficial in her considerations and not able to fully understand or distinguish between short-term, long-term or evidence-based versus non-evidentially based issues.

She could not meaningfully balance or weigh up evidence from her experiences of her illness and its treatment to date. She identified that given the mortality rate of this illness and the serious risks already identified to her life, it was significant she placed little or no weight on this information in her considerations and she, therefore, failed the third aspect of the test.</span></p>

Then she would go back to the hospital, her weight would be restored to a certain extent and then it would drop again. Dr O'Connell also said that it was likely that the weight drop was not just because of her leave home but was also because at a certain BMI, which she identified as 14, it would become very difficult for SV to see herself putting on weight and reaching that level of BMI.</span></p>

She then has identified some of the issues in relation to her home leave and she has also identified for me the state of play in respect of nutrition. There is at present a nasogastric tube in place. It is, from time to time, pulled out by SV but usually she will allow it to be replaced. She is taking oral food and there are certainly restrictions around that.

Dr O'Connell has also identified that she spoke to Dr Helen Murphy of Nightingale Hospital and that she, Dr O'Connell, was impressed with the course of treatment described in Nightingale and she has confidence that Nightingale would be able to adequately treat SV, given her complex needs.</span></p>

It seems to me that her rationale is that she wishes to go to the hospital in London so that she can start her treatment there.

That is a very important averment because obviously if SV's needs could be met in Ireland, they should be met in Ireland. It is more challenging in many different ways for her to be treated abroad and it also means she won't be able to see her family in the same way as she can at present.

One of those was in relation to the facilities provided for nasogastric feeding, including the room and the chair that was being used and Dr McCabe has identified that this has now been addressed and there are now suitable facilities in place.</span></p>

There is just one issue that I should address that is the relief that is sought at paragraph 6(i). What that identifies is that notwithstanding the respondent's lack of capacity to consent, that the director manager and/or responsible clinician would deliver such care and medical and/or psychiatric assessment as they consider to be appropriate, including nasogastric tube feeding and other PEG feeding and/or feeding by intravenous total parenteral nutrition.</span></p>

That is, unfortunately, a common way of administering nutrition to patients in this situation. It has been used in the hospital since SV has been admitted, although happily I think it has not been necessary to use it on a non-consensual basis where restraint is needed. Nonetheless, it is clearly an important part of the treatment regime and I will authorise that. But I'm not satisfied in relation to PEG feeding or TPN. Both of those would require admission to a general hospital. I am told that there is a general hospital right beside the Nightingale Hospital but, nonetheless, I do not have any evidence as to why it would be necessary for such a draconian form of relief, without any further recourse to this Court. Given the nature of the relief sought, it seems to me that I would have to have more evidence than simply a generalised statement, which I think is what Dr McCabe provided, which was that it would be better for them to have a full suite of available ways of feeding the respondent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I think both Dr McCabe and Dr O'Connell made it clear in their evidence that they were not familiar with these particular types of measures in the context of eating disorders, that they had not seen them used, that they were extremely rare indeed. They certainly had not only not been used in the admission to date, but I do not think ever considered in the admission to date. There was concern raised by Dr McCabe that if it became impossible to feed the respondent by any other means but PEG feeding or TPN, that it might be necessary to resort to them. But if that is the case, of course the parties have liberty to apply here. Certainly, the situation is a little more complex because any Order would have to be recognised by the Court of Protection but, again, I'm quite sure that Court has measures to deal with extreme emergences. In any case, given that SV will be closely monitored, and she will be in Nightingale Hospital, it will become clear if she has stopping eating and, it seems to me, that I have not been given sufficient evidence that the measures sought are necessary in all the circumstances. So, I will not grant liberty in respect of those measures.</span></p>
