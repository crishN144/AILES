Sadly, in recent years she has suffered the effects of memory impairment, which have become extremely serious. There is a diagnosis of alcohol related impairment and associated alcohol misuse and amnesiac syndrome related to alcohol use. </span></p>

She was married to LS for many years. She also knew William (WP), and they were friends since their teenage years. After LS died, PS and WP started a relationship, and they lived together as partners for the best part of two decades. They had a sexual relationship. It is unchallenged that both want that relationship to continue even though PS is now in residential care.</span></p>

With the exception of RS, all those mentioned above as well as the expert, attended the hearing in person. RS lives abroad, and he attended by way of video link. I was greatly assisted by all parties.

I note that PS&#8217;s son has said that WP was (and maybe is) financially dependent on his mother. That may have been so, however there is no doubt on his or any other person&#8217;s part about one feature of their relationship, namely that it has been a loving and caring relationship and PS still benefits to the extent she can from it.</span></p>

This caused a &#8220;safeguarding&#8221; alert when staff were not let in the bedroom. It seems this &#8220;incident&#8221; was reported to the police. </span></p>

There is no doubt that PS is unable to understand/use and weigh the information relevant to decide on contact with people in general. In very simple terms, PS is incapable of understanding/using and weighing the matters listed in LBX and quoted above.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">What about WP? It seems to me that even if we treat him differently, because he is PS&#8217;s partner of many years and she has a strong sense of memory of him at a very deep level, it is clear from what Dr McIntosh told us, and the rest of the evidence, that PS does not know how to make decisions about contact with him taking into account the LBX features summarised above. She cannot put their contact into the context of her needs and the fact she now resides in residential care. During oral evidence Dr McIntosh focused on any risks WP may pose to PS and that she would have no ability to assess those risks. Actually, leaving risk to one side, PS has no ability to initiate or refuse contact within the context of her relationship with WP, other than simply following her basic feeling that she knows him, and he is her husband/partner. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Whether WP poses a risk to PS of which she is unaware is a different issue. If there had been evidence that WP had, throughout his relationship with PS, abused her and regularly sexually assaulted or raped her, the risk would be obvious, and it would be relevant information for her to have in order to assess contact with him. However, no one suggests WP has ever been anything other than a loving partner to PS. The risk identified is the risk that he will not follow a care plan put in place to keep PS safe. Experience shows that there is a risk that he may do that, and it is a risk that would be relevant to PS&#8217;s decision-making if she were able to do so. </span></p>

Dr McIntosh described it as finely balanced. Although she was extremely clear and insistent that the presumption of capacity in this area is a matter of law and that people have the right to have sexual relations with whoever they wish unless it can be established that they lack capacity, Dr McIntosh has obviously toiled anxiously over this question. This is no criticism of her at all. Indeed, I would have been very critical of her if she had not found the issue somewhat difficult.</span></p>

The relevant information depends on the circumstances and must be modified accordingly. So, in the same way as sexual relations between two members of the same sex cannot result in children, neither can sex involving a woman way beyond her child-bearing years. The need to understand that risk, question (4) in JB, is irrelevant.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The need to understand that sexually transmitted diseases may be spread by intercourse is something PS is unable to understand according to Dr McIntosh. That would of course be a crucial problem when considering sex relations with men in general. However, during her evidence, it was put to Dr McIntosh that we are concerned in this case with PS having sexual relations only with WP. Her response was that was not necessarily so because there were other men in the care home who she could have sexual relations with, perhaps even in error (her error, that is). However, it was then suggested that the overwhelmingly likely outcome of this hearing if the Court were to find that PS did have capacity is that any sexual relations would be carefully risk assessed. Amongst those issues that would have to be considered would be to ensure that PS only ever had the opportunity for sexual relations with the man she says she wishes to have them with, and that is WP. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Since WP and PS are within a monogamous and long-standing relationship it was asserted that the risk of STD could be ruled out. Whilst I am not sure one can be so confident that one party in a stable relationship will not acquire an STD, I am willing to accept that within the context of such a relationship it is not the risk factor that a young person wishing to explore sexual experiences in a distributive rather than focal way would have. On that basis Mr Allen, Dr McIntosh and the Court accepts that for PS to be unable to meet requirement (5) is also not a bar to her having capacity.</span></p>

This is (3), namely that the fact that PS can say yes or no to having sexual relations and is able to decide whether to give or withhold consent. Central to Dr Green&#8217;s approach to this issue is PS&#8217;s extremely damaged short-term memory. Her focus here was on PS&#8217;s ability to change her mind. According to Dr McIntosh in her report, following a detailed examination of PS she did understand that consent was needed from both sides in order for sex to continue lawfully. If either WP or her changed their minds, the other should &#8220;pack it in&#8221; as PS put it.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Dr Green&#8217;s argument, as I understood it went like this. Although she conceded that PS would be able to retain the relevant information to her decision to engage in sexual activity with WP long enough to agree to it, she would soon have forgotten that information and the decision she had made. Once sexual activity began, she would probably have forgotten what she had decided and why. Although Dr Green then went on to ask about what I consider to be a different issue, namely what would happen if PS changed her mind (which I will return to shortly), in fact there is a serious issue about what happens to the decision she had originally made? Of particular importance here is the fact that sexual activity can only continue if both parties have consented, and maintain their consent or, perhaps more accurately do not withdraw their consent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The answer is that if PS consents to sexual activity and it begins, her ongoing engagement with the activity will be determined by how she feels in the moment. If PS is happy to be engaging in sexual activity with her partner, then she will carry on. I pause here to note that Dr McIntosh was clear that when there was intimacy between PS and WP, she knew her partner was WP. There is no need for a periodic re-evaluation of the JB criteria in order for sexual activity lawfully to continue. If that was Dr Green&#8217;s submission, I reject it. If PS does not want to continue or if, perhaps because of her memory difficulties she becomes confused, even afraid, then that will be clear through her behaviour including what she says. At that point, her partner WP will have to stop the activity. </span></p>
