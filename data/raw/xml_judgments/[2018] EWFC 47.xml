She is currently the subject of an application for a care order under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> </span>(&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">CA 89</span>&#8217;), and is in the interim care of Northumberland County Council (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;).  Her mother is MD, and her father FD.  RD has two older sisters (aged 21 and 17 respectively) who both live away from home; she has a younger sister (aged 12) who lives at home, and who is the subject of a supervision order made in March 2018 in favour of the Local Authority.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">RD has had a damaged and disrupted early childhood, which has left her with a wide range of complex therapeutic needs (see [6] below); her parents accept that they cannot currently meet these needs for RD at home.  RD has been placed by the Local Authority at a residential placement in Scotland, which I shall call Lennox House.  RD has been at Lennox House for nine months, and is reasonably well-settled there; it is acknowledged that, objectively, the placement is successfully meeting her needs.  </p>

The Local Authority maintains that it does not (though the social worker herself acknowledges that the court is in a better place than her to judge this); the Local Authority&#8217;s position is supported by the Independent Reviewing Officer.  RD&#8217;s Guardian considers that, while the placement is entirely suitable, the regime at Lennox House does deprive RD of her liberty under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 5</span>.  RD&#8217;s parents are neutral on the issue.  All advocates agree that this is a finely balanced, fact-specific, decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is unnecessary for me to rehearse an account of RD&#8217;s early childhood history.  It is sufficient for me to record that RD was accommodated by the Local Authority first under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> in July 2017.  At that point, it was acknowledged that her life in the care of her parents had become significantly harmful to her; she had been sexually abused; she had received a poor education (through non-attendance and non-engagement); she had become involved in inappropriate relationships; she had been drinking alcohol and smoking; she had taken part in other forms of unboundaried behaviour. The threshold criteria under <span style="font-style:italic">section 31 CA 89</span> are not contested in this case.  RD&#8217;s parents accept that they have been unable to exert proper control over RD, and as a result of this she was exposed to harm, particularly sexual harm.  The parents accept that they exercised insufficient oversight of both younger children&#8217;s relationships with men who posed a sexual risk to the children.  It is further accepted that the parents have failed to offer their younger children a good enough level of general parenting as a result of which the children were put at risk of serious harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once accommodated in July 2017, RD was placed in a foster home.  The placement broke down, as did a succession of further foster placements.  Consequently, in September 2017 RD was moved to Lennox House. She initially struggled to settle, and the early phase of this period was peppered with incidents of disruptive behaviour.  From time to time she left the home in a state of upset, but when she did so, she returned of her own accord, or was successfully persuaded to return; during all periods when she was off site, she was never out of sight of staff. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Increasingly, RD began to recognise the value of being at Lennox House; the Guardian visited her there after a month, and noted that she looked healthier and happier.  At that visit, RD confirmed to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that she knew she needed to stay at Lennox House, despite missing her family.  Later in October 2017, RD was assessed by the Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Ursula Cawthorne, who reported that: &#8220;[RD] told me that this placement is her twelfth placement.  She does not want to move again&#8221;.  </p>

On re-entering the school system, RD struggled with some of the basics of reading and writing but has made commendable progress. The school, which is run by the same organisation as Lennox House, is a one-hour&#8217;s drive from Lennox House.</p>

However, in May 2018, RD absconded from the school premises on three occasions.  RD explained that she absconded at this time not because she wanted to escape the regime at Lennox House or school, but because she craved adult attention.  Following these abscondences, the levels of general supervision of RD were temporarily increased.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lennox House is a large detached house in a rural setting in Scotland, which was originally a working farm.  It is on the outskirts of a village, sitting high in its own grounds and is accessed via a winding drive over a large grassed area with steep banks leading up from the road.  The drive leads out onto a reasonably busy and fast &#8216;A&#8217; road; pedestrian access to Lennox House along that road would be risky in low light, darkness or poor weather.  By reason of its rural location, most of the outings taken by young people away from Lennox House have to take place in the company of a member of staff, principally to provide transport.  It is somewhat less than one mile (0.7 mile) to the local village, and about 5 miles to the local town.</p>

Currently there are three other girls and two boys at the home, with an age range of 12-17; the 17-year old resides in a separate cottage in the grounds of Lennox House.  I am advised by the social worker that staff involvement is not seen by them as &#8216;supervision&#8217; as such, &#8220;but staff are always on hand to intervene if required&#8221;.  That said, staff assist with the preparation of meals, laundry and other domestic tasks. Meals are eaten &#8216;family style&#8217;.  RD has said that she &#8220;does not feel watched over all of the time&#8221;, and &#8220;feels safer&#8221; than she has at any time in her life before.</p>

Thus, as RD settled at Lennox House last year and earlier this year, so were levels of supervision and monitoring relaxed.  It is currently expected that as RD&#8217;s behaviour improves, the level of supervision will again reduce.   When she has been emotionally distressed in the home, particularly initially and latterly, higher levels of support than her peers have been justified. I have been careful to assess what properly represents support and what represents supervision, and to assess whether supervision of her, and control of her movements, is &#8216;constant&#8217;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My primary focus is, and has been, firmly on RD and on her <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> circumstances at Lennox House.  I have sought to isolate from the statements and reports filed those features of her life there which are relevant to the issues in play (see [18] above).  It has been necessary for me to examine whether these features amount to a regime of &#8220;complete supervision and control&#8221;, when compared with the notional circumstances of the typical child of the same age, station, familial background and relative maturity who is free from disability.   That comparable child would, I am conscious, be a child whose life is likely to be &#8220;more regulated and controlled&#8221; than would be the case some years ago (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A-F</span> at [31](ii), quoted at [33] above).  Consistent with this approach is the fact that, as earlier indicated ([30] above), I am satisfied that RD is not &#8220;free to leave&#8221; Lennox House permanently any more than a 14-year old would be &#8220;free to leave&#8221; her family home.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The impression I have formed from the statements and reports is that the regime at Lennox House is boundaried, yet supportive.  Naturally the staff keep watchful eyes on the young residents, particularly when they cluster, but I do not discern that this level of monitoring is any more intense or overt than a parent&#8217;s watchfulness over young adolescent people in a domestic setting, in similar circumstances.  The presence of staff in the home is, I am satisfied, in significant measure to give the young people support and attention.  These young people, because of their needs, require 1:1 attention and support at times; this is qualitatively different from 1:1 supervision.  RD avowedly craves this kind of attention.  Contrary to the submission of Mr. Wilkinson, I am not persuaded that the staff ratio indicates of itself that the residents are subject to complete or constant supervision and control.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the issue of supervision or surveillance and/or control which gives rise to the most difficult question on the facts of this case: i.e. to what extent the &#8216;supervision&#8217; of the staff over RD is different from the watchful eye or supervision of a reasonable parent?  It is not immaterial to my assessment that RD is described as a 14-year old who appears younger than her chronological age (see [14] above).  It is fair to reflect that the degree of supervision may well be greater for her given her &#8216;younger&#8217; presentation or late evolving maturity than it would be for a more mature 14-year old.  Nor is it immaterial that RD herself does not feel &#8220;watched&#8221; all the time (see [16] above), which in itself is a reflection of the actual extent of the supervision.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The monitoring of RD as she ventures out into the grounds of Lennox House ([18](viii) above) is, it seems to me, ordinary quasi-parental good sense.  The fact that Lennox House stands on a busy road would be a matter of concern to any parent; a rash and unthinking excursion onto the road by any young person would place them at risk.   As I have earlier indicated, the fact that the staff accompany RD and her parents on some but not all of her contact visits ([18](xi) above) is more by way of support than supervision, particularly given that the parents have struggled with RD&#8217;s behaviours in the past; moreover, and not insignificantly, the parents are unfamiliar with the local area, and without transport on their visits.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are restrictions on RD&#8217;s movement, for sure.  She does not enjoy the freedoms to wander in to a town as a 14&#189; year old young person may have the opportunity to do if living in an urban area.  This restriction at least in part (perhaps a significant part) arises because of the geographic location of Lennox House &#8211; its distance from the local town and village, its distance from school, and is not in my finding because it is a function of any &#8216;complete control or supervision&#8217; of the State.  Restrictions of movement in this way do not engage considerations of &#8216;deprivation&#8217; under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 5</span> (see <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi</span> above).  I am satisfied that when the staff regard it as safe for RD to be able to pay a visit independently to the local village shop (involving a walk along the A road in daylight), they let her do so, much as a parent may well do.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Plainly when RD&#8217;s behaviour (her abscondences, disobediences, and/or her distress) justify some restrictions on her movement, these are appropriately applied and enforced; but every 14-year old is liable to appropriately imposed boundaries and sanctions. One of the obvious consequences of behaviourally acting out (for whatever reason) has been, for RD, the increase in the level of supervision, albeit for a short time.  This is not altogether surprising; just as parents may temporarily &#8216;ground&#8217; a teenager, or a boarding school head may impose limitations or tighter restrictions on a pupil&#8217;s ability to leave the campus, there is an element of &#8216;teaching a lesson&#8217; aswell as promoting future safety (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span> at [32] above).  Generally, RD has the freedom to wander around the home, and it seems to me that she enjoys a significant degree of autonomy about her recreation there while not at school.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the occasions when RD has temporarily absconded, she has either returned to Lennox House voluntarily, or by persuasion.  As Sir James Munby P said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A-F</span> at [31](i) (above) if a 14 or 15-year old child runs away from home, wanting to live on their own, they are likely to be returned home.  It is as simple as that.  I have read of no occasion on which RD has been forcibly restrained or detained in order to secure her return, and even if she had, I would require persuading that this would reflect anything other than reasonable and effective parental authority.  It does not amount to &#8216;complete control&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am conscious not to allow the protective or &#8220;comparative benevolence&#8221; (see [32](i)/(ii) above) of Lennox House or its regime (i.e. the fact that it is a therapeutic resource which is achieving much positive benefit for RD) distract me from the essential assessment of the liberty enjoyed (or not enjoyed) by RD there.  Nor can I be diverted by the fact that RD generally recognises the value of her placement, is mainly compliant with its regime (see [32](v)) and for the main part expresses an acceptance of the value of remaining there.  But these factors inevitably contribute to my assessment of the lower level of &#8216;intensity&#8217; of the supervision or control at Lennox House.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All children are, or should be, as I have discussed subject to some level of restraint, adjusted to their degree of maturity; so too is RD.  It is against that background that I assess RD&#8217;s situation.  Having reviewed all the circumstances, and for the reasons which I have set out above, I have reached the conclusion, on a fine balance, that the regime at Lennox House does not possess the &#8220;degree or intensity&#8221; of complete control or supervision of RD which justifies the description of &#8216;deprivation&#8217; of her liberty.  In my judgment, insofar as the staff impose limits or boundaries on her movements and freedoms, these represent <span style="font-style:italic">restrictions</span> of the type which a child of her age, station, familial background and relative maturity would have placed upon her. </p>
