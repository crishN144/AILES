This judgment relates to the hearing at which the points I raised in Schedule A to that judgment were considered.  That Schedule, in an amended form, is also attached to this judgment.  The amendments include typographical errors and a bigger change in respect of the test to be applied in making a finding exonerating a person alleged to have inflicted harm.  Schedule A as amended and attached to this judgment should replace Schedule A to my earlier judgment.  This judgment is also given in public.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, in many contexts, a finding that a risk exists can rationally, logically and in accordance with the relevant legal policy be based on a conclusion that that there is a real possibility that an event has occurred in the past (and thus on the facts and reasoning relied on to reach that conclusion taken alone, or together with that conclusion).  This is, for example, recognised in paragraph 13 of the speech of Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N; Re B </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 AC 523" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 AC 523</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 1169" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 1169</ref> and by the conclusions reached by the House of Lords in that case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire County Council v B </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 AC 147" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 AC 147</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 589" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 589</ref>.  Those conclusions are to the effect that where a judge finds a child has suffered significant harm at the hand of his parents, or a child minder, but cannot say which of them is more likely than not to have been the perpetrator, and thus whether either of the parents inflicted the harm, the risk that the harm was caused by either or both of the parents (a) satisfies the statutory threshold in s. 31, and (b) can be taken into account in deciding what care plan should be approved and what order should be made.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.62in"><span style="font-style:italic"> In a case where there is potentially more than one perpetrator a finding exonerating a person of inflicting harm would often have two stages.  The first would identify the pool of possible perpetrators and the second would involve the issue whether the actual perpetrator can be identified from the pool.  At the first stage the test to be applied is the &#8220;real possibility test&#8221;, at the second the test is the &#8220;more likely than not test&#8221;.   As I have indicated (see paragraph 14 of this Schedule), if it can be said that it is not a real possibility that A inflicted harm on B that conclusion would clearly found one that it is more likely than not that A did not do so.  So, at the first stage, a finding excluding a person from the pool, on the basis that there is no real possibility that he or she inflicted the relevant harm is also a finding that exonerates that person.  Following the identification of the pool the court goes on to see whether a finding can be made that it is more likely than not that a person (or persons) within the pool did not inflict the relevant harm.  If it can, any such person is excluded from the pool and exonerated.  When the pool is reduced to two, or always comprised only two, a finding that it is more likely than not that one of them inflicted the relevant harm is the mirror image of a finding that it is more likely than not that the other did not.  So one is found to be the perpetrator and one is exonerated, applying the &#8220;more likely than not test&#8221;.</span></p>

Such a conclusion would exonerate the person accused of inflicting the harm because the finding that the harm was not inflicted would be based on (or alternatively he or she would have satisfied a) higher test than the &#8220;more likely than not test&#8221;.  When, as in this case, such a finding cannot be made and both the allegation and the denial are therefore real possibilities a finding that the harm was inflicted or, its mirror image that it was not and therefore the person accused is exonerated, is based on the more likely than not test.  </span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.62in"><span style="font-style:italic">As I have explained, in my view, an inability to find that it is more likely than not that the alleged inflicted harm occurred does not equate to a finding that it is more likely than not that it did not occur, and vice versa.  To reach a conclusion on a stark choice between two real possibilities that one of them is more likely than not to be correct, the court has to be able (on the evidential approach set out in Re H and R) to penetrate with sufficient clarity, the competing factors and the relevant uncertainties to reach that &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; finding.  Sometimes it will be able to do this and therefore reach a conclusion based on that test that a person inflicted harm, or that the person alleged to have inflicted harm did not do so, and therefore should be exonerated.  Sometimes, as is the position in this case in respect of the allegations of sexual abuse made by R against Mr B, it will not.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.47in">As the allegations have not been proved to the civil (more likely than not) standard and are therefore to be treated as not having happened (see paragraph 10 of Lord Nicholls&#8217; speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O and </span>N), an approach that could be taken is that Mr B should be treated as having told the truth, and R as having lied about the issue whether Mr B sexually abused R.  If this approach was correct the position would be the same as that which follows from a finding that it was more likely than not that the alleged harm was not inflicted by Mr B and therefore that he should be exonerated.  As indicated in paragraph 42 of Schedule A an assessment of risk and outcome on the basis that the alleged abuse is not a fact (because it has not been proved to the civil standard as required by <span style="font-style:italic">Re H &amp; R)</span> is not the same thing as one on the basis that it is a (definite) fact that it did not happen (because it has been established to the civil, or a higher, standard that it did not happen).  In my view correctly, it was not argued before me that this approach should be taken to unproved allegations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.47in">In my judgment the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N </span>that at the welfare stage an unproved allegation can be taken into account as such, and as no more than that, as part of the relevant background (see paragraphs 38 and 41 of Lord Nicholls&#8217; speech) means that, when doing so, the points (a) that the allegation is unproved, and thus, in a case such as this, (b) that its mirror image (i.e. that the alleged harm was not inflicted) has also not been found to the required (more likely than not) standard, can both be taken into account.  In my view the reality that flows from that approach, and which therefore falls to be taken into account, is that there is no finding that establishes whether it is the accuser or the accused who is telling the truth on the issue whether the abuse occurred.  In my view that reality means that it should be accepted that either of them could be telling the truth about those allegations and the court, the local authority and the assessors are not required to proceed on the basis that one of them is telling the truth and the other is lying about the allegations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.47in">I accept that there is some tension between this conclusion and (a) the approach that the existing cases dictate is to be taken to the existence of a risk that can only be founded on the establishment of inflicted harm (which is based on the legal policy set out by Lord Nicholls in paragraph 10 of his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N),</span> and (b) the common ground between the parties that save in this limited context existing authority, and thus that policy, dictate that all must proceed on the basis that Mr B did not sexually abuse R because it has not been proved that it is more likely than not that he did. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.47in">But in my view this tension inevitably flows from the ability to take into account an unproved allegation at the welfare stage as part of the relevant background because in that context the allegation is being considered as an unproved allegation rather than as something that did not happen (per the approach under the legal policy in paragraph 10 of Lord Nicholls&#8217; speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N</span>).  The reality which flows from that, and which can therefore in that limited context be taken into account is, as I have said, that it has not been established who is telling the truth about the allegation, even though for other purposes the event alleged is to be treated as something that did not happen.</p>
