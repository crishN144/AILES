They are the two children of the applicant (&#8220;the father&#8221;), and the respondent (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).   The application is brought under the 1980 Hague Convention On The Civil Aspects Of International Child Abduction (&#8220;the 1980 Hague Convention&#8221;) as incorporated by Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>.  </p>

In late-May, the mother formally sought permission to instruct an &#8220;expert psychiatrist or psychologist&#8221; to advise the court in relation to her mental health; that application was granted by Mr Lock KC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge on 8 June.  It is apparent from the documents before me that Mr Lock was only &#8220;just persuaded&#8221; that the instruction of an expert was indicated in this case.  The father applied for, and was refused, permission to appeal; the father renewed his application to the Court of Appeal, which was on 26 June, similarly refused by Moylan LJ.</p>

He is now 54 years of age, and works for the US Government.  The mother is 40 years of age and is Eritrean by birth; she is a British national and has permanent residency in the USA.  The parties&#8217; families had apparently known each other for some time, but the parties reconnected more recently on an internet site in or about 2013, formed a relationship, and were married in the USA in October 2017.  The parties now live in a suburb of Washington DC.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the mother's case that she remained largely based in London after the marriage, at least until 2019; this is not entirely accepted by the father, who described the mother as based in the USA.  The mother applied for her immigrant visa in 2018; she applied for a Green Card in the USA in 2019.  The mother asserted that her Green Card application was simply so as to give her the freedom to travel easily between the USA and the UK; the father specifically challenges this, asserting that the Green Card is a permanent residency card and that the mother had applied for this because she intended to be permanently resident in the USA.  There is little doubt that the mother was permanently in the USA after December 2019.  The mother gave up her council property in London in 2020.</p>

Thereafter, and again in accordance with the agreed arrangements, the father returned to the USA on 31 January; the parties agreed that the mother would remain in London with the two children until 15 March 2023 in order to be able to spend time with her wider family. On 2nd March 2023, the mother informed the father that she did not wish to return to the USA, and asked him to cancel the return flight. The mother explained that she wished to remain in London so that S could receive speech therapy. Although puzzled by this turn of events and explanation, the father cancelled the flights.</p>

At that time, she told him that she did not like the lifestyle in the USA. She made it clear that she would not return with the children; the father told her that he did not agree to the children remaining in the UK. The parents spoke regularly on the telephone over the following days; the father proposed some form of family mediation to resolve the disagreement, but the mother refused this. It is the father's case that when he told the mother that her decision not to return to the USA was &#8220;wrong&#8221;, she responded by saying &#8220;my life comes first&#8221;.  The mother declined to give the father information about her, or the children's, whereabouts at that time.</p>

As I have earlier mentioned, the case has taken a largely unexceptional course.  The father has had video contact with the girls most days; he travelled to the UK at the beginning of this month, and had direct contact with the girls on three consecutive days between 1-3 July 2023, between 10am &#8211; 5pm.  This contact was &#8216;supported&#8217; by the mother&#8217;s sister.  I was told that the girls were pleased to see their father; the contact took place in the father&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s home.  Although (I am told) S did not apparently eat very much (if at all) during the contacts, Ms Cooper told me that the contact was broadly successful. </p>

As the burden is on her to demonstrate that the exception is made out, she presented her arguments before the father, and I deal with them first.</p>

The mother claims that the father regularly drank to excess, and when drunk he would become threatening and angry. He would demand sexual intercourse whether she consented or not. She claims to have been subjected to physical abuse from the father, who would become angry at the smallest things. She asserts that he would monitor the mother in the home by way of baby monitors. She says that she felt as if she was living in a prison.  She says that she felt stressed and depressed; she claims that she lost weight and suffered hair loss.

In her written evidence (and in discussion with the psychologist) she described the dire political situation there in the 1990s, and her daily experience as a child of conflict, terror, bloodshed, and death.  She described the extreme hardships caused by the conflict, living without electricity, water and/or food for extended periods of time. Her education was significantly disrupted. She recounts that her brother was killed by Ethiopian soldiers, and during her childhood her mother was, for a number of months, incarcerated.  The mother left the country when she was 11 (in 1994) with her older sister, and travelled to London via Addis Ababa; when in this country she was placed in the care of foster parents by the local authority. Her parents remained in Eritrea.</p>

He points to the fact that the war of independence ended in 1991 (when the mother was 8), and described the years from 1991 to 1997 as &#8220;the most peaceful, hopeful and prosperous years in Eritrea before the Ethio-Eritrea border conflict started in 1998&#8221;.  His understanding is that the mother moved to Europe aged 11 in 1994 for a &#8220;better life&#8221; and was taken in by her extended family (not foster carers as such). He observed that when the mother underwent her medical examination for immigration purposes in the USA, she did not then mention any post-traumatic stress or other legacy mental health issues deriving from her childhood. </p>

The &#8216;risk&#8217; has to be focused on the children, and it must be &#8216;grave&#8217;.

But I approach the case by first asking whether <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> they are true, would there be a <span style="color:#000000">grave risk that the children would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation if they were to return to that same situation?</span></p>

No one can now be in any doubt about the deeply damaging impact of domestic abuse on children who are exposed to it (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/3/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref>).  Accordingly, I must consider whether the comprehensive protective measures offered by the father, coupled with the protections of which the mother may be able to avail herself through the US courts, and the supports which may be available from her own wider family in the USA, can mitigate that risk.  In my judgment, the protective measures offered (especially those at D, E, F and G below) do materially, and effectively, diminish the risk, to the point where I find that the risk of harm by domestic abuse &#8211; if it exists at all &#8211; is negligible.</span></p>

It is not possible to know for sure the extent to which she was exposed to the worst of the war of independence in Eritrea which had begun long before she was born (1961), and ended when she was 8 years old, in 1991, but on her case it plainly had an impact on her and her family.  I further proceed (as above, and <span style="font-style:italic">without making findings</span>) on the basis that she has probably suffered a range of domestic abuse in her relationship with the father.  </p>

That said, I accept the expert view that the mother has, on the basis of her own self-reported account, a generalised anxiety disorder associated with symptoms of post traumatic stress and depression, and that she suffers occasional feelings of sadness and discouragement, worrisome thoughts, fatigue, some behavioural apathy, and loss of interest in pleasurable activities.  Although <span style="color:#000000">it matters not whether the mother's anxieties about a return are reasonable or unreasonable, </span>I accept the expert view that the mother does indeed have a &#8220;realistic and reasonably held&#8221; anxiety about returning to the USA.</p>

Materially, the expert considered that the protective measures would indeed &#8220;alleviate&#8221; some of the mother&#8217;s anxieties in the short term; notably, the expert found it difficult to formulate a prognosis regarding the mother&#8217;s mental health if she had to return to the USA on the basis that the protective measures were in place.  This is some distance from the scenario painted by Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> where he considered that if the court concludes that: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned&#8221;.</span></p>

Her statement (see &#167;25 above: &#8220;I feel enormous levels of guilt that I was not able to give her children the life that young children, by rights, should have access to.  It is for that reason that I made the decision to remain in England, <span style="font-style:italic">where I believed my home to still be</span>, with the children&#8221;) is perhaps revealing of her true motives for remaining (italics added).  In any event, I am satisfied that the protective measures are appropriate and more than sufficient to alleviate/reduce to a meaningful extent the anxieties of the mother, giving her measurable independence from the father and access to therapeutic and other support services.  </p>
