	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This is an application made by DM for permission to appeal a decision of His Honour Judge Dancey sitting as a judge in the Court of Protection following a hearing in Bournemouth on 20 December 2017.  On that occasion the judge found that that DM lacked capacity to litigate on his own behalf in proceedings brought by Dorset County Council (&#8220;DCC&#8221;) in May 2016.  By its originating application, DCC sought the appointment of a deputy to manage DM&#8217;s property and affairs on the basis of his apparent inability to do so on his own account. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The judge on that occasion heard evidence from a Special Visitor, Dr Andrew Barker, the author of two reports commissioned pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  Dr Barker gave oral evidence at the hearing on 20 December 2017 and responded to questions put to him by counsel instructed for DCC, by counsel instructed for DM&#8217;s (then) litigation friend, CB, and (with the permission of the judge) by DM himself.   The judge delivered an ex tempore judgment at the conclusion of which he declared himself satisfied that DM lacked capacity to litigate on his own account in the context of these ongoing proceedings because he was suffering from an impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of his mind or brain arising out of a persistent delusional disorder, as diagnosed by Dr Barker.  The judge&#8217;s principal concern, as explained in his judgment, was DM&#8217;s inability to use and weigh information in the context of decision-making.  The judge specifically  identified what he perceived as an incapacity to engage in the overall decision-making process inherent in the litigation in terms of DM&#8217;s lack of ability to see the various aspects of the arguments and to relate the one to the other in a rational and considered manner.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the context of the pending application for permission to appeal, it is important to bear well in mind the nature and scope of the declaration which the court made on 20 December 2017.  This is the single aspect of the court&#8217;s decision which is the subject of the current application for permission to appeal.   <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> empowers the court to make a declaration as to whether or not a person has, or lacks, capacity &#8220;to make decisions on such matters as are described in the declaration&#8221;.  This includes the initial decision as to whether there is a lack of capacity which itself engages the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection.  DM&#8217;s capacity had been identified as an issue from the outset of these proceedings and, on 15 June 2017, His Honour Judge Dancey had made an interim declaration in relation to his lack of capacity.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue before the court on 20 December 2017 was DM&#8217;s ability to conduct the substantive proceedings on his own account (i.e. his litigation capacity).  That was the subject of the declaratory relief granted by the court pursuant to paragraph 1 of its order flowing from the hearing on 20 December 2017.  In relation to the separate (and wider) issue of &#8216;subject matter capacity&#8217; (i.e. DM&#8217;s ability to make decisions about his property and financial affairs), the court made no final determination, recording in paragraph 2 of its order simply that &#8216;there is reason to believe that DM lacks capacity&#8217; in this respect. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The functional impairment which the judge found to exist deprived DM of capacity to conduct the proceedings on his own account. Whilst the judge made it clear that such impairment did not prevent DM from understanding or retaining information relating to both the substance and procedure concerning the litigation, the judge found that his inability to use and weigh information rationally as part of the process continued to engage the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection.  The judge reached no final conclusions about whether or not DM lacked capacity in relation to the specific subject matter of the mainframe proceedings brought by DCC.  In paragraph 38 of his judgment, he specifically reserved that decision as &#8220;a question yet to be determined&#8221;.  Indeed, I am aware that there is a direction as part of the ongoing case management of the substantive proceedings for a fresh <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> report into that very issue and the two substantive questions which will need to be determined in relation to:- </p>

At that point in time, there was no transcript of the judgment and no order.  That was due to no fault of DM whose notice was filed within the prescribed time limits.  An approved transcript became available in February 2018.  Following correspondence with the Court of Protection Office at Bristol Civil Justice Centre, DM wrote on 24 March 2018 indicating that he intended to seek a judicial review of the capacity decision.  That application was dismissed by Mrs Justice Cockerill on 27 April 2018 on the basis that the decision was not susceptible to judicial review in circumstances where (a) a claimant has an adequate alternative remedy; and (b) the application pertained to matters which have not yet been decided (i.e. subject matter capacity). </p>

At that point, there was still no order on the court file.  Having made enquiries directly with His Honour Judge Dancey, it became clear that the parties had been unable to agree and/or had failed to lodge an order (including future case management steps) following the hearing on 20 December 2017.  As a result of those enquiries, an order was eventually drawn and approved by the judge on 23 July 2018.  At that point it was apparent that the case was no further forward in terms of the substantive case management directions which the judge had put in place at the conclusion of the December 2017 hearing, albeit that these had not been reduced to writing at that stage.  This delay was highly regrettable, to say the least.  It will have done nothing to reassure DM about the ability of the legal system to ensure that his Article 6 rights are accorded priority in the context of his present appeal. </p>

Consequent on that decision, I extended an invitation to the Official Solicitor to act in his place.

That hearing took place on 11 February 2019.  DCC was represented by Mr Simon Edwards of counsel who was new to this case.  Ms Emma Stacey, who has acted throughout these proceedings, appeared on the instructions of the Official Solicitor without counsel, albeit that I had a helpful skeleton argument in advance of the hearing from Miss Sophia Roper of counsel.   She was not available for the hearing but has been instructed throughout and represented DM&#8217;s previous litigation friend at the hearing before His Honour Judge Dancey on 20 December 2017.  DM himself attended the hearing on 11 February 2019. </p>

That further assessment also has the potential to influence the determination of the jurisdiction of this court in relation to the substantive issue.  Subject to the outcome of the pending appeal with which I am currently dealing, should the court find that DM has regained litigation capacity and/or that he has capacity in relation to the subject matter of the substantive appeal, this court will have no further role to play in these proceedings. </p>

As Ms Stacey has confirmed, the Official Solicitor does not consider it appropriate to advance a case in relation to the appeal which is contrary to that which DM seeks to put before the court.  That said, she accepts that, on the basis of the evidence which was before the trial judge and on the basis of the reasons which he gave for his decision, she is not in a position to support the appeal despite the obvious conviction with which it is advanced by DM.   </p>

In this instance, as is conceded by Miss Roper and Ms Stacey, there is an imperative to make progress.  This is particularly so in view of the protracted nature of these proceedings, the delay which has already occurred, the need to engage DM in the Court of Protection proceedings and the court&#8217;s obligation to comply with the overriding objective to ensure a case is dealt with justly and at proportionate cost having regard to the principles set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.

I have the transcript of the fourteen-page extempore judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Dancey at the conclusion of the hearing in December 2017.  I am entirely satisfied (i) that I have before me all the material which I need insofar as it is relevant to that determination; and (ii) that DM&#8217;s Article 6 rights in relation to the determination of the preliminary issue of permission are engaged and have been met in terms of his ability to put before the court the arguments he would wish to have considered notwithstanding the position of neutrality which has been adopted by the Official Solicitor. </p>

If he does not have capacity, the law proceeds on the basis that he needs to be protected from harm. Accordingly, in determining an issue as to an individual's capacity, the court must bear in mind that a decision that an individual is incapable of managing his affairs has the effect of removing decision-making from him. The decision is not made lightly: as Kennedy LJ put it in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Masterman- Lister v Brutton</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> [2003] 1WLR 1516, "no court should rush to interfere" (para. 27). This is so even though, if he were declared to be incapable for the purpose of any decision, his advisers could maximise his contribution to that decision-making process by seeking and taking into account his views so far as he was able to express them. It is surely necessary in a democratic society to maximise an individual's contribution in this way, and the law should encourage this to be done. Although no court should rush to interfere with the power of an individual who is competent to make decisions, it must not shirk the duty of intervening where an individual is not so capable and needs to be protected by the law. Finally, it should be noted that the law presumes that a person is competent. Accordingly, the burden lies on those who seek to assert that an individual is not competent to manage his own affairs.&#8221; </span></p>

Well, first of all, so far as the diagnostic test is concerned, I am satisfied that DM is suffering from an impairment or disturbance of the mind or brain, as diagnosed by Dr Barker.

In addition to the written and oral evidence from Dr Barker, the judge was referred to the earlier diagnosis of delusional disorder which had been made by DM&#8217;s own treating psychiatrist, Dr R, between 2013 and 2015.  There was a further report by a locum psychiatrist with the community mental health team, Dr S, prepared in November 2016 which confirmed a similar diagnosis.

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Judge Dancey made his finding in relation to litigation capacity.  None of the experts involved in DM&#8217;s care or assessment doubted his ability to present as an intelligent and articulate individual.  Nonetheless, Dr Barker&#8217;s expert view remained that he suffered from a persistent delusional disorder of moderate severity as recognised by international professional classification standards (paragraph 4.6).  In relation to the specific issue of litigation capacity, Dr Barker confirmed that DM lacked capacity to litigate in these proceedings but that, were the situation to change with regard to his mental health in the future, his capacity could be revisited.  That opinion was confirmed during the course of his oral evidence during the hearing on 20 December 2017.  That was the most up to date medical evidence available to the court and there was no effective challenge to that expert opinion save from DM who told the judge that he did not accept Dr Barker&#8217;s diagnosis. </p>

In reviewing the evidence which had informed his report, Dr Barker made reference to a formal capacity assessment which had been carried out by Dr S in November 2016.  She had concluded that, as at that date he lacked capacity to use and/or weigh relevant information and had longstanding delusions about people conspiring against him.  She recorded the following about a consultation she had with DM on 10 November 2016: </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[DM]said since 2008 his financial status had changed, nd following his divorce in 2005 his life collapsed.  He was put &#8220;on a programme of destructions&#8221;, had to sell his home, pay his wife childrens&#8217; <span style="font-style:italic">[sic] </span>benefit, and is now in excess of &#163;100,000 in maintenance arrears.  He said everything started the day after he was born, which is the date of the death of John Steinbeck.  He believes there are relationships between his daughter and John Steinbeck&#8217;s death, also his brother and John Kennedy&#8217;s assassination, and he also has connections with these through matrixes.  Someone in the media took these facts, they cascaded into a series of events until he was put at risk, and someone needs to kill the story.  He is in the middle of the matrixes and that was the reason he was singled out.  Some used the family as &#8220;divide and rule&#8221;.  The intention was to make him a non-entity, and that also meant no career.  He left his profession once he realised he got into a Catch 22 situation, could no longer trust his employer, and resigned claiming constructive dismissal (2008) &#8230;&#8221;. </p>

He thought there was a trade-off in him agreeing that he was mentally ill and receiving benefits.  His speech was difficult to follow at times, with pressure of speech and explaining his delusions.  His speech was disjointed sometimes, trying to connect various events in a bizarre manner.  He had no insight into his delusions and no insight into how these affect his life.  He said he would dispute everything written about him as he does not believe he has mental health difficulties&#8230;.. He believes the application will help his persecutors to further harm him.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">When DM was re-interviewed by Dr Barker on 8 November 2017 for the purposes of reassessment for the forthcoming capacity hearing, he recorded as part of that interview what DM had told him about a report which he (DM) was writing to challenge the diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder.  That report (then 120 pages long) was to be the basis for his witness statement, a document which was before His Honour Judge Dancey on 20 December 2017.    </p>

He quoted from it at some length in his judgment (paragraph 33) as evidence of &#8220;a very disturbed delusional state of mind&#8221;.  In paragraph 34 of his judgment, he accepts that his quotation from DM&#8217;s written evidence is but a random extract but one which &#8220;illustrates how self evident it is that DM is, on any reading, suffering from delusional disorder and, in a sense, it does not take Dr Barker to tell me that&#8221;. </p>

I am sure that DM will believe that I, too, as an appellate tribunal have failed to understand his points but I select the following as what appear to me to be those he would wish to emphasise in the context of his current application for permission to appeal the judgment of His Honour Judge Dancey: </p>
