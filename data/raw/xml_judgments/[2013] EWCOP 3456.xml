In them, acting by her Litigation Friend and Independent Mental Capacity Advocate, M challenges a Deprivation of Liberty Standard Authorisation that would otherwise remain in effect until February 2014.  That authorisation began soon after M entered a care home in June 2012 and its effect is to prevent her from leaving it.  </p>

He is A, who maintains his own property, where he would stay for a few days a week, spending the rest of the time with M.  A is also a party to the proceedings and supports M&#8217;s application.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is opposed by the Care Commissioning Group (&#8216;CCG&#8217;) that is responsible for providing the services that M undoubtedly requires, whether she is in a care home or in her own home, due to her very substantial medical needs, the most prominent being control of her diabetes.  The CCG relies on the assessment of members of its multi-disciplinary team.  </p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the course of a day and a half I have read the papers which contain statements from no less than 21 witnesses, heard evidence from Dr Leonard, from three witnesses for the CCG, from the Litigation Friend, and from A, as well as submissions from counsel.  I have also read a verbatim note of a meeting that took place last month when the District Judge who had been managing the proceedings visited M in the care home.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My conclusions are these:  Firstly, the question of capacity is not in dispute.  Applying Section 2(1) of the Mental Capacity Act, I find that arising from her medical condition M has an impairment of the functioning of the mind or brain.  It is relatively mild, but in the view of Dr Leonard, which I accept, it crosses the diagnostic threshold.  </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, I find that M lacks capacity to decide where she should live.  This is because a central component in that decision is an appropriate appreciation of the risks arising from the lower level of supervision of her diabetes management that a home placement entails compared with 24-hour professional oversight.  M has an inflexible but mistaken belief that she can manage her own diabetes and consequently cannot weigh up the serious risks involved in a reduction in the level of supervision.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, best interests.  This is in dispute.  There are only two available options; a continuation of the status quo and a return home with a standard care package.  No other alternatives are available.  24-hour medical care at home is prohibitively expensive and would anyhow be rejected by M.  There is no other care home that she would be likely to accept.  A sub-issue arose at a late stage in the proceedings about the availability to M of a new diabetes drug that might improve her protection at home.  On further investigation, the evidence of the specialist nurse, Miss L, established that this is not of relevance to the present decision.  </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying Section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act and accepting the evidence of Dr Leonard, I find that it is in M&#8217;s best interests for her to return home with the benefit of a domiciliary medical and care package consisting of twice daily visits from district nurses to supervise her insulin regime and regular visits each day from care staff.  To give effect to this and to allow the parties to draw up a care plan I will discharge the standard authorisation a month hence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am in no doubt that M was rightly accommodated in the care home in 2012, despite her objections, and that the standard authorisations were rightly granted in the earlier stages.  However, in the past year her physical condition has improved as a result of the care she has received.  Without this a return home could not happen.  The committed support that A will give is also a significant factor. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My message to M is this: I hope that you will be happy when you return home.  If you accept the support you will be getting from district nurses and carers it may be possible for you to stay there.  If you do not accept that support you will probably have to return to a care home.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From the age of 13 M has had Type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes.   She was able to manage that well and lived a normal life at home and at work for many years.  Unfortunately in her forties she began to suffer problems with her eyesight, and at the age of 53 one eye was removed, leaving her with just ten percent vision in the other.  Since 2008 her health problems have multiplied.  She required major surgery in 2009 and later that year she collapsed after what may have been a stroke.  This marked a watershed in her ability to manage independently.  She has become markedly inflexible in the level of support she wishes to accept, insisting on her own assessment of her diabetic management.</p>

She was discharged either home or to a nursing home.  In 2012 there were two further admissions with high blood sugar.  On the second occasion she was discharged to a residential home where she broke a hip.  By April 2012 she was bedbound, incontinent and confused.  In June 2012 she was admitted to the current care home.</p>

I also believe that her relationship with her partner is important to her and her expressed wish not to be separated from her partner would cause her less distress.  However, it has been known that A has asked staff to make excuses for his leaving as her behaviour towards him has been stressful, and when in the home environment this facility may not be as easy.  This could impact upon their relationship.</span></p>

In her views expressed to myself her home is her security as she can be on her own, of which is her preference as she has always been a solitary character.  However, it is this opinion that has impacted upon her diabetes management when being at home in the past.  Her refusal to accept support within her own home has been identified by the district nurses and care agencies.  This could have devastating consequences on her health should she refuse the access to care services and that is highly likely.</span></p>

Her evidence establishes that if there is a default in the insulin supply that M receives there will undoubtedly be a deterioration in her physical health.  The probability is that  this would be picked up, but the length of time that would be available to take action would be limited with the likeliest scenario being a situation that had to be resolved within a certain number of hours or a few days; however the possibility of a more urgent and possibly fatal event cannot be discounted. </p>

He advised that her response following a return could not be predicted.  She might appreciate that she was more likely to stay at home if she cooperated with support services, but this could by no means be guaranteed.  As to the prospects for success, the impression given by Dr Leonard throughout his evidence is that these are guarded, but by no means unattainable.  As to M&#8217;s current quality of life he described it as being significantly adversely affected by her current deprivation of liberty.  He referred to the unsuitable, from M&#8217;s point of view, group of other inhabitants of the home, many of whom are much older and suffering from advanced dementia.  He pointed to her objections about lack of privacy, inability to come and go and alienation from her home environment and her possessions.  It is also the case that a recent occupational therapy report confirms that M&#8217;s needs are not, in that regard, being met.  </p>

There then remains the uncertainty surrounding any particular course of action and that some variables, for example the quality and availability of care staff in the community, along with whether or not they form a positive relationship with M, can be positively influenced but not completely controlled.  In contrast, the nature of her experience and health within residential care from 2012 is more clearly known, nonetheless I have also indicated that I do not think this can be assumed to be a stable situation.&#8221;</span></p>

I am aware of the situation during 2011 and concerns that this pattern of deteriorating health could be repeated, but an acceptance of more limited aims for her diabetic management, emphasis to her of the very limited options for enabling a return home, predetermined arrangements for access, and the improvement in her general health during the past year may represent conditions from which it could be achieved.&#8221;</span></p>

I do consider that so far as practicable she has been permitted and encouraged to participate in these proceedings by means of her litigation friend and IMCA and by the visit of the Judge to her at the care home.  I do not, in evaluating this matter, in any way approach matters out of a desire to bring about M&#8217;s death.  On the contrary, I approach that matter with great caution, accepting the submission on behalf of the CCG that the administration of diabetes in this case might be regarded as life-sustaining treatment as defined in subparagraph 10. </p>

M hates it at the care home; she hates the people, she hates the noise, the impersonality, the lack of privacy and the absence of her own surroundings.  She said this in parting to the District Judge: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I want to be out of here quick or be dead.&#8221;  </span>Whether or not her threats to kill herself represent a real physical threat, they undoubtedly represent an expression of the strength of her feelings.  I place considerable weight on M&#8217;s wishes, bearing in mind that the domain in which she is incapacitated does not extend over all areas of her life.  As Mr Stockwell, on her behalf, put it, the essential justification for the deprivation of liberty is the prevention of DKA.  </p>

This is no fault at all of the home itself, but it is in most ways not a suitable place for her.  What it does offer is the best available quality of care for her diabetes management, but at what cost?  That question is pithily answered by Mr Butler in his position statement in which he says that at the care home there is almost complete certainty of physical safety at the cost of the happiness of M, even if that might somewhat overstate what can be achieved at the home. </p>

They cohabited part time, with each of them feeling happy to keep their own homes.  The impact of group living on M is in consequence more difficult than it would be for many others.  Another of M&#8217;s characteristics is that she has always been a determined person, but since her illness this has developed into a habit of inflexibility.  She is acknowledged to be a particularly difficult person to help.  This is likely to continue wherever she lives. </p>

I accept that there are many uncertainties in a return home, indeed more uncertainties both of a good and a bad kind than in maintenance of the status quo.  Negatively these include a possible deterioration in her physical and mental state as a result of non-cooperation.  The deterioration may be gradual, but might also be sudden, occurring in a matter of a few hours, and may even, though perhaps less likely, be instantly life-threatening.  Any decision that M returns home must accept the real possibility that the attempt will fail and the possibility in the worst case that she may die as a result of a sudden deterioration in her condition.  Like Dr Leonard, I do not however accept the view that failure is inevitable.  </p>

The right to life and the state&#8217;s obligation to protect it is not absolute and the court must surely have regard to the person&#8217;s own assessment of her quality of life.  In M&#8217;s case there is little to be said for a solution that attempts, without any guarantee of success, to preserve for her a daily life without meaning or happiness and which she, with some justification, regards as insupportable. </p>

The visit has therefore had the dual purpose of informing the court of M&#8217;s views and of making M feel connected to the proceedings without putting her into the stressful position of having to come to court in person.  I commend this as an approach that may be of value in other cases of this kind.   </p>
