The application concerns one child (&#8220;L&#8221;) who is now 16 months old.  The Applicant is his father (&#8220;the father&#8221;), the Respondent is his mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purposes of resolving this application, I read the extensive bundle of documents, and heard submissions from counsel. The hearing had to be conducted over a number of short half-days.  On the first half-day (14 November 2022) I heard brief oral evidence from the mother on the sole issue of whether the father had consented to the removal of L from Belgium (see also <span style="font-style:italic">Preliminary Issue</span> below).  For reasons more fully explained in this judgment, following the mother&#8217;s evidence this argument was not pursued.  The focus then switched to the mother&#8217;s contention that there is a grave risk that a return to Belgium would expose L to &#8216;physical and psychological harm&#8217; or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. After the second half-day, and when it became apparent that further evidence was required to be filed on both sides on the issue of protective measures, I adjourned the hearing for a short time to allow the lawyers to obtain the evidence.  A further adjournment (on 23 November) was, regrettably, necessary when that evidence was not, in a timely way, available.</p>

This was all the more important given that within the evidence obtained part-way through the process a letter was filed from the father&#8217;s Belgian lawyer in which she asserted that the mother had, prior to her departure with L, been in Belgium &#8220;illegally&#8221;, an assertion which warranted further investigation given its potential significance to the relief sought (but which, in fact, proved to be wrong).</p>

As indicated above, the mother initially sought to defend the application on the basis that the father had consented to her removing L from Belgium and bringing him to England.  In fact, her oral evidence, taken at its highest, did not support that conclusion (having regard to the dicta in <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re P-J (children)</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2009] EWCA 588 Civ, see especially &#167;48(1), (7), (8), (9): the mother in the end accepting that she could not discharge the burden on her to demonstrate &#8220;clear and unequivocal&#8221; consent) </span>and the point was abandoned. </p>

He is currently living with his own parents. The mother is Slovakian, although she spent most of her childhood living in England; she is also from a Roma family.  The father is 25 years old, and the mother is 20.  Neither parent currently works, and neither has a source of income; they are both reliant on state benefits.  The father has a catering qualification and was a chef when the parties were together; he now hopes to become a taxi driver and is taking steps to advance this career.  The mother is apparently currently undertaking vocational training in the field of hospitality in England.</p>

Both make allegations against the other of abusive behaviour; it is the mother&#8217;s case that the father was often physically and emotionally abusive to her; she alleges controlling behaviour on the part of the father.  She asserts that the corroborative evidence of this (in WhatsApp and other messages) has been wiped from her phone by the father who has hacked into her account.  She alleges that the father suffered with mental ill-health, including paranoia and depression; she describes how he experienced panic attacks both when he was alone and when he was with his family members.   The father asserts that it was the mother who had mental health issues, overlaying a dysfunctional and unhappy upbringing.  I have seen a very short letter from the father&#8217;s doctor which raises no apparent concern about the father&#8217;s current mental health.</p>

There is evidence which has been filed by the mother that the father was physically and emotionally abusive and controlling.  While making no findings, I have little doubt on all that I have read that the relationship was a very unsatisfactory one for both of them.  It may be that it was, as Mr Tidbury argued, a &#8216;doomed&#8217; relationship. Insofar as domestic abuse may have occurred, it seems that both parents were capable of calling the police to intervene in their disputes; although the mother complains that the police were ineffective, it appears that she herself did not follow through with requests for obtaining medical evidence to support her complaints.  The mother has failed, on the evidence before me, to demonstrate that the father suffered materially from mental health difficulties of such an order as put her at risk (or at all).</p>

That is simply one of the proper consequences of a parent unwisely taking the law into his or her own hands rather than seeking relief through the courts. It sits ill in the mouth of a parent who has abducted a child to complain about the consequent risk of arrest and prosecution&#8221;</span>.</p>

On the final day of the hearing, after an adjournment, the mother (through counsel) had possibly changed her tune; Mr Tidbury told me that the mother was now considering not returning with L.  She told me (again through counsel) that when she had earlier given direct evidence of her intention to return with L, should I order his return, she had not really thought that L would be sent back.  The situation had now &#8216;sunk in&#8217;.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Generally</span>: Mr Tidbury has argued in his final submissions that &#8220;it is not easy&#8221; for a mother as young as this in circumstances such as these to contemplate a return to Belgium, a country which she left more than seven months ago.  I am sure that he is right. But that is a far cry from establishing (and the burden is on her in this regard) that there is a risk of psychological or physical harm to L which would be characterised as &#8220;grave&#8221; should I order his return.  The Article 13(b) exception is of very restricted application (see &#167;30(i) above), and although I recognise the inconvenience, the anxiety, and uncertainties for the mother in a return to Belgium, the situation which L will face is not in my judgment close to exposing him to a grave risk of harm.</p>
