On the left a fracture line extended from the fronto-parietal to the occipito-parietal sutures, measuring 14 cm in total.  This fracture line was parallel with the sagittal suture and continued into the fronto-parietal and occipito-parietal sutures.  About two thirds of the way along this fracture line it was crossed by a vertical fracture extending from the sagittal sinus vertically downwards and measuring 14 cm in length.  These fracture lines crossed at right angles, separating the parietal bone into four fragments which were separated by distances of about 1 cm.  On the right-hand side there was a similar long fracture line (13 cm long) from the fronto-parietal to the occipital sutures, again as on the left-hand side running parallel to the sagittal sinus.  About two thirds of the way along was a fracture line at right angles to the first, extending to the sagittal suture and measuring 4.5 cm in length.  This fracture line extended into the occipito-parietal suture, separating the bones into separate fragments.  Further fracture lines extended backwards from the occipito-parietal sutures on each side.  The fracture lines did not extend to the base and the frontal bones were spared.</span></p>

He accepted that a heavy jump from a good distance might explain the changes to the brain and could not rule out the injury being caused to the head in a static position but felt that an injury sustained to the moving head was more likely, consistent with the head being hit against a hard surface once or more than once.   </span></p>

The impact would have to be to the side of the head, with force on the parietal prominence, not on the forehead.  This makes it more likely that if the child was on the floor, he would be on his front, as the face would then be to the side.  If he was on his back the face would be to the front or oblique, and these fractures would not result from pressure on the forehead.  There would not necessarily be visible external injuries.  </span></p>

The scan does not assist with timing, other than showing changes that were recent.  Based on the child&#8217;s clinical state, the visibly increasing head swelling seen by Dr R, and the CT scan, he assessed the injury as occurring within a few hours of the observations.  It depended on whether B&#8217;s condition was constant from the moment of injury, in which case Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s more specific estimate might be right, or declining, in which the period could be longer.  Based on experience, he could not draw conclusions from measurements of heart rate, breathing rate or oxygen saturations, as these are variable and do not pin down the time that had passed since injury.  He said that a neurosurgeon is at least as well placed to advise as a paediatrician.   Overall Mr Richards concluded that the injuries were caused within a few hours of death and after B was last seen as normal. </span></p>

Any proceedings taken in relation to the new baby shall be transferred directly to this court, consolidated with these proceedings and reserved to me if available.   Ms Shepherd will resume her role as Guardian to both two children and will no doubt be appointed to represent the interests of the new baby.  Likewise, I expect the LA will want to ensure that Ms S, who has been present throughout this hearing, continues as social worker for all three children. </span></p>
