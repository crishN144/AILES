All three children have been living with the F&#8217;s brother (their paternal uncle) in Nigeria since July 2019 after they were abducted to that country by F.  The paternal uncle is the second respondent to these applications, having been joined on 29 November 2019.  Although he has been a party for over a year, he has not participated directly in any of the hearings, neither attending nor being represented.  He has, however, filed evidence, and is well aware of this and previous hearings having been fully informed of them by the father and/or by the father's solicitors.  Indeed, for this hearing I received a letter on his behalf from Nigerian lawyers complaining robustly about the courts of this jurisdiction purporting to exercise its powers over the children. It is quite apparent that the paternal uncle has no intention to assist in the return of the children to this country; on the contrary, he firmly opposes that course of action.   </p>

He did not return them, and told M that she would never see the children again.  Shortly afterwards, on 8 October 2019, F caused to be issued in Nigeria a petition for divorce based upon unreasonable behaviour, desertion and two years' separation.  The petition is demonstrably false in parts.  First, it gives M&#8217;s address as being a village in Nigeria where she had not lived since 2011.  Second, it states at paragraph 5 that after November 2016 F (i) lived continuously in Nigeria and (ii) the children lived with him; that is false on both counts.  Third, it states at paragraph 11 that the children have been in the custody of F since 2016.  That too is false.  As found by Lieven J in a fact-finding judgment dated 16 March 2020, to which I shall return, &#8220;There is no possible dispute in this case that the mother was their primary carer before they were removed".   </p>

That is notwithstanding numerous orders for contact that have been made by Judges of this division which have been utterly ignored and flouted by both F and the paternal uncle.  I have no doubt that the deprivation of even speaking to the children has been devastating for M.  I equally have no doubt that the deprivation for the children of speaking to M has been highly damaging to their interests; neither F nor the paternal uncle appear to show any acknowledgment of what seems to me to be a self-evident proposition in the circumstances of this case. </p>

On that occasion F asserted that M had consented to the removal of the children on a permanent basis on 31 July 2019, and that the whole family had planned to relocate from England to Nigeria.  He also asserted that at the time of M's application for a return order, the children were not habitually resident in this country.  Finally, he asserted that Nigeria rather than England is the appropriate forum for issues relating to the children.  As a result, Cobb J stayed various parts of the previous orders, including the return order and the order against the paternal uncle to hand over the children to the maternal aunt, until determination of (i) the habitual residence of the children and (ii) forum conveniens.  At that hearing M was informed by F for the first time of the existence of the Nigerian divorce proceedings. </p>

The letter from the Nigerian lawyers sent on behalf of the paternal uncle, who are the same lawyers instructed by F in the Nigerian proceedings, says nothing about attempts made by F to ensure the return of the children by taking appropriate steps in the Nigerian court.  On the contrary, as I have indicated, the said letter trenchantly objects to the involvement of the English court. If F had instructed his lawyers to take the required steps, they would no doubt have acted on his instructions to do so. Alternatively, he is able to act in person and enter into the appropriate consent order with M&#8217;s Nigerian lawyers. The suggestion that the paternal uncle controls F&#8217;s legal proceedings is not made out. I therefore do not accept that it is beyond his ability to discontinue or amend his Nigerian application as appropriate so as to ensure that there is no obstacle under Nigerian law to a return of the children to this jurisdiction. </p>

Commonly this is found in contractual applications where the parties agree an exclusive jurisdiction for resolving disputes, but one party then brings a claim in a country other than the contractual forum.

		<p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.36in">Under English law the court may restrain a defendant over whom it has personal jurisdiction from instituting or continuing proceedings in a foreign court when it is necessary in the interests of justice to do. (2) It is too narrow to say that such an injunction may be granted only on the grounds of vexation or oppression, but, where a matter is justiciable in England and a foreign court, the party seeking an anti-suit injunction must generally show that proceeding before the foreign court is or would be vexatious or oppressive. (3) The courts have refrained from attempting a comprehensive definition of vexation or oppression, but in order to establish that proceeding in a foreign court is or would be vexatious or oppressive on grounds of forum non conveniens, it is generally necessary to show that (a) England is clearly the more appropriate forum ("the natural forum"), and (b) justice requires that the claimant in the foreign court should be restrained from proceeding there. (4) If the English court considers England to be the natural forum and can see no legitimate personal or juridical advantage in the claimant in the foreign proceedings being allowed to pursue them, it does not automatically follow that an anti-suit injunction should be granted. For that would be to overlook the important restraining influence of considerations of comity. (5) An anti-suit injunction always requires caution because by definition it involves interference with the process or potential process of a foreign court. An injunction to enforce an exclusive jurisdiction clause governed by English law is not regarded as a breach of comity, because it merely requires a party to honour his contract. In other cases, the principle of comity requires the court to recognise that, in deciding questions of weight to be attached to various factors, different judges operating under different legal systems with different legal policies may legitimately arrive at different answers, without occasioning a breach of customary international law or manifest injustice, and that in such circumstances it is not for an English court to arrogate to itself the decision how a foreign court should determine the matter. The stronger the connection of the foreign court with the parties and the subject matter of the dispute, the stronger the argument against<span style="font-size:13.5pt"/>intervention. (6) The prosecution of parallel proceedings in different jurisdictions is undesirable but not necessarily vexatious or oppressive." </p>

The children are wards of court and have been the subject of numerous hearings over 18 months.  Importantly, by earlier judgment Lieven J established the jurisdiction of England and Wales by the habitual residence of the children, and further determined that this country, rather than Nigeria, is the appropriate forum.

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">There are, in my view, clearly appropriate grounds for granting relief. On the finding of Lieven J, F has pursued Nigerian proceedings despite the finding of this court as to forum.  He has rejected the invitation to take steps to withdraw the Nigerian proceedings.  He is clearly taking every step he can to deprive these children of the opportunity to return to England and the primary care of M. He has ignored, or disobeyed, orders made by this court and seeks to hide behind Nigerian proceedings which he has brought on a false premise and contrary to the interests of the children. He is, in my judgment, acting unconscionably and the proceedings in Nigeria in respect of the children are oppressively and vexatiously pursued by him against M. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">I have no hesitation in exercising my discretion in favour of making the order sought.  Given the conduct of F, and given the needs of the children, it is entirely appropriate to make an anti-suit injunction against F.  The children had lived all their lives in England prior to their removal.  This was a wrongful abduction by F. True, there are proceedings ongoing in Nigeria but in circumstances where the court in this country has already (i) decided the children&#8217;s habitual residence to be here, (ii) determined the natural forum to be England and Wales and (iii) recorded its expectation that F should withdraw those proceedings, this point in my judgment carries little weight.  </p>
