	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">This hearing today is a sequel to a hearing which took place before Mr Nicholas Cusworth QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, on 17 February 2021, in which he handed down judgment on 1 March 2021.  His judgment is now publicly reported (with anonymisation) on the BAILLI website under neutral citation <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2021/17" uk:canonical="[2021] EWFC 17" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWFC 17</ref>.

Accordingly, both the children also have dual Russian and Greek citizenship.  The parents were married to each other and have two children.

I say that because, amongst other things, she owns two apartments in Kensington in London which cost in aggregate between &#163;13 and 14 million.  She also owns a substantial house in Siberia.  It is quite clear that the parties have enjoyed a comfortable, or even luxurious, lifestyle.  Their children are privately educated.  They have the service of a nanny and other advantages.  </p>

The father, in his capacities both as father and also as husband, commenced proceedings in England for child arrangements orders and also for an English divorce.  The mother commenced proceedings in Russia for what we would describe as child arrangements orders and also for a Russian divorce.  </p>

There are undertakings in place pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic">Hemain</span> jurisdiction which were intended to &#8220;hold the ring&#8221; and postpone any divorce being granted in Russia until after that hearing. Very recently, however, the wife says that, without, she says, any intervention by her, the Russian court has already granted a divorce which, subject to appeal, will soon become final.  So that is an entangled situation in the background of this case, but it does not impact directly on today.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">At the hearing on 17 February 2021, Mr Cusworth was considering an application advanced by the mother in the children proceedings to the effect that pursuant to Article 13 of the 1996 Hague Convention on the Protection of  Children the English court should abstain from exercising any jurisdiction in deference to prior proceedings in the Russian court.  In fact, by that date, the Russian court had not decided whether or not it did have jurisdiction in relation to these children and, if so, whether it should exercise it. By paragraph 6 of his formal order dated 1 March 2021 Mr Cusworth recorded that:   </p>

So he said at paragraph 55: </p>

As a result, the father has lodged within time an application to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal from the decision and order of 1 March 2021.  That application was only lodged at the beginning of this week and there may be a period of time before the decision of the Court of Appeal on permission is known.  Further, even if permission is refused on paper it would be open to the father to renew his application for permission to an oral hearing. </p>

Neither party was personally present at that hearing, and neither party themselves gave any oral evidence at that hearing.  A number of other witnesses did give oral evidence.  The mother appears to have been very fully represented by a lawyer/s at the hearing.  I am less clear as to the extent of actual representation on behalf of the father at the hearing, but it is absolutely clear from the resulting judgment of the Russian court that that court had, and gave full consideration to, detailed written evidence from the father.  That appears, amongst other places, from pages 12 and 13 of the English translation of the Russian judgment.  </p>

So it is, of course, very recent.  The judgment is, if I may respectfully say so, very thorough, and again and again in the factual narrative within the judgment one sees echoed and repeated exactly the same contentions, both as to the facts and the legal position, that these parents are making within these English proceedings.  The Russian court clearly decided that it does have jurisdiction to make substantive orders in relation to these children; and, indeed, clearly considered that the children are habitually resident in Russia, notwithstanding that they currently attend schools during term time here in England.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">The Russian court also clearly decided that the children should reside with their mother at a place of their mother&#8217;s choosing.  At page 33 of the English translation of their judgment they carefully explain why they are not specifying the address or, for that matter, the country in which the children should reside with their mother, because they wished to leave that in the choice and discretion of the mother.  But the judgment as a whole makes plain that the mother regards her place of residence as being the property which she owns in Russia, and there is no doubt that the mother has made clear that it is her desire that the children should live with her primarily in Russia and not in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">As to the precise status today of that judgment, there is a twist.  The twist is that by virtue of Article 209 of the Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, the decision of a court of first instance only enters into legal force after the expiry of the time period fixed for lodging an appeal.  Further, if an appeal is lodged, then the decision at first instance only enters into legal force after the appeal has been considered.  The very end of the judgment on page 37 of the translation makes express that the decision may be appealed to a higher court &#8220;within one month from the date when the decision in the final form was issued&#8221;.  I am not quite clear whether that means one month from 18 March 2021, when the judgment appears to have been given or handed down, or 23 March 2021, when it appears to have been stamped by the court, but nothing turns on those few days. </p>

Nevertheless, it is, to my mind, a document that requires great respect.  It cannot simply be ignored on the basis that it is not yet of any &#8220;legal force&#8221;.  In my view, indeed, it clearly represents evidence that the Russian court has accepted jurisdiction over these children and, indeed, has made a substantive order in relation to them, albeit that it has not yet entered into legal force. </p>

The twist is that very recently indeed, namely yesterday afternoon, the father&#8217;s solicitors have issued yet another application in a case which is already littered with applications, in which they ask this court to set aside the decision and order of Mr Cusworth of 1 March 2021 on the grounds, in summary, that there has been non-disclosure of a particular Russian court order such that, it is said, the decision of Mr Cusworth was made on a false basis.  The father asks in that application that today I should give appropriate directions for the determination of the set aside application, to include listing it before Mr Cusworth with a time estimate of one day.  </p>

But the legal position today is that that order has not, at the moment, been set aside, either by Mr Cusworth or by the Court of Appeal.  It subsists.  </p>

I am not aware that there is any application to the Court of Appeal to stay that order, and in any event, it is for the Court of Appeal and not me to exercise any such jurisdiction. </p>

I am not prepared to do so today for a number of reasons.  The first is that, in my view, that would be inconsistent with the requirement to abstain from exercising jurisdiction which now bears down on me, unless and until the decision and order of Mr Cusworth is set aside, either by himself or on appeal.  Mr Tyler strongly submits that Article 11 of the 1996 Convention is in play.  That provides that:   </p>

I do not accept that.  If there was simply no contact at all between this child and her father (as was the situation up to 1 March 2021), then I can see that Article 11 might well be in play.  But this child is seeing her father regularly three times a week.  Of course, there is room for consideration of whether those periods should be longer; whether they should include overnights; and whether they require to be supervised.  But the fact is that this child is now regularly seeing her father.  In my view, there is no longer a situation of &#8220;urgency&#8221;, nor any requirement of a &#8220;necessary measure of protection&#8221; for this child, such that Article 11 continues to apply, notwithstanding the application and effect of Article </p>

Provisionally, it seems to me that the allegations made by the mother are such that Practice Direction 12J may require that there is some fact-finding hearing of the mother&#8217;s allegations before the court could make any extensive order as to contact.

I understand how that must seem unfair and, indeed, maybe is unfair to the father, but it is not the effect of the Practice Direction that just because each side is making similar allegations against the other that somehow means that they cancel each other out and contact can simply take place without a due fact-finding exercise.  </p>

Mr Teertha Gupta QC strongly submits that now that the Russian court has delivered its judgment I should formally stay all these English Children Act proceedings as the logical consequence of the decision and ruling of Mr Cusworth.  To my mind, however, there is a distinction between abstaining from exercising a jurisdiction and formally staying the proceedings in question.  I am not myself willing to make a formal stay today when I know that there is a subsisting application to set aside the order of Mr Cusworth of 1 March 2021, and also a subsisting application to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal from that order.  In my view, it would be premature today for me, being of co-equal jurisdiction with Mr Cusworth, to go to the next step of staying these proceedings.

The order goes on to provide that the current solicitors are directed to then hold the children&#8217;s passports to the order of the court until further order.
