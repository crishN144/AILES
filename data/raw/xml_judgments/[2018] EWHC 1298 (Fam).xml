Save on one occasion on 12 December 2016 Ms Root has represented herself since 2011. When asked on 26 February she did not seek an adjournment to secure legal representation. During that hearing she was able to make detailed oral submissions, cross examine witnesses and clearly had a good understanding of the background and the relevant cases. Ms Root&#8217;s position during that hearing, as it has been since 2011, is her strong feelings of injustice that the care orders placing the children away from her care should not have been made. As set out in paragraph 5 below, Ms Root is now represented by Mr Dean who attended court on 15 March.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">Following the hearing before Gwynneth Knowles J on 28 September 2017 the Local Authority issued a committal application on 21 February 2018. That application was listed for directions on 26 February. At that hearing Ms Root was informed about her entitlement to legal representation in relation to that application. The committal application was adjourned until 15 March, so she could secure representation. On 12 March solicitors instructed by Ms Root, Sternberg Reed, sent a copy of an approved statement from Ms Root to the court and the Local Authority and confirmed she would be represented by counsel, Mr Dean. Prior to giving judgment Mr Dean confirmed Ms Root had approved the statement and will sign it. In that statement she raised issues that have already been determined by HHJ Polden in earlier judgments. I raised this with Mr Elliott and Mr Dean prior to giving judgment, Mr Dean took instructions and did not oppose Mr Elliott identifying those matters prior to the court giving this judgment and for this to be included in this judgment. I can summarise the position as follows:</p>

In his judgment on 17 July 2017 HHJ Polden dealt with this issue at paragraphs 38 and 39 of his judgment whereby he rejected similar contentions made by Ms Root then. This issue was not appealed.</p>

It was clear by that stage that some of Ms Root&#8217;s Facebook posting related to Ms Root&#8217;s more recent applications with different case numbers. As a result, the Local Authority sought a further injunction, it was said this was under section 12 AJA. HHJ Lazarus granted the application on the Local Authority undertaking to issue an application, which it did on 7 September. However, there are issues with this order. First, the order states it was made pursuant to s 97(2) Children Act 1989 (CA). Mr Elliott accepted at the hearing before this court that as all the relevant proceedings had concluded by then s 97(2) no longer applied. Second, the order had no penal notice attached. The application issued by the Local Authority is an application issued on C1 form, in the Family Court for an order under s 97(2) CA 1989, rather than an application for an order under s 12 AJA. That application has now been treated as an application under s 12 AJA.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>HHJ Lazarus&#8217;s order directed the next hearing to be listed before a Deputy High Court Judge (DHCJ) and recorded the hearing had been in open court.</p>

Section 97 prohibits the publication of &#8216;material which is intended, or likely, to identify&#8217; the child. But this prohibition comes to an end once the proceedings have been concluded: Clayton v Clayton [2006] EWCA Civ 878, [2006] Fam 83, [2006] 3 WLR 599, [2007] 1 FLR 11, [2007] UKHRR 264. Section 12 does not protect the identity of anyone involved in the proceedings, not even the child: see Re B (A Child) (Disclosure) [2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, para [82], A v Ward [2010] EWHC 16, [2010] 1 FLR 1497, para [79], Re X and Others (Children) (Morgan and Others Intervening) [2011] EWHC 1157 (Fam), [2012] 1 WLR 182, sub nom Re X, Y and Z (Expert Witness) [2011] 2 FLR 1437, para [32].

In exercising this jurisdiction the court must conduct the &#8216;balancing exercise&#8217; described in Re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, [2004] 3 WLR 1129, [2005] 1 FLR 591, [2005] UKHRR 129, and in A Local Authority v W, L, W, T and R (by the Children&#8217;s Guardian) [2005] EWHC 1564 (Fam), [2006] 1 FLR 1. This necessitates what Lord Steyn in Re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication), para [17], called &#8216;an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case&#8217;. There are, typically, a number of competing interests engaged, protected by Arts 6, 8 and 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (the European Convention). I incorporate in this judgment, without further elaboration or quotation, the analyses which I set out in Re B (A Child) (Disclosure) [2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, at para [93], and in Re Webster; Norfolk County Council v Webster and Others [2006] EWHC 2733 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 1146, [2007] EMLR 199, at para [80]. As Lord Steyn pointed out in Re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication), para [25], it is &#8216;necessary to measure the nature of the impact ... on the child&#8217; of what is in prospect. Indeed, the interests of the child, although not paramount, must be a primary consideration, that is, they must be considered first though they can, of course, be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations: ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 WLR 148, [2011] 1 FLR 2170, para [33]. </span></p>

But it is important to note the views expressed in that case by each of my two immediate predecessors as to the likely need for specific orders protecting a child&#8217;s identity beyond the conclusion of the proceedings.

Before considering in detail the three points of justification for interfering with the parents' Art 10 rights advanced by the local authority, it is important to be clear what the information the parents seek to publicise in this case now comprises of. The information comprising the petition consists, essentially, of (a) a statement that the children were the subject of care and placement proceedings, (b) a statement that the parents do not agree with the decision of the court, (c) a statement that they do not think the proceedings were fair, nor the decision evidence based, (d) a statement that they are seeking to try and overturn the decision and (e) statements by a number of people expressing agreement with them, a small number of which statements refer to the children by their forenames notwithstanding the parents agreement to remove the children's names from the front page of the petition. The information in the petition contains no details of the evidence and submissions the court heard during proceedings, no details of the significant harm the court found the children to have suffered and no details of the children's current circumstances, save that two of the children are the subject of a plan for adoption. The mother is referred to by both her forename and surname as the instigator of the petition and, thus, in circumstances where a limited number of responses to the petition mention the children using their forenames, the children are, in places, identifiable as having been the subject of proceedings (a situation that is not prohibited by the terms of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 s 12 (A v Ward </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2010/16.html" title="Link to BAILII version" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic">[2010] 1 FLR 1497</a><span style="font-style:italic">)).

Whilst it is, of course, possible to formulate a number of common-sense assumptions with respect to the potential impact on each of the children of persons accessing the online petition, the reality is that the justifications on which the local authority seeks to rely  for interfering with the parents' right to freedom of expression under Art 8 are poorly evidenced and largely speculative in nature.&#8217;</span></p>

But it is well recognised that it is also instrumentally important. It serves a number of broad objectives. First, it promotes the self-fulfilment of individuals in society. Secondly, in the famous words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market": Abrams v United States (1919) 250 US 616, at 630, per Holmes J (dissenting). Thirdly, freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy. The free flow of information and ideas informs political debate. It is a safety valve: people are more ready to accept decisions that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them. It acts as a brake on the abuse of power by public officials. It facilitates the exposure of errors in the governance and administration of justice of the country." </span></p>

Further, in circumstances where, as the parents do here, a person seeks to petition the State for redress in respect of a personal grievance arising out of alleged actions of the State, it is particularly important that the State should not, without very good reason, be permitted, as it seeks to be permitted here by way of an application for injunctive relief, to restrain that person from petitioning. Indeed, once again, whilst I did not hear detailed submissions on the point, it is arguable that the prohibition on "commitments and prosecutions" with respect to petitions seeking redress contained in the Bill of Rights of 1689 would render such restraint unlawful.</span></p>

Against this, the ability of a parent to make clear who is speaking out or seeking to petition for redress is self-evidently very important, it being very difficult, if not impossible, to effectively protest a contended for injustice or petition for redress of a personal grievance if the protester or the petitioner must remain anonymous and prevented from providing any salient details of their grievance that may breach that anonymity. </span></p>

Applying the ultimate balancing test of proportionality, in my judgment it cannot be said in this case that compelling the parents to take down their online petition directed at Parliament and Government, or compelling them to remove from the petition the mother's name and the responses which utilise the forenames of the children, represents a proportionate response to the risk to the psychological integrity, personal development, development of social relationships and physical and social identity of the children presented by the limited amount of information concerning the children that the petition now contains. &#8216;</span></p>

The evidence in relation to the elder child&#8217;s distress is more obvious than for the younger child but the clear message from both has been consistent during the period of each social worker&#8217;s involvement, that they do not want their personal information published. They wish to get on with their lives with the support that is available. The continued publication of material about them by Ms Root is making that much more difficult for each of them, particularly when some of the material involves deeply personal information about them relating to the court proceedings, their history and their current circumstances. The Local Authority point to the recent postings of videos by Ms Root which contain very personal information about the elder child which has been viewed over 8,000 times and shared over 2,000 times.</p>

To date Ms Root has not proposed or accepted any limit to what she wishes to publish. On the facts this case is different to those such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Southend</span> where there was some limit on the information sought to be published. For example in <span style="font-style:italic">Southend</span> the information in the petition contained no details of the evidence and submissions the court heard during the proceedings, no details of the significant harm the court found the children to have suffered and no details of the children&#8217;s current circumstances, save that two of the children are the subject of a plan for adoption.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The justification for interfering with the Art 10 rights of Ms Root is based on the combined evidence of the social workers who have been allocated to the children, including the elder child&#8217;s letter to the court. I accept their evidence. Each witness was measured in what they said, and all confirmed the distress to children of what Ms Root has continued to do by publishing information about them. Whilst the children expressed their distress in different ways I accept the evidence of Ms Conn, Ms Kemp and Ms Hopper that it mainly relates to what Ms Root is doing relating to publishing this information. It is having an adverse impact on them when they each have the vulnerabilities of being children who have been in care and are now being supported having left care to seek to establish their own independent lives. It is right both children are aware that Ms Root does not agree with the decision reached by the court in 2011 to make a care order, but that knowledge does not undermine the evidence the court has about the distress to them of Ms Root&#8217;s actions. Whilst it could be said on behalf of Ms Root that the fact that information is already in the public domain so what is the need and justification for further injunctive relief it is clear from recent posts the repetition of known facts about an individual, amounts to an unjustified interference with the private life of that person. The recent evidence shows an escalation in what Ms Root has put on line, in particular the videos that have been posted and the number of times they have been viewed, in excess of 8,000 times. The evidence from the social workers demonstrates that the material already in the public domain will continue to cause both the children ongoing embarrassment and emotional harm where that information will remain on the internet in an easily and repeatedly accessible form.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> I am satisfied that there is evidence before the court that both children will suffer embarrassment and emotional harm if no order is made.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is now necessary to consider the Art 8 rights of the children. As a number of cases have made clear (as set out in the <span style="font-style:italic">Southend</span> case at paragraphs 51 and 52) the ambit of the right to respect for private life is wide. As MacDonald J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Southend </span>[53] it encompasses &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">not only the narrow concept of personal freedom from intrusion but also psychological and physical integrity, personal development and the development of social relationships and physical and social identity.&#8217;</span> For the children this includes being able to establish their life as care leavers. The publication of personal and sensitive information, involving private matters concerning family life, is likely to cause upset and emotional harm. As I have said Ms Root has not sought to suggest that the information she has published and that which she wishes to continue to publish should in any way be limited.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the justification for interfering with the children&#8217;s Art 8 right to respect for family life, the discussion of the importance of the Art 10 right of freedom of expression has considered some of the justifications for the interference in the children&#8217;s Art 8 rights. In considering this aspect the court is required to have regard to the importance of the right to freedom from expression generally, as required by s 12 (4) Human Rights Act 1998. Within this context it is important that parents who are subject to public law care proceedings, initiated by the State are able to express their opinions about that intervention, particularly as in this case where it is said it has worked an injustice (whether in fact that intervention has, in fact, worked an injustice or not). The main factor driving the interference with the children&#8217;s Art 8 rights is the fact that Ms Root wishes to identify who she is and the children in connection with the proceedings as to seek to do so anonymously with limited or no information about the salient details severely limits her ability to protest about a contended for injustice.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having carefully considered the parallel analysis of the importance of the rights engaged in this case and the respective justifications for interfering with the respective rights and applying the ultimate test of proportionality I am satisfied the 13 December 2011 injunction should continue, as amended, and should include the case numbers of the subsequent proceedings concerning the children (including these proceedings) so there is one order going forward. In my judgment the order should last until 20<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>November 2023, when the youngest child is 25 years old or further order, and a penal notice must be attached. I have balanced the respective Art 10 and Art 8 rights as set out above and the respective justification for interference with them. This must be considered in the context where Ms Root&#8217;s position is that there should be no limit on what she should publish about the proceedings, including in effect, that which is prohibited by s 12 AJA. Ms Root does not accept any steps that would limit the interference with the children&#8217;s Art 8 rights, whilst still proportionately enabling her to exercise her Art 10 rights. In those circumstances I consider the right and proportionate balance is to make the injunction until November 2023, when the youngest child is 25 years old. This will cover the period when both children are in receipt of leaving care support from the Local Authority. It will enable both children to have the best chance of being able to establish their own independent lives and &#8216;get on with their lives&#8217; as they have repeatedly expressed the wish to do. It leaves open the question of any further application to extend and it also proportionately interferes with Ms Root&#8217;s Art 10 rights by limiting the time. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered Ms Root&#8217;s position, which is to discharge the injunction. As a matter of law this would leave the s 12 AJA statutory restrictions on publication of information relating to the care proceedings in force. An argument in favour of such a course is that by discharging the order it removes the prospect of returning to court regarding any future breaches and may in due course remove much of the conflict created by ongoing proceedings. This position could be more credible in circumstances where there was some prospect of moderation by Ms Root about what she wants to publish, even some confidence that she would comply with the statutory restrictions imposed by s12 AJA would be a promising start. Sadly, there is no sign of that position from what Ms Root has said to date. In those circumstances having regard to the matters set out above I have reached the conclusion the injunction should remain in place until 2023.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning now to the question of the applications for non-molestation orders under the FLA 1996. In relation to the application by the elder child I am satisfied that it should be granted. The evidence filed by the social workers demonstrates a long course of conduct of behaviour by Ms Root that amounts to molestation. The repeated publication of deeply personal and sensitive information on line about the elder child shows no sign of abating. Whilst the injunction will cover information relating to the court proceedings, it does not cover personal information outside the court proceedings. Ms Root has known about this application since August 2017 and has shown little change in her behaviour and if anything, an escalation of it by the posting of the videos on line where she discusses personal information. Leaving to one side any applications for committal for contempt s 42A (1) FLA 1996 makes clear <span class="legaddition5">a person who without reasonable excuse does anything that he is prohibited from doing by a non-molestation order is guilty of an offence</span> and if proved can be imprisoned for up to 12 months or up to 5 years on indictment. In my judgment Ms Root&#8217;s behaviour in relation to the children also risks criminal proceedings for the offence of harassment under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning finally to the reporting restrictions order. The important additional consideration in relation to this order is the Art 10 rights of the press, particularly in the context of committal proceedings where the liberty of the subject is at stake. Both the Committal for Contempt of Court Practice Direction dated 26 March 2015 and the Practice Guidance dated 24 June 2015 emphasise the need for such proceedings to be in open court. In this case all the hearings regarding the committal applications before HHJ Polden were in open court, but a reporting restrictions order was made on 12 December 2016 and each committal hearing thereafter restricting the right to report any information or details about the hearing, save for the notice endorsed by HHJ Polden on 17 July that the committal hearing had taken place involving Ms Root, the breaches that had been proved and a further hearing to consider sentence would take place. On 30 August 2017 a similar order was made at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the notice on that occasion included details of the sentence of 6 months suspended for a period of 12 months. That order was made until 28 September, then further extended by Gwynneth Knowles J until this hearing. The form of order giving details about the committal order was repeated in the Court of Appeal on 22 November 2017, with an addition recording the dismissal of the application by Ms Root for permission to appeal.</p>

I directed the Local Authority to give the press notice that afternoon, which was done and directed the press should be given notice of the date of the judgment when the reporting restriction order would be further considered. That was done on 14 March 2018. The press did not attend on 27 February, Mr Farmer (Press Association) did attend today.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Committal Practice Direction refers only to giving the press notice of any hearing and details of the nature of the proposed derogation from the hearing taking place in public. The requirements of <span class="text">Practice Note &#8216;Applications for Reporting Restriction Orders&#8217; dated 18 March 2005 and Practice Direction 12I Family Procedure Rules 2010 require not only notice to be given but also for the applicant to serve a Part 8 claim, statement in support, draft order and an explanatory note. Whilst that is not specifically required by the Committal Practice Direction my view, subject to any further representations made from the parties, is that must be done. In addition, it is crucial the press must be served with any order made, which does not appear to have happened here. Without that being done how could they be said to know about it? It is concerning that these basic procedural steps have not been done. In addition, prior to the order made by Gwynneth Knowles J there has been no penal notice attached to any order.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Turning to the merits of the order continuing, at least in the interim until the current committal application can be listed to be heard. In balancing the Art 10 rights of the press I recognise the importance of the press being able to report applications to commit for contempt of court as they involve the liberty of the subject and the relevant Practice Direction and Guidance make it very clear this is expected to be the position. The justification for interfering with that right is the fact that there is an order preventing Ms Root publishing any information about the care proceedings. As the alleged breaches that found the application to commit involve consideration of material she has published about those proceedings if that was reported it would risk rendering that injunction meaningless. The Art 10 rights of Ms Root also need to be considered but for the reasons outlined above in relation to the injunction interference in those rights are justified for the same reasons. The Art 8 rights of the children remain as set out in relation to the injunction, as does the analysis of the justification for interference with them. Whilst the Art 10 rights of the press add a further dimension of those rights at this stage and in the absence of further argument it does not significantly change the analysis of the competing rights however the position is far from straightforward. In considering proportionality it is relevant to recognise that the public notice gives some information and, subject to any further representations, the judgments given by HHJ Polden in relation to the findings and sentence within the committal proceedings are required by the relevant practice directions and guidance to be put on Bailli. The difficult issue is whether they should be in their current anonymised form.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Therefore having balanced the competing rights, in particular having regard to s 12(4) HRA, I am satisfied at this stage there should continue to be an order preventing the publication of information that will identify Ms Root as being the subject of committal proceedings other than the information set out in the orders of HHJ Polden dated 17 July and 30 August and the Court of Appeal dated 22 November 2017. This should be on the basis that (1) the Local Authority issue, file and serve on Ms Root and the press by 12 noon 20 March 2018 an application and a statement in support that complies with the 2005 Practice Direction (2) that a reporting restrictions order is made in the conventional form which has a penal notice attached and sets out clearly what has taken place and the press must be given liberty to apply to vary or discharge.</p>
