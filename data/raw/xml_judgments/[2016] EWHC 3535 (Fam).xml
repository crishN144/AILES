As a result, the father remained completely unaware that that application had been made.

It seems to me that the uncommunicated decision which the mother took in her mind in November 1991 not to return the boy on 21 January 1992 could hardly constitute a wrongful retention in November 1991. It was at most an uncommunicated intention to retain him in the future from which she could still have resiled. But on balance I am driven to agree with the judge on the second ground (an application by the grandmother on 19 December 1991 for a prohibited steps order preventing the removal of the child and an interim residence order), which she recognised to be the stronger one, although it seems odd that an otherwise lawful and unconcealed application to the court can constitute a wrongful retention. However, the unusual nature of this act as constituting a wrongful retention appears to me to have some relevance to the question of acquiescence.&#8217;</span></p>

If a parent pursuant to an agreement that a child may live with him for a given period, fears unilateral action by the other parent, it seems to me very hard to suggest that an application to the court designed to protect the presence of the child for an agreed period constitutes an act of wrongful retention. Thus if the mother in the instant case applied for a prohibited steps and residence orders for the sole purpose of protecting the presence of the children within the jurisdiction until 1 September 1993 (the expiry of the 12 month agreed period of retention), I would find it difficult to find that an act of wrongful retention, alternatively, if it was, that the father had not consented to the retention until 1 September 1992 under article 13(a)&#8230;</span></p>

As Mr Turner puts it, she cannot have the benefit of the agreement without the burden. Equally as an issue of fact, it seems to me that the decision which precedes the announcement, even if not communicated to the father, must be capable itself of constituting an act of wrongful retention.&#8217;</span></p>

That &#8216;question&#8217; is set out in the judgment of Baroness Hale at &#167;&#167; 39-40. It is unnecessary for me to set it out. It has no relevance to the issues with which I am concerned. It did not relate to an issue that fell for determination in that case. No doubt it is for that reason that this passage is couched in guarded terms (&#8216;it may well be that&#8217;). Miss Renton accepts that this passage of Lord Hughes&#8217; judgment was obiter. However, leaving those points to one side, this passage raises an interesting question about whether the submission of an application for citizenship in circumstances such as those with which I am concerned can be construed as a unilateral act amounting to a wrongful retention in Convention terms.</span></p>

The solution that both Lord Hughes (at para [78]) and Baroness Hale (at para [40]) had in mind, and seemed to think tenable, involved treating the act of wrongful retention of the child as occurring at an earlier stage than might sometimes be assumed, that is to say as soon as the parent engages in unilateral acts designed to make permanent the child&#8217;s stay in the new country rather than only when the end of the child&#8217;s scheduled stay there arrives. This would prevent a parent from establishing a habitual residence in the country to which he has abducted the child before the act of wrongful retention occurs.&#8217;</span></p>

When asked what she thought the father&#8217;s response would have been had he been asked for his views before submitting the applications, the mother said she thought he would have objected. Her failure to tell the father of her intention to make those applications coupled with her failure to respond to the father&#8217;s repeated request to be informed of the date when the children would be returned to Australia give some support for Miss Renton&#8217;s description of the mother as &#8216;evasive&#8217;. </span></p>

When asked why she had not responded to the father&#8217;s e-mails she replied that she felt that whatever she had said would not have been accepted by the father and would simply have led to more e-mails or, as she put it, to more harassment.

A finding that there was a wrongful retention on some unspecified date in April 2016 is, in my judgment, too imprecise. Second, the evidence that by April the mother had come to the conclusion that she would not be going back is evidence that did not emerge until the mother was being cross-examined by Miss Renton. It was a &#8216;feeling&#8217; that the mother had not conveyed to the father at the time. Once again I come to the conclusion that if there is a &#8216;binding legal principle in relation to &#8220;anticipatory breach&#8221;&#8217;, the evidence does not support a finding that such a breach occurred in or (as the mother put it) &#8216;by&#8217; April 2016.</span></p>
