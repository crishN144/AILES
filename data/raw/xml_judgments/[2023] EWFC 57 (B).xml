It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one. </span></p>

Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see Re S-B at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof. </span></p>

It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) [2009] EWCA Civ 472 at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the 'pool'&#8221;. </span></p>

A is taking the video, and she can be heard laughing and chatting with C. She told me that she had passed B to the father when he collected them from the bus stop, and I was left with no understanding of why she allowed C to drive off. During her evidence, she accepted that she was enjoying the moment with her husband but was critical after the event. Both parents now accept that this was completely unacceptable but there was an air of defensiveness from both of them when making that admission, such that I was left with the impression that they both still struggled to understand why professionals have been so concerned at their behaviour. A said that, in India, where she grew up, this would not be considered to be unusual. </span></p>

A momentary lapse in C&#8217;s concentration, even at a relatively slow speed, may have been fatal for so small a baby. This incident placed B at risk of significant harm.

I infer from his evidence that the photo was intended to show his pride in how far his life had come. I would note that although these photos have a slightly bizarre feel to them, I am not persuaded that they show C holding B in a way that was deliberately harmful or neglectful. There is also a photo in which the father is placing his thumbs in the middle of B&#8217;s cheeks, in which he says that he is rubbing her cheeks. It doesn&#8217;t look very comfortable.

My impression of the mother is that she was willing to allow the father to handle B in a way that she may have known he should not, or at least, with hindsight can see he should not, because of her love for him and her desire for them to be the family that she has always wanted. She was pleased and proud that her partner was taking such &#8216;pleasure&#8217; in their daughter. As a consequence, she has found it very difficult to be critical of him, and there continued to be an element of her evidence that struggled to accept that the father&#8217;s behaviour was poor. For example, both of the parents tried to tell me that there was something about the mother&#8217;s tone of voice during the &#8216;car&#8217; video that indicated that she was disapproving, but that is not what the video shows. The mother is laughing and nothing about her tone is remotely critical. They have subsequently felt the need to say that they reflected on their actions, because that is what is expected of them.

A told me that her husband had never fed their daughter unsupervised (by her) before the night that she was poorly. In truth, B had barely had a bottle feed. Throughout her daughter&#8217;s short life, the mother has always engaged well with medical professionals, and I have formed the view of her that she has been honest when asked questions about her health and development. She was horrified when she was told that her baby had rib fractures by hospital staff. It is inconceivable to my mind that, once A was told about the injuries, and she had been aware that there had been an occasion that B had fallen off a bed, A would not have told the doctors about it immediately. But more than that, had she heard her baby cry out on the night in question, as she would have done had she fallen from a bed, this is a mother who would have jumped out of bed, no matter how ill she was feeling.</span></p>

We simply do not know at what stage bones become more susceptible to fracture, save from the knowledge that we gain from our day to day experience. It is also accepted medical opinion that the bones of children have a degree of elasticity which is not present once a child is fully grown. Everyday accidental falls do not cause rib fractures.

They suggested that simple vitamin D deficiency without radiological or biochemical signs of rickets has not been associated with increased fracture risk in infants and children.  The radiological opinion has not changed i.e. no radiological evidence of rickets, and biochemical changes of insufficient 25OH vitamin D with mild elevation of PTH and alkaline phosphatase was modest has not changed. I have not seen further opinion from Prof Greene. B was not mobile in terms of crawling, cruising or walking. The statement of Dr H simply repeats information from the records.  Therefore I would not wish to change my opinion that although there was a potential risk of bone fragility associated with vitamin D insufficiency, there is no confirmed radiological evidence of rickets which would predispose to fractures. One cannot be more specific in relation to risk of fractures on the basis of current research.&#8221;</span></p>

It was obvious from the mother&#8217;s evidence that she did not want to use formula feed, which she believed increased the chances of B being sick, and that she was determined to breast feed. It was also apparent that she did not enjoy using the breast pump and stopped using it as soon as she could. By the time that she did that, B was gaining weight, although not very quickly. Lots of mothers persevere with breast feeding through thick and thin because they want to do the best that they can for their baby. Feeding a child must involve a degree of personal choice, and I am not persuaded that the care provided by the parents (and specifically the mother) fell below that of a reasonable parent. Had the medical professionals strongly advised bottle feeding, stopping breast-feeding or using formula at certain times, and the parents had objected, they may well have been criticised.
