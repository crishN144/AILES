His parents are married. His mother is a Slovakian national who was born into a Christian family and converted to Islam in the late 1990s. She was born in 1976.</p>

The father speaks French and Arabic. The mother speaks Slovakian and English. They only lived together as husband and wife for a few months (i.e. from October 2000 until the father&#8217;s arrest in early 2001). The parents and A have never lived together as a family, throughout A&#8217;s life the father has been in prison in this country.</p>

An EPO was made on 22 August 2003 and an ICO on 3 September 2003. A has been the subject of an ICO since then. Since August 2003 he has been placed with the same foster carer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It emerged during the hearing that they were introduced by the husband of a Slovakian friend of the mother who had converted to Islam. The evidence was that that friend and her husband live in Slovakia. The mother and this lady had been friends since their schooldays and the father accepted in his oral evidence that it was this friend&#8217;s husband who had introduced him to the mother. That introduction took place in England.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Understandably the mother&#8217;s family were worried concerning her lack of contact with them and these worries naturally increased when they were visited by Interpol who informed them that a woman who was suspected of terrorist involvement and who had been using the mother&#8217;s passport to enter and leave Germany had been arrested.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following a request from the court the Home Office have confirmed that the mother entered the United Kingdom illegally in or around October 2000. The maternal grandmother believes (and this was not disputed during the case) that she entered the United Kingdom using a false Polish passport. The mother claimed asylum in April 2001 but this was refused on 26 November 2001. She appealed against that decision refusing asylum on 12 December 2001 and that appeal was not heard prior to the accession of Slovakia to the EEC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother contacted the maternal grandmother on the day of her religious wedding to the father telling the maternal grandmother  that she was due to be married on that day. Shortly after that the maternal grandmother received a telephone call from one of the mother&#8217;s Muslim friends in Slovakia and was told that the father had sent her a present. The father confirmed in his oral evidence that he had done this and the maternal grandmother collected the present (&#163;400 and a bottle of perfume) by arrangement with a Muslim friend of the mother in Bratislava.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the wedding the mother had regular telephone contact with the maternal grandmother during the period prior to the father&#8217;s arrest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The information received from the Home Office is that the father entered the United Kingdom and claimed asylum in November 2000. The father has not given me a precise date of his entry into the United Kingdom but it was common ground between the parties that he and the mother had undergone a religious ceremony of marriage in October 2000 in this country at the home of Ms EH.  It therefore seems that he arrived here before November 2000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Home Office have informed the court that the father&#8217;s claim for asylum was unsuccessful and that he is currently going through the appeal process. This information was provided by the Home Office in their letter dated 4 December 2003.  This process understandably seems to have taken second place to the issues relating to his imprisonment and the request for his extradition by France.</p>

This is because (a) in the comparison, balance or weighing of Convention rights the court under the ECHR jurisprudence attaches particular importance to the best interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may over-ride those of the parent (see paragraph 117), and (b) often, and indeed here, the Convention rights of the parent will be mirrored in those of the child (e.g. the benefits of a child knowing and either being brought up by or having contact with both his parents) and the rights to family life of a parent and his or her child are a two way process.

Further it seemed to me that the absence of the Secretary of State or any other relevant public decision maker in these proceedings (or any proceedings held at the same time) arose from the decision of the father not to seek judicial review of any decision or failure to make a decision by such a public body in respect of his extradition/imprisonment, or to seek to join such a decision maker as a party to these proceedings.</p>

In doing so I mentioned that a point that might be of relevance was whether the delay on behalf of such decision maker was, or could be, the subject of challenge and I was concerned as to whether it would be appropriate for the court having regard to the investigatory aspect of its role to raise questions as to this when the father had not done so.</p>

For example, that timetable shows that in respect of the process the Secretary of State is awaiting a reply from the father&#8217;s immigration solicitors to a letter dated 11 March 2003. Further, that timetable indicates that the father has not been pressing the Secretary of State for a decision on the question of his extradition.</p>

On 16 February 2001 the French Government sent details to support a provisional warrant and on 16 May a notice of discontinuance was served in respect of the domestic charges against six people of which the father was one.  He was therefore released but immediately re-arrested on the authority of the provisional warrant relating to the extradition request.  The evidence of his solicitor before the Designated District Judge showed that there was at the very least a case to answer in respect of the original English charges.</p>

It follows that although I have accepted and proceeded on the basis that the mother&#8217;s expressed wishes as to that are based on unfounded allegations and assertions they are her consistently expressed wishes and are thus likely to affect her future behaviour.</p>

It is unlikely that the mother would be happy with such contact and it would not accord with her expressed wishes to look after A herself.  In my view it follows that although the mother  has attended regularly at contact since the issue of these proceedings there is a real risk that problems in respect of such contact and knock on problems as to the stability of a placement of A with Ms EH would arise.</p>

An additional question is whether she would go to Slovakia  If she did similar problems could, and in my view would be likely to, arise based on her objections to contact against the background that A&#8217;s home was with his grandmother and thus that the basis of the placement would not be that the mother and A lived with the maternal grandmother. Indeed this is recognised in the final care plan which refers to the mother not wishing A to be placed in Slovakia with her maternal grandmother because it was not planned that she would live in the same house.</p>

A classic example was when he asserted that if A was placed with Ms EH he would fund the travel costs of the maternal grandmother so that she could maintain regular contact with A, but when asked if he would fund that travel so that the maternal grandmother could bring A for contact with the father in England he was not prepared to say that he would.

To my mind that approach of the father is very understandable but he failed to demonstrate any understanding (a) of A&#8217;s need to have a home and stability for his childhood, or (b) that there would be difficulties in the building of as relationship between himself and his son if and when he was released from prison in circumstances that would permit him extensive contact with his son or to look after him in this country or elsewhere, or (c) that A gets very distressed going through the security procedures at Belmarsh and has had nightmares after visiting the father there.  </p>

The second Respondent is aware that the first Respondent no longer wishes to practice Islam and regards this a matter of personal choice as far as the first Respondent is concerned. He does, however, consider that his son should be allowed to take full advantage of his religious and cultural background and that he should not be prevented from living in an Islamic environment during the course of these proceedings. The second Respondent wishes to make it clear that he puts forward this view not out of any desire to contradict the first Respondent&#8217;s viewpoint nor indeed from any religious sentiments he may himself feel but simply because he wishes to ensure that A is able to take full advantage of the support and help which is available from within his own community.</p>

It was also unclear whether the uncle was seeking to advance a different position to that advanced by the father. The indications were, and indeed the understanding of the uncle&#8217;s counsel at that stage was, that the uncle was not seeking to advance a different case to that of the father. Counsel very properly recognised that that was a strong factor against joining the uncle as a party to these proceedings. On the first day of the hearing I adjourned the uncle&#8217;s application and requested him to put in an additional statement and the local authority to provide a chronology relating to their contact with the uncle and the possibility of him being assessed as a carer.

She describes the circumstances of her husband&#8217;s death as follows. Her husband returned home heavily under the influence of alcohol when the maternal grandmother was there with the mother. Her husband started an argument during which he became violent and took a knife from the kitchen which he used to attack her. A struggle ensued which the mother witnessed. The maternal grandmother managed to escape to obtain support from neighbours who called the police. Before the police arrived the father left the family home whilst still under the influence of alcohol and got into his car.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the guardian and the social workers who have assessed the maternal grandmother and her family have naturally had regard to these points. Their assessment of the maternal grandmother and her family is that they are all very impressed with the commitment of the maternal grandmother to giving A a home. Also, as I have mentioned, the maternal grandmother has accepted that A should be brought up as a Muslim boy and neither she (nor any member of her family) have asserted that A&#8217;s Slovakian/Christian heritage should be given priority because, for example, of the changing and uncertain stance of the mother. Additionally, and although the mother has referred to feeling persecuted in Slovakia on the grounds of her religious beliefs, she has not, so far as I am aware, directed that allegation at any member of her family.</p>

Again this is an indisputable fact. The mother speaks Slovakian and English. A is described by the social worker as an English speaking child who has understanding of some Slovakian. This was not disputed.  For example, he reacts appropriately to comments or instructions in Slovakian. If A moves to Slovakia his maternal grandmother has indicated that she would seek to promote his English and enquiries have been made at a local primary school that there are English speaking members of the staff. As I understand it there would be no classes in English but until A&#8217;s Slovakian improves those members of staff would be able to converse with him in English. </p>

The approach of the maternal grandmother has been observed as being very child centred and one in which she is able to anticipate the needs of A and to react to them. In short, all who have observed contact between the maternal grandmother and A have been impressed by her abilities and approach and have concluded that she is someone who will be able to provide A with excellent day to day care.

Indeed she was clearly of the view that it would be likely to be detrimental.  She was of this opinion because she considered that what A desperately needs is close and consistent care from his primary carer and the stability which flows from it and that this would not be available if he was part of a sibling group which would also be a change for him.</p>

However the position is that whilst the father remains in Belmarsh his contact is necessarily limited and would take place in very difficult circumstances. Those difficulties would be likely to increase as A gets older.  Further, if as seemed to become accepted, a placement with Ms EH was to be on a medium to long term basis the purpose of that contact would not be to seek to provide a basis for a move to the father&#8217;s care on his release and thus would probably not be at a frequency that the father emotionally would like. This reduces the force of part of his argument which envisaged regular contact between him and A in prison.  Also such regular contact could well place considerable burdens on Ms EH and therefore cause problems in respect of the stability of the placement of A with her if, as has occurred, A demonstrates distress on visiting the prison and going through the security arrangements.  </p>

That funding for travel is therefore available.

To his credit the father has not questioned this commitment of the maternal grandmother. The guardian and the social workers who have talked to, and assessed, the maternal grandmother are confident that she will perform that commitment. I accept their opinions. I have not qualified the contact order I propose as to a minimum of two contacts per year.  Thus if, for example, A displays distress on visiting the prison I have not given the maternal grandmother a discretion to end such contact on that basis.  If he does display such distress this might found a variation of my order by agreement or the court. I considered leaving the number of contacts entirely to the discretion of the maternal grandmother but have concluded that the minimum of two visits a year should be included in the order to provide that framework and starting point.</p>

However I accept, as has the maternal grandmother, that given the mother&#8217;s conversion to Islam, her marriage and her choice of lifestyle at the time he was born A was born into a Muslim household and lived in an Islamic community.  This reflected the choice and wishes of his parents at that time and notwithstanding the conflicting assertions of the mother since, the maternal family have accepted that A should be brought up as a boy born to a Muslim family and as a Muslim. It follows in my view that if the argument was between whether A should be brought up in a Muslim household and community or in his maternal grandmother&#8217;s household and community the answer now would clearly be that he should be brought up in a Muslim household and community that also sought to promote his Slovakian heritage.</p>

As with other submissions made on behalf of the father this was made in general terms.  For example it was not asserted what in particular should be ascertained relating to the availability of an Imam, or teacher, or concerning other aspects of A&#8217;s religious upbringing.  As to that I repeat that the father has some knowledge of, or access to knowledge of, the position in Bratislava from the couple who introduced him to his wife.  However I accept that the maternal grandmother and the local authority could have made further investigations in respect of such matters.

So for example a public law order would not have been necessary to give the local authority parental responsibility or to assist or oversee contact or the care given by the maternal grandmother. A supervision order would have been more likely but in my view on the assessment of the maternal grandmother unnecessary. Secondly I accept that in practical terms the making of a care or supervision order would not have added any realistic ability of the local authority to themselves check that things were going well in Slovakia and to implement a back up plan. The practical reality is that at reviews they would have been reporting back views of the maternal family unless a public authority in Slovakia was taking an active role in the life of the family.  </p>

None was suggested.  A possibility might be that such an order would enable the local authority to report back the views of a public body in Slovakia but it seems to me that the  assessment of the maternal grandmother warrants the placing of responsibility on her to keep the father aware of relevant developments. </p>
