He then sought to justify the filing of the skeleton as rendering him less likely therefore to need to &#8216;prod&#8217; either counsel in the hearing. He was clearly seeking to go significantly further on this client&#8217;s behalf than Mostyn J had intended when dismissing his application for party status. Mr Thorpe and his solicitor have been present throughout the hearing, intervening only occasionally, and not then inappropriately. However, the cost to the company of their intervention has been &#163;54,163.60. In the event, now that the specific facts relevant to my determination of the issues involving the company have been found, I doubt very much whether those costs have been worthwhile.</span></p>

As indicated, the parties began their cohabitation in 1990, the year before H, a systems analyst by training, and the 2 other shareholders, first set up their enterprise which was initially called X Ltd. In 1992, the name was changed to XYZ Ltd, which was shortened to Z Ltd in 2008. H in his statement dated 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> October 2014 describes the primary function of the company at its inception to have been to develop insurance administration systems, and explains how the company gradually expanded its client base. In 1995, following an idea from H, Z Ltd developed what he describes as &#8216;the very first website on which you could buy a motor insurance policy in real time&#8217;. This appears to have been the pattern for the company. H was the ideas man, who came up with a concept, proved that it worked, and then passed it over to his fellow shareholders who were the developers. He said: &#8216;I believed we would be successful working together and I was right&#8217;.</span></p>

She ceased working after the elder child was born in the summer of 1998, and did not in the event return to work until after the parties&#8217; separation, over Christmas/new year of 2006/7. When the parties separated, initially H moved out of the family home, a well-appointed 5 bedroom house in a town in south east England, leaving W there with the 2 children, then aged 8 and 5. He went to live in a 2 bedroom flat owned by his father. In April 2008, W returned to work as a school receptionist where she has stayed, earning now just over &#163;1,000pcm net in that employment.</span></p>

Firstly, the events which unfolded in 2009, whereby W and the children moved from the former family home at number 12 C Road, and into the much smaller, if still well appointed, 3 bedroom house at number 21, a few hundred metres away; and H moved back into the larger property at no. 12. Secondly, how, from about 2010, the progress of Z Ltd increased rapidly on the back of H&#8217;s creating of a specific product for the insurance industry, and the impact that that progress has on W&#8217;s entitlement. And thirdly, why, following both of these developments, W took no steps to pursue her claim for financial provision against H until he himself issued a Form A in December 2013, over 2 years after her original petition.</span></p>

The first is that the law should be certain and predictable in its results. This objective is not only consistent with the popular concept of justice; it also means that it is easier for lawyers to advise their clients on the likely outcome of a dispute, so promoting the conclusion of reasonable settlements and minimising recourse to contested trials. The second objective is that the law should achieve justice and fairness between the parties; and it is said that this necessarily involves considerable flexibility of approach by reason of the widely varying facts of each case."</span></p>

There is no question of her entitlement to any element of post-separation accrual being triggered by a 'needs' argument but I take the view that, notwithstanding the exponential increase in the growth of the Fund post-separation, its genesis as a matrimonial asset is a factor of considerable significance. That factor must, in my view, find its reflection in the overall quantum of the financial award she will receive at the conclusion of these proceedings.

It will be apparent from what I have written above that I do not agree with this approach as it risks the criticisms of being a lawless science and an unreasoned expression of instinct and intuition. To my mind the preferable approach where there is a significant amount of active post-separation growth of a matrimonial asset is first to determine the share of the pool in the absence of that growth (usually an equal share) and then to determine the share of the growth (usually an unequal share). </span></p>

But how to bridge the significant gap that still exists between their two positions? Firstly, I must assess the evidence that I have heard. Mr Dodge, in his characteristically concise but robust reports as SJE, values the equity value of Z Ltd. at between &#163;11.75m and &#163;13.4m, and H&#8217;s shareholding at between &#163;7.4m and &#163;8.5m net of tax. He values the surplus cash of the business as being in the region of &#163;2m., calculating that were that amount to be extracted by way of dividend, H&#8217;s post tax distribution would be in the region of &#163;972,000. He notes that H&#8217;s gross salary has been and is forecast to continue to be slightly in excess of &#163;200,000pa, but that his additional dividends have been sharply reduced, in circumstances which I will consider below, since the payment of a significant figure in the year to February 2011. Since then Z Ltd has retained profits of &#163;1.52m, and its cash reserves have increased by &#163;1m. He was clear that further dividends could have been declared should the directors have wished to do so, whether from historic reserves or the further retained profits. He acknowledged that dividend payments required the consent of all directors.</span></p>

This was a course adopted after an unsuccessful takeover attempt by venture capitalists in 2011 had foundered because such investment had essentially been lacking. The growth in staff numbers in the years since then reflects that strategy. They were all clear that the company needed significant cash reserves (1) to make it more attractive for eventual sale, and (2) to guard against the risk that they might lose a lucrative contract and run into unforeseen cash flow issues. Both of the latter two witnesses, who between them share 30% of the company, were clear that the refusal to take dividends over recent years was in pursuit of that strategy, and that they would be unhappy to be compelled by the fact of the majority shareholder&#8217;s divorce, if that strategy should be compromised to their financial disadvantage. Faced, as they were, with the extreme position advocated for W at the outset of the hearing, it was unsurprising that they should on the company&#8217;s behalf indicate their firm opposition to that course.</span></p>

At various times H had borrowed further against that mortgage facility to provide additional capital for his business but appears then to have repaid those sums when the business had the cash available. He having vacated the property at the start of 2007, W says that H asked her not to commence divorce proceedings, for the children&#8217;s sake. She also says that H then told her that Z Ltd was then not in a strong position, and that if he had to give her 50% of the company, the company would not survive. He told her, she said, that it would be to her financial benefit to wait until the business was worth more. Given subsequent events, I accept this evidence.</span></p>

It is accepted that she identified 21 C Road, a smaller house in the same complex, as a suitable alternative, as moving there would allow the children to stay in a familiar environment after the move. She says that she understood that H was to move back into No. 12 only to redecorate it with a view to sale. She says that she would not have accepted the move to a much smaller property if she had known that H would move back to their former home significantly upgrade it and make no attempt to sell the property. No. 21 was bought for &#163;485,000 in March 2009, with a mortgage of &#163;408,623.</span></p>

He says that W positively wished to downsize following their separation, and further he points out that the current arrangement has suited the children very well as they have both of their parents very close by and able to see each of them virtually every day. It is also the case that W has continued to accept this arrangement now for the last 6 years; and as recently as January 2014, in her Form E, she was not expressing a housing aspiration at a greater level than the value of her current home. Indeed, she accepted in evidence that she could buy a larger property for the same value as her current home, if she was prepared to move from the complex.</span></p>

W says that he &#8216;got irritated&#8217; when she said that she wanted to take advice. I have to say that I do broadly accept her evidence about this, and the picture that she paints about the reasons why (a) she moved out of the family home and into the much smaller property next door, and (b) she did not initiate any divorce or financial proceedings over this period. Consequently, I reject H&#8217;s case in that regard. However, the fact that she did settle into her new home, without any greater level of income provision from H, is another circumstance to which I must have regard.</span></p>

The offer which he made to her then was that she could retain her house, without mortgage (&#163;500,000), and receive a further &#163;2.03m. for herself, plus &#163;156,000 in child support. H was to be left with a little under &#163;7m. This suggests very clearly that certainly at this time, he did consider that he was trading with W&#8217;s &#8216;unascertained share&#8217;, and confirms her account that he had asked her not to take proceedings earlier so that he could grow the business first to their mutual advantage. In fact, the negotiations with the prospective buyers failed as they began to drop their price and H took the view that in due course he could do better.</span></p>

H in his statement gives a full and I accept accurate account of how he saw, first in 2010, that the insurance market was struggling to get control of its pricing, and that insurers needed to host and manipulate their rating algorithms centrally. He consequently developed what he describes as a &#8216;unique and highly sophisticated piece of software&#8217; which processes quotes at what he describes as phenomenal speed. He describes in some detail how the existence of this solution has lifted the company from bit part to major player in their industry. In his statement he suggests that it only since 2012 that the nature of the company and its business has really changed, as a result of their deployment of the product in the market-place. In his oral evidence he accepted that it was after the failed negotiations with AB Group that he and his fellow shareholders really began to reshape and redirect the company&#8217;s efforts. Had the sale progressed, the Solution would have been the prize asset acquired.</span></p>

H&#8217;s offer to W in October 2011 indicates that whilst he has viewed her interest from then as being worth a lot less than an equal share, he was certainly aware that it was significant and subsisting. He goes on to describe how the management structure of the business has been reshaped from 2012, and it is significant that when the Finance Director Mr W was appointed in 2012, it was with a view to sale within 3-5 years. Mr W told me, and I accept, that the timescales have lengthened somewhat, such that there may now be another 4 years before the market conditions favour a sale, but that remains very much the company&#8217;s intended direction, as I find.</span></p>

However, by his belated offer of a 10% stake in the value of H&#8217;s shareholding, he has latterly acknowledged what I would otherwise have been driven to find, which is that he has always treated his shareholding, which remains that which he held in 2007, as a matrimonial asset, and whilst his later endeavour undoubtedly will reduce significantly the extent to which it will be shared, W must still retain some valuable entitlement. </span></p>

The amount of such provision has been very significantly reduced by the policy which he and his fellow shareholders have adopted of regularly reinvesting the profits of the business into research and development projects. In other words, rather than passing on to W some share of her interest, the majority of it has, along with H&#8217;s entitlement, been reinvested with a view to maximising future profit. Indeed, the principled objections of the other shareholders to the release now of any dividend to enable H to make a payment to W are made on the basis that they do not wish their investments yet to be realised before they have matured at the point of sale. W&#8217;s investment must be treated, to a significant extent, in the same way &#8211; as being retained in the business. </span></p>

Contrary to Mr Lyon&#8217;s suggestion, however, I credit that as a payment made in the last 9 months and during these proceedings, and as a payment made towards the current value of W&#8217;s entitlement, as I determine it to be, rather than as part of the payment made in 2009, when no doubt the value of H&#8217;s Z shares would have been less (and probably not much different from that on separation in 2006/7).</span></p>

This is 5% less than the amount contended for by W&#8217;s counsel in closing, and 10% more than the amount offered by H. W&#8217;s share is worth &#163;1.59m, and whilst this increases the value of her 2007 entitlement by more than the general share or prices indices, that it does so is appropriate having regard to the value to H of having the those shares at his disposal, and to the 2011 offer which he made. The fact that that offer was made at a time when his shares were valued more highly than they are now is reflected in the fact that the value W is to receive at this current time is less than what was then offered.

She should prima facie have 50% of the combined joint pension pot, which would have required a pension credit to her with a present estimated value of &#163;161,382. If she is also to retain an interest in 20% of the value in H&#8217;s Z Ltd. shareholding, as I have explained above, then she would require a further lump sum from H in the sum of &#163;57,000 to achieve her 50% entitlement. However, this receipt alone may cause her a short term liquidity issue, in that her resultant liquid capital would not enable her to discharge at once her current liabilities (&#163;77,139).</span></p>

I find that this is a lump sum which H can pay from his own personally held investments at this time without the need to declare any further dividends from the company, or attempt to persuade the other shareholders to alter the company&#8217;s chosen course.

Taking first her capital case, I have already provided for a sum to meet her current liabilities by the adjustment I made at paragraph 46 above.  I do not accept that she needs to, nor should be able to require the funding to move into a significantly more expensive property. Although I have found that she did not expect H to move back into the family home when she vacated it, she has now been in her current property since 2009, and accepted that she could in due course buy a bigger house for the same money, once the location was no longer so important for the children. Had the house really been unsuitable, she could have raised the point before purchase, but chose not to. I do not therefore find that her needs require the release to her now of an additional capital sum for re-housing.</span></p>

If the household repair items then treated as capital are added to her original budget this moves to &#163;46,838pa. This is the true disparity between the two presentations, and she frankly accepted in her evidence that the higher of these figures was predicated upon her living in the larger property which I have found is not commensurate with her needs at this stage, given the time that she has been living with the children in her current home. Until the sale of Z Ltd leads to her receipt of the balance of her sharing entitlement, I find that her income needs can fairly be met in the sum of &#163;48,000pa, taking a broad view of the items in her original budget, their suggested increase, and a sensible amount for the repairs. W will also have had the benefit of the additional lump sum referred to above, which will enable to discharge her current indebtedness.</span></p>

He also allows as much as &#163;24,000pa for depreciation in relation to his car collection, so I am satisfied that factoring in this and other easily achieved economies, he can afford the order for periodical payments which I propose to make to cover the interim period.</span></p>

He will also discharge the school fees for the one further year that these have left to run. This will not require him to seek to amend Z Ltd&#8217;s remuneration policy to the detriment of the other shareholders in any way pending completion of that sale.

I have formed the view that if he does so, which he must be at liberty to do for the benefit of the company, this should not require a recalibration of W&#8217;s entitlement, provided that the dilution affects no more than 10% of the current holding &#8211; ie. provided that H&#8217;s residual entitlement is not less than 63% of the company&#8217;s shares. Should that course be taken, I am satisfied that it will be done only in the best interests of the company, and so in the best interests of H&#8217;s and so W&#8217;s financial stake in that company. Should a larger proportion be taken, then W&#8217;s entitlement should be recalibrated such that her entitlement is equivalent to not less than 12.6% of the whole.</span></p>

If for whatever reason that does not happen, and, as a result of a different strategy being taken by the shareholders more liquidity within the company is potentially available, it may become appropriate to review the timing of the payment to W of her entitlement, which I envisage will be in the form of lump sums as set out in W&#8217;s &#8216;revised proposal&#8217; document.
