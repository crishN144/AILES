I remain of the opinion that the energy and costs already invested by the parties suggest that this is going to be hard fought litigation.  This also gives an insight into one of the frequent consequences of information having been irregularly obtained, namely to inflame the litigation process.</span></p>

The premises and the computer system belong directly or indirectly to the wife&#8217;s brother or brothers.  The estimated volume of the material taken from the husband&#8217;s computer files is between 250,000 pages and 2&#189; million pages.  These estimates were given in proceedings in the Queen's Bench Division between the husband and the wife&#8217;s brothers and others, which I will return to later in this judgment.  The wife received part of this material and this is now contained in seven lever arch files being held by the wife&#8217;s legal representatives in these proceedings (&#8220;the seven files&#8221;).  It is this latter material which forms the focus of this application.  It appears that the documents in these files had been seen and read by a number of solicitors at Withers and one or two junior counsel instructed by them, although the precise extent to which each of them has done so is not clear.  </span></p>

There may be something of an irony about this argument &#8230; in circumstances where there is no way that any of the Defendants could have obtained access to the Claimant&#8217;s material by means of a court order.  As Mr. White pointed out, court orders are available in appropriate circumstances for the preservation of evidence, and sometimes the carrying out of a search.  That being so, it is hard to see how any infringement of the claimant&#8217;s Article 8 rights could be categorised as proportionate or necessary when no such steps have been taken on behalf of his wife.  As a matter of fact, such orders are far from common and would only be made as a matter of last resort on the basis of strong evidence that a spouse has failed to give truthful disclosure.&#8221;</span></p>

He makes this submission on the basis that Coleridge J. was told that the terms of the order being sought from him were &#8220;in very similar terms&#8221; to the order made by Cox J.  This is a serious allegation.  I do not consider that Coleridge J. was misled.

He submits that this would significantly undermine the very issue being determined at that hearing, namely whether the wife can make any use at all of the material or whether the documents should be returned without any use being made of them either at that hearing or subsequently.  He argues that there is, or should be, a clear line to the effect that no party can make use of improperly obtained material.&#8221;</span></p>

He accepts &#8230; that a party is entitled to assert privilege, but appears to be submitting that the other party&#8217;s legal representatives are themselves to look at the documents to see whether privilege is proper claimed.  This seems to me a rather startling proposition.  Nevertheless, Mr.&#160;Turner submits &#8230; that the wife&#8217;s legal representatives should be able to go through all of the documents to be able to argue whether they are (a) relevant; and (b) privileged.  He submits that all members of the wife&#8217;s legal team should be able to look at the documents for the purposes of conducting the defence of the application to be determined in October.  He asks why the proviso which was considered to be appropriate for the defence in the Queen's Bench Division proceedings should not also be considered to be appropriate for him and the wife, or for the wife in the Family Division proceedings.  So, he submits, that to be able properly to argue all the issues which will arise for determination at the October hearing, the wife&#8217;s legal representatives need to be able to use the documents and the information contained within the seven files.&#8221;</span></p>

The effect of the guidance given in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Hildebrand</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">T v.

The practical consequences are well understood and, in my experience, invariably complied with (including in respect of information held in electronic form), although there is sometimes debate as to how the guidance applies to the new ancillary relief procedure.  For example, does the guidance require disclosure of the irregularly obtained information prior to the delivery of the questionnaire and, in particular, prior to service of forms E or not?  A conventional method of meeting this uncertainty, as occurred in this case, is for a specific request for the disclosure of all </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Hildebrand</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> documents to be made at the outset of proceedings.  As Wilson LJ comments in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">White v. Withers</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, FPR r.2.61B(6) might appear to conflict with this practice, although I doubt whether this factual situation was in the mind of the drafters of this provision.  </span></p>

I have already referred to the fact that it invariably inflames the litigation process.  It is seen as creating an uneven litigation process if, as is usually the case, only one party is circumventing the normal rules of procedure &#8211; they are, after all, procedural rules not merely guidelines.  &#8220;Why [a party will ask] must I act in accordance with the rules when the other party seems to be free to ignore not only the court&#8217;s own rules but even commit a crime in order to access my personal information?&#8221;  Of course, the extent to which a party can protest in this way will inevitably be in direct correlation with the extent to which the irregularly obtained information demonstrates that they have not been complying with their obligation to give full and frank disclosure.  Further, such crimes do not necessarily go unpunished, albeit that this is a very, very rare occurrence.  </span></p>

This constitutes, he submits, a breach of the other party&#8217;s rights under article 8 and a breach of their right to a fair trial.  The former because it is an unregulated and wrongful interference with their private life and the correspondence.  The latter because it distorts the legal process as one party has obtained an unfair advantage and has thereby ensured that the parties are not on an equal footing.  The husband&#8217;s article 6 rights are also engaged and are protected, he submits, by adherence to the court&#8217;s own procedures, which are consistent with the overriding objective.  </span></p>

It is to be deprecated not least because it overrides the rights of the victim, subverts the proper processes of disclosure, and provides the self-helper with advantages which could not have been obtained if they had followed legitimate procedures.  If one party&#8217;s information is irregularly obtained it will invariably, if not inevitably, be obtained in breach of that party&#8217;s article 8 rights and this cannot, he submits, be justified by reference to the other party&#8217;s article 6 rights.  Mr.&#160;Howard relies extensively on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">L v. L</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, to which I will refer later in this judgment.</span></p>

Appropriate remedies are available through the court and it is these, he submits, which provide the sole recourse available to the wife.  If there are proper grounds for concern, orders can be sought from the court through the Family Proceedings Rules or by means of a preservation order or an Anton Piller</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt"/><span style="font-size:14pt">order.  These are legitimate routes, with appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with article 8, by which information or documents can be obtained from or relating to another party.  No application was made in this case for any such order.  In any event he submits, there existed no or no sufficient grounds which would have justified the exercise by the court of its powers to make such orders, and accordingly there existed no justification for the husband&#8217;s rights being overridden by a unilateral act by or on behalf of the wife.  There was, he submits, simply no justification for interfering with the husband&#8217;s article 8 rights in the manner which has occurred in this case.  </span></p>

His rights to a fair trial are assured by adherence to these proper procedures and, as a consequence, to the overriding objective to deal with cases justly, including by ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are on an equal footing.  He relies on the Family Proceedings Rules as providing the mechanism by which disclosure is properly regulated so that it is proportionate to the issues in the case and in accordance with the overriding objective.  Not to make the orders he seeks will, Mr.&#160;Howard submits, give the wife an illegitimate litigation advantage as she will have available to her information which she could not legitimately have obtained.  At the time the husband&#8217;s information was taken she was not entitled to disclosure.  She can in due course request further information and documents, but he submits it is inconceivable that disclosure would be ordered of privileged material or to the extent contained in the seven files, much of which Mr.&#160;Howard submits is irrelevant.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The only potential justification on which the wife can rely, so as to entitle her to retain and use the information, is her right to obtain justice, i.e. to give effect to her article 6 rights.  However, Mr.&#160;Howard submits, these rights do not justify the retention and/or use of the information at this stage.  By denying the wife the right to retain or use the information the wife&#8217;s right to a fair trial is not thereby prejudiced or undermined.  The court&#8217;s own procedures and powers strike the right balance between the parties&#8217; respective rights and obligations.  It is not for one party to make up their own rules and thereby gain an illicit advantage and avoid &#8220;vetting&#8221; by the court.</span></p>

The relevant parts of the material will be disclosed by the husband, through his solicitors, in due course.  The husband also, as I have indicated, agrees to the preservation of the seven files pending the determination of the wife&#8217;s ancillary relief claims so that the wife can apply for further disclosure, if justified.  As the wife&#8217;s rights to a fair trial will thereby be appropriately protected, there is nothing to balance against the breach of the husband&#8217;s rights and interests.  She cannot therefore use her article 6 rights as justification for breaching the husband&#8217;s article 8 rights and/or his article 6 rights.  There is frankly, Mr.&#160;Howard submits, nothing to put in the balance on the wife&#8217;s side against the husband&#8217;s rights, and there is accordingly no conflict at all between the legitimate interests of both parties.</span></p>

It is well established, he submits, that the courts will restrain the use of and order delivery up of material subject to legal professional privilege which has been improperly or surreptitiously obtained.

As a matter of practical reality, Mr.&#160;Howard submits that neither the wife nor Withers nor any third party lawyer, without knowledge of the purposes for which the documents in the seven files were created, would have all the information necessary to determine what is privileged and what is not.

Information supplied under compulsion in legal proceedings cannot, as a general rule, be used for any other purpose.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule.  This submission was not the focus of much discussion during the course of the hearing.  The material was used by the husband only for the purposes of the Queen's Bench Division proceedings.  Whilst it may be correct that an application should have been made by the husband, I do not consider that the husband&#8217;s use of this information in this way should have any effect on the issues I have to determine.  </span></p>

Mr.&#160;Turner relies in particular on Eady J&#8217;s judgment and the transcript of the telephone conversation.  I have already dealt with the husband&#8217;s case before Eady J.  As to the transcript, during the course of this conversation the husband does indeed appear to say that he is happy for the information to be left with Withers and for it to be used in the matrimonial proceedings.  I do not, however, consider that when viewed overall the passages on which Mr.&#160;Turner relies bear the weight he sought to put on them.  They are part of a general discussion in which a great deal is said and they do not show that the husband is, as Mr.&#160;Turner submits, &#8220;game playing&#8221;.  In my view, the wife is seeking to cherry-pick certain extracts and, as I have said, give them disproportionate weight.  I do not therefore consider that the husband&#8217;s application is merely tactical manoeuvring and/or is an abuse of the process, and certainly not such that it should be rejected on those grounds.</span></p>

The relevant documents are not his documents so he has no claim to any physical object.  The documents contain confidential information which belongs to him but the proposed use by the wife is not a misuse.  Mr.&#160;Turner submits, therefore, that as the husband has no substantive entitlement there is no platform from which he can seek an injunction or the other orders he has applied for.  There is no claim based on confidentiality or privacy and there is no claim for wrongful interference with goods as the information is not contained in a document or physical object that belongs to him.  </span></p>

A judge&#8217;s responsibility today in the course of properly managing litigation requires him, when exercising his discretion in accordance with the overriding objective contained in CPR Pt 1, to consider the effect of his decision upon litigation generally.  An example of the wider approach is that judges are required to ensure that a case only uses its appropriate share of the resources of the court &#8230; Proactive management of civil proceedings, which is at the heart of the Civil Procedure Rules, is not only concerned with an individual piece of litigation which is before the court, it is also concerned with litigation as a whole.  So the fact that in this case the defendant&#8217;s insurers &#8230; have been responsible for the trespass involved in entering the claimant&#8217;s house and infringing her privacy contrary to article 8(1) is a relevant circumstance for the court to weigh in the balance when coming to a decision as to how it should properly exercise its discretion in making orders as to the management of the proceedings.</span></p>

The significance of the evidence will differ as will the gravity of the breach of article 8, according to the facts of the particular case.  The decision will depend on all the circumstances.  Here, the court cannot ignore the reality of the situation.  This is not a case where the conduct of the defendant&#8217;s insurers is so outrageous that the defence should be struck out.  The case, therefore, has to be tried.  It would be artificial and undesirable for the actual evidence, which is relevant and admissible, not to be placed before the judge who has the task of trying the case.  We accept Mr. Owen&#8217;s submission that to exclude the use of the evidence would create a wholly undesirable situation. &#8230; For these reasons we do not consider it would be right to interfere with the Judge&#8217;s decision not to exclude the evidence.&#8221;</span></p>

In this appeal, we therefore propose, because the conduct of the insurers gave rise to the litigation over admissibility of the evidence which has followed upon their conduct, to order the defendants to pay the costs of these proceedings to resolve this issue before the district judge, Judge Harris and this court even though we otherwise dismiss the appeal.  This is subject to Mr. Owen having an opportunity to persuade us to do otherwise.  In addition, we would indicate to the trial judge that when he comes to deal with the question of costs he should take into account the defendant&#8217;s conduct which is the subject of this appeal when deciding the appropriate order for costs.&#8221;</span></p>

They were engaged in matrimonial financial proceedings.  The contents of the hard drive had not been accessed by or on behalf of the wife, but were said to include information in three different categories, namely (a) information protected by legal professional privilege, (b) information which was confidential and potentially relevant to the English proceedings, and (c) information about the husband and others which was not potentially relevant to the English proceedings.  The husband commenced proceedings in the Queen's Bench Division for the delivery up of the hard drive.

		      <p style="margin-left:0.92in;text-indent:-0.42in"><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;It is frequent in matrimonial disputes for one party (in this case the wife) to suspect that the other party is about to destroy documents, or conceal information which is, or may be, relevant to the proceedings, and to do so with a view to preventing her from obtaining from the court the financial provision to which she claims to be entitled.  While the law provides for court orders to be made for the preservation and obtaining of evidence for the purpose of future legal proceedings, claimants, or potential claimants sometimes resort to measures of self-help by copying, seizing or attempting to access digital copies of documents.  The other party in such a case, in this case the husband, has rights, including privacy, confidentiality and legal professional privilege, in relation to relevant documents.  The rights of privacy and confidentiality (but not any right to privilege) may be overridden by the competing public interest that any trial should be conducted on full evidence where the documents are relevant.  But unless a document or information is relevant to the actual or intended proceedings in question, the rights of privacy and confidentiality will not be overridden at the instance of the potential or actual claimant, here the wife.  These measures of self-help therefore give rise to legal difficulties.  </span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.92in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The difficulties that measures of self-help give rise to in this context include the danger that the husband&#8217;s rights will be overridden, when they would not be overridden if the matter had been the subject of an application for a preservation or search order made to the court.  Rights of confidentiality, and legal professional privilege, have long been protected by the common law.  Measures of self-help could in the past involve the commission of civil wrongs, such as trespass, breach of confidence and breach of copyright.  In the last 20 years or so the legal protection of information has been greatly increased.  This has in large measure been in response to the development of computers and their use for word processing and sending of electronic messages.  The amount of information that can be stored on a laptop is vast, and techniques for copying are quick and simple for experts.  So the potential fruits of self-help are of a different order from those of former days.  These developments have given rise to the question of the extent to which measures of self-help are also in breach of the criminal provisions of the law designed to protect the databases contained in digital form in computers.&#8221;</span></p>

It contains provision for the solicitors for one party to search the documents of the opposing party, effectively for the purpose of carrying out the exercise of finding what is disclosable and separating it from what is not disclosable.  The form contains numerous safeguards for the party whose documents are being searched.  Without them, a Court could not make a search order consistently with article 8 of the Convention.  There is provision for the party to whom the order is directed to have an opportunity to seek legal advice and to ask the court to vary or discharge the order before it is executed.  The court will normally require the appointment of a supervising solicitor, who is an independent third party.  There is provision for the person whose documents are to be searched to gather together documents he believes may be incriminating or privileged.  The applicant for such an order must give undertakings to the court.  </span></p>

L</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the wife was ordered to deliver up the hard drive.  I am aware of many unreported cases in which a party has been permitted to rely on and adduce irregularly obtained information.  Each case will depend on its own facts and will often, if not usually, depend on balancing the public interest in the court having available to it all relevant evidence with the manner in which the information has been irregularly obtained.  The more extreme the nature of the irregularity the greater the likely interference with that party&#8217;s article 8 rights and the greater the need to justify such interference as being proportionate and, further, the greater the duty on the court to ensure that that party&#8217;s right to a fair trial is not thereby unduly prejudiced and that the proceedings as a whole are fair.  I will return to this latter point shortly.  Conversely, the lesser the nature of the irregularity the less likely the court will consider it necessary or appropriate to be engaged in any preliminary consideration of whether the information obtained in this manner should be used.  And, the greater the default demonstrated or suggested by the improperly obtained material the less likely the court will likewise consider it necessary or appropriate to conduct such a preliminary assessment.</span></p>

Mr.&#160;Howard has based his case primarily on the point of principle which, as I have indicated, I reject.  I do not, therefore, have any knowledge of any of the information contained in the seven files beyond the fact that it is financial information.  It is also reasonably clear that much if not all of this material has been read by the wife&#8217;s solicitors and part has been read by at least one of her junior counsel.  In the circumstances of this case, and I would suggest usually, if information has been accessed by one of the parties or their legal advisers it is too late to seek to quarantine it.  In such circumstances a court is very unlikely to be able properly to undertake the exercise required by the husband&#8217;s application without being provided with details of the information and certainly without giving a party in the position of the wife the opportunity to demonstrate the relevance of the material for the specific purposes of her ancillary relief application.  As referred to earlier in this judgment, the wife would wish to refer to and rely on the nature of the information in opposition to the husband&#8217;s application and in support of her brother&#8217;s actions.</span></p>

Although I have not heard significant argument on the point, my provisional view is that the Family Proceedings Rule 2.61B(6) is not intended to and does not apply to the disclosure of Hildebrand material.  I have little doubt that parties are under an obligation to disclose irregularly obtained information (including that held in electronic form) if and when requested to do so, even if this takes place during a period covered by that rule and also that such disclosure should not depend merely on one party&#8217;s legal advisers being astute enough to make such a request &#8211; in other words, it should happen as a matter of course.</span></p>

For example, if one party seeks to make use of irregularly obtained confidential information then, as in other situations when the court monitors the use of evidence which might have an impact on the fairness of the process, the court might well make more extensive orders for inspection and disclosure against that party if considered appropriate in the interests of justice.

I am not persuaded by Mr. Turner that his client&#8217;s possession of the material in the seven files, having regard to the manner in which it was obtained, entitles the wife or her legal advisers to retain that part of it which is alleged to be privileged for the purposes of looking at and potentially using such material to challenge any such claim.

This material must be preserved and held by them pending the determination of the wife&#8217;s ancillary relief application as offered by the husband.  Once the claimed privileged material has been removed, the files should be returned to the wife&#8217;s solicitors for the reasons    I have given earlier in this judgment.  As for the material alleged to be privileged, if necessary the provisions of r.31.19, paras. (3) to (7) of the Civil Procedure Rules, although not directly applicable to these proceedings, provide the appropriate procedure which should be adopted.  By this means the husband will identify with sufficient particularity those documents which it is alleged contain privileged material.  I also order, subject to any order which might be made during the course of the r.31 process or subsequently in these proceedings, that the wife and her legal advisers are not to make any use of the information contained within or derived from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">this</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> material, including for the purposes of these proceedings.</span></p>

In my view, the orders sought are excessive and unnecessary, especially as I have concluded that the wife in this case is entitled to retain that part of the seven files to which no claim of privilege is made, and when I have little knowledge about the information and, in particular, the nature and extent of the information which is alleged to be privileged.  It may be that the husband is entitled to further orders but any such application in my view requires to be determined, if pursued, when the court has a better understanding of the nature and extent of the material in respect of which privilege is claimed.  At present, as I have said, these orders do not seem to me to be justified.  Further,        I consider that the husband knows sufficiently how the documents arrived with Withers and, as a result of the affidavit filed by the wife, to whom the documents have been provided.</span></p>
