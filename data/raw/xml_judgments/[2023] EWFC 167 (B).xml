The applicants are the Child&#8217;s biological parents. The respondents are caring for her and have been doing so now for the majority of her life. The first respondent is the Child&#8217;s special guardian pursuant to an order dated 26 April 2016. The first respondent is not related to the applicants but was a close friend of the first applicant when the guardianship order was made. The picture is complicated by the fact that the second applicant and second respondent are brothers making the second respondent the uncle of the Child. The applicants have two other children who are full siblings to the Child. The applicants care for these two children of whom one is older and one is younger than the Child. The respondents have another child in their care arising out of a surrogacy relationship.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">This somewhat complicated dynamic functioned without meaningful difficulty for a period following the making of the special guardianship order. Exactly when it began to come under strain is a matter of debate which I will return to below. However, it is clear it completely fractured by the summer of 2021 since which date there has been only the most limited contact between the applicant&#8217;s and the Child pursuant to order of the court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Within this judgment I examine the likely causes of the fracture and I evaluate the impact this may have on the welfare of the Child. In reaching my conclusions I am assisted by the papers contained within the final hearing bundle (supplemented by additional witness statements filed following the first day of the hearing); the live evidence of each party and of the CAFCASS reporting officer (Ms Bond) and a local authority social worker (&#8230;.) who has been working the case. I have also been assisted by the representations made by counsel for the parties. This judgment is by necessity selective as to the documents and evidence cited but I have borne all the evidence in mind when reaching my conclusions. The final hearing proceeded as a 3-day attended hearing but due to some loss of time on both days 1 and 3 it was not possible to provide an ex-tempore judgment at the end of the hearing. This application has had continuity before me throughout the proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The applicants commenced these proceedings seeking the discharge of the special guardianship order and for the Child to return to their care. However this application was later withdrawn with the applicants instead seeking a spending time with order. This is their position before me today. They seek direct contact on a regular basis. Faced by the opposition of the Child to such contact they argue for an adjournment of the proceedings for further work to be undertaken and for a guardian to be appointed to represent the interests of the Child. Whilst they do not oppose the making of a SGO in principle they argue the requirements for the making of an order have not been met and that an addendum report is required before the Court can consider a final order. Further, they argue this is a case in which the Court can expect a support plan to be provided and that this might be a route under which further support can be offered.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The respondents at face value do not oppose contact occurring although they reference the Child&#8217;s wishes as being relevant as to whether it in fact occurs and if so the pace at which it proceeds. By the end of the hearing their finalised position was for gradual development of contact with it being on an indirect basis only pending the Child changing her position as to direct contact. Separate to the child arrangements the second respondent also seeks the making of a special guardianship order (&#8220;SGO&#8221;) to complement the order held by the first respondent. Ms [&#8230;.] is the author of a Special Guardianship Assessment (&#8220;the SGA&#8221;). By the end of the hearing the respondents appeared to accept a final SGO could not be made pending receipt of further information.</span></p>

An order should only be made if the making of such order would be positively better for the child than making no order. The issue of child arrangements is found in section 8 of the Act and the special guardianship provisions in section 14A and in supporting regulations to which I will return in more detail in my analysis below. Consideration of each question turns on a welfare analysis.</span></p>

The purpose of this is to fortify the placement and to permit its sustainability. A SGO is intended to meet the placement needs of a child throughout their minority. As a result, a party seeking to discharge such an order requires the permission of the Court to do so.</span></p>

A lives with order would give him PR but this cannot subsist alongside an SGO. He does not fit within the category of individuals who can gain PR within the provisions of the Act. The only manner in which he could, would be if a contact order were made in his favour under section 12(2)(A) of the Act but that would be highly artificial and is not proposed by any party.</span></p>

It will be for the party making an allegation to prove it took place and they will establish it as a fact if they demonstrate it is more likely than not to have happened. In considering this I will bear in mind the broad landscape of evidence with a particular focus on the evidence of the parties themselves. To the extent I find any of the parties have not been truthful in respect of other evidence I should nevertheless proceed with caution before applying this dishonesty to the key issue in dispute. A witness may lie for a host of reasons and specific dishonesty on one matter does not prove general dishonesty on all matters.</span></p>

It is said the first respondents father felt the second respondent was using the first respondent to gain rights to live in this country given he would not be marrying her otherwise due to her infertility. The second respondent&#8217;s parents opposed the union as it would not permit their son to bring children into their family. I should note there is no suggestion of any opposition within the family to the initial &#8216;gifting&#8217; of the child. The first applicant indicates she did not share these feelings so long as the child was well looked after.

In her statement the first applicant expresses herself negatively about the decision of the respondents to seek further children. I note in her live evidence she sought to correct this impression. I understood the respondents to also note a change in attitudes from about this time with the first respondent commenting that her relationship with the first applicant fractured from about this time. However, it appears contact continued albeit on a gradually diminishing basis. I asked about the regime of contact during live evidence but did not receive a particularly clear response. In statement evidence it is said to have diminished to monthly contact before further reducing to contact every other month or so. The best understanding, I have, was that this dated back to at least April 2020. In her final statement the first applicant details 6-weekly overnight contact.</span></p>

The section 7 report (authored by Gemma Bond) is dated 29 September 2022. It raised significant concerns as to the emotional impact on the Child of the complex dynamic surrounding her and questioned the level of insight of the adults. It recognised the cultural background to the case but observed that the case had been transplanted into an environment and culture in which such an agreement was far from commonplace. In simple terms (my words) the adults had failed to plan for the likely complications arising out of the agreement and in doing so had effectively planned for the arrangement to fail. Work was required to fortify the child&#8217;s emotional wellbeing. She recommended the application to discharge the SGO be dismissed; that life story work with the Child commence as a matter of urgency and that there should be indirect contact between the applicant and the Child to support the work being undertaken. Implicit in this recommendation was the need for all adults to accept and endorse the current arrangements and for there to be a genuine change in attitudes that would remove any uncertainty as to the Child&#8217;s future living arrangements.</span></p>

However, with such a catastrophic breakdown in the relationships between the adults, and the now prolonged gap and entrenched negativity [the Child] has about her birth parents, this recommendation in my view will do the least harm, whilst also enabling [the Child] to maintain some relationship with her birth parents and siblings which I do support. If the adults do the work on their relationship and can mediate and support [the Child] to rebuild her relationship with her birth parents more quickly, there is nothing stopping the contact progressing by agreement, but regarding Court directions, this in my view is as far as they can go.</span></p>

However,  when this did not materialise, the applicants became worried something might have happened and thus attended the property. When they attended the property, they had no awareness or expectation of there being a particular issue. On attendance there were no issues until they probed the second respondent as to why he had not returned their calls whereupon they were told he no longer wanted to associate with them and they would not be seeing the Child. He refused to explain why and the first respondent said she could not answer for the second respondent. This caused the meeting to become heated and the applicants did mention going to Court and having the Child back if the respondents would not allow contact. They were then told to leave.

On that occasion the Child came back from contact and was unsettled. The second respondent called the applicants to find out if anything had happened during contact but was told nothing unusual had happened. Later the Child said she had been told by the applicants that they were her parents and that the respondents were not. As a result, the Child was significantly unsettled and this is why contact stopped. In August the second applicant phoned the second respondent asking about contact, but the second respondent refused the same due to the agitation the child was experiencing. He continued to call but the second respondent did not answer. When asked the Child did not want to go to contact. Then the applicants came to the house. In the course of this meeting which lasted for about 2-hours emotions were heated and the first respondent among other things grabbed the Child and placed her on her lap and in the presence of the Child talked about the applicants being her parents and having her back.  At some point the applicants acted as if to take the Child from the house but the second respondent prevented them before asking them to leave, which they did.

It is quite clear (as explained by the first applicant) that the wider family did not accept the marriage of the respondents. The first applicant may have wished to tell me that she did not know about the feelings of others but I consider her bound by her statement (which she adopted) in which she is quite clear (as I have noted above). These family pressures are I judge powerful influences in a culture in which the opinions of elder members likely carries great weight. The parties come from a culture in which the extended family is important and the views of parents a significant consideration. For the second applicant and respondent&#8217;s parents to be oppositional to the marriage and later firm in the view that the child should be returned (as I find they are/were) was a matter of real significance. It would have impacted the decision making of both applicants and shaped their approach. In this context I find the respondents have in part ended up as surrogates for the views of others.

She makes it abundantly clear that the &#8216;agreement&#8217; was for the first respondent to be entirely focused on the Child. Yet instead, she formed a relationship, married and then planned to bring a further child into the family. I do not accept the suggestion of a mistake in the statement in which it was said that &#8216;sadly&#8217; following the marriage the respondent&#8217;s wanted to have their own children. This I find represents the feelings the applicant held at that time.</span></p>

I accept the evidence of the respondents of their sense of breakdown from around 2019. This was represented in meaningful reduction in contact from around early 2020 at the latest.

I prefer this over the revised position given during the final hearing - of there being ongoing communication which led to a form of agreement as to an August contact which then did not materialise leading to the attendance. First, this has the attraction of being the original account and I struggle to understand on what basis it came to be misstated in the first instance. How was it that the first application neglected to mention or failed to remember at that time that there had been communication and an August contact had been agreed? I find this a wholly implausible state of affairs. Second, whilst I appreciate the case that by this time contact had reduced as to regularity this does not explain why a period of nearly 4 months passed without contact if the parties remained in communication. </span></p>

In making this finding I prefer the position of the respondent&#8217;s without making a specific finding at this stage. This would explain three things: (a) the cessation of contact during the period; (b) the avoiding of communications, and; (c) why there was a delay in timing before the applicants attended the property. On the evidence I have it is far from clear why the applicants left it till August to attend the property on their case. It is far more explicable if the delay flowed from an understanding that something had happened. If, as the first applicant claims nothing of note took place in April 2021 and that this was an entirely positive and normal contact then it becomes very difficult to understand what then happened (or more correctly didn&#8217;t happen) in the following 3-4 months.</span></p>

It appears clear all agree the Child was present. For my part I listened to the debate about the exact location of the Child at times during the visit but ultimately felt this was a somewhat sterile debate. In reality all agreed this was a heated discussion and I find voices were raised by a number of the participants. Second, it is clear the topic of the discussion was the Child and I am in no doubt adults referenced her by name or in such a way as to make it clear that they were speaking about her. Third, I find they likely spoke in their native language and I accept this is a language in which the Child is fluent. Whether the Child was outside the room listening, in the room witnessing what happened, or upstairs (or all three at times) doesn&#8217;t change the likelihood that she could hear what was being said and understood it was about her. It is likely she would have been curious and would have listened.</span></p>

The willingness of the applicants to raise these sensitive issues in such a careless manner might support a finding that they would have done so earlier as alleged by the respondents. Alternatively, the respondents may have utilised the later behaviour as an ex post facto justification for their decision to stop contact in April. I have to say the latter suggestion is the more contrived of the two possibilities. Having considered all the evidence I favour the account given by the second respondent of the Child expressing to him that she had been told in April that the applicants were her parents. I accept by this time matters had deteriorated to the extent that the applicants acted as found.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">In summary I find by April 2021 contact was starting to reduce due to intra-family issues which created a sense of fragility in the placement of the Child with the respondents. Their response to reduce contact was an entirely unsurprising reaction to the same. This contributed to the applicants (or one of them) unfortunately speaking to the Child as to her biological background. I accept (as seems agreed) that earlier in life she had spoken of all the adults in terms of mum and dad but this situation was in the past and likely lost in the mists of memory and by this point the Child had entrenched an emotional understanding of the respondents as her parents. The conversation in April was therefore poorly judged and likely to damage the Child. I judge it did. As a result, contact was stopped. In August 2021 the applicants attended the home and this visit simply reinforced the damage previously done. It has led to the Child clinging onto the adults she regards as her parents and rejecting those who might come to break that relationship. Viewed from the outside none of this is at all surprising.</span></p>

She attended a contact visit in July 2023 but despite the appropriate efforts of the first applicant was unwilling to actively engage in that contact. She answered questions but would not engage physically and the conversations were entirely led by the first applicant. It is reported the Child was then physically sick in the car after leaving the contact. She refused to attend the follow up contact in August 2023 and has written a letter to me in which she comments negatively about the contact and tells me she wants to stop it. I am satisfied on the evidence that these are the child&#8217;s wishes and that they have not been fundamentally shaped by others or forced onto her by others. I am confident these feelings have been impacted upon by the events of April-August 2021 and I judge a likely developing sense of tension in the preceding months before those events. I doubt very much that matters simply took a new departure in April 2021. It is more likely some of the feelings of frustration evident in the later months was present and growing during this period.</span></p>

I agree with the professionals as to the significant impact that informing the Child as to her biological background would have upon her. This impact was exacerbated by the fact that it was presented in a manner which questioned her continued placement with the respondents. I consider it entirely predictable that she would consequently seek to avoid or limit contact with those she must see as presenting a challenge to all that is important to her. This case is described as factually complex. For the Child the situation will appear very clear. She is happy where she is and the applicants are suggesting this cannot continue. This will have left her scared and uncertain as to her future. She will cling on to those things which give her stability. Her decision making around contact is entirely understandable in this context.</span></p>

In any event this would be somewhat apparent by reason of the fact the parties continue to attend common communal events at which they no longer interact. I accept this may have reinforced the Child&#8217;s views but I do not agree it is the source of these views. I also have regard to the Child&#8217;s personal characteristics (see below). This may mean the Child&#8217;s level of understanding of the issues in question is not set at the same level as her chronological age. Her condition is often associated with wariness around change and seeking solace in that which is known and can be confidently anticipated. It is easy to see how the issues in this case will have profoundly impacted on such a child.</span></p>

My worry would be that she feels unable to openly engage with these issues with the respondents and in doing so bottles the emotions up with the risk they will escape later in an unpredictable and damaging fashion. I am also worried that she will come to distrust the respondents if she feels they have not been open with her leaving her isolated and at risk of forms of exploitation. My concern is that these circumstances are also highly challenging for the respondents and they have struggled to grapple with how to resolve the dispute in a Child focused manner. I did not form the impression that have a clear and developed understanding of the emotional baggage that might be created. I found them to be rather simplistic in their approach (in a manner not particularly different from the applicants). Their lack of sophisticated understanding can be seen in the failure to predict the challenges that would arise out of the SGO and to create a strategy in advance to manage this if and when it arose. My sense is of all the adults drifting into this dispute without ever really applying their minds to the journey they were engaged on or the impact it would likely have on the Child.</span></p>

Her response is absolutely predictable and is a natural response to the adult actions. I fail to see on what basis one would need to work with her to correct or remedy her understanding. Rather this is plainly a case in which the adults have the responsibility to address their actions. For my part I fail to see why this is requiring of a therapeutic process. In my judgment the adults simply need to adopt a mature and Child focused approach. They need to put their priorities (and those of other family members) secondary to the needs of the Child. In my view the chief responsibility lies with the applicants to seek to repair the fractured relationship with the respondents. I am not expecting a return to the previous positive relationship from 2016 but rather to a position of respect for the respondents.</span></p>

They need to take a decision as to what is now more important to them. Rebuilding a situation in which they can have a relationship with the Child or being responsive to the views of family members. If they continue to be a conduit for the views of others then they really cannot expect to also have a relationship with the Child. They do not have an entitlement to a relationship but can expect a relationship if the same is best for the Child. It will only fulfil the latter criteria if it is entirely child focused as set out within this judgment.</span></p>

Listening to the adults I had no real sense that they had achieved a materially significant change in attitude. I felt they each (except the second respondent who was unwilling to engage in work) told me what they thought I wanted to hear. My sense was that the emotions remain raw and the feelings are deeply set. The adults did not meet each other&#8217;s eyes when giving evidence and when pressed on topics it was a struggle for any of them to provide naturally warm observations about the others. This is striking in the context in which (i) the respondents have benefitted from the undoubted generosity of the applicants in &#8216;gifting&#8217; a child, and; (ii) the applicants owe the respondents respect for the love and care they have given to the Child in bringing her up as their own child.

In my judgment on the provision of the same the Court will also expect confirmation as to the authors continuing support for an order (or of course a change in opinion if the same is justified on the new information).

I am quite clear that this is not a view which has been imposed on the Child and she has not had this shaped by the respondents. Rather it is a natural response on her part to the challenging circumstances that have been imposed upon her. I judge as entirely plausible the account of her being sick after contact. A process in which she is forced to have contact with individuals who she fears wish to remove her from her family will undoubtedly cause her meaningful emotional harm. To repeat this without regard to the impact to her and to do so on a continuing basis cannot be justified. It will harm her and importantly will not likely repair the relationship with the Applicants.

This is both in respect of the capacity of the applicants to maintain such a high level of one directional contact but also for the Child. I would be concerned to avoid any sense of the messaging appearing oppressive to the Child. She is currently unresponsive to a lower level of contact. In my view the contact should include a letter and video each month but it should be timed to be received at the same time. In this way the letter will complement the video. I consider this is both more practical and more likely to be received positively in due course.

Whilst I would leave the parties to agree increases in contact in future between themselves I would consider on an improved footing contact should take place on up to 6 occasions per annum (based around the conventional school holidays and half-terms). I agree in improved circumstances this would benefit from being contact in a natural environment as suggested by Ms Bond (a picnic or bowling for example). I would not be considering overnight contact without the agreement of all parties. Such contact would not require professional supervision. Unfortunately, viewed from the other perspective if there is no progress then I struggle to see the how the identity contact suggested by Ms Bond will be effective. I understand the logic of her argument as to the futility and likely damage that will arise out of repeated forced attempts, but I fail to see how this will in fact be any more achieveable simply because it has been reduced to bi-annual contact. I cannot see the Child will be any more likely to engage or in fact attend. The intermittency of the arrangements will I suspect increase rather than reduce her opposition as the applicants will seem more distant from her.</span></p>
