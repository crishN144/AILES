	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application under the Hague Convention in relation to a little girl, E, who was born on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2009 and so is now aged five years old. It is a somewhat unusual application for reasons that will become apparent.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant is E&#8217;s maternal grandmother, who is now 66 years old. The Respondent is E&#8217;s mother, who is aged 24. E&#8217;s father, Mr D, is 38 years old. All family members are nationals of the Czech Republic.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I describe the history of this matter, it is important to note that the question for this court is not what should happen to E in future or where E should live. The decision to be made is which court should determine decisions about E in future: should it be this court or should it be the court in the Czech Republic? This is not a welfare decision; it is a decision about jurisdiction.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this matter is that, until around the end of 2011, everyone in this family was living in the Czech Republic. The grandmother was then still married to the mother&#8217;s father. The mother, as quite a young teenager, had got into considerable difficulties with drugs. When she became a mother at a very young age, the care of E gravitated towards her own mother.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, by October 2010, the grandmother was caring for E. There were then proceedings in the Czech court, which led to an order on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011, under which the &#352;umperk District Court ordered that E should, from then on, live with her grandmother.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By this stage, according to the grandmother, the mother had disappeared from E&#8217;s life. In 2012, the maternal grandparents divorced and in early 2012 the mother came to England, where she has remained. She now speaks good English. The remainder of the family speak no English.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To complete the picture, in January 2014 the grandmother, for financial reasons, issued an application in the District Court to become E&#8217;s official foster carer. Those proceedings are still in existence, awaiting the outcome of these proceedings.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now turn to the mother&#8217;s position. She describes being brought over to England with the promise of work as a waitress or as bar staff. However, she was in fact the victim of a criminal gang and was a victim of trafficking, whereby she was effectively imprisoned and forced to work, amongst other things, in prostitution. The gang behind this is said to be run from the Czech Republic and to have a particular leader who still remains there.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Happily for her, during 2013 the mother managed to escape and reported her position to the police. The result was that criminal proceedings were taken against two individuals, the son of the gang leader and his partner, which led to their conviction in March 2014. They were sentenced to 11 and 10 years imprisonment, respectively. The mother gave evidence during those proceedings.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s situation in London has, not surprisingly, been difficult. She has been in two relationships recently. The first ended in the middle of August, when she says that her partner was violent towards her and she left. The second is continuing at the moment.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the results of the police intervention was that the mother and grandmother were put back in touch with each other. It had been some years since the mother had had any contact with her own mother or with her daughter. There were a number of messages and phone calls and these led to the grandmother coming over to England with E on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grandmother left England on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, without E. There is a dispute between the grandmother and the mother as to why that happened. What is clear is that, within a few days of the grandmother&#8217;s arrival, she was in conflict with her daughter. The grandmother and E were living in very small and inadequate accommodation with the mother and her then boyfriend. It was only about four days after her arrival that they fell into disagreement.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the time that followed, the grandmother contacted the police and the Czech Embassy, claiming that E had been taken from her care and asking for help. However, nothing came of it and on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July she went back to the Czech Republic, where she immediately contacted the authorities, who brought forward an application through the International Child Abduction and Custody Unit on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, soon after the grandmother left, the mother herself issued an application for a prohibited steps order in this jurisdiction, to prevent the grandmother removing E from her care. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grandmother now seeks an order for E&#8217;s return to the Czech Republic.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The unusual features of this application are, firstly, that E was brought here by her grandmother and, secondly, that the mother&#8217;s situation as a victim of trafficking creates a special context. There is no dispute between the parties that, up until 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, E had always been habitually resident in the Czech Republic. Nor is there a dispute that E was brought voluntarily to England by her grandmother. Therefore, this is not a case of abduction. What is alleged by the grandmother is that E was unlawfully retained in this country by her mother, in breach of the grandmother&#8217;s rights of custody under the Czech order.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother raises two defences to this application. Her first defence is that she alleges that the grandmother consented to E not only coming to England but remaining here. The second defence is under Article 13(b), by which the mother alleges a grave risk of harm to E in a return to the Czech Republic, or that E would be in an intolerable situation if sent back to that country.  I deal with these in turn.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential issue between the parties is that the mother says that when E came here to England with her grandmother, she had come to stay. The grandmother puts it differently, saying that she had come to see whether the family could live together in England and whether E could be reunited safely with her mother.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard limited oral evidence from both parties about this question. I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that there were many communications by phone or text message between early 2014 and the grandmother&#8217;s arrival. The mother says that the arrival was because of a plan to be together as a family. The grandmother told me that she came to England because she wanted to convince herself about the mother&#8217;s situation and to see how she was.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the mother, Ms Finch points out that the family&#8217;s difficult situation, arising from the criminal investigation, would have been an incentive for the grandmother to move away from the Czech Republic. She also argues that there was at least some accommodation and possibilities for the future for the family in London.</p>

In particular, the effect of these authorities and others like them is that consent must be clear and unequivocal (although it need not be in writing), that the burden of proving it rests on the person who asserts it, and that one has to take a practical view of the realities of family life.</p>

It is possible that the grandmother agreed to E coming here permanently, but then, for some reason, changed her mind. However, it is much more likely that she is correct when she says that she came to investigate the situation, but was not satisfied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn now to the defence under Article 13(b). There are many cases in which this Article is raised as a defence without any real basis in fact. That is not the case here. The court is bound to consider whether risk arises for E as a result of her mother&#8217;s courage in deciding to give evidence in such a serious case. The mother says in her evidence that she feels under threat as a result and that she fears that criminals involved with this organisation might seek to harm her or to harm her daughter, bearing in mind that one of the criminal defendants is a child of a leading member of the gang. I do not, in any way, take the mother&#8217;s feelings about that lightly.</p>

He says that the grandmother had contacted the Czech police, feeling that she might be being watched by members of the group local to her. He also makes reference to the fact that there was evidence of at least one potential witness in the Czech Republic being bought off before the criminal trial and that, whilst the grandmother had not reported any violence or threats of violence, his concerns are real. Therefore, it is obvious that the question of risk of harm has been fairly raised by the mother in the circumstances of this case. </p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be &#8220;real&#8221;. It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8220;grave&#8221;. Although &#8220;grave&#8221; characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as &#8220;grave&#8221; while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.&#8217;</p>

Although for anyone, adult or child, involvement in a history of this kind is bound to raise concerns of the sought mentioned by A, I have not been able to find any solid, established evidence of a threat to E in this country or in the Czech Republic.</p>
