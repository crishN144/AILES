	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application made on behalf of Guardian News and Media Limited, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Independent Television News, Associated Newspapers, Sky News, Times Newspapers and the Telegraph (the media) for publication of the judgment of Eleanor King J, as she then was, dated 30th June 2014.  It is an application brought just the day after the convictions at the Central Criminal Court of Ben Butler and Jennie Gray resulting from the tragic death of Ellie Butler; and it is made, I would observe, with a powerful element of public interest behind it.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In ordinary circumstances, Eleanor King J would be confronting this application.  She does not do so in circumstances where she has been elevated to the Court of Appeal and in the belief that it was most appropriate for a judge of the Division to deal with the matter.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is made on behalf of the media organisations on the basis that there is a profound public interest in reporting the story of Ellie's death, including, in particular, the history of the care proceedings relating to Ellie's younger sibling.  It is said that the judgment of Eleanor King J should be published so as to ensure that the media can properly report both the story of Ellie's death and the story of the care proceedings.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is unnecessary for present purposes to deal with the facts which lie behind the application.  They are well-known and already in the public domain.  The history, though, in relation to reporting restrictions orders is of some relevance; and I shall therefore deal in just a little detail with what has happened in so far as restriction on publication is concerned.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Reporting restriction orders have been in place continuously since Ellie&#8217;s death. The order made by Eleanor King J on 13th March 2014 continued, and was in similar terms to, the first order made on 30th October 2013 by, I believe, Hogg J.  The final hearing of C's care proceedings was listed before Eleanor King J on 9th June 2014.  On 30th June at their conclusion, Eleanor King J made a care order and gave a full judgment. She found that Mr.&#160;Butler was responsible for having caused Ellie's death and that Miss&#160;Gray had failed to protect the children from him.</p>

On 29th July, again in 2014, Eleanor King J considered and reiterated the order of Holman J.  Her order provided, materially for present purposes at paragraph 7:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8th June 2016, Moor J considered an application made by the BBC and the Guardian for the provision of copies of all orders made in the care proceedings leading to the judgments of Hogg J.  There was a contest.  Moor J directed that redacted orders should be released to the media.  Moor J recognised the considerable public interest in the care proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last week, on 13th June, the applicant media organisations applied for a revised reporting restriction order.  The purpose of that was so as to relax the previous orders to permit the reporting of the fact that Ellie Butler had a younger sibling whilst still protecting C's identity.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant conceded that the media should be provided with a lightly redacted version of the final order of Eleanor King J; and Bodey J gave permission for the redacted order to be provided to the media.  Bodey J approved and agreed a revised reporting restriction order which permitted the publication of paragraph&#160;122 of the judgment of 30th June.  I am unclear as to why it was that Bodey J gave liberty to apply but he did; and it is, in part, as a result of that liberty to apply that the application comes before me today.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of principles are, as Mr Bunting suggests, applicable. Open justice is at the heart of our system of justice and vital to the rule of law.  It promotes the rule of law by letting in the light and allowing the public to scrutinise the workings of the law for better or for worse.  There is a particular need, I altogether accept, for the media to act as a public watchdog in care proceedings in the Family Court because of the intrusion or potential intrusion into the family lives of those concerned and what could be a serious interference by the state in family life.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, while there is no presumption in favour of open justice, in private proceedings concerning the welfare of children there is a fundamental need for the press to play a scrutiny role in family proceedings.  That is a matter enshrined within the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">President's Practice Guidance (Family Courts: Transparency)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 WLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 WLR 230</ref>.

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The foundation of the jurisdiction to restrain publicity in a case such as this is derived from rights enshrined within the European Convention on Human Rights. A balancing exercise is required between competing rights.  The balancing exercise as between Articles 8 and 10 has been addressed in a number of authorities; they are well described within paragraph&#160;17 of the application.  There is no need for me to read them into this judgment. I accept Mr Bunting&#8217;s analysis.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is suggested that the proceedings before Eleanor King J are of the utmost public interest.  There should therefore be, it is said, a strong presumption in favour of publication.  There is an important public interest in the press being able to follow and understand those proceedings for the reasons described by Mr. Bunting; and there is a profound public interest in the press being able to investigate and, as necessary, report the varying approaches of the Family Court to the care proceedings relating to Mr.&#160;Butler and Miss&#160;Gray.  These care proceedings, it is said, and I accept, place the Family Court under a particular spotlight and cry out for public exploration.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr. Bunting then goes on to say that in so far as the judgment and order of 30th June 2014 have been withheld from the press to protect against injustice in the criminal proceedings, this justification falls away upon the verdict given yesterday at the Old Bailey by the jury.</p>

That exercise was said to be a process in which all the parties represented at this hearing could have involved themselves so as to devise a redacted version that I would then simply have approved.</p>

He referred me to the three-stage assessment process outlined by Lord Judge at paragraph&#160;13 of that decision.  Mr Bunting argued that it is necessary to have regard to three matters, in particular, when assessing whether there is a substantial risk of prejudice.  First, that jurors can and should be trusted to remain true to their own passionate and profound belief in and commitment to the right of a defendant to be given a fair trial; and the importance of trusting a criminal jury to comply with directions made by the trial judge.  </p>

It is recognised that the staying power of news reports is very limited.  Mr Bunting drew my attention to the very high threshold exemplified by the recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Abdulla Ali v. The United Kingdom</span>.</p>

The proceedings are not active, no notice of appeal has been lodged.  There are, he says, no extant appeal proceedings.  Even if there were, it does not follow they would succeed.  The CPS is on notice of the current reporting restriction orders of Bodey J and Wilkie&#160;J and it is difficult to see, says Mr. Bunting, how the publication of King&#160;J's judgment could create a separate substantial risk of prejudice given that the press is already freely reporting Mr.&#160;Butler's conviction. Moreover, the media is already reporting the finding of Eleanor King J that Mr.&#160;Butler was responsible for Ellie's death as well as the findings of the serious case review released overnight which makes a number of critical comments about Mr.&#160;Butler's credibility, his history of lying and concealing matters from professionals.</p>

The guidance then, materially, continues thus, "And the effect of publication upon any current or potential criminal proceedings".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the signs are that the criminal processes involving Ben Butler are not yet over.  Yesterday, as is reported on the BBC website, after the guilty verdict, Mr.&#160;Butler shouted out, "I'll fight for the rest of my life.  Unbelievable" before adding, "I want to be sentenced now so I can fight in the appeal court".  He added, "I'll fight for ever to prove this wrong.  My daughter was jumping in the house.  I am 100% not guilty."  Miss&#160;Gray added, "Big mistake.  Spend another ten years proving you wrong". Those expressions of view, albeit uttered in the heat of the moment and immediately after the verdict, give some solid indication that the criminal proceedings are likely to extend to the making of an application for permission to appeal and to a submission that his conviction should be overturned.  </p>

It will be, if I am able to forecast anything, front page news. I am fully aware of the extent of public interest in the circumstances of this case, the background, the extent to which the Family Court has been involved as well as to the many legal processes leading to yesterday's verdict.  </p>

There was, in the immediate aftermath of the criminal trial widespread front page, very prominent and extensive references to the judgment given many months, even perhaps years, previously by Eleanor King J.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a very high likelihood, indeed it is inevitable, in my assessment, that there would be the most widespread and extensive reporting of the content of King&#160;J's judgment in this instance.  Would there be repercussions for the criminal appeal&#8217;s process?  Mr. Bunting invites me to significantly doubt that there would be prejudice.  He says there is a long way to go before any retrial.  It is unclear as to whether one would be ordered.  There may be a slender prospect, he argues, and it may be in the distant future and it is insufficient to outweigh the public interest in favour of publication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would suppose that three options exist for the appeal which Ben Butler made clear yesterday he is intent on pursuing: firstly, that it is dismissed; second, that it is allowed and the conviction quashed; and, third, that the appeal is allowed to the extent that a retrial is ordered.  I have no means of forecasting, no one has any means of predicting with any degree of accuracy, or at all, what will happen in connection with the proposed appeal.  If there is any potential for a retrial then it seems to me that for exactly the same reasons as underpinned the decision of Eleanor King J not to release her judgment in 2014, I must do likewise.</p>

There is the potential for prejudice to, even the derailing of, the criminal process.  That, to my mind, is manifest.  The risk may be, as Mr. Bunting suggests, small but the consequences for the criminal process could be incalculable.</p>

That possibility, the potential for that eventuality, inevitably compels me to dismiss this application.  </p>

The arguments in favour of the release of King&#160;J's judgment are powerful and strong.  They will remain so.  I fully expect that so soon as the criminal appeals&#8217; process is at an end a full, suitably redacted version of the 30th June 2014 judgment will be published.  That is my judgment.  </p>
