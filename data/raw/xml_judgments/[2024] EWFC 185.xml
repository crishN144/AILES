I am making my order on the basis of Mr Amlot&#8217;s paragraph 7(c).  I gave permission to Mrs. Rotenberg to apply for Part III relief on the basis that she and the children were, indeed, resident permanently in this jurisdiction.  That was the basis on which she was entitled to apply and that was the basis on which the terms of this agreement were reached.  I accept Mr. Pocock&#8217;s point that the provision includes outright provision for her.  I further accept that the term that she was to remain here is only to apply until 2024 but it is clear that they agreed that she would be here until 2024.  On that basis, I am quite clear that I should make this agreement into an order of this court.  I have done so on the basis that she will be remaining here.  Indeed, I note that she would require the permission of a judge if she wished the children to relocate permanently outside the jurisdiction of this court.  </span></p>

He did so expressly on the basis that, accepting W&#8217;s evidence (as set out at paras 55 of the judgment), W intended to return to this country to take up residence at the property. An order dated 30 July 2019 recorded his conclusions. He also released H from his escrow fund obligation because W had remarried, and the maintenance provision had ended. </p>

The wording seems to me to be curious as it envisages leaving the order in a permanent state of limbo. The stated ground was a significant change in circumstances, namely that the order had been made &#8220;on the basis that [W] would live in this jurisdiction with the parties&#8217; two children, and they would be educated here&#8221; whereas they had left England permanently. This was very similar to the applications previously made on 5 April 2017 and 28 September 2018, but of course Moor J had dismissed the previously constituted applications.  Curiously, H&#8217;s statement dated 23 February 2021 in support of the application says in the first paragraph that the application is to &#8220;set aside&#8221; the order, which is rather different.  I have to say that I regard the drafting of this application, and the relief sought, as very odd (it was done long before H&#8217;s present lawyers were involved in this case). </p>

W advanced at the appeal an alternative ground that the property was held beneficially under a constructive trust. The constructive trust argument had not been advanced at trial, and the Court of Appeal accordingly remitted for rehearing. It is not, I think, unfair to say that the Court of Appeal clearly thought there was prima facie merit in the constructive trust argument; Moylan LJ described it as &#8220;certainly arguable&#8221; at para 48 of the judgment.</p>

In the course of those proceedings, she has not attended court, has breached numerous orders and has had a 21-day sentence of imprisonment imposed on her for contempt of court, which is yet to be enforced.</p>

Those needs depended on W and the children remaining in the UK until December 2024 by when the youngest child would be 18. In fact, within two years, W and the children had left England, and the children took up residence with H while W set up a new life with a new husband in Armenia. In those circumstances, in my judgment, the landscape on the ground was very different from that which was envisaged at the time of the order made on 20 July 2016. The facts of this case are exceptional, and justify the order being reframed. </p>

H and Ravendark can no doubt point to the settled jurisprudence (which I accept) that as a starting point equity follows the law, and accordingly the beneficial interest follows the legal title, but it is not necessary or appropriate for me to so record in an order.</p>

The respondents agree that in respect of costs between each of them and W, there is no starting point either that costs follow the event or that there should be no order as to costs. A clean sheet of paper applies. None of the respondents seeks costs orders against the other. </p>

In that time W has not engaged at all and has not complied with court orders. She is the applicant, yet has not pursued her applications against H. It seems to me, notwithstanding the criticisms of H made in the past, and the Court of Appeal&#8217;s comments on the potential merit of the constructive trust claim, that H is entitled to his costs from 13 September 2022 on the indemnity basis. W&#8217;s approach to the litigation in that period (or, rather, non-approach) is of such a degree of unreasonableness as to warrant the higher basis of assessment. His costs are &#163;167,878 which I will summarily assess at &#163;150,000 (just under 90%).</p>

Since that date W has not engaged at all, other than a brief period in mid-2022. Olpon had no alternative but to participate. I consider that W should pay Olpon&#8217;s costs on the indemnity basis; again, it is W&#8217;s non-participation in the proceedings which justifies the higher basis of assessment. The sum sought is &#163;147,255 which I will assess summarily at &#163;130,000 (just under 90%).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ravendark seeks an order for costs from 20 December 2016, to be subject to detailed assessment. It is submitted that W pursued a resulting trust enforcement application which ultimately was set aside in the Court of Appeal, and her constructive trust application has now fallen away. Further, W has not engaged at all since the Court of Appeal proceedings save for the brief period in mid-2022. Against that, I cannot ignore the findings made by Moor J about the failure of H to give evidence on the beneficial interest point at the July 2019 hearing, nor the judge&#8217;s criticism of Mr Kalantryskiy who claimed he was the ultimate beneficial owner, and whose evidence was not accepted by the judge. Nor can I ignore the Court of Appeal&#8217;s comments on the potential of a constructive trust claim. In short, it seems to me that far greater criticisms can legitimately be laid at W&#8217;s door in respect of her conduct of the litigation since the Court of Appeal decision, than in respect of the period prior thereto.  I shall order that W pays 50% of Ravendark&#8217;s costs, to be subject to detailed assessment on the standard basis. I will not make an order for an interim payment on account. </p>
