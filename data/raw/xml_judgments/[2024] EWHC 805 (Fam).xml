AN is an intelligent young person who is due to sit her GCSE exams in the summer of this year. Very sadly, and completely unexpectedly, AN was diagnosed as suffering from acute leukaemia after presenting at hospital with the symptoms of a cough, fever and chest infection 5 days ago, on 5 February 2024.</span></p>

At the time, the doctor concerned was satisfied that AN understood and was able to retain information regarding the diagnosis, was aware of the seriousness of the condition, could weigh up the risks and benefits of being discharged, versus staying in hospital, and could communicate this.</span></p>

She describes AN in her statement of 9 February 2024, which is before me, as a well-educated young lady who explained that she needed time to come to terms with the diagnosis and asked for several days to do that. She recounted what must have been a very traumatic experience of being given the diagnosis and being told that she would die without treatment. Dr X explained to her the urgency in starting treatment promptly, and why this would usually be done as an inpatient, given the potential for side-effects and life-threatening complications. </span></p>

AN explained that she was not refusing treatment, but needed time to come to terms with her diagnosis. She didn&#8217;t believe that she would become unwell over several days at home. Dr X records her impression that AN had capacity to understand the diagnosis, and the proposed need for inpatient treatment, and the risks of not having treatment. The doctor agreed to give her limited time at home before seeing her again ideally to admit her for treatment on 9 February.</span></p>

Those tests confirmed an elevated White Blood Cell count, a low neutrophil count and anaemia. The diagnosis of Precursor B cell ALL was confirmed, and there was further concern that elevated inflammatory markers suggested a potential for active infection. ALL is described by Dr X as an aggressive, rapidly progressive form of blood cancer that untreated would be expected to result in life threatening complication within a matter of days or weeks. With appropriate treatment, however, there is a very high chance of remission, and a good chance of long-term cure. </span></p>

This would include intravenous fluid hydration for the first 48 hours (protecting the kidneys from tumour cell breakdown), and dexamethasone (steroid) tablets to destroy the cancer cells. The doctor explained that, when leukaemia cells are broken down by steroids, breakdown products released into the bloodstream can interfere with kidney function, which therefore requires inpatient admission to enable appropriate blood test monitoring, IV fluids and observations to be performed.</span></p>

Dr X, in company with psychologist Dr Z, performed a capacity assessment for AN, and concluded that she did not have clinical/physiological impairment of brain functioning, nor any history of mental health disorder. However, she found that AN was not accepting of her diagnosis, or of the inevitability that she would become unwell in the absence of urgent treatment. This led her in her statement to conclude that AN &#8216;does not display sufficient capacity today to make decisions about her treatment/safety&#8217;.</span></p>

However, whilst under this last outcome the doctor foresaw the likely progression of the disease to fatality in days or weeks, it was the second option which I understood from AN&#8217;s mother&#8217;s submissions to me to be one which she could accept. That involved a further delay of admission for several days whilst providing steroids and supportive care medicine for AN to take at home, with a view to daily blood tests being performed and AN being re-admitted to hospital on Monday 12 February.</span></p>

Given that AN&#8217;s parents, who with her were objecting to admission, had expressed a desire to see the judge, I determined to conduct the hearing remotely to the hospital, despite the late hour. I received a position statement and oral submissions from Ms David of counsel for the applicant, and submissions from AN&#8217;s mother, BN, in person. AN was present in the room with her mother and could hear and see the evidence and submissions. By the time that the hearing commenced, her father had left to look after her siblings. I was also grateful for the assistance of Mr Brownhill of counsel who appeared for the Official Solicitor, appointed as Advocate to the Court. That unusual situation arose as follows.</span></p>

As AN is 16, she remains a minor and so would in those circumstances usually be represented through Cafcass as her guardian. I have been referred to the January 2023 guidance provided jointly by Cafcass and the Official Solicitor dealing with out of hours medical cases involving children. However, given that the issue of capacity has been raised, and in light of AN&#8217;s age, this may yet become a case that should appropriately proceed in the Court of Protection, in which case the court could appoint the Official Solicitor as AN&#8217;s litigation friend. In circumstances where no officer of Cafcass was available at short notice, and pursuant to the Attorney-General&#8217;s Memorandum of 19 December 2001, paragraph 3, the Official Solicitor was satisfied that this was a case where &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">there is a danger of an important and difficult point of law being decided without the court hearing relevant argument</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8217;, as reconfirmed and explained in the President&#8217;s Guidance dated 26 March 2015. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#323130">&#8216;If we gave AN some steroid tablets to take home, this would start to potentially deliver some initial treatments to bring that white cell count down. But it wouldn't be done in a safe and controlled environment. So whilst it may start to treat the leukemia and she may manage to take the medication as an outpatient, the monitoring that goes along with that, that we would ordinarily do to ensure that we're keeping patients safe through that process, wouldn't be happening&#8230; Also, given that she's displayed some signs and has some clinical features that raise concern that she has active infection, and she has a compromised immune system, letting her go on tablet antibiotics would be a risky thing to do in that situation, because even with antibiotic therapy at home, her immune system is not well powered even in the face of antibiotics to fight these infections. Intravenous antibiotics are of paramount importance and patients can get very sick very quickly&#8230; If she isn't here we can&#8217;t provide the close oversight and monitoring and minimize risk in terms of any side effects related to that process... we would normally be doing blood tests very frequently and in the 1st 24 to 48 hours we often do blood tests twice a day to make sure that they are stable, and that we are not causing any knock on effects to things like the kidneys and the kidney function is stable,&#8230; alongside giving her some fluids to make sure that her kidneys were hydrated and that we were doing everything to minimize the risk whilst those steroids had effect.</span></p>

Nevertheless the discretion is not to be exercised in a moral vacuum. Undoubtedly the philosophy behind <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1969, as well as behind the decision of the House of Lords in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Gillick's</span><span style="color:#000000">&#160;case is that, as children approach the age of majority, they are increasingly able to take their own decisions concerning their medical treatment. In logic there can be no difference between an ability to consent to treatment and an ability to refuse treatment. This philosophy is also reflected by some provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> which give a child, of sufficient understanding to make an informed decision, the right to refuse "medical or psychiatric examination or other assessment" or "psychiatric and medical treatment" in certain defined circumstances:&#8230; Accordingly the older the child concerned the greater the weight the court should give to its wishes, certainly in the field of medical treatment. In a sense this is merely one aspect of the application of the test that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. It will normally be in the best interests of a child of sufficient age and understanding to make an informed decision that the court should respect its integrity as a human being and not lightly override its decision on such a personal matter as medical treatment, all the more so if that treatment is invasive. In my judgment, therefore, the court exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to a 16- or 17-year-old child who is not mentally incompetent will, as a matter of course, ascertain the wishes of the child and will approach its decision with a strong predilection to give effect to the child's wishes&#8230; Nevertheless, if the court's powers are to be meaningful, there must come a point at which the court, while not disregarding the child's wishes, can override them in the child's own best interests, objectively considered. Clearly such a point will have come if the child is seeking to refuse treatment in circumstances which will in all probability lead to the death of the child or to severe permanent injury&#8230;</span></p>

Every case must depend on its own facts. What I do stress is that the judge should approach the exercise of the discretion with a predilection to give effect to the child's wishes on the basis that prima facie that will be in his or her best interests.&#8221;&#8230;</span></p>

In considering the welfare of the child, the court must not only recognise but if necessary defend the right of the child, having sufficient understanding to take an informed decision, to make his or her own choice. In most areas of life it would be not only wrong in principle but also futile and counter-productive for the court to adopt any different approach. In the area of medical treatment, however, the court can and sometimes must intervene.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

I state this only as a general and not as an invariable premise because of the possibility of cases in which the court would not authorise treatment of a distressing nature which offered only a small hope of preserving life. In general terms, however, the present state of the law is that an individual who has reached the age of 18 is free to do with his life what he wishes, but it is the duty of the court to ensure so far as it can that children survive to attain that age.&#160;</span></p>

I do however pay serious regard to her expressed views and wishes and to those of her parents, both in supporting her and for their own part in advocating for a return home for their daughter. She is clearly an intelligent and articulate young person who, despite the most traumatic of circumstances has nevertheless been able to converse at length with her doctors and in so doing impress on them her capacity and her awareness of her situation. It is not a surprise that she has found the final step, of acknowledging the gravity of her diagnosis and consenting to immediate and demanding treatment a hard one to take over such a short period of time. I remind myself that just this time last week, all of the events since her diagnosis were completely unforeseen and unforeseeable. She has in fact coped remarkably well with the most terrible of situations. It is completely understandable that she would like to be at home.</span></p>

However, I have come to the very clear view that, notwithstanding her age and her expressed wishes, her welfare needs do dictate that she must now remain where she is and commence inpatient treatment as Dr X urgently recommends. I bear in mind that this is not a young person who is refusing treatment, but rather one who clearly says that she wants to be treated, but simply wishes to delay the commencement of that treatment. The evidence is very clear that such a delay risks seriously compromising the efficacy of the treatment. The potentially extremely serious side effects of the steroids which AN would be taking at home would not be mitigated by the intravenous hydration which could be provided in a hospital setting. Further, chemotherapy, which would otherwise begin at the start of next week, would almost certainly be delayed, increasing further the risk of the cancer proving fatal.</span></p>

As against those dangers, alongside of course AN&#8217;s own clearly expressed wish for more time, I have to weigh the very positive potential outcomes if the treatment is commenced immediately without those risks being run. In those circumstances I am clear that the balance falls comfortably in favour of intervention, and in acceding to the Trust&#8217;s application for an order which will keep AN in hospital where she is now, so that the life-saving treatments which are available can be administered to her. </span></p>
