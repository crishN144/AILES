	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After he moved abroad, the father had contact in this country when he came over on visits.  Problems soon developed, however, leading him to issue an application for a child arrangements order in 2016.  The mother  made allegations of domestic abuse and issued an application for a non-molestation order.  A fact finding hearing took place in 2017 at which His Honour Judge Rutherford made a number of findings adverse to the father.  The judge found that the father had made vile comments about the mother and had said unpleasant things about her in front of the children. This had made the children very uncomfortable.  In his judgment the judge noted that whilst the father made some admissions about his behaviour, he remained largely unrepentant. The judge did not find that the father had embarked upon a deliberate campaign of harassment and controlling behaviour against the mother but he did accept that the mother had perceived it to be so. He found that it had undermined the mother to the detriment of her care of the children, and that the children had been made to feel anxious and pressurised about contact.  He made a non-molestation order.</p>

The father said that the mother did not support contact and that accordingly the arrangements were not adhered to. The mother says that the father upset the children during video contact and then failed to move forward at the children&#8217;s pace. She said he did not abide by the arrangements and failed to do such things as to book the supervisors or confirm his attendance.</p>

The children were joined as parties in October 2020 and a Guardian from NYAS was appointed to represent them.  In June 2021 Melanie Gill, Psychologist, was appointed to conduct a global psychological assessment of the family.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The outcome of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span> was that the President determined that the decision as to whether a particular individual was an &#8216;expert&#8217; was one for the family court hearing a particular case; it was not for the court to prohibit the instruction of any unregulated psychologist.  He noted that the generic label &#8216;psychologist&#8217; was not protected and could be used by any individual whether registered or not. This is distinct from the title of &#8216;clinical psychologist&#8217;  which could only be used by those who are validly registered under the regulations. The court must therefore work with the current, potentially confusing scheme but &#8216;must do so with its eyes wide open to the need for clarity over the expertise of those who present as a psychologist but who are neither registered or chartered&#8217; ([96]).</p>

The father asks me to find that the mother has been obstructive to the children spending time with the father in accordance with the order of 1.11.17.  He says that the mother has failed to positively promote him to the children, that she pursues allegations of abuse against him which have been previously been determined by the court, and that she makes unfounded allegations against him of emotional abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour in order to obstruct his relationship with the children. He also alleges that she has knowingly communicated her negative views about him and contact arrangements to the children,  thereby alienating them.  In the alternative, he invites the court to find that her views have been communicated unconsciously, but with the same result.</p>

They essentially encompass what she has alleged in her witness statements. In paragraph 1 she asserts that the father&#8217;s behaviour towards the children has caused them to feel anxious, upset, lied to and pressured, causing the relationship to break down. There are twenty specific examples given of the behaviour alleged which, for the sake of brevity, I will not set out here.  At paragraph 2 she alleges that the father has undermined and is hostile to or about third parties to, or in front of the children.  There are fourteen examples which follow which relate to such matters as being confrontational to the contact supervisor, being rude about the contact supervisor, and making derogatory remarks about the mother.  Paragraph 3 alleges that the father has undermined the 2017 order and placed pressure on the children in respect of contact arrangements, with ten examples. Paragraph 4 alleges that the father has continued to be emotionally abusive, intimidating and threatening towards the mother, and is coercive and controlling (seventeen examples). Paragraph 5 alleges that the father is financially abusive and controlling (five examples).  At paragraph 6 it is alleged that the father has no insight into the impact of his behaviour on the children&#8217;s wellbeing and relationship with him (three examples).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children currently have contact with their father in the community, supervised by Family Ties. As the father lives abroad this is spread over a five day period every three months or so when he is here at half term and the school holidays.  There is also video contact on Sundays  which is not supervised.  The mother agrees to the continuation of that contact, but suggests that for the moment at least the video contact reduces in frequency.  She does not agree that there should be unsupervised face to face contact at the moment, and submits that the father should undertake work to address his abusive conduct prior to any intervention involving the children.  In particular she proposes that the father undertakes a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme (a DAPP).  The mother offers to undergo some training and support for herself.  She does not agree with the proposal for the family to undertake a Parenting Apart Programme (PAP) as proposed by the Guardian as she does not consider that it replicates the specific work around domestic abuse as provided for by the DAPP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is willing to undertake the work recommended by Melanie Gill and NYAS. Indeed he has already undergone a number of therapy sessions with a psychiatrist.  He proposes that contact becomes unsupervised every six weeks, from Friday to Sunday evening or Monday morning.  He submits that supervision is unnecessary in principle and is fuelling the children&#8217;s anxiety.  There are, he says, no risks posed by him which require supervision, and it simply endorses the mother&#8217;s narrative that there are reasons to be anxious around him when there are not.</p>

Sometimes people lie out of misplaced loyalty, to bolster a true case or for no reason that anyone can discern.

He did accept that it was his wrongdoing which affected his relationship with the mother, but after that said &#8216;I really can&#8217;t take much blame&#8217;.

She said she had witnessed a warm bond between the father and children, and said that some of the contact had been very good.  He is attentive towards them and provides good food.  Her criticism of the father was in his management of difficult conversations with the children, saying that he would never stop  or deflect the discussion, even when it was very upsetting for the children.  She said at one point that the father would go &#8216;on and on&#8217; and had done this on a visit in December 2022 even though he could see that the oldest child was crying.  Whilst the children had become more able to tell their father when he was upsetting them, he does not always listen.

She concluded that he was suffering from trauma in a depressed form from the ambiguous loss of his children.  She recorded that at one point in the interview the father said the mother was the only one to blame, and that she was a pathological liar and a fascist. He saw the mother as highly deceitful, and this has endured since the relationship broke down and this continues to adversely affect his ability to engage positively with the children. Ms Gill stated that at times he was chronically unable to regulate his emotions and became distressed and angry as a result of repudiatory behaviour shown by the children.  Ms Gill recommends that he undergoes individual therapy, of a type described by her as schema therapy.</p>

Absent from the report is any reference to the findings of His Honour Judge Rutherford, the observations of contact or the wider evidence in the case. It is not unusual in my experience for an expert to interview the parents and conduct psychological testing before reading the papers, but it is unusual for there to be so little reference to the wider context in the overall assessment.  Notwithstanding Ms. Gill&#8217;s assurances that she had read all the papers and took all the evidence into account, I consider that her assessment was narrowly based on her own interpretation of the results of the structured attachment based interviews she carried out rather than upon the evidence as a whole.</p>

The caseworker observed contact on a number of occasions and expressed concern that little had changed over the period of over two years with respect to contact.  I have set out her recommendations above, which did not change materially during the course of her oral evidence.  In particular she said that whilst she recognised the damaging effect on the children of the prolongation of these very long proceedings, on balance she considered that it was right for these proceedings to be adjourned to allow the parents to undertake a parenting apart programme.  She was rather more neutral on the need for the father to undergo a DAPP, but did state that if he was to do this, it should take place alongside the PAP. She recommended that the contact continue to be supervised and then supported.</p>

I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence about this.  Whilst there are no transcripts or recordings of the video contacts in early 2018 I bear in mind that there is independent evidence of the father&#8217;s behaviour causing the children distress before 2017 and again later. It is not difficult to believe that the sort of conduct that has been described on those occasions also occurred when there was nobody but the children present, particularly because the father lacks insight into the effect of his behaviour on other people.</p>

He was unwilling adapt the direct contact arrangements so as to allow the supervision to continue longer than was envisaged by the 2017 court order.  He placed emotional pressure on the children, for example by telling A on a Skype call at the end of March/beginning of April 2018 that they (the children) had been mean to him, and that S was behaving as she was because of the mother.  Rather than examine his own conduct and how he could make things better, the evidence shows that he tried to place the responsibility on others, notably the mother.  He concluded that the fact that he had a good relationship with his other son L (who has a different mother) meant that he could not be blamed (for the most part) for the problems he was having with S and A.</p>

The earlier exchanges about contact were directed through his solicitors. In an early email he offered assurances that he would not act angrily towards the children in contact. His dismay at the thought of the children refusing to come to contact when it cost him so much to come to this country, rent accommodation,  pay for the supervisors and organise nice outings, was understandable.  He explained to the mother in March 2019 that it was not good for the children to have an image of their father &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">humiliated, powerless, and without any integrity, stripped of all his rights&#8230;..a father you can just toss around as you please, as if he were a toy. Also I am not prepared to sacrifice my integrity and so do something I think is wrong for the children, something you can impose through sheer brute power just because of the current logistical situation&#8217;</span>.

She acknowledged as much herself, particularly so far as the video contact was concerned. I further accept that the children may have received some subtle messages from the mother and others (for example the school) reinforcing their anxiety about their father. Examples of this are the mother telling them about their half-brother, the father not being told that the family were moving to the country in the lockdown and not being kept informed about the change of schools, and S being given support at school.  Most parents in the position of the mother would be anxious and protective of the children, and I accept that this was the case with this mother. I accept her evidence that she did not know how to raise the move and change of schools with the father without eliciting an angry response and that she was worried that he might seek to block this through the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is my firm view that contact between the father and children should continue to be supervised for the time being, but with a light touch so that the supervisor keeps a distance unless she judges that the children need her to be closer. I recognise the father finds this somewhat unnecessary and humiliating, given the fact that he does not pose any physical risk to them, but the emotional pressure he has put on them has caused them a lot of anxiety and upset. If this does not happen whilst the parents undergo the PAP programme the children are likely to be extremely resistant to going no matter how much persuasion is used.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is very important here to reflect upon the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings as set out in the report of Ms Higgins.  As this judgment will be published I will not repeat the words of the letter that S wrote to her (which mirrored what she said in their meeting) but I want to make it clear that in my judgment her views are grounded in her own experience and I give them very significant weight.  All family judges must be alert to situations where the views of children are not authentically their own, but here S&#8217;s  views are consistent with the findings I have made.  A&#8217;s views are slightly different as he appears to be less affected by his father&#8217;s past behaviour.  Although S has said she does not want to go to contact, she has said she will go if A goes, and that appears to be an important way in.  Ms Higgins emphasized her view that it is very much in S&#8217;s long term best interests to give her relationship with her father this chance before she reaches an age where she will make all the decisions herself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A particularly difficult issue is whether I should make a final order for supervised contact on the basis that the parents will attend the PAP which should enable them thereafter to come to an agreement about any progression of contact. These children have now been subject to proceedings almost all their lives.  S is14, which is an age where a young person should be able to focus on friends and school work, as well as what goes on at home. I am very concerned about the effects of prolonging these already excessively long proceedings on them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, the attempt by the judge to bring proceedings to an end in 2017 did not serve to bring the conflict to an end.  The mother told me that whilst she wants the proceedings to be over she is unsure whether, should this happen, the situation will go downhill.  The father feels similarly, from his own perspective. Ms Higgins has recommended, on balance that the proceedings should be adjourned to give these children (particularly S) one last chance to have a proper relationship with her father before it is too late.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On a very fine balance I have decided to accept this recommendation.  A regime of &#8216;light touch&#8217; supervised contact together with engagement with the PAP should protect the mother and children from unacceptable harm at the same time as enabling the children to benefit from a relationship with their father.  The court can consider final arrangements once the PAP has come to an end.  In the interim the order for contact will be for two consecutive days every holiday and half term, with video contact to remain the same.  This can be looked at again at the next hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am asked to make a decision about the funding of the Parenting Apart Programme. It is not cheap. I am very conscious that the father has had to spend a lot of money on legal representation (as has the mother) and of the long term cost to him of the contact arrangements.  On the other hand, I have found that he bears the lion&#8217;s share of  responsibility for the problems that have arisen in contact.  Neither party has endless resources.  In all the circumstances I have decided that the father should pay for the PAP course. This is not a case of needing to give a message to the mother to engage in the programme; I am sure she will, for the benefit of the children.  There are considerable arrears of child maintenance too, which will have caused her some further hardship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have also been asked to make two further decisions about costs and funding. First I am asked to decide that the father should pay the costs of the supervision of contact. That has been the pattern to date. Second, I asked to revisit an earlier decision that the mother should share the costs of Ms Gill&#8217;s attendance to give evidence equally with the other parties so that the costs should be shared only as between NYAS and the father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have decided that the father should pay for the costs of supervision of contact. This broadly reflects what has happened in the past, save that the mother made a small contribution until 2022. Having heard this case I have decided that supervision is still required for the time being because of the father&#8217;s conduct rather than anything else. I accepted the evidence of the supervisor that the mother encouraged the children to go.   I do not think it right for her to pay towards it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to Melanie Gill,  I do not think I should revisit my earlier decision. The relevant facts behind her instruction and the need for her to give evidence are multi-faceted.  She was engaged at the instigation of NYAS, not the father or mother. Once she had prepared her report it was inevitable that she would have to give oral evidence, and in this regard I do not think it is right to draw a distinction between any of the parties as to their responsibility for this or their liability to pay.  Ms Gill did attend remotely in the end which will at least mean the cost is less than otherwise had been thought.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally I would like to extend my grateful thanks to the advocates in this difficult case. It is sadly rare in private law proceedings for there to be representation on all sides. This case has been impeccably prepared and presented by all and the advocacy was of the highest standard. This has not only benefited the parties, but the court too.</p>
