However, Mrs Fleischmann made clear at that stage that the wife sought a greater than 50% share in her ancillary proceedings.  The CPS indicated that agreement between the husband and the CPS was imminent to the effect that the &#8220;available amount&#8221; for confiscation was 50% of the net proceeds of the house on the basis that that sum represented the husband&#8217;s interest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the court is concerned with the position as it exists under the provisions of POCA.  However, in the light of the argument raised by Mrs Fleischmann , it is necessary to summarise the powers of the High Court prior to the provisions of POCA coming into force, when restraint and confiscation proceedings were governed by the <span style="font-style:italic">Criminal Justice Act</span> 1988 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/33" uk:canonical="1988 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJA 1988</ref>) and the <span style="font-style:italic">Drug Trafficking Act</span> 1994 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1994/37" uk:canonical="1994 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">DTA 1994</ref>).  Under that earlier regime, whereas confiscation proceedings were conducted in the Crown Court, the jurisdiction over the making of restraint orders, the appointment of receivers and the enforcement of confiscation orders rested with the High Court.  In that context, the situation would arise in a number of cases whereby the claim of the divorced wife of a drug smuggler, money launderer or other criminal who sought ancillary relief under the <span style="font-style:italic">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> 1973 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>) was in conflict with the claims of the Crown, represented either by the CPS or by Her Majesty&#8217;s Customs and Excise, to the extent  that the making of a property adjustment order in the ancillary relief proceedings would have the effect of reducing the amount available for confiscation as provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1994/37" uk:canonical="1994 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">DTA 1994</ref>.</p>

Carried to its logical conclusion that would offer a material advantage to a spouse who rushed into divorce and ancillary relief proceedings as soon as she discovered the slightest grounds for suspicion that her husband was involved in drug dealing and a corresponding disadvantage if she delayed&#8230;. A further consequence would be an unseemly competition between the prosecution and the Crown Court, where the wife would not be heard, and the solicitors acting for the wife in ancillary proceedings, from which the prosecution would be absent.  First come, first served, would be unlikely to produce a just result.  These are persuasive arguments for the view that, notwithstanding any perceived &#8220;priority&#8221;, the decision of the courts should not be confined to enforcement of a confiscation order first and exclusively, but even where a confiscation order has been made, provided the circumstances justify (for example, as here, where a wholly innocent spouse and property untarnished by drug dealing or its profits are involved), the enforcement process should at least acknowledge the existence of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> and the power of the court to exercise its discretion by taking account of the interests of the innocent spouse as well as the criminal defendant.&#8221;</p>

Section 6(4) deals with the matters which the court must decide at a confiscation hearing in respect of any benefit received by a defendant from his criminal conduct.  In a qualifying case, the court must make a confiscation order requiring the defendant to pay the &#8220;the recoverable amount&#8221;: section 6(5).  The &#8220;recoverable amount&#8221; is the defendant&#8217;s benefit from his criminal conduct, unless he shows that the &#8220;available amount&#8221; is a lesser sum: section 7.  If the defendant shows that the available amount is less than the defendant&#8217;s benefit from criminal conduct, the recoverable amount is the available amount or (if the available amount is nil) a nominal amount: section 7(2).</p>

The phrase retains such &#8220;elasticity&#8221; as to permit a diminution in the available amount and it contemplates striking an appropriate balance between the same competing public policy considerations between confiscating the proceeds of crime and making proper financial provision for a wife.  For the reasons given in <span style="font-style:italic">Customs &amp; Excise v A</span>, injustice may be caused by too rigid an application of the confiscation principle where the interests of an &#8220;innocent&#8221; or former spouse are concerned.  Removal of the discretion of the High Court to make financial provision in such circumstances would be a substantial change in the law and the jurisdiction of the High Court and it is clear to me that the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> remains unaltered in that respect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the representation of a third party, such as the wife in this case, in relation to confiscation proceedings in the Crown Court, there is no provision contained in  POCA for representation or argument to be presented  by the third party at the stage when the confiscation order is made.  In this respect the position is the same as that which existed under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/33" uk:canonical="1988 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJA 1988</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1994/37" uk:canonical="1994 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">DTA 1994</ref>.  This is because, when making a confiscation order, the Crown Court must disregard what a former wife may obtain in other proceedings over and above any interest  which she holds at the time of the confiscation order is made.  The mere right of the wife to apply for relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> does not amount to &#8220;an interest&#8221; falling within the terms of section 69(3)(a) of POCA: see section 84(2)(f).  At that stage, the Crown Court has no regard to, and makes no allowance for, any possible adverse consequences for a former spouse and her child when deciding the amount to be confiscated.  The court&#8217;s function is simply to conduct an arithmetical exercise to determine the assets available for confiscation: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Ahmed and Qureshi</span> (C.A.) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2004/2599" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Crim 2599" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Crim 2599</ref>.</p>

As the House of Lords explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Norris</span>[2001] 1WLR 1388, this is the stage of the procedure in which third party&#8217;s rights can not only be taken into account but resolved&#8230;.  It would be at that stage that the court would have to consider whether or not it would be proportionate to make an order selling the home in the circumstances of the particular case&#8230;  The court would undoubtedly be concerned to ensure that proper weight is given to the public policy objective behind the making of confiscation orders, which is to ensure that criminals do not profit from their crime.  And the court will have a range of enforcement options available with which to take account of the rights of third parties such as other members of the Ahmed family.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By way of contrast with the position at the stage the confiscation order is made, POCA gives a right to an affected third party make representations in relation to the making, variation etc of restraint orders and the enforcement of confiscation orders: see sections 42(3), 49(8), and 53(8).  These provisions give effect to the requirement in section 69(3) to allow persons other than the defendant and the recipient of the tainted gift to retain or recover the value of his or her interests.  Albeit POCA treats the function of the Crown Court at the confiscation stage as a limited one which does not involve the consideration of the practical effects of an order properly made on third party interests, if a property adjustment order is made in favour of a third party such as the wife in this case, the Crown Court must have regard to it in determining the &#8220;available amount&#8221;.  Similarly, if a property adjustment order is made after the confiscation order but before enforcement, the Crown Court must, on the application of the CPS or the defendant, have regard to it in adjusting &#8220;the available amount&#8221; under section 23 of POCA.</p>

She also acknowledged that, under POCA, the Crown Court is obliged to make an order requiring the defendant to pay the recoverable amount which, unless or until the ancillary relief proceedings were concluded in favour of the wife would be for 50% of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home.  She submitted that, in those circumstances, it would be unsatisfactory for the ancillary relief and the confiscation proceedings to be determined other than at the same time.  Only by this means would one avoid the need for the wife, if successful, to return to the Crown Court  after the making of the confiscation order, but prior to enforcement, in order to discharge the restraint order under section 42(3)(b) of POCA, in conjunction with an application by the CPS or the defendant to vary the confiscation order by substituting for the amount required to be paid (i.e. 50% of the proceeds of sale) a nominal order, or other appropriate sum.</p>

However, it is equally clear to me that, the sole jurisdiction to deal with all matters of restraint, confiscation, and enforcement now resides in the Crown Court (save that the High Court is the venue for applications made by the enforcement authority for recovery orders pursuant to section 243 POCA).  Thus, the Family Division of the High Court has no jurisdiction to make the order sought by Mrs Fleischmann.</p>

The practical consequences of the course proposed by Miss Fleischmann would have a profound effect on the general conduct of criminal cases where confiscation orders are made, in particular in relation to complex drugs cases involving co-defendants and lasting weeks or months.  It is essential in such cases that confiscation is dealt with by the trial judge and, wherever practicable, this course should be followed.  Findings usually have to be made as to the precise role of several defendants in a case, the positions of each in the hierarchy of criminality, what drugs each was in possession of and when, and whether to apportion &#8220;benefit&#8221; as between the defendants.  Such issues can only be satisfactorily resolved by the trial judge having formed a view of the case in the course of the trial and, if evidence is given in the course of the confiscation hearing, by acting as both judge of both fact and law.  Only thus can there be proper consistency between the views of the judge taken at sentence and upon confiscation.</p>
