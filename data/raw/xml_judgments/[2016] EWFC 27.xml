A great deal of material was in fact supplied in late 2013 and early 2014, albeit the process was not as smooth as it ought to have been.  On one occasion, the second most senior investigating officer attended a hearing before me with a legal adviser and on a later occasion a witness summons had to be issued to ensure that (so it was then thought) all information had been supplied.   </span></p>

This was a covert recording made by the police in the parents&#8217; home on 27/28 September 2013, immediately after their release on bail following their arrest.  The recording had been authorised under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/23" uk:canonical="2000 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</ref>.  It is of poor quality but it includes a conversation involving the mother that on one interpretation might conceivably have been relevant to the accounts given by the parents about K&#8217;s death.</span></p>

It was only at an advanced stage in the criminal disclosure process that the Crown Prosecution Service, having itself become aware of the recording, advised that it should be disclosed to the defence.  Prosecution counsel also appreciated that it should have been disclosed to this court in 2013 and so advised.  At that point the parties to the family proceedings and the court were informed and in due course the Guardian made his application.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The first issue is whether the findings of the family court should be revisited in light of the disclosure of the recording.  The threshold for reopening is that there is a real reason, based on solid grounds, for believing that a different outcome might result.  Having studied the issue closely, none of the parties applies for this to happen.  For my own part, I am independently satisfied that the further information falls far short of crossing the threshold for reopening the case.  In particular, the confused and partially audible recording does not cast significant doubt upon the mother&#8217;s evidence or supply any plausible alternative explanation for K&#8217;s injuries.  True it is that the father has not been convicted of any offence and continues to deny responsibility for K&#8217;s death, but that is no reason for this court to reconsider its conclusions.  </span></p>

The existence of the recording was known to the three investigating officers in 2013, but they did not consider that it had any evidential value.  It should have been obvious, in particular to the officer who appeared before me just four weeks after the recording was made, that it had to be disclosed, but it was not.  Because of its special status, it was not held on the case file.  The Constabulary&#8217;s lawyers and the officers who were not involved in the investigation process were therefore not aware of its existence until a much later stage.</span></p>

It is governed by protocols and on occasions reinforced by court orders.  The criminal and family courts must be able to rely on assurances that all relevant material has been disclosed, though in some cases they may have to resolve claims of public interest immunity.  </span></p>

Moreover, there was an unusually drawn-out sequence of events surrounding police disclosure.  In those circumstances, the failure of Cumbria Constabulary to disclose the recording was particularly regrettable.  It has led to further anxiety for the mother and significant extra expense for the public.  </span></p>

I also note the expression of regret made on behalf of the Chief Constable, reflected in the attendance of the Assistant Chief Constable at this hearing, and the assurances that lessons have been learned from this unhappy episode.  In the circumstances, there is in my view nothing to be gained from any further action by the family court.  These proceedings are accordingly concluded.</span></p>
