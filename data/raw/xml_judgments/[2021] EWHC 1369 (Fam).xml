	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">The father is Italian, but has lived in Lanzarote, Spain, since he was seven years old. He is now aged 36. The mother is British; she is 28 years old, and has lived in Lanzarote for most of the period since 2012. The relationship of the parties began in or about 2012. They separated for a period, and at that time, the father moved briefly to live in England with a new partner who was expecting their child. The mother too returned briefly to England.  In May 2015, the mother returned to Lanzarote, reconnected with the father (who by then had also returned), and they resumed their relationship.  They lived together for about five years until January 2021.  The father in fact has <span style="font-style:italic">two</span> children living in England with whom he has no current contact, and who he does not (it is agreed, but for different reasons) support financially. </p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">The parties have very different perspectives on the quality of their relationship. The mother describes it as one in which she felt controlled and coerced, and in which she suffered more vivid forms of domestic abuse, including physical violence. She avers that the family lived in relative penury given the low paid work which mother and the father both had locally; the father is/was a disc jockey, and the mother did bar work initially in the same entertainment complex. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">The parents were never married.  Both boys were born in Lanzarote.   There is a dispute on the face of the papers as to who was the primary carer of the boys throughout their lives; it is obvious (as indicated above) that both parents worked, and doubtless there was some sharing of parenting tasks.  It seems to me on the evidence that the mother assumed the greater responsibility for child care, but it is neither necessary, nor appropriate, for me to make any further comment, let alone finding, on this issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">In the autumn of 2020, the mother, on her account struggling emotionally to cope with the difficult relationship with the father, consulted her Spanish GP, who in turn referred her to a psychiatrist who prescribed her anti-anxiety medication. The mother was also referred to a social worker for support. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">On 8 January 2021 the mother informed the father that she had arranged flights to leave Lanzarote with the children on the following day in order to return to England. The father informed the mother that he did not agree to this, and that if she wanted to leave there needed to be some form of formal or legal arrangement in place concerning the children. The police were called, but no action was taken.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">On 14 January 2021, the mother removed O from school, and then took both boys to the airport and fled Spain; she did this by stealth, without notice to the father.  She flew with the boys to England, where they are now all staying with the maternal grandfather.  The father immediately lodged a complaint with the police in Lanzarote, alleging abduction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">On 19 January 2021 the mother issued proceedings in Spain for sole custody and &#8216;Guardianship&#8217; of the two children, and financial maintenance.  Within the proceedings the mother seeks leave to relocate the children to England, offering contact with the father. Her lawyers in Spain have filed detailed pleadings and statements supporting the mother&#8217;s case. There is to be a hearing on 7 July 2021 in the court in Spain; I am told (but this has not been verified) that this is to be a remotely conducted hearing on video-platform. The mother asserts that she has been advised by her Spanish lawyer that she will succeed in her claim for sole custody, and permission to relocate to England. It is said (by the mother) that in those proceedings, the father has agreed that the children will remain living primarily with their mother. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">The father continues to live in Lanzarote. His wider family live there, or elsewhere in the Canary Islands.  He has been out of work for a significant period of time given the impact of Covid-19 on the tourism industry in Spain as elsewhere.  He currently receives &#8364;300 income per month in state benefits and some additional cash in hand for working in a Vape shop.  The rent has not been paid on the parties&#8217; apartment for the last year, and the arrears are now said to be approximately &#8364;6,500.   The mother has no employment in Spain or England, and she maintains that she has no means of supporting herself should she and the children return to Spain.  Historically, the family struggled to make ends meet, and the situation now and for the foreseeable future &#8211; according to the mother &#8211; is likely to be worse than it was. </p>

There are significant arrears of rent outstanding, and this has been so for many months.  While the landlord is said (by the father) to be very understanding and has not indicated (so far as I know) any intention to take possession of the apartment in the near future, or at all, it remains a largely unsustainable option for the mother in anything but the short term.   That said, it is at least currently available for the mother and children should she return, and the father has willingly agreed to vacate to give her and the children their own space; </p>

I do note that the Handbook entry on which Ms Renton relies (see &#167;42 above) contemplates that even if the parent who has removed the children would be placed in &#8220;dire financial circumstances&#8221; it is suggested that this would not warrant a finding of &#8220;grave risk&#8221; / &#8220;intolerability&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in">The mother&#8217;s claims of domestic abuse at the hands of the father are powerfully made, in my judgement, but can be adequately met in the short term by a combination of (a) the father&#8217;s voluntary undertakings offered to this court which I accept, (b) the assistance and support of social services in Spain in her return (referred to by ICACU), and (c) any orders from the Spanish Court.  The Spanish Court will doubtless be alive to the fact, as I am myself, that coercive and controlling behaviour can take many forms &#8211; including financial abuse &#8211; and its insidious and pervasive nature can be difficult to contain or manage through the giving of formal undertakings as to molestation.  As the case moves forward, I trust that the Spanish Court will impose whatever strictures are considered appropriate and necessary to manage the parents&#8217; relationship and their behaviour towards each other going forward if the mother is even in the short-term living in Spain.  All that said, I note that notwithstanding the complaints of abuse, the mother had contemplated &#8211; through her very recent statement filed in these proceedings &#8211; a situation in which she and the father would be living separately in Spain, and that the father would be having visiting and staying contact with the boys. </p>
