On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2017, I gave the Queen&#8217;s Proctor permission to intervene in the petition with case management directions leading to a full hearing which has taken place today.</p>

The petitioner is a Dutch national and the respondent a Bulgarian national. The petitioner has, he asserts, been habitually resident in this jurisdiction at all material times. The parties met in Greece in about 2002 and began living together in 2004.  It seems that they lived at the petitioner&#8217;s property in ancient Epidaurus in Greece and also at other times in a workshop used or occupied by the respondent in Greece. They also spent time together living in a property in Bulgaria which the respondent had inherited.</p>

The Queen&#8217;s Proctor avers that this was, in fact, a PO Box address run by a company called Mailboxes Etc. and was not a residential address at the time of the marriage. </p>

In documents produced for this application, the respondent has asserted that it was in January 2015 that she and the petitioner separated and she has produced a substantial body of documents demonstrating that until that date their relationship was continuing. In view of the way in which I consider that this application can be dealt with, it is unnecessary for me to consider that evidence in any detail. The respondent asserts in documents she has supplied to the Queen&#8217;s Proctor that she was not aware that she had been divorced by the petitioner until after the break up of their relationship in 2015.  Indeed, she asserts that she did not receive the decree nisi and decree absolute until March 2016.</p>

She pointed out that the address is not a residential address, but, rather, an address of Mailboxes Etc.  She further averred that this was an address used by the petitioner for the service for delivery of documents and asserted that, on a regular basis, he received mail at his address in Epidaurus in envelopes from Mailboxes Etc.   She asserted, as is indeed accepted, that no accommodation which matches the description of &#8220;Suite 102&#8221; exists in the building and that no floor, apartment or any part of that property is owned or rented by either the petitioner or her.</p>

That application came before me initially, as I have said, on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2017.  On that occasion, as I have said, I gave the Queen&#8217;s Proctor permission to intervene in the petition and directions for the future of the application.

In that case, the parties opposed the Queen&#8217;s Proctor&#8217;s application on the grounds, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that, although neither of them had ever lived at the false address given in the petition (which was the same false address as given in the majority of the 180+ petitions), the respondent had, as a matter of fact, been habitually resident in England at the time that the petition was filed so that the courts of England and Wales would, as a matter of law, have had jurisdiction under Article 3 of Brussels IIa when the petition was issued.  To that, the Queen&#8217;s Proctor responded that his plea was not advanced solely on a jurisdictional basis, but, rather, on the grounds that the decrees had been granted as a result of a serious deception of the Court, namely, by the provision of the false address.  In other words, he asserted that, even if the respondent had, in fact,  been habitually resident within the jurisdiction, within the meaning of the relevant legislation, namely, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.5</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973</ref> (as amended), the divorce proceedings were &#8220;still tainted by deception of the Court&#8221;  and for that reason the Queen Proctor maintained his claim.</p>

In other words, Mr O&#8217;Brien submits that, contrary to the decision of the President, it is not either necessary or appropriate, as a matter of law or public policy, for decrees to be set aside on the basis of a false address when, as a matter of fact, the petitioner would have been entitled to a divorce on the basis that he was, in fact, habitually resident in this jurisdiction.</p>

In my judgment, it matters not that the petitioner may have been entitled to a decree on the grounds that he was, in fact, habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  He so asserts and I am in no position to judge whether that is true or not.  Like the President, I proceed on the basis, for the purposes of this analysis, that he is correct, but, like the President, I conclude that, even if he is right in saying that he was habitually resident in this jurisdiction so as to give the Court jurisdiction to entertain the petition for divorce, that does not avail him in his case.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my opinion, the right course is to dismiss the petition.  It is so tainted by material irregularity that it would be a travesty of public policy to allow it to proceed in the way in which Mr O&#8217;Brien proposes.  There is nothing to prevent his client filing a fresh petition in proper form and seeking a divorce on that basis.  If that happens, then it may be that the parties litigate the financial issues that are plainly underlying these events, but that is a matter for them. It is not a matter which I consider necessary to consider further at this hearing today.</p>
