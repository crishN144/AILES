It should be noted that the husband has paid all the costs of all the experts, this being the main reason why there is a difference between the parties&#8217; totals. The husband has also paid the majority of the wife&#8217;s legal costs so this has been an expensive exercise for him.</p>

He is a Country A citizen by origin and has two children from a previous marriage, the youngest of whom is aged 17, and who live in Country A. He has lived in England since 2010 and now also has UK Citizenship.  English is not his first language, but he is fluent in English and language has not been an issue here. He has had a successful business career in the manufacture of particular products, still owning and running a business which he started in Country A in 2004, and which now operates as Company Y in Country A which owns its UK subsidiary Company Z.</p>

She gave up this career in September 2021 to pursue a competitive sports career. She has had some significant success in this career, but it has not provided her with an income, indeed it continues to be an expensive exercise. Instead, she has relied on financial support from the husband, initially given voluntarily, but unwillingly (and ultimately subject to court orders) since the separation. Her dream and aspiration (which appears not to be unrealistic) is to compete for Team GB in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Although the husband is a Country A national, throughout the period of the relationship the parties lived in England, always in London. This was always in rented accommodation, from 2016 to 2022 in a property in Northwest London. In Spring 2022, the husband purchased a property in his sole name in Berkshire and moved there himself and terminated the tenancy in respect of the rented accommodation. These events caused a good deal of ill feeling between the parties, as the wife wished to remain in London, and they have different accounts as to the extent to which the husband consulted the wife about these decisions; but I have not considered it necessary to make any findings about this in the context of my task. The long and short of it is that these events coincided with the breakdown of the relationship and the wife decided not to move to live with the husband at the new property and this was, in effect, the parties&#8217; separation.   </p>

In fact, it was comforting to hear that, despite this litigation, the parties have been able to be friendly to and cooperative with each other, at least in relation to the mutual care of their cats. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">In assessing the &#8216;duration of the marriage&#8217; for the purposes of my section 25 analysis below, I am satisfied that the relevant period is September 2010 to Spring 2022, some 11&#189; years. Mr Thorpe&#8217;s suggestion that I should ignore or attach less weight to the period of pre-marital cohabitation between September 2010 and December 2017 was, in my view, not consistent with the established law on this subject, which perhaps had its first articulation by Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">GW v RW</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2003] EWHC 611 (Fam): &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">where a relationship moves seamlessly from cohabitation to marriage without any major alteration in the way the couple live, it is unreal and artificial to treat the periods differently</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;. Most authorities since have accepted this proposition without challenge, for example the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Miller v Miller</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2006] UKHL 24, and I accept this as the established orthodoxy and the law binding on me. If the duration of the marriage in this case was 11&#189;</span> years then, whilst it may not be a very long marriage, that certainly does not place it in the &#8216;short marriage&#8217; category for which different considerations sometimes apply.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"> Mr Thorpe argues that I should include in my asset schedule a debt owed by the husband to the HMRC of &#163;90,344. <span class="within-new" style="color:initial">Mr Tyzack says I should not. </span>In this respect Mr Thorpe relies on a letter from HMRC dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024 in which the liability is asserted, which letter was disclosed only as an exhibit to the husband&#8217;s statement dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2024. On the face of the letter, this liability arises from the HMRC&#8217;s assessment of benefits in kind taken by the husband in the tax y/e 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020, in particular the rent paid via the company for the rented accommodation in Northwest London and the use of a motor car by the husband. The letter notes that this assessment follows similar assessments for the two previous tax years. While there is no challenge to the legitimacy of the HMRC letter itself, what is missing from this disclosure is evidence of the husband&#8217;s account with HMRC which would confirm whether or not the husband has paid all or some of this amount on account in advance of the assessment. He accepted that he had sold a property in Country A in 2021 and paid &#163;275,000 to HMRC and the evidence is unclear whether this payment covers (in full or in part) the assessed liability of &#163;90,344. The husband was a little vague about this in his evidence. Further, the witness statement itself says that the HMRC assessment &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">is currently being challenged</span>&#8221;, but no details have emerged of what this meant. In the circumstances, doing the best I can without best evidence, I have decided that the fairest thing for me to do here is to include a figure for half of this amount on my schedule, i.e. the figure of &#163;45,172.</p>

Mr Tyzack says I should not. On closer analysis, this is a liability which has not yet arisen (it is assessed as at 31</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">st</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> December 2024 and is payable on 31</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">st</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> July 2025) and may be an ongoing annual charge, at least until 2026 (there is a dispute as to whether the liability will cease five years after the husband ceased to be a Country A tax resident). Further, it seems likely (but no calculations have been put forward) that an assessed Country A tax would have to take into account any reduction in wealth caused by my ordering the husband to make payments to the wife. On balance I have decided that it would not be appropriate to include this figure in my asset schedule, which is intended to represent a current snapshot, though I note that the husband may have an ongoing extra tax liability in Country A which he will have to meet from his income, at least until 2026.</span></p>

He further challenges the increase in that figure to &#163;820,894 in the course of 2024 by the production of a schedule of payments made in 2024, though there was no real challenge to the schedule itself which largely consisted of payments made for the costs of this litigation. On balance, I have been persuaded that this Director&#8217;s</span> Loan Account liability does exist, is a problem for the husband, and should be included in my asset schedule.</p>

On these issues, the parties (or in the first instance the husband) have spent a substantial amount of money seeking the advice of various accountancy experts. Initially, Ms Fiona Hotson Moore of FRP, accountants, was appointed as the SJE. Subsequently, she parted company with FRP and another accountant from that firm, Mr Jon Dodge, stepped into her shoes as SJE. Later, Mr Paul Singleton was instructed by the husband after a successful </span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Daniels v Walker</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> application.

The reasons for this are many. In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold.

First, most of the figures produced for the holding company are expressed in Country A currency. Inevitably, the &#163; to Country A currency exchange rate moves around over time. For the purposes of my calculations, for mathematical convenience and the fact that the rate has been hovering around this figure, I propose to use the figure of &#163;1 = 14 in Country currency. Secondly, there are some Country A tax issues which have an effect on our calculations.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">These figures were produced before the very late company real property valuations were produced. After this, Mr Dodge, in a report dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2024, expressed the view that since the real property valuations significantly exceeded the equivalent figures in the company accounts, he would be minded to increase his valuation figure by Country A currency 26,480,000(&#163;1,891,429) so that his valuation figure would now be &#163;15,644,643 + &#163;1,891,429 = &#163;17,536,072. Mr Singleton, in a report dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2024, expressed the view that the new real property valuations made no difference to his figure of &#163;10,379,462.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both experts agreed that a proper calculation of the net value of the company would require a deduction for tax. If this was Country A Tax (which in my view is, on a balance of probabilities appropriate, taking a snapshot value now) this would result in a deduction of the Country A tax rate % of the value. This would produce a net valuation figure of &#163;11,980,644 on Mr Dodge&#8217;s figures or &#163;7,091,248 on Mr Singleton&#8217;s figures. Even if it had been my conclusion that UK tax rates should apply in this context, I remind myself that an increase in these rates in the UK seems likely in the foreseeable future, even if the precise details are not yet clear.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">So how should I determine the value of the company for the purposes of my task? I remind myself of the fragility of the exercise, and in particular the fragility of the assessment of the multiplier. I have listened carefully to a good deal of evidence of two very experienced professionals arguing with passion for this multiplier or that, backed up with numerous comparables which, as ever, have to be treated with caution in the context of the real world, where many factors come into play in fixing a sale price of a business. As often, there was a dispute as to which business sector was the most reliable indicator of multiplier selection. I could not say that I regarded one expert as having better answers to the many questions asked on the multiplier question. On a balance of probabilities I propose to take a multiplier between the two asserted figures, that is 7.25. I propose to use the agreed EBITDA figure and take the midpoint on the net debt dispute, i.e. Country A currency 66,000,000 = &#163;4,714,286. I preferred Mr Dodge&#8217;s view that a figure should be added for the late real property valuations, and I shall use his figure. I shall use the  Country A tax rate. Accordingly, I make a finding that the husband&#8217;s shareholding in Company Y is worth &#163;(7.25 x 2,403,571) = &#163;17,425,890 less &#163;4,714,286 (net debt) plus &#163;1,891,429 (real property uplift) = &#163;14,603,033 less &#163;4,626,241 (tax) = <span style="font-weight:bold">&#163;9,976,792. </span>This is the figure that I shall place in my schedule.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The experts did not have a very big disagreement as to the sustainable net income which the husband might expect to receive in the foreseeable future from this shareholding. Mr Dodge suggested &#163;601,000 per annum net. Mr Singleton said &#163;582,949 per annum net. I note in passing that the husband will probably have to meet from this sum a Country A Tax debt, at least for a period. He, of course, has his own debts to meet as well as his living costs and any provision ordered by me in favour of the wife.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of reaching conclusions about the outcome of this case I need also to apportion the extent to which the husband&#8217;s shareholding in Company Y is a matrimonial asset (the marital acquest, subject to the sharing principle) as opposed to a non-matrimonial asset (only usually to be invaded if needs are established). This exercise caused the experts to look at the business at the commencement of the parties&#8217; cohabitation in September 2010. It is common ground that the husband has held his shares in Company Y since 2004 and so the shares, on any view, existed prior to the relationship so have one characteristic of non-matrimonial property; but in so far as they have grown more valuable since 2010 by reference to factors other than passive growth, they will in part have acquired status as matrimonial assets.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two experts were able to agree, mostly by reference to an analysis of the accounts in the period leading up to 2010, that the value of those shares in September 2010 was &#163;1,250,000 before tax. That, of course, is a 2010 figure and (to produce a fair figure for a present calculation) a fair methodology needs to be identified for updating that figure. This is sometimes referred to as the assessment of the &#8216;springboard&#8217;. The arguments about how to decide on this issue have been traversed in leading cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Jones</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 41, <span style="font-style:italic">Martin v Martin</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 2866, <span style="font-style:italic">XW v XH</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 2262 and <span style="font-style:italic">Hart v Hart</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 1306. My attention was particularly drawn to the analysis in the well-known judgment of Wilson LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Jones</span> (supra), which seems to me to be apposite in the present case.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been persuaded by Mr Thorpe&#8217;s analysis that, on the facts, and on the chronology of the development of Company Y, a very important event was the purchase by Company Y of a UK company called Company Z (based in the North of England). This event occurred in August 2010 (albeit that the full ownership was transferred a little later) which was before the parties&#8217; cohabitation began. This might be identified as something of a paradigm &#8216;springboard&#8217; event because it can be seen from a detailed analysis of the group turnover figures that thereafter Company Y was moved on to a different level from which it has subsequently grown and developed. In these circumstances I have been persuaded that, in assessing the present day figure to be applied in this context, the fair way forward is broadly to follow the guidance of Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Jones</span> (supra) by doubling the initial valuation figure and then applying an appropriate share index. I have decided to accept Mr Tyzack&#8217;s suggestion by taking the average of the FTSE All Share Index, the FTSE 350 Index and the FTSE 100 Index of the period between September 2010 and the present, that is 1.54. Thus, I shall upgrade the 2010 figure from &#163;1,250,000 to &#163;3,850,000. From this must be deducted Country A Tax and I shall use the figure of 28% for this to reach the figure of &#163;2,772,000.</p>

I am satisfied on the evidence that if she wished to return to that career she could fairly easily do so. She is well qualified for it with a good track record and has only been out of the business for a short while. She is young and in good health. That represents her earning capacity for the purposes of my task. If she chooses not to pursue her earning capacity and instead seeks to pursue her aspirations in the sports world then that is her choice and entitlement but she cannot, I think, expect the husband to fund this any more and my assessment of her needs must be carried out on the basis of that she maximises her earning capacity from now onwards in paid work, not on the basis of a potential sports career. In my judgment at the MPS stage in April 2024 I indicated that this would be the likely conclusion at a final hearing and I have not been persuaded otherwise at trial.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, nobody has sought either an order for sale of the company or any kind of <span style="font-style:italic">Wells </span>sharing arrangement. I think that is perfectly sensible as the obvious solution here is to allow the husband to retain his shares, but to pay monies to the wife over time &#8211; the structure adopted by both parties in their open positions. There is, however, a real liquidity issue here and, in my view, since the value of the company represents the very dominant asset in this case, the common practice of allocating &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the resources in such a way as to reflect illiquidity and risk. Conventionally,&#8230;to allocate to the party retaining the business a greater share of the overall assets to provide a fair balance&#8221;</span> is very much in play here.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">We have investigated in the course of the evidence before me the possibility of extracting money from the company in different ways to fund a settlement for the wife. Options have included borrowing further money by the company against its real property or trade debtor figure, paying out from existing resources within the company and selling the company real property (for example to a commercial property investor) and leasing it back by some form of long lease which restricted any interference in the business itself by the purchaser, who would become the landlord (Mr Dodge felt that this should release significantly more than &#163;1,000,000). Mr Dodge thought all these were realistic possibilities, though with obvious downsides to the future of the business. Mr Singleton felt all these would be detrimental to the company, but (on this issue) my feeling was that he was articulating the likely reaction of a cautious business owner rather than addressing the court&#8217;s task of balancing the needs of a wife to receive capital as part of her divorce settlement against the risks arising to a business owner. In the end it will be for the husband to decide how he can raise money, and he needs to be given time to explore these possibilities more fully, but in my view one of these ways forward should be possible and should be seen by him as a necessary downside of retaining his company. Equally, it would be wrong for me to impose a regime of payments which risked the very survival of the company and a fair balance has to be struck.</p>

This will be ordered by the mechanism of a spousal periodical payments order with credit given for any monies received under the employment so the husband has the option as to how these payments are actually made. Then there should be a clean break. There will be a section 28(1A) declaration to prevent the extension of this term.</p>
