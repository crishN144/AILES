	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal framework in the period leading up to the beginning of this hearing was, to say the least, complex. Leaving legal issues to one side for a moment, no party suggested there should be a hearing without oral evidence; indeed most of the represented parties positively encouraged a process in which the parents, in particular, should give evidence from the witness box. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was intent, as I had been at the interlocutory hearings in early July, to ensure a fair and just decision-making exercise, mindful of the troubling chronology relating to the parents&#8217; thwarted attempts to first appeal and then discharge the placement order during the autumn, winter and early spring of 2012 / 2013. In short, I was determined to do justice and not injustice. A summary process, limited to legal argument focused on satisfying certain criteria, would not have been sufficient.  It would not have achieved fairness or been proportionate given the importance of the question at issue. The parents would have felt that they had been denied a proper hearing and with cause.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s application for discharge, whilst simultaneously arguing for continuation of the placement order, was based on pragmatism and a desire to achieve a swift but procedurally fair outcome to the proceedings. Mr Alistair Perkins of Counsel, so I believe, was instrumental in formulating the local authority&#8217;s legal strategy, anxious as it was to circumvent an application by the parents for judicial review which, almost certainly, would have taken many months to reach a conclusion. </p>

If I were to decide the parents&#8217; claim should prevail then the only proper course would be to enable them to participate at what would be a fully contested adoption application at which they would argue for rehabilitation.</p>

She invited me to dismiss the local authority&#8217;s application on the basis it was misconceived, arguing that if it were to proceed I would effectively be permitting a parent to apply to revoke the order in a way which circumvented both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/24/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24(2)</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last week, on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2013, Solicitors representing Mr and Mrs A issued an application for adoption. That fact enabled Ms Fottrell to go on to submit that the parents might achieve their central aim of securing a substantive hearing by making an application for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order. No party disagreed. Ms Fottrell suggested it was the only remedy in the current factual circumstances which does not offend the letter and spirit of the statute. And whilst that contention is almost certainly correct, it has to be said that until proceedings for adoption were begun there was no other available legal vehicle so as to enable the court to be seized of the issues.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Fottrell also contended that an application for leave to revoke the placement order and an application for leave to oppose the adoption are analogous. In order to succeed in relation to the former, and at a time <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">before</span> the child had been placed for adoption, a parent would have to demonstrate there had been a change of circumstances since the order was made. The court would then go on to consider whether or not to exercise its discretion and also whether the application has a real prospect of success (<span style="font-style:italic">Re F (a Child) EWCA Civ 439</span>). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the latter, an application for leave to oppose the adoption, a parent would have to satisfy the court there has been a change of circumstances which is relevant or material to the question of whether or not leave should be granted. The change in circumstances must be of an nature and degree sufficient on the facts of the particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion; and the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child throughout her life (<span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Adoption: Leave Provision) [2007] 2FLR 1069).</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So as to reconfigure the legal ambit of the hearing, Ms Fottrell drafted an order on Monday reciting that the parents&#8217; deemed application for leave to oppose the adoption would be heard at the same time (these three days) as the local authority&#8217;s revocation application. Thus, it was possible to make progress in a way which did not offend the statutory code whilst at the same time meeting the parents&#8217; desire for a substantive hearing.</p>

Those two children, both boys, (now aged 5 and 3) were made the subject of full care and placement orders in June 2011 essentially because of exposure to domestic violence, neglect and the mother&#8217;s problems in managing aggression. Expert assessments concluded that neither the mother nor AA had the capacity, maturity or motivation to parent. Nor did they demonstrate by their sporadic attendance at contact that they were committed to the boys. </p>

It was said by the professional witnesses that AW&#8217;s timescales were such that she needed permanency imminently so as to safeguard her present and future welfare needs. The Justices agreed with the experts that any changes the parents may have made had not then stood the test of time; and there was a requirement for about two years of therapeutic work which was outside AW&#8217;s timescales. She needed to be placed, without delay, in an adoptive placement.</p>

Asked in evidence about her reasons for stopping the psychological work, the mother said she had &#8220;felt (she) was doing so well.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t think she had a personality disorder any more and did not need to be going on a weekly basis. Moreover, she had been told by social services to &#8220;take 6 to 8 weeks off from everything&#8221; after MT was born. More generally, the mother said she did not feel the need to be amongst people at the group sessions who are suicidal.</p>

Moreover, her more recent advice is that that the mother &#8220;should continue to have psychological work to help with her underlying personality difficulties so that she can continue to be stable in her mental health, understand the triggers to her difficulties and continue to develop healthy coping mechanisms.&#8221; Dr Seneviratne recommends that the mother should continue with the Sun Project and also suggested Dialectical Behavioural Therapy &#8230; &#8220;for at least a year to effect and maintain change.&#8221;</p>

The mother said the project was &#8220;always there&#8221; for her and &#8220;open to (her) whenever (she) needed it.&#8221; She would go back if someone gave her an actual time and said she should keep to a schedule. </p>

She had spent more time with these parents than with others and knows the conversations she&#8217;s had with them. She has been clear that she has been willing to work with and has had a desire for them to be &#8220;good, healthy parents.&#8221; Ms Wofford can speak to the experience they have had from her team. There has been &#8220;honesty and integrity&#8221; from the social workers &#8211; Juliana, Maria and Rose &#8211; so that Ms Wofford is disappointed the parents could not bring (the fact of the pregnancy) to them. She thought the parents had taken lessons on board so that whilst she understands their &#8220;extreme motivator&#8221; she is having a &#8220;hard time holding it.&#8221; Her disappointment, she explained, is for the parents because of some of the progress she had thought was there.

The mother has made it plain she would challenge the local authority &#8220;every step of the way&#8221;.

The parents had the benefit of her wise judgment, her proper encouragement, her honesty and integrity in keeping them informed as to what was expected of them under the various plans as they developed for AW and MT. The parents could not, in my judgment, have had better quality social work; and therefore it is extremely disappointing that they have failed to achieve even basic honesty in their dealings with the local authority. </p>

Moreover, she was supremely well able to articulate her thoughts and opinions in a way which many other professional witnesses, including experts with a capital E, would struggle to match.</p>

AW needs security, stability, consistency and predictability. Her physical, emotional and developmental requirements should be met by individuals who are not only attuned to her but also have the opportunity to expend considerable energy in ensuring she thrives.</p>

She has made a very pleasing attachment to them as the result of the good connections earlier made with her &#8216;short term&#8217; foster parents. Ms Newton, who has seen AW within her current home, in the company of both prospective adopters, reports her as already being &#8220;their child.&#8221; When Mr A and Ms Newton entered the house together, AW&#8217;s face had lit up, she jumped off a chair, rushed towards him saying, &#8216;Daddy, Daddy.&#8217; AW, said Ms Newton, is very comfortable with Mr and Mrs A. They know her very well; she will seek out each of them for different tasks; she gets very good attention, one-to-one, and thus she has been able to attach very easily.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AW will be two years old next week. Little more needs to be said about her background than already emerges from the chronology. She has already had a series of moves. Throughout her time with foster parents and until 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April this year, AW saw her parents at contact. Between September and April, she was enabled to adjust to a reducing relationship with her mother and father. Now, since her placement with Mr and Mrs A, she is with the couple who are intended to be her adoptive family. </p>

It is a measure of their empathy and determination to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217; by AW that if I had decided to set about a process of reversing the process towards eventual adoption, they would have been prepared to keep her within their home rather than see her moved into a foster placement. All the signs are that AW has been quite exceptionally fortunate to find herself with such a superlative couple.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider any harm which AW would be at risk of suffering. She is, according to Ms Newton, an adorable, easy going child. Ms Newton has 110% sympathy for the parents and agreed that the mother does understand it would be difficult for AW to be moved again. Ms Newton believes the mother&#8217;s focus has been upon herself rather than AW; and I would have to say I agree  with that assessment in relation to both parents.</p>

Ms Newton&#8217;s view is that it would &#8220;just not be fair&#8221; to put AW through the disruption of a further move and assesses the chances of a negative outcome at 50:50 if she is returned to her parents.</p>

If eventually, at the end of a contested adoption hearing, AW were to be moved back to her parents she would be faced with the most demanding of circumstances. From being an only child with no competition from others for the attention of her &#8216;parents,&#8217; she would be the oldest of a group of three. MT is 15 months younger; the new baby will be two years and two months younger than AW. Any consideration of that situation would cause an outsider to have enormous fears for AW&#8217;s emotional wellbeing given her history, unable as she would be to make sense of what was happening and why. Moreover, she would be looked after by a young couple whose resilience and capabilities, thus far, have been untested save in relation to one still very young baby, MT.</p>

Her welfare demands that the relationship she had with her parents should be brought to an end by the making of an adoption order. Her parents are unable to provide AW with the secure environment she deserves. Any process of assessing the potential for AW to be reunited with them would be wholly outside acceptable time limits from AW&#8217;s perspective.</p>
