On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2018, the court made final declarations that SR lacks capacity to (a) conduct these proceedings and (b) make decisions as to where she should reside and (c) make decisions as to the care she should receive. An interim declaration was made that SR lacks capacity to make decisions as to her contact with others and A Local Authority was directed to file and serve an assessment of SR&#8217;s capacity to make decisions as to the contact which takes place with her husband JR. An assessment was conducted on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2018 by a social worker which concluded that SR lacks the mental capacity to decide with whom she has contact and any arrangements for such contact (C80).

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"> At the hearing on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2018, A Local Authority applied orally for orders restricting SR&#8217;s contact with her husband JR. A Local Authority sought orders preventing JR from taking SR out of the care home unless accompanied by a member of staff or a relative in the light of concerns on the part of A Local Authority about JR&#8217;s expressed views in relation to euthanasia and other comments made by him from time to time. A Local Authority expressed concerns that SR may be at risk of harm in her husband&#8217;s sole care.  In addition, A Local Authority sought orders that JR should not take SR out in a car without the support of a member of staff or a family member due to the risk that SR may become agitated and present challenging behaviour, which would be difficult for JR to manage if driving. In a Position Statement dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2018, A Local Authority modified its position and no longer seeks an order in relation to travel arrangements in the car, since it considers that the risk can be appropriately managed by SR travelling in the rear, wearing a seat belt and with child locks engaged.</p>

In closing submissions, Mr. Copnall stated that it may not be necessary for the Court to consider each and every particular comment alleged, if the Court is satisfied that JR has made a series of such comments over time to different professionals and lay persons.

They lived as husband and wife until SR was moved to reside at the current placement.  They raised three children and had active involvement with grandchildren. JR is aged 81 years and remains living in the family home. He retired at the age of 63 years and until the onset of his wife&#8217;s dementia, the couple spent most of their time in each other&#8217;s company.  They had planned to renew their wedding vows on their 60<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> wedding anniversary. ShR confirmed that her parents were a very close and happy couple, dedicated to each other. Professionals recognise the strong relationship between SR and JR (G45) and there is no dispute that JR is a devoted husband. He currently visits his wife twice daily at the current placement and keeps her company for up to three hours on each visit.</p>

SR went into respite care at the previous placement on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016 and returned to the family home on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2016.

On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016, a best interests decision was made that SR should remain at the current placement.  This decision was reaffirmed on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017 that SR should remain at the current placement in part because of the risks perceived by professionals arising from JR&#8217;s expressed view on euthanasia. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in"> Three attempts at mediation in October and November 2017 with the family proved abortive. The family declined an opportunity of further mediation in January 2018. The process of seeking to resolve issues surrounding SR&#8217;s residence and contact, without recourse to the court, has been elongated.  Relations between A Local Authority and health/care professionals and the family members have become increasingly strained. I note that notwithstanding the recurrent objections by family members and intermittent expressions of distress at separation from her husband from SR herself, no proceedings were initiated. The Assessor from the Deprivation of Liberty team expressed the view in her assessment dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2018 that SR had been displaying behaviours which indicated that she wants to leave the care home and were suggestive of an objection to the placement (D12/D22). She recommended that the paid Relevant Person&#8217;s Representative may wish to seek legal advice in relation to both SR and her family objecting to the decision for her to remain at the current placement (D22) An application was subsequently issued pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s21</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018 to challenge the standard Deprivation of Liberty authorisation in force dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2018.</p>

It is alleged that he also said he believed in euthanasia and if he could get pills, he would give his wife and himself some. This is the first of two conversations alleged to have occurred with other individuals visiting residents at the home. A further referral was made on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 when a member of the public reported that JR had stated he understood &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">why people do silly things and take lives</span>&#8217; (G55).

Indeed, the social worker noted that JR expressed the view that people were living too long and compared his wife&#8217;s situation with an animal that was ill and stated &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">you would put the animal down, out of its misery</span> &#8216;(G9-11).

In relation to the latter comment, it is not uncommon for family members to experience and articulate a range of emotions when witnessing and coming to terms with a loved one&#8217;s progressive and deteriorating condition. It does not however lead to the inevitable conclusion that JR will act in a manner to harm SR, which will result in bereavement. I wonder at this stage to what extent any form of counselling or support was offered to JR to deal with the sense of loss he was experiencing for his wife, himself and their plans for the future, as a result of witnessing his wife&#8217;s deterioration.</p>
