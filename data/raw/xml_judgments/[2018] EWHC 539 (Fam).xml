It may also be easier for GH to keep blaming herself for her father&#8217;s behaviour, than to face the painful and unthinkable realisation that he does not love her.</p>

Experiencing both positive and extreme negative behaviours from a parent, can lead to a child becoming almost co-dependent. In addition to GH&#8217;s descriptions of her father&#8217;s violence and aggression, she told me that her father also bought her nice presents, such as a princess coach and Barbie Doll, for her birthday. This combination of care and violence, sometimes referred to as &#8216;traumatic bonding&#8217;, can make it extremely difficult for a child to separate from the parent (Baker &amp; Schneiderman, 2013.)&#8221;</p>

The issue of whether GH will remain in the care of her current foster carers as a long term placement must be resolved immediately and without any delay whatsoever. It is vital that this young troubled and vulnerable girl knows where she is going to live and who is going to care for her long term.</p>

The mother accepted that direct and indirect contact with GH should only take place if and when the professionals judge it to be in her welfare best interests. Accordingly it is agreed I do not need to consider making a s.34(4) order in respect of the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of GH having contact with her father demands the very closest examination and consideration. He, as I have found, had repeatedly physically abused GH and has caused her grave emotional and psychological damage for which he accepts no responsibility whatsoever. GH blames herself for her father&#8217;s abuse. He denied and denies he has done so and, as set out above, he blamed GH for being exposed to adult sexual activity &#8220;it was her own fault&#8221;. This is a truly shocking and troubling stance for this father to take. Unless there is a fundamental and genuine change in his thought process and acceptance of his abusive actions and his responsibility, I do not see how contact, in any form, would be in the welfare best interests of GH.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially the local authority did not seek a s.34(4) order in respect of the father. On further reflection, it has changed its approach and yesterday invited me to make this order. Mr Jones, on behalf of the father, opposed the order on the basis that, taking account of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> an order was not needed and that the position of the father&#8217;s contact could be the subject of an appropriately worded recital. This would reflect the father&#8217;s current stance that contact should only take place when the professionals consider it is in her welfare best interests and GH wants to see her father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I disagree. In my judgment the father is a dangerous and manipulative man. He accepts no responsibility for his abuse of GH. In denying the truth of her allegations he is, in effect, accusing her of lying. I have no confidence that his current apparent co-operative and reasonable stance on the issue of contact with GH will be maintained in the future. An order under s.34(4) is a permissive order. My concerns about the father having contact are so grave that it is wholly appropriate for me to relieve this local authority of its statutory duty to promote contact between GH and her father. I am satisfied that the social workers will remain alive to this issue and if the time comes when it is considered to be in GH&#8217;s welfare best interests to have some form of contact with him, they will arrange the same.</p>

Although the father consents to the making of placement orders and consents to them being adopted, he has not signed the requisite consent forms.
