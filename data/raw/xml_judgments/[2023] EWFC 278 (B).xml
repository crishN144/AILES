There had before my involvement been a number of applications to adjourn this final hearing, which had been listed not in accordance with the PLO, but at a point significantly in advance of all evidence being filed such that no proper assessment could be taken of how long was needed, or any detailed analysis able to be undertaken of the necessary witnesses, and in particular which parts of the evidence were genuinely in dispute.  I shall return later to how much that has impacted upon some parts of this judgment.  No application has been made to me to adjourn this final hearing.  </span></p>

On any analysis of the timing of when reports have come in, and the documents that I have received, it is undeniably the case that both counsel and solicitors have been working outside any normal working hours.  I am immensely grateful to them all.  I should also set out from the commencement of this judgment, the Court&#8217;s appreciation of the constructive and collaborative way that this case has been presented and argued in general. </span></p>

It is exceptionally unusual for a baby to sustain so many fractures, but this baby did. The inherent improbability of a devoted parent inflicting such widespread, serious injuries is high, but then so is the inherent improbability of this being the first example of an as yet undiscovered medical condition. Clearly, in this and every case, the answer is not to be found in the inherent probabilities but in the evidence, and it is when analysing the evidence that the court takes account of the probabilities. </span></p>

It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so (see Re D (Children) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 668" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 668</ref>, Re SB (Children) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1161" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1161</ref>).</span></p>

That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction.

That is why, when presented with a speculative theory based on an unlikely hypothetical base, an expert will rarely discount it and will, in effect, never say never. Fanciful speculation is not an appropriate method of inquiry. What is needed and what the experts have endeavoured to achieve in this case is to piece together all the available information and look at the differential diagnosis. Some of the experts in this case specialise within a particular and very narrow field, and by reason of being experts of referral at centres of excellence, they acquire special knowledge and skill. However, concentration on a very narrow area of expertise can sometimes render it difficult for the expert to see the whole picture. It is for that reason that I find Dr S is best placed to view the overall picture. The judge has the duty of sifting the evidence from the experts, who form their assessments within their particular area of expertise, and the judge has to decide the case by reference to the identified issues. Although the medical evidence is of very great importance, it is not the only evidence in the case. Explanations given by carers and the credibility of those involved with the child concerned are of great significance. All the evidence, both medical and non-medical, has to be considered in assessing whether the pieces of the jigsaw form into a clear convincing picture of what happened.</span></p>

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability.  Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them.  However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not &#8220;who is the more likely?&#8221; but &#8220;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8221;  In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability.  Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion.  </span></p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">[63]&#160;Such findings where made in respect of a carer, often the mother, are of the utmost importance when it comes to assessments and future welfare considerations. A finding of failing to protect can lead a Court to conclude that the children's best interests will not be served by remaining with, or returning to, the care of that parent, even though that parent may have been wholly exonerated from having caused any physical injuries.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">[64]&#160;Any Court conducting a Finding of Fact Hearing should be alert to the danger of such a serious finding becoming 'a bolt on' to the central issue of perpetration or of falling into the trap of assuming too easily that, if a person was living in the same household as the perpetrator, such a finding is almost inevitable. As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.</span></p>

He responded that the fragility is presumably related to changes in the matrix of the bones, and that this can occur even with normal calcium levels. He explained this is because the bones matrix begins to thin out and the calcium structure around the collagen scaffold begins to thin out, and that may create weaker bones.  </span></p>

When pressed that there was a real possibility that a lack of vitamin D could contribute to bone weakness his response was that the balance of evidence does not suggest that is a real possibility.  He was challenged in relation to that, and it was clear that his difficulty with this proposition was that the phrase &#8220;real possibility&#8221; tipped the balance too much, and he could not agree with that.

His report is characteristically clear that he agrees there are two left sided rib fractures, the fractures were somewhere between half a month and 1 &#189; months old on 6 April 2023.  He was not of course able to say whether these had occurred together or separately, but they were consistent with having occurred on the same occasion.  The mechanism was more likely than not a sideways squeezing of the chest, explaining that force applied simultaneously to the left and right sides if of sufficient magnitude would cause accentuated bowing of the arc towards the back.  The sideways squeeze did not need to be precisely from side to side but could have been applied slightly diagonally, but this was unlikely to be a front to back or back to front squeeze. He set out of course that in an infant with normal bone structure it is generally accepted that rib fractures are not caused by normal handling by a reasonable carer, and that there was no radiological sign of any underlying conditions, in particular rickets.  </span></p>

Dr Olsen&#8217;s response to that was that it was impossible to know how much force the father had applied, which of course is the most important determinant.

The rib would break at the apex of the curve, giving the analogy of it being like a tree trunk if you bent it, it would break in the middle, where the curve is at its height.</span></p>

To summarise the findings that they now sought, they said the evidence now showed that there were a number of marks that the court should find were bruises upon AA, and that she did not suffer from any form of propensity to bruise easily, and therefore that these were inflicted bruises. In relation to the rib fractures, they sought a finding that AA suffered 2 inflicted rib fractures, that these were not caused by any accident, and were not caused in the father&#8217;s fall down the stairs.  They submit the Court should find that both sets of injuries were caused by the mother, and that the father had failed to protect AA.  In relation to the assertion that the Court could find properly that these were deliberately inflicted injuries, the local authority say that the court should find that on the basis of the medical evidence coupled with the mother&#8217;s oral evidence.   The reasons for the positive assertion that the mother was the perpetrator of what they say are inflicted injuries is set out in detail by the local authority in their closing and is largely based on their views of her oral evidence.</span></p>

She said the doctors seemed to have some knowledge of why she had been admitted, and that none of them made notes while she was with them. She said Dr N was there for five minutes, and in cross examination was clear that Dr N did not take a fresh history.   The mother was asked about Dr N having described bruises on AA&#8217;s back, but both she and the father were absolutely clear that AA has never had bruises on her back, they have never reported that, and nor has anybody else.    The father was asked about this and said that when he saw that in the doctors&#8217; evidence he was confused, but he denied that the reason for those records was because the doctors were right, or that the mother was now trying to reduce the number of marks.  </span></p>

No advocate has suggested to the contrary, and they have all attempted to assist the Court by grappling with what even the local authority describe as the difficulty in trying to &#8216;square the circle&#8217;, and they accept the existence of &#8216;anomalies&#8217;.  In my view there are a number of important pieces of evidence which appear to point in different directions, all of which need to be analysed.  I do not therefore consider the right approach to this case is to consider either the factual background, or the parents and their evidence, or the medical evidence in isolation.  Given the complicated medical situation, I do not consider it correct to decide firstly whether the marks are indeed bruises, and then to go on to consider who has caused them.   Similarly, I cannot simply conclude that the rib fractures are inflicted on the basis of the medical evidence.  In my view that would be to take an incorrect linear view.  Given the very stark, seemingly incompatible evidence, I must weigh matters more carefully and globally, and then consider the standard and burden of proof.</span></p>

Every paediatrician is very cautious nowadays in relation to bruising, not just in relation to dating, but in how bruises appear and change, and how long they last for.  Whilst I accept that some of these marks do act in the same way as bruises, I cannot ignore the fact that a number of them do not.  Even taking into account the caveats I set out above, it seems to me a very relevant matter of fact that some marks disappear in such a short space of time, which would be very unusual if indeed they were some form of dark purple bruise, given what dark purple bruising usually signifies in terms of the broken blood vessels.  </span></p>

However, when I look at for example the marks to AA&#8217;s bottom and her stomach, it is very difficult to comprehend how these could be caused.  A baby&#8217;s stomach is a soft and pliable thing, and the mark to AA&#8217;s stomach (mark 3) is such a strange shape, no matter how I consider it, or cast my mind to how that could be caused, it is difficult to understand how that could be caused such that it is a bruise.  Similarly, whilst I accept children are certainly caused injuries to their bottom by parents effectively spanking or hitting them on their bottom, given AA would in general be wearing a nappy, for such a mark to be caused deliberately a parent would have to inflict that, having removed the nappy, or that is a very severe assault.  Nappy changes can be difficult and frustrating time for parents, but there is no evidence that these parents struggled in relation to that matter.  A Court conducting this exercise does not need to work out how injuries are caused necessarily to children, but it is striking in this case the extent to which it is difficult it is to comprehend how they could be caused.  I accept that bruises can be caused to legs by grip injuries, but that amounts to only really only one of the marks alleged by the local authority, and one for which there is no photograph.  </span></p>

Dr A supports the extent of the mottling.

Appropriately in this matter, the experts accepted that whilst there appeared to be no medically proven link, there did continue to be some genuine debate in relation to this.     I must be cautious not to elevate discussion and debate which does not seem to have a medical basis, to something which is a proper factor in my considerations.  The same is true in relation to the genetic variation that AA suffers from COL5A1.  I must again be cautious that simply because something is a variant of unknown significance, does not mean it can be used to explain any potential difficulties away. The balance must be struck of accepting the limits of medical knowledge at the moment, and how that can change, with a proper analysis of the actual evidence, rooted in realism, to which I then apply the appropriate legal tests when considering if the local authority have made out their case. </span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It is accepted on behalf of the parents that the severity and frequency of the marks observed to AA does not seem to continue whilst AA is foster care, or once she is being cared for by her grandmother.  The evidence I have in relation to AA once she is in the care of her grandmother and whether she does sustain any marks is in truth very unsatisfactory.  The parents assert that there were some marks, but that not only did they believe the maternal grandmother would be informing the social worker of them, but that they have been specifically instructed not to take photographs of these of these.  These intelligent parents would also be acutely aware that whilst this would certainly be relevant, it could even have the potential to threaten the placement of AA with her grandmother or could be viewed as them criticising the grandmother.  AA is not yet one year old.  As she begins to roll, then crawl, then cruise she is inevitably going to suffer some bumps and even potentially some marks or bruises.  The parents do assert that AA appears to have quite a high proportion of bruises, and continues to have some odd marks, but with very few proper records it is very hard to work out whether there is any real relevance to this.  Whilst of course one explanation for the lack of marks on AA could be that she is no longer in her parents&#8217; care, it seems to me there are also real and genuine question marks in relation to a baby potentially having marks being caused by some other issue such as cutis marmorata, or skin mottling.  Given that uncertainty, if we do not know what really causes the marks, how do we know whether a change of carers removes whatever causes that, or whether a child growing older can impact on how their body reacts.  </span></p>

I certainly cannot elevate those medical issues postulated into being some definite explanation for these marks.  Similarly, simply because the medics have no real explanation other than inflicted injury, that does not enable the case to rest there.   I do not consider that I can make a positive finding that these are bruises, and then go onto consider who caused them.  The medical evidence is simply not clear enough in that respect, and there are some genuine aspects that point away from the Court making that determination without in any sense straining with the medical evidence. </span></p>

I have set out above the careful and extensive evidence in relation to whether the ribs could have been more susceptible to fracture.  The relevant medics were all prepared to accept a theoretical potential for there to have been some implications for AA&#8217;s bones in terms of the deficiencies in vitamin D.  They were also prepared to accept the father&#8217;s fall on the stairs as a potential mechanism.  Medical evidence in cases such as this is always set out with great care, and I am cautious not to elevate the fact that medics will very rarely say something is impossible.  In my view however in relation to the rib fractures, the evidence goes further than that, to a situation where the medics considered that fall and AA&#8217;s response to be an unlikely explanation, but one which they were prepared to accept could cause the fractures.  Importantly of course, it was accepted that even if AA&#8217;s bones were not susceptible to fracture more easily than would be expected, such an incident could still cause the fractures.  </span></p>

Again, I am conscious not to elevate an inability to rule things out with an ability for this issue to be genuinely relevant.  However there remains in my view a question of whether there could be some relevance to AA&#8217;s bones and bone density and possible fractures, when the issues with COL5A1 and vitamin D are combined.  </span></p>

In relation to the rib fractures, the choice is equally stark that one of the parents had either deliberately or in a moment of loss of control caused those injuries to AA in what would have been a significant incident, and if that is the same parent having done that, then consistently presenting her to doctors asserting that there may be something else wrong with her, in a way which most people realise could lead to their being further investigation of AA. Even if a parent did not realise that they had broken ribs, if this had been some form of inflicted injury a parent would surely have suspected that there may be some evidence of that on further investigation.</span></p>

The court would also have to conclude that potentially the mother caused an injury whilst AA was in hospital in February, as was suggested to her.  Similarly, given what happened on 4 April, then on that evening or on 5 April, either a parent knowing that a child is about to be examined the next day is unable to restrain themselves to such an extent that they cause further injuries, or that a parent deliberately causes injuries to be able to gain attention in some way, or feels the need to inflict those injuries and cannot prevent themselves.

It does not appear to me that the evidence suggests, even taken at its height, that they were struggling any more than any new parent would.   I am quite sure that if the mobile phones of any new parents were considered there would be the occasional message suggesting that their baby seemed to cry a lot, or displayed some characteristics that were not always entirely positive, such as being &#8216;fussy&#8217;.  These were first time parents, and there were inevitably some challenging times, or times that seem challenging when you are very tired.   I do not consider any of the evidence to be at a height to support a conclusion that as a result of that either of them would injure AA.   The mother had one argument with her mother which she found very distressing, at a point when she would undoubtedly be significantly hormonal, and spent some time crying about it that day.  There is no other evidence that the mother in general was suffering from any form of low mood or depression, and the health visitor had no concerns about her.  </span></p>

Relatively minor issues can seem very serious when new parents are tired, and also facing the responsibility of this new life, this baby being entirely dependent upon them.  I have considered carefully the father&#8217;s actions following that.  I found his explanation to me in the witness box that he was cross with himself, and that at that moment he found himself worrying that in some way he might repeat some aspects of his childhood, or that he could in some way let AA and his wife down entirely credible.  I do not consider his actions in hitting himself in the head, or of then deciding that he needed some anger management to be relevant in relation to the matters I need to determine.  The local authority do not assert that the fact of the argument is relevant, and I agree.  The father did not hurt himself, he clearly did not hit himself hard, and although his initial reaction was that he needed some form of anger management, clearly with the benefit of some time, and reflection, he decided that he did not need further assistance.  </span></p>

The local authority suggest that the mother has filed extremely detailed statements, and that her lack of explanation and acknowledgement of this incident could suggest to the court that she in some way displays characteristics that are relevant to whether she could harm AA. </span></p>

The mother did not know about the father&#8217;s actions until after her substantive statement had been filed. She was never directed to file a statement about that issue, and indeed of course all that she could ever say was that the father had told her about it, and her response to him.  There is no other and surrounding evidence of difficulties in these parents&#8217; relationship.  I do not accept that the mother's response and her evidence in relation to that was anything other than that of a concerned partner, but who was quite satisfied those actions were out of character for her husband, which he had resolved in a way that required no further input from her.  She told me that when she discussed it with him, she was concerned about him, but did not view it as a very significant incident.  I saw nothing concerning or untoward in relation to her responses to that.  </span></p>

Cases are not determined of course merely on how someone presents in the witness box.  Judges must be extremely cautious not to substitute a few hours of observation of someone's demeanour, against many other recordings of how a parent presents.  I did not however in any event view this mother as being emotionless in any sense.  The way she presented in the witness box appeared to me to be the culmination of an event that she had been waiting for many months, knowing and expecting that it was going to be suggested to her that she may have caused these injuries to her baby, and that a judge whom she had not met previously would be determining what happens to her family for the future.  My impression of the mother was that she was seeking to assist the court, and that she was holding herself together under immense pressure.  That may have been viewed as being less emotional than she might have been, but we must accept everyone deals with incredibly difficult matters in very different ways.  I viewed her as being genuine and honest.  </span></p>

There are voluminous contact notes, expressing entirely positive views about how the mother reacts to her daughter, and many photographs in the bundle all of which appeared to show an entirely normal relationship between her and AA.  The mother did show significant emotion on a couple of occasions in the witness box, at the start, once when describing to me the lumbar puncture and her daughter's distress, and on another notable occasion when she was asked about the death of her dog.  I found her to be a witness trying hard not to breakdown but taken by surprise on each of those occasions of how those memories overwhelmed her with genuine emotion.</span></p>

No criticism is made of the father by the local authority or guardian, but for the avoidance of doubt, his responses when talking about his daughter, and his relationship, and the problems in this case also appeared to me to be entirely credible and straightforward.  </span></p>

I have thought carefully about the local authority&#8217;s concerns in relation to this evidence.  The situation where the Court does not have the benefit of hearing from those medics has come about by no fault of anyone's in my view, apart from the fact that there was not able to be any proper analysis and reflection of what evidence was required.  </span></p>

It is important to note that the significance of those recordings really only became understood as the case was starting.  From my reading of the papers, it had never been suggested before to the mother or father that there had been other marks that they had not reported.  The parents had filed extensive narrative statements, in which they detail one by one the marks that they say they have seen, describing them and giving dates and their movements around those dates.  </span></p>

The local authority argue that they had offered for these witnesses to give evidence, and were prepared for that.  My recollection is that this was briefly raised before me at or the housekeeping hearing the day before this hearing commenced, and I was told they were not needed.  I suggested that it seemed to me unlikely that the doctors were able to say anything more than what was set out in their notes, from what were clearly relatively brief encounters now some nine months ago.  I had certainly not understood at that stage that the local authority would suggest that this assumed some significance in the case, or that it would be suggested the mother was now in some way seeking to retract or minimise the number of marks that AA had.  </span></p>

Dr A was not challenged by the parents in relation to her views that the mother was describing more frequent marks, but it is clear that partly this is due to the potential significance of that not being fully understood and for the parents, them not being on notice initially that this would assume such significance.  Again, that is not a criticism of anyone, but simply how this case has developed. Mr Sampson KC suggested to me that courts often do see inaccurate medical records (as he suggests they are) in situations like this, particularly if they are written in retrospect. I must balance that of course with the fact that medical records are extremely important documents, doctors are aware they are extremely important, and which take great care in trying to record what they were told.</span></p>

Their case, of necessity, is that this mother is deliberately causing harm to her daughter and bringing that to people's attention.  I simply cannot understand therefore, why, if it were right, the mother would not have been reporting to everyone at all points that there were other injuries.  Similarly, why would she now deny that there were more injuries?  If this is a mother who wants to draw attention to herself, or her daughter, why would she not have been suggesting to other medics that to there were more injuries?  If there were more marks, why would she not take photos? Again, if the local authority assert that there were in fact more injuries, then that would involve the father in some form of ongoing deception as surely he would know about them given how involved he was.  </span></p>

The parents&#8217; statements detail the same marks on the same dates, and on any version there are a worrying number of marks in relation to this baby.  The local authority assert that this evidence shows that the mother is in some way an unreliable historian.  Given the local authority do not assert the father is being untruthful about this, the local authority must be suggesting that the mother was deliberately exaggerating the injuries to the medics.  I cannot see any other evidence to support that and in my view it is far more likely that the treating medics, and indeed Dr A have become rather lost in how many injuries that were, and when they appeared and disappeared, just as even Dr Ward admitted she had with the benefit of an expert overview.  I cannot find that mother was deliberately attempting to mislead anyone, nor can I see any reason why she would do that.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I can deal relatively shortly with the suggestion that the mother has been in some way untruthful about the father's drinking.  There is no evidence that the father drinks to excess, and indeed very little evidence of him drinking in general.  I agree that for many people if they describe someone as teetotal, they may well be using it correctly as someone who never drinks, but you would often hear the phrase of someone being &#8216;virtually teetotal&#8217; or described as teetotal if they very rarely drink.  The father's evidence in this case is that there are still cans of alcohol in his fridge leftover from Christmas.  He describes himself as someone who hardly drinks.  In every other piece of evidence the mother agrees with that, apart from one recording which it says clearly was made in retrospect.  Given the totality of the evidence in relation to this, I do not accept that the mother was lying, or simply rejecting a written record.  Again, I can see no reason and by far the most likely explanation for this anomaly in the records is that that recording is incorrect.</span></p>

Again, I have thought very carefully about this.  The advocates have all reminded me of the case law in relation to what the local authority must be able to prove to the court, and how the parents do not need to mount a positive position of what they say must have taken place.  In this case I do have a potential answer being postulated by the parents.  The local authority do not seek to suggest that the father is lying, but do say that instead of accepting that potential explanation, the evidence points to the mother having inflicted the rib fractures.  </span></p>

A parent rushing, holding a baby, and not only missing a step but then falling such that their bottom hits the stairs, would inevitably it seems to me clutch in a strong jerking fashion their child to them.  The father was not clear exactly how he was holding AA, only that she was against him.  It is entirely possible that she was slightly sideways or that at her age she was slightly wriggling, such that the grab towards the father with his arm was a sideways motion.  The medics do not dismiss this explanation, and I cannot see how the Court can do that either.  </span></p>
