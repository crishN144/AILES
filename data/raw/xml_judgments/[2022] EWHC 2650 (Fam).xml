It was agreed between the parties that instead of Ms Goddard attending she would be sent some questions by the parents which she has then answered in writing. I have also read the statement of the witness on behalf of the parents, EB. I also read the bundle consisting of 738 pages plus the supplemental report (final analysis) of the Guardian. I have taken all these matters into account even if some of them are not expressly referred to in the Judgment. I have kept in mind, especially when considering the continuation of the care order, that the child&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration and all those factors in the welfare checklist found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

This appears to be born of a belief by the parents that their concerns are not taken seriously and that they are being shut out of E&#8217;s life. One vignette which occurred during the trial illustrates this. I was told of an incident which appears to have taken place on or about the same 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July as the incident referred to above. The father told me that E had sustained bite marks on his left chest. He demonstrated where the bite marks were by pointing to his left upper chest. He said there was a photograph, and I was shown a photograph which is taken of E&#8217;s right upper chest (not left) which could be bite marks. Unfortunately, this was the first time that the Local Authority had heard of this complaint. When I asked the Father why he had not told them before the start of the proceedings he said it was because he felt that he could trust this court. The necessary implication of trusting the Court but not others, was that he felt that he could not trust the Local Authority.</p>

The Moving to Adulthood team will now be within Children&#8217;s Services working with young people with SEND with an EHCP who are likely to require support from adult social care. The focus is very much on ensuring timely consideration of transition needs and a streamlined processes to ensure the right plan is in place at the right time for the young person and their family. This is a multi-agency approach which includes education and social care, as well as health when needed. I will therefore continue to support E post his 18th birthday.  I am currently completing his pathway plan. I will complete an assessment of needs in the coming months to determine whether he requires provision under the Care Act and what his wishes and feelings are around his adult life. E&#8217;s parents will be included in this process as well. This will consider E&#8217;s mental capacity to make decisions around his care, treatment, and residences. These assessments will inform where E should live post 18 and how best he can be supported to achieve maximum independence. It is premature to say whether this will include more time in his family home however, it is most likely that E will need an adult residential placement when he is 18. However, his needs might change by then and be able to live with less support.</span>&#8221;</p>

If a woman stands to lose a sum of money because she might be fined in criminal proceedings, the standard is the criminal one; if she might lose the same sum of money in civil proceedings, the standard of proof is the civil one. There are no principled reasons for a difference in approach to deprivation of liberty; if someone is to be confined as a term of imprisonment then the standard is the criminal one but if someone is to be confined, say because their own welfare requires this then it is a civil matter to be satisfied on a civil standard of proof.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a widely held suspicion that legal aid has been so cut back over the past few decades because it is &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221;. The beneficiaries of legal aid tended to be the &#8220;voiceless&#8221; ones; people, like these parents, who are conscientious, hard-working and in employment, but not that well paid. They have become the dispossessed. Dispossessed of legal representation, by virtue of being neither poor nor rich enough. Legal aid was originally one of the pillars of the welfare state. But for these people that prop is removed. The net result is that in DOLs proceedings they are at a real disadvantage against an organ of the State (the Local Authority) who are publicly funded. There is no logical reason for  them (and the Guardian) to be treated differently from respondents in care proceedings. Instead, there is a compelling case for them to be treated the same &#8211; on grounds of fairness, equality of arms and the simple economic consideration that overall, it should prove cheaper for them to be represented than not.</p>

The father has a full-time job in a lower-managerial role. He has undertaken training in restraint techniques which might be helpful in restraining E should that be necessary.

She says that at his current school there are issues such as nonverbal and verbal conflict with the other children. She went on to say that he used to be in mainstream school and does not understand why with support services in place this could not still be the case.  She said she was upset that it has been said E has a severe learning disability. In view of the fact that some of the incidents take place with people of his own age (and usually end in a violent exchange only resolved by the input of Local Authority workers) I found the Mother&#8217;s position to be unrealistic. If E went to a mainstream school and exhibited the behaviours already evidenced, the schooling would quickly break down. I agree with the Guardian that any such arrangement would be very short lived. </p>

There are significant issues with the parents and professionals being able to work together and focus on E&#8217;s needs.

It is unlikely that this will improve despite the parents indicating they will work better together in future. The upper chest bite mark is a good example of the parents failure to engage with the local authority. Having reviewed the papers I have formed the firm conclusion that the Local Authority are doing their very best for E, but the parents are resentful of having &#8220;lost&#8221; their child to the Local Authority. They naturally but unhelpfully see the Local Authority as the enemy; blocking E&#8217;s desire to be with them rather than as they should see them &#8211; as an organisation prioritising his welfare.</p>

The Local Authority dispute this and are of the view the parents are involved with all decision making. I have seen no good examples of the parents&#8217; complaints. The parents complain of such matters as E trying to escape and this not being recorded; yet I have seen those records &#8211; they are at, for example, pages F279 and F291 of the bundle. Another such area of dispute is in respect of E&#8217;s medication. This is regularly reviewed however the parents continue to argue that he is over medicated, and this is impacting on him meeting his potential. They draw support from the fact that the dosages for E have changed over time; but that is not vindication of their position &#8211; it is a clinical decision taken as E&#8217;s condition responds differently.</p>

I find her role was to analyse and not investigate. She does not have a statutory duty to visit E.

They said it would not happen because they would properly prepare E with relevant strip-cartoons and aromatherapy. But in the fact of my insistence that on this example it would happen, I was told that their response would be matters such as distracting E by calling him an Igbo name and ultimately calling the police.

The parents currently cope for short periods and with their limited contact, but if this was extended as per their proposal I have little doubt the arrangement would fail and by then E&#8217;s current placement will have been lost.
