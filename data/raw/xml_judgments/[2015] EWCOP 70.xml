	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The evidence provided by Audrey shows that AMH receives a monthly income of &#163;655.20. Audrey has confirmed that she spends &#163;566.63 of this every month. The personal allowance record shows a further &#163;170 had been provided to [the nursing home] over a 10 month period which equates to a further &#163;17 per month, providing AMH with monthly outgoings of &#163;583.63. This leaves a monthly residue of &#163;71.57, which over a year should have provided AMH with savings of &#163;858.84, and yet the bank statements do not reflect this. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">The breakdown of spending provided by Audrey and the information provided by [the manager of the nursing home] show that a further &#163;253 per month is spent unnecessarily on items of food and clothing for AMH. Audrey also confirmed that she still spends &#163;199.11 per month on utilities and garden and property maintenance at [the bungalow in Herne Bay]. The Public Guardian accepts that this property is jointly owned and therefore cannot be utilised to its full extent, i.e. rented. The Public Guardian also accepts that [the bungalow] needs to be maintained, but would argue that the amounts provided by Audrey are considerably high.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Public Guardian is concerned that Audrey is not utilising AMH&#8217;s assets in her best interests. For example, she is not saving AMH&#8217;s surplus income in the event of her Continuous Health Care funding ceasing. That being said, the evidence shows that Audrey&#8217;s actions are more a consequence of her ignorance and belief that her current spending is benefitting AMH rather than her own self dealing. It is the Public Guardian&#8217;s opinion that Audrey would benefit from guidance in her role and therefore requests the court to revoke the LPA and appoint Audrey as deputy to manage AMH&#8217;s property and financial affairs with support from the OPG.&#8221;</p>

The rights set out in the European Convention are to be guaranteed to &#8216;everyone&#8217; (article 1). They are premised on the inherent dignity of all human beings whatever their frailty or flaws. The same philosophy underpins the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), ratified by the United Kingdom in 2009. Although not directly incorporated into our domestic law, the CRPD is recognised by the Strasbourg court as part of the international law context within which the guarantees of the European Convention are to be interpreted.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Audrey has some strange ideas about the functions and duties of an attorney acting under an LPA. A good example is her suggestion that her former co-attorney, Rocky, &#8220;would take care of all the labouring side and I would take care of all literacy etc. side of things.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">At the hearing I asked Audrey a few basic questions about the principles of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, best interests decision-making, and the fiduciary duties of an attorney acting under an LPA for property and financial affairs. The replies to these questions required no more knowledge than the information that is already contained in Part C of the LPA, which Audrey signed on 23 January 2013. She didn&#8217;t have a clue, and I am inclined to agree with the Public Guardian that her actions are &#8220;more a consequence of her ignorance &#8230; rather than her own self-dealing.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">What concerns me, however, is that Audrey has no intention or desire to learn about the principles of the Mental Capacity Act, or best interests decision-making, or her fiduciary duties as an attorney. One of her personality traits is inflexibility, or rigidity in thought and behaviour. She is adamant that she knows what is best and nothing and nobody will persuade her otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Take the bungalow, for instance. Audrey says that AMH wants Rocky to inherit the bungalow, so that he will always have a roof over his head. In fact, AMH didn&#8217;t specifically devise the bungalow to Rocky. She left him her entire residuary estate, which naturally includes the bungalow or its net proceeds of sale. Rocky doesn&#8217;t live in the bungalow and has no wish to live there. He is perfectly happy staying with friends. Yet, as a result of Audrey&#8217;s rigidity of thought, the bungalow has become a millstone around their necks. It is unoccupied and generating no income. It is a drain on AMH&#8217;s resources. AMH is paying the entire outgoings, even though she is beneficially entitled to only a half share of the net proceeds of sale. Rocky is unable to contribute towards its upkeep because he is in receipt of means-tested benefits. The bungalow should be sold or let or, at the very least, Audrey should be taking professional advice on how to achieve the best outcome for both AMH and Rocky and, in the event of a conflict of interests between them, the best result for AMH.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Another example is the purchase of additional foodstuffs. Audrey supplies her mother with things she liked to eat in the past, and often turns up with &#8220;24 mini sausage rolls, 6 pork pies, and numerous cakes and biscuits; too many for one person comfortably to eat.&#8221; AMH has no appetite for these items, partly because her tastes have changed, but mainly because she receives an adequate, nutritious and balanced diet at the nursing home. Yet, Audrey is spending over &#163;250 a month of her mother&#8217;s money on unnecessary food, sweets and cakes, which AMH sometimes throws at members of staff and ultimately end up in the waste bin.</p>
