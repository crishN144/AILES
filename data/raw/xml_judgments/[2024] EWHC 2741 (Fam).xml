	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Ms Chaudhry, on behalf of Mother, argued that continuing the wardship would prevent Father from changing the children&#8217;s residence or schools again without court approval. But there is no indication in the evidence that Father has any intention of changing the children&#8217;s residence or schools; and if there were such indication then this concern could be met with appropriate orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Ms Chaudhry also made the point that, by stranding Mother abroad (as Mother alleges), Father has sought to prevent Mother from exercising her parental responsibility, stopping Mother spending time with the children or even having information concerning their development. But, even accepting that (on Mother&#8217;s case) this is so, and that Father has sought to achieve this through a form of domestic abuse, that does not seem to me to warrant a wardship order being made. It is not suggested that the necessary statutory powers are lacking and, so far as regards enforcement, as McFarlane LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (Children) (Removal from Jurisdiction etc)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/1302" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 1302" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 1302</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 WLR 2326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 WLR 2326</ref> at [70]:</p>

Wardship may appear more formal and it may be seen by [the applicant] to have some form of enhanced status, but in reality it does not.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the present case, a location order was sought and granted by the court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. However, that limited use of the inherent jurisdiction does not seem to me to be a significant factor pointing in favour of wardship.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Finally, it seems to me relevant to note that while the judges of the Family Division do have expertise in matters relating to international child abduction, there is no allegation of international child abduction here. The primary international elements of this case are that (i) one parent is abroad, and there is uncertainty as to whether or when she might obtain permission to enter or stay in this country, and (ii) there is a factual dispute as to what happened between Mother and Father (and, potentially, wider family members) when they were abroad. It seems to me that these are issues which may today be faced by any judge of the Family Court, which may represent a change since the decisions of Hogg J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>.</p>
