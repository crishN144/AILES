	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">These proceedings concern the welfare of two children: A girl, Y, who was born in February 2013, and who is now aged seven and a half years; and a boy, Z, born in September 2016 and now just over four years of age.  The children have the same mother: a single woman, who resides in Scotland; but they have different fathers. In particular the father of Y, the elder of the two, is Mr A, a native of Ghana, whose business interests bring him very regularly to the United Kingdom and, certainly at the time of his close relationship with the children's mother, he was a regular visitor to her home and the Glasgow area. </p>

For some years now, those two children have lived with their father, and out of the mother's care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">The proceedings in relation to the need to protect the children have been conducted entirely through the Scottish system.  The social services in West Dunbartonshire have been involved in monitoring and then supporting the children's care with their mother for a very significant period, and it is surprising to English eyes, but it is a very positive surprise, that the same social worker, Miss McF, and the same senior social worker, Miss McD, have been involved really throughout the life of these two young children.  There is, therefore, a wealth </p>

Social services had for some time been contemplating the removal of the children to foster care.  In the end, on 6 December 2016, the mother seems to have accepted the reality, and she consented to their removal.  I am sure that she will have done so with a very heavy heart.  She is a woman who plainly loves all four of her children, and has done what she has felt able to do to care for them in her way over the years. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">The children proceeded through the Scottish court process.  Significantly on 11 January 2017 the case was referred up to the Sheriff's Court where formal findings of fact were recorded with the mother's agreement as to the background history.  I will turn to those in more detail shortly.  Following those findings, plans were made for the permanent care of the children, and the Scottish Children Panel formally approved the plan for them to move to an adoptive placement. That move took place in October 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">The placement that was found was not in Scotland but was in England, and thus the resulting adoption application has come before the Family Court in England and Wales. It is an application made by the couple with whom the children have lived since October 2018.  The application for adoption is opposed by both the mother and Mr A.  In their separate ways, but in many ways they are united in this, both of them wish to see the two children, and in Mr A's case his primary focus is on Y, living with either the mother or with Mr A or, in some way, in their joint care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">Pausing there, those words are a reminder to the court that the decision that I make today is not just for today.  It is not even a decision about looking after young children for the time being.  It is a lifetime decision.  I have to regard their welfare throughout their life, and part of that is to consider that the decision is not just about caring for children, it is about bringing up individual human beings who will, in a very short time, become individual, independent adults.  It is important for them when they are in their twenties, in their thirties, middle-age and beyond, for them to have had as stable and secure a childhood as is possible, for them to feel comfortable about themselves, including about their race and their culture and their identity, as they go forward.  These are key and important elements in their lives, and the decision I have to make has to pull together thoughts of these long-term important aspects of their upbringing, just as I must consider issues concerning their immediate safety and wellbeing. </p>

Subsequently courts have held that there is a need for an overall assessment to be undertaken of the realistic options in the case; it is to be an holistic assessment.  In the present case that means balancing the welfare of the children if they go to live with their mother and/or Mr A, or if they remain in the care of the adopters, and only if the balance tips, so that really nothing else will do, in favour of the adopters can the mother's consent be dispensed with. </p>

At that time the mother already had the benefit of legal advice to help her should she wish to undertake either of these steps.

The relevant statutory context is set out in detail in each of these three decisions. No issues of law were raised by any party in the present proceedings and it is not therefore necessary to assemble all of the relevant references here. The difficulties that have arisen in the present case have done so because of the impact of the children&#8217;s status under the Scottish system upon the English proceedings, rather than as a result of any legal controversy over the nature of that status in Scots law. It is, however, helpful to set out the key provisions which may be deployed to authorise a child&#8217;s placement for adoption in the Scottish system as it appears that there is a choice to be made between two separate avenues that may be followed which, in turn, will have a different impact upon a child&#8217;s status before the courts in England and Wales in the event that an application is made here to adopt a child who has been placed by a Scottish local authority. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">The first route is the one followed in the present case and involves the child being authorised for placement for adoption within the terms of a compulsory supervision order. Before a compulsory supervision order (other than an interim order) may be made, it is necessary for one or more of the &#8216;grounds&#8217; set out in CH (S)A 2011, s 67(2) to be established. In broad terms a finding that one or more of the 17 specified &#8216;s 67 grounds&#8217; is established equates to a finding that the &#8216;threshold criteria&#8217; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> are met in care proceedings in England and Wales. Where s 67 grounds sufficient to justify making a compulsory supervision order are accepted by a child&#8217;s parent(s), the case may proceed before a Children&#8217;s Panel (CH(S)A 2011, s 91). In other cases, the determination of what, if any, grounds are established is referred for determination before a Sheriff&#8217;s Court (CH(S)A 2011, s 93). </p>

The mother was told the names and the then address of the adopters before the children were placed.  The adopters were not told that, and I think they only learned that today, as I learned it also.  But it is to the mother&#8217;s credit that she has not taken any steps to use that information to take action directly, and make contact.   </p>

The adopters are in a solid relationship.  They had been together for some five years or so prior to the placement.  They have taken to the children from Day 1.  They love these two children.  They are fully committed to them.  One only has to understand what the adopters have been through in the last year, in terms of hanging onto these two adoption applications, and facing all the hurdles that they have faced, to see proof of their commitment to the children.  People who were not so committed may well have thrown their hands up and said, "Enough", and tried to walk away, but these two adopters could not and have not because of the strong bond that is said to exist between them and the children. </p>

They place education as a primary objective in their lives, and for the lives of these two children, if they remain in their care.  There is a racial concurrence between the adopters and the two children.  The two children are said to be thriving in their care.  The children were led from the moment of placement to understand that this was their &#8220;forever home&#8221;, and that is how they have approached the two years and more that they have lived with this couple.  They regard them as their mother and father, their mum and dad.  Whether that is right to happen, or not as the mother says, that is the reality for the two children, and to consider moving them now would be to move them from people that these two children regard now as their parental figures. </p>

And unless there is a good reason, a strong reason, presented by the mother's case for moving them, there is no other reason for suggesting that they should do anything other than remain in the care of this couple. </p>

It is one thing to have caused her pain, as I am sure I did, by going through a catalogue of her circumstances in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  But she would say, and she is entitled to say, that that was &#8220;then&#8221;, and her life has changed significantly since that time. It is, indeed, very plain, and I rely on the evidence not only of the mother but also of the social worker Miss McF, and her superior Miss McD; the Independent Social Worker Miss Bates, who has looked at the files, and then met the mother very recently; and the Children's Guardian: that the mother is now much more settled than she was in those earlier years. </p>

She has done what she can to learn about what will be needed were she to take up the care of these children once again.

No one has ever suggested that she has not wanted to care to the best of her ability for the children, and that comes through very clearly in her evidence.  She is a victim in many ways.  She was a victim of her circumstances and the choices that she made, and she could not cope with the children&#8217;s care.  There is no indication that she caused them deliberate harm or was a deliberately abusive parent to them.  She just could not cope and, as a spiral developed, the lives of the children disintegrated into the neglect and chaos that I have already described. </p>

In many ways it speaks for itself, and I have read it again during the course of the short adjournment before giving this judgment.  One of the factors that Ms Bates relies upon is the absence of any history of the mother being able to work effectively with professionals.  Indeed, during her time with Ms Bates there were occasions when she became angry when challenged.  That is an important matter because on any view there would need to be professional input from the social services to chaperone, control and monitor any move of the children into the mother's care. </p>

She has been involved in this case for longer, and she endorses the Scottish local authority evidence and that of the Independent Social Worker, and she has formed her own view that it simply is not possible to contemplate a move for the children.  In addition, looking beyond the detriments in the mother's ability to care, the reality is that she has not got a settled plan; she would have to move house; she would have to build a relationship with the children; she would have to develop support networks to help her with the care of the children; and there is no basis in the evidence she has been able to put before the court to indicate that that is about to happen, or that it would work. The mother&#8217;s proposal is, therefore, at best an experiment, and it is not possible to contemplate experimenting with the lives of these two children, who are now so well settled in the care of the applicants. </p>

The professional conclusion of these two experienced and insightful social workers that the children had to be removed is unassailable, as is their opinion now that there has been wholly insufficient change to justify contemplating halting the adoption process and sending either or both children back to their mother&#8217;s care. </p>
