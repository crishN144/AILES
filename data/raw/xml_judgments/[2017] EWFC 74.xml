Specifically, she has been advised that she is unlikely to succeed because she is unlikely to be able to establish bad faith and/or a lack of good faith; bad faith is of course a matter she would be required to prove in a misfeasance claim, and by virtue of section 9(3) HRA a lack of good faith is a pre-requisite for an award of damages for breaches of rights under Articles other than Article 5 ECHR. She has, however, been advised that she can bring an application to the ECtHR in light of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hammerton v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2016) 63 EHRR 23" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">(2016) 63 EHRR 23</ref> for breach of Article 13 as well as Articles 6 &amp; 8.</p>

As the Court of Appeal later found, this harm occurred before the Judge was persuaded to embark upon a series of hearings during which he received detailed submissions made on behalf of each of these three appellants and others as to the precise content of the judgment: see &#167;8, &#167;86-87 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>.&#8221;</p>

As you will see from the proposed draft order SW will make the necessary application seeking to ensure that she is anonymized and that none of the documents from the care proceedings that might identify the children or their family will be made public.&#8221;</p>

It will be noted that the safeguards set out in paragraphs 2-5 of the proposed order are rather differently structured and somewhat less stringent than those contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of my order of 25 July 2017.
