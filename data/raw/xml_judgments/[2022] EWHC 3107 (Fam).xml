The parents separated in 2019 and X remained living in the family home. The F works close to the family home, whereas the M&#8217;s work is some 50 miles further north. In March 2021 the M applied for X to live with her and for her school to be changed from close to the family home to the town where the M was living. The F made a cross application for the child to remain living with him and to remain at her existing school. </p>

The M raised a number of inaccuracies and two amended letters were produced. The Legal Advisor ordered that Cafcass produce a section 7 report, which was produced on 8 March 2022. Cafcass recommended that the Court make a Child Arrangements Order (&#8220;CAO&#8221;) that the child live with the F and have contact with the M. This would necessarily involve X remaining at her current school. </p>

In her statement of 6 September 2022 the M had alleged that the F had been undermining X&#8217;s confidence about wearing her glasses in school &#8220;for the sole purpose of winning custody&#8221;. The F wished to rebut this allegation of &#8220;malicious parenting&#8221;.  The M opposed this application. The Court asked the Cafcass officer to read the letter and give her opinion. The officer said that she had contacted the school about the issue, and the school had no welfare concerns.  </p>

The starting point is that there is no right in any party to cross-examine. This is made entirely clear by FPR22.1. It is open to the Court to limit cross-examination where it is fair and proportionate to do so. This must include the power to prevent cross-examination altogether given that FPR22.6 provides that the Court can order that a witness should not be called at all. It would make no sense of FPR22.1 to restrict it in the way Ms Beswick suggests to having to allow the witness to be cross-examined but then restrict what s/he is cross-examined about. </p>

Further, Counsel for the parents could cross-examine the Cafcass officer and, as such, put any material areas of disagreement to her. It was open to the Bench to consider that this would be a more effective and proportionate way to consider the material, rather than hearing oral evidence from the parents.

Indeed, to the contrary, the Court made clear that the officer could be cross-examined.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I note the Bench adjourned the case to allow the Mother to appeal. I fully understand why they took this course, but Courts in this situation should carefully consider whether it would be more effective and proportionate to continue with the hearing and then for any appeal to be based on the substantive outcome. It is possible that the grounds for appeal would thereby fall away, and it would have the obvious benefit of not building more delay into the determination of the case. </p>
