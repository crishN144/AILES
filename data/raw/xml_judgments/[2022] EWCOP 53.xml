The latter is particularly troubling to TN. She has developed a real anxiety that the vaccine is more likely to cause her son serious harm because of his heart condition. The Partial Trisomy 13 has had a significant effect on RN&#8217;s cognitive behaviour.</p>

In 2021 there were discussions with her as to whether some agreement could be reached in relation to vaccination. This was not possible. In order to address, and perhaps allay, TN&#8217;s concerns, Dr A (a Consultant Cardiologist) was asked to give an opinion. In September 2021, he concluded that it was in RN&#8217;s best interests to have the vaccine, for the reasons I will refer to below. </p>

As the Judge noted, Dr A, in his first report dated the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2022, focused in careful detail, on any vulnerability that might arise for RN in consequence of the heart conditions from which he suffers. HHJ Burrows set out the key parts of Dr A&#8217;s report. I do the same, though slightly more extensively: </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Tetralogy of Fallot is a reasonably common (1:2500) congenital cardiac problem usually detected at birth (or antenatally by ultrasound),and repaired surgically in the first few years of life. Sometimes Tetralogy of Fallot is associated with genetic changes. In RN&#8217;s case cardiac development occurred differently in the presence of the extra genetic material he carries (three copies of part of chromosome 13). This genetic change is also linked to other developmental matters, including cleft lip/palate and cognitive development. Normally children born with complete trisomy 13 (Patau&#8217;s syndrome, frequency 1:16000) do not survive the first year of life. Partial trisomy 13 can be less severe, but patients surviving to adulthood are very rare. RN&#8217;s prognosis will therefore be shaped by the natural history of partial Trisomy 13 in addition to the natural history of repaired Tetralogy of Fallot. In the first witness statement from TN it is acknowledged that RN has a life limiting condition (at paragraph 31) due to the chromosomal abnormality, with attendant learning difficulties that lead to a lack of capacity (paragraph 23), and unable to verbalise physical symptoms (paragraph 69). There are no treatments for chromosomal anomalies at present.</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">With regard to the underlying cardiac diagnosis, the need for lifelong cardiac surveillance for repaired Tetralogy of Fallot relates to the need for re-operation to the pulmonary valve in ~40% of patients by the third decade of life, in addition to the later risks of rhythm abnormalities, which do come with an attendant risk of sudden death as set out in point 11 above. Although the global experience with tetralogy repair is now significant, because this is a surgery delivered in infancy from the 1970&#8217;s we have very few patients in their sixth decade of life (or older) who may be able to inform of the longer-term cardiac prognosis. In my own clinical practice, I have not yet looked after a patient with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot into their eighth decade of life for example. However, it is now expected that patients born with Tetralogy of Fallot will now survive well into adulthood (discussed in point 18 below).</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">In contrast the documented natural history of partial trisomy 13 in adulthood is scant. The world&#8217;s largest case series (Am J Med Genet.2021;185A:1743&#8211;1756) for complete trisomy 13 has 11 individuals over 18 years old. I am unable to find an equivalent case series for partial Trisomy 13. In other words, it appears that chromosomal anomalies are likely to impact prognosis more than the cardiac aspects. Put simply, there are many adults with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot, and few with partial Trisomy 13&#8221;</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am not aware of any specific reports that have identified patients with particular types of heart disease being more (or less) vulnerable to vaccine related complications. The most recent COVID vaccination guidelines from the UK&#8217;s congenital cardiac disease society continues to advocate for vaccination, and for booster vaccination. Young males may be more at risk from particular vaccine regimes from a myocarditis perspective, but there are alternative explanations for those findings, and also alternative vaccine strategies that are not encumbered by such concerns</span>.&#8221;</p>

Moreover, the evidence, as highlighted in the judgment, identified from a statistical basis, a heightened risk to RN of not having the vaccine. This was expressed in Dr A&#8217;s report as follows: </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the matrix of this medical evidence, it is clear that Judge Burrows could have reached no other conclusion in respect of RN&#8217;s best interests medically. However, as the jurisprudence of the Court of Protection has made abundantly clear, a finding that P (the protected party) lacks capacity to take a decision for himself does not mean that his wishes and feelings are irrelevant. On the contrary, they remain part of the wider forensic landscape and are mandated for consideration by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 4</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. I was concerned that the voluble force and sincerity of TN&#8217;s own views, which have been the focus of much attention by both the doctors and the parties, may have drowned out RN&#8217;s voice, both generally and for the Judge. Though it was not raised as a point of appeal by Mr Diamond, who acts on behalf of TN, I was prepared to investigate whether this important aspect of the required evaluation had been undertaken with sufficient rigour.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Children are not chattels of parents. Our domestic law emphasises responsibilities rather than rights. In most situations, a parent will have ultimate responsibility for taking decisions concerning their children&#8217;s health, education, and welfare. It is obviously right that this should be the case, but it is not ubiquitously true. Parents do not have absolute rights in respect of their children. Occasionally, for example, in the sphere of serious medical treatment, parents are sometimes ambushed by their own grief and distress which ill-equips them to identify where the best interests of their children lie. Thus, I reject Mr Diamond&#8217;s primary proposition and, inevitably, therefore, the analogy he seeks to make with adults who lack capacity. In any event, however, incapacitious adults are entitled to the same choices and opportunities as the rest of the adult population. These rights are more extensive than those available to children. They include rights to forge personal and sexual relationships, to marry etc. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> imposes an obligation actively to promote P&#8217;s decision taking however limited the sphere might be in which it can be exercised. It also requires assessment of wishes and feelings, even where P lacks the ability to understand, weigh or evaluate the decision in focus. Thus, the law extends the freedoms of adulthood to all adults, which includes the incapacitious. Any other approach would be discriminatory. </p>

The exercise of his autonomy may be circumscribed and confined by his learning difficulties, but it has not been extinguished. I consider that Mr Diamond&#8217;s argument rather than advancing &#8220;modern liberal-democratic values&#8221; is regressive and fails to afford appropriate respect to people with disabilities who lack capacity in specific spheres of decision making.

Accordingly, I dismiss the application for permission to appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not doubt that the mother will be disappointed by this and whilst I consider the Judge was entirely right to rely on the established empirical conclusions underpinning the guidance, I respect the sincerity and strengths of her beliefs. There can be no doubt that she has, throughout his life, provided the best possible care for her son. His joyful personality and resilience is a great credit to him but it is his mother who has provided a quality of care for him in which these delightful and engaging aspects of his personality have been given the opportunity to blossom and grow. Though much of it goes beyond the scope of this appeal and was prepared before TN engaged counsel, I have given very great thought to everything that she has written, which I have no doubt is sincere. Ultimately, those views cannot be reconciled, either with the national medical guidance nor the specific evidence relating to the cardiology in RN&#8217;s case. </p>
