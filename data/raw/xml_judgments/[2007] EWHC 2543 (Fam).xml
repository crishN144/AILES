	    <p class="NormalWeb">The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">On 3, 4, and 5 September I heard applications by the Applicant father, 38 year old Mr T F, and by the Respondent mother, 30 year-old Miss R F. They all concern their two children, 9 year old D (24.1.98), and 6 year old N (19.4.01). They follow on from my judgment in January 2007 after a four-day hearing on issues of residence and contact in December 2006.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In brief the parties lived together latterly in N for 9 years before separating in 2005. The father works in information technology. The mother worked in a bank but is not presently in employment.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In early 2005 they purchased a seaside a home in Mexico, where the father now lives with his partner, 23 year old Miss M. When the father returned from a holiday there in September 2005, he proposed that the children should live six months of the year there with him. The other six months of the year they would spend with the mother in England.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Two years of bitter litigation have followed leading up to the present hearing. The father, who has acted in person, maintains his proposals. The mother accepts that the last 2 periods of supervised contact in April and May 2007 went well. However she seeks an order supported by the Guardian that there should be no direct contact.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Even if matters had not gone so wrong as she alleges, she would have been opposed to shared care as proposed, though holidays in Mexico might well have continued. As it is, she says that the history as set out in my last judgment and the events since make the continuation of any direct contact no longer in the children's best interests.</p>

It caused the mother to start committal proceedings and return to a refuge before finding a new home in another area. The father she says has almost no insight into his conduct. His tirade and threats have continued. In a psychologist's view he has traits in common with an antisocial disorder. Contact has been suspended. Change is needed before it can resume but this is not apparent. The Guardian represented by Mr Coleman agrees.</p>

But because of the extreme nature of his personality poses a severe risk to them. Mr F appears to be genuinely unable to see that his behaviour causes distress, and that this impact upon the boys in the number of ways and has led to their education and friendships being disrupted. In the absence of any attempt to address these problems, the Guardian considers that the orders sought by the mother are proportionate and necessary for the protection of the children."</p>

Had they done so they would have had no advance warning of what was to be said.</p>
