As a teenager, there were safeguarding concerns for the mother around child sexual exploitation, drug use and her own mother being unable to care for her. Both the Local Authority and the Guardian have talked about &#8220;inter-generational neglect&#8221; in the mother&#8217;s family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z had remained in his mother&#8217;s care under an Interim Care Order until last year, when the Court sanctioned his placement into foster care. During the proceedings, Z has had three placements, as well as a mother and baby placement prior to the proceedings. Z moved with the mother to a respite foster placement after the first placement broke down due to allegations made about the foster carer and the mother not working with the written agreement that she had agreed with Local Authority. The next placement was another mother and baby foster placement and although this was initially a respite placement, the mother and Z actually remained there for several months. This placement raised similar issues to the previous placement, namely that the mother would be out of placement with Z every day until late at night. There had been two written agreements and a schedule of work and undertakings that the mother was unable to adhere to. The Local Authority had serious concerns for the safety and welfare of Z during these times. Concerns were heightened further by a number of injuries that Z had sustained whilst in his mother&#8217;s care including, for example, when Z sustained burns to the front of two fingers. The mother reported she had been at a family member&#8217;s home where she was using the oven and Z burnt them by touching the oven door. In discussion with the mother, she reportedly stated that she had told Z not to touch the oven, but he did it anyway. The mother was asked if it was her view that Z understood her request and she stated that he did but touched the oven anyway. The mother did not accept that it was a lack of supervision and maintained her view that Z, who was then aged two, knew what he was being told. On another occasion, Z had sustained a cut to his head when a picture frame fell from a height and landed on him whilst at a family member&#8217;s house.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was no suggestion that these injuries had been inflicted intentionally but there was concern that the mother&#8217;s insistence on taking Z to the home of the maternal grandmother and taking him away from the placement, contrary to the written agreements, and then her failure to properly supervise him there, was placing Z at risk of further injury. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2022, with the Court&#8217;s approval, the mother and Z moved to a residential unit (&#8216;the unit&#8217;) for a specialist parenting assessment. By this time, it was clear that another mother and baby placement would have served no purpose and was not in the best interests of Z&#8217;s welfare. It was clear that the mother had struggled to comply with the written agreements and boundaries of such placements, and the mother was just using the placements to sleep there but was not accepting any support or guidance offered to her, which was clearly needed. The unit had completed an initial assessment. Despite the mother&#8217;s initial reservations and reluctance to move to the unit, she did make the move with Z. Whilst in the unit, the mother reportedly received a high level of support and intervention which, according to the unit, were delivered at an appropriate level for the mother to understand in light of her cognitive functioning. Sadly, the assessment was terminated early, around six weeks after it began. There were concerns raised regarding the mother&#8217;s basic care of Z, her behaviour towards staff and other residents, as well as her lack of cooperation with the assessment. On one occasion, the mother was heard to threaten to burn down the unit<span style="font-style:italic">.</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>There were three disruption meetings held within a space of two weeks, which resulted in the assessment then being terminated.</p>

It has taken place over four days, with the fourth day being listed for the handing down of this judgment. I have however already given a short overview of this judgment, as recommended in the intermediary assessment. The mother, as I will come on to, is a highly vulnerable individual. She has been assessed previously as to whether she requires the assistance of an intermediary and she has been assisted by an intermediary throughout this final hearing. Ground rules were considered at the Pre-Trial Review and again on day one of this final hearing. Ground rules have included the mother having regular breaks approximately every thirty minutes during the evidence, the questions that were planned to be asked of the mother in cross-examination being sent to the intermediary in advance, and everyone using straightforward, every-day language as much as possible. I hope the short summary of the judgment that I have provided will assist the mother in understanding how and why I have reached my decision in respect of Z. </p>

The mother did not consistently work with staff in a helpful manner or implement the tailored support and intervention provided. This resulted in the mother remaining on high levels of support with regards to all care tasks with Z. The mother had spent extended periods of time away from Z, meeting her own needs at the expense of Z&#8217;s needs, including cigarette breaks or making phone calls. The mother was verbally aggressive towards residents, made threats to residents and threatened to burn the unit down. The mother did not have a secure daily routine for herself or Z and did not wish to engage in support and discussions with regards to this. The mother was unable to adhere to the rules within the unit. The mother was unable to hold Z or his needs in mind, and she did not appear motivated to meet his needs. The mother also lacked insight into the concerns held and her role within these. She was unable to really acknowledge the need for a residential assessment and did not engage with the process to a level that was hoped and expected. Overall, the unit concluded that the mother had made limited progress within the residential assessment due to her lack of engagement in the process and unwillingness to implement the advice and support offered to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was put to the Team Manager, on behalf of the mother, that things had changed since the final care plan was formulated, particularly because the mother has now completed the Triple P parenting course and has been working with CGL since December 2022. The Team Manager was very pleased to hear that the mother has now completed the Triple P course and is now working with CGL, and was very hopeful that the mother will continue this positive engagement. The Team Manager was however very clear that she did not believe this work meant that the mother was now in a position to care for Z or that any further assessment of her was required. The Team Manager pointed out that the Triple P course is a fairly basic course in terms of teaching parenting skills and felt that the mother requires something much more specialised and detailed in light of her difficulties, as identified by Dr Y and by the unit. The Team Manager was of the view that the unit would have been a very good organisation to provide the mother with the guidance and learning that she requires but, unfortunately, the mother had not been able to engage with them. In respect of CGL, the Team Manager was of the view that it is still early days and was concerned that as recently as March 2023, the mother told the Guardian that she was still smoking one or two spliffs of cannabis a day, which the Team Manager considered to be a high level of ongoing usage. The Team Manager was also clear that professionals had been encouraging the mother since before Z was born to engage with parenting courses and with CGL, but it was only at the very end of these proceedings and with the final hearing imminent that she had decided to do so. The Team Manager felt that, while commendable, the mother&#8217;s efforts had come far too late, that insufficient progress had been made and that Z simply could not wait any longer for final decisions to be made for him. </p>

The Team Manager confirmed that there remained extensive concerns about the maternal grandmother and issues relating to neglect, a poor home environment, drug misuse and domestic abuse, all of which pose a direct risk to a young child living in or coming into regular contact with such an environment. The Team Manager remains very concerned that despite extensive work being undertaken with the mother, she had never accepted these concerns, let alone taken any steps to address them, as evidenced by the fact that she continues to live with the maternal grandmother now. In short, The Team Manager was of the view that the mother simply cannot accept the long-standing concerns held by professionals about her own mother and the care that the mother herself received as a child. The mother remains unaware of the fact that she was exposed to poor quality parenting when she was a child. </p>

For those reasons, the Team Manager opposed there being a goodbye contact but did confirm that the Local Authority could provide the father with a photograph and possibly a short video of Z. </p>

This point is not in dispute. As I have already set out, the assessments of the mother completed during these proceedings show that Z would remain at risk in her care. The key areas of risk, as identified by the various professionals prior to the proceedings and as set-out in the threshold relate to drug misuse, domestic abuse and an inability on the part of the mother to meet and prioritise Z&#8217;s needs over her own considerable needs. All of these matters pose a real risk of Z&#8217;s needs being neglected, through his mother being unavailable to meet his needs due to her significant ongoing cannabis use, through him witnessing and being exposed to domestic abuse, which is known to be emotionally harmful to children, and from the mother being unable to focus on Z&#8217;s needs, which is likely to lead to those needs not being met and Z&#8217;s safety potentially being placed at risk.  The assessments of Dr Y and of the unit have explored whether these matters have been addressed and whether the risks have reduced. Sadly, the conclusion of those assessments is that very little has changed, and the risks remain as high now as they were at the outset of these proceedings. I accept the conclusions of those assessments and that Z would, sadly, be at risk of emotional harm and neglect if placed in the care of his mother. Z, of course, needs a placement where he can be protected from harm and the evidence, from the psychological assessment and parenting assessments suggest this would not be the case with his mother. The mother has significant vulnerabilities, as outlined by Dr Y and those difficulties were part of the reason that the placement at the unit had to be terminated. The mother experienced a poor level of parenting herself but her lack of understanding or insight into that, despite the best efforts of professionals, means that she is likely to replicate something similar with Z. I therefore remain concerned that the mother does not have any real understanding of the risks to Z of experiencing neglectful care, the mother&#8217;s own support network, drug use and domestic abuse. It is positive that she says that she has separated from the father but whether that can be sustained and whether the mother can remain free from abusive relationships remains to be seen. Based on the evidence of Dr Y, which I accept, it is unlikely that the mother has developed the necessary level of understanding to protect herself and Z from such situations. The mother has recently engaged with CGL and Triple P, which I commend her for, but those are small and relatively early steps on a long road for the mother to develop the skills and understanding to meet and prioritise Z&#8217;s needs over and above everything else. As things stand, she continues to lack those important skills and is not equipped to identify and manage risks arising from this range of issues. If Z was placed with her now then, for the reasons outlined by Dr Y and by the unit, it is clear that Z would be at significant risk. </p>

He has not attended this hearing and has not filed any final evidence. He has not engaged with the Court-directed assessments, including a risk assessment. There is therefore no evidence before the Court of any positive change whatsoever. The risks identified relating to the father, which are outlined in threshold document, in my judgment, remain completely unaddressed and in all likelihood, he is continuing to use illicit substances, engage in criminal behaviours and has done nothing at all to reduce the risk he poses as a perpetrator of domestic abuse. </p>

Given Z&#8217;s age, he needs a decision to be made and it would not, in my judgment, be in the best interests of his welfare to delay matters for many months, and possibly longer, to see if the mother is able to make and sustain the required changes. Having considered the evidence of the professionals, which I accept, there is no amount of support that could realistically be provided on a consistent and long-term basis by the Local Authority or any other organisation that would enable Z to be safely cared for by her mother. In any event, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that the mother is unable to accept such support. I am entirely satisfied that everything possible has been done to try to support the mother in caring for Z through the various placements, including the specialised placement at the residential unit. In short and very sadly, the vulnerabilities and risks of placing Z with his mother are far too high. </p>

For whatever reason and most likely due to his own difficulties, the father has not been able to engage with the proceedings. In my judgment, it is therefore clear that the father is unable to meet Z&#8217;s needs and Z would be placed at a very serious risk of harm in his care. The father clearly has very many of his own difficulties to address before he could be considered as a possible carer for Z and he is not yet at the point where he can engage with professionals or in these proceedings, let alone being able to acknowledge his difficulties and to start addressing them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, there are no alternative family members to care for Z who have been positively assessed. Viability assessments have been completed of two family members, which were negative. They have not been challenged.  A Special Guardianship assessment was undertaken of the paternal grandparents, which is an extremely thorough assessment. This reached a negative conclusion and in fact raised some quite serious concerns. This assessment was never challenged. It is, of course, always better for children to be brought up within their family and while such a placement would promote Z&#8217;s cultural and identity needs, while maintaining a relationship with their parents and wider biological family, the assessments that have been undertaken are, in my view, thorough and fair. These assessments sadly conclude that Z cannot be cared for within the wider family and I accept those conclusions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that Z is just three years of age, he needs permanence and so options such as long-term fostering and residential care are not realistic for him as such options would potentially consign Z to a childhood of changing placements and of ongoing professional involvement. While long-term fostering would allow Z to maintain a relationship with the parents and potentially their wider family, this needs to be balanced with his other welfare needs. When considering those needs, Z clearly needs a permanent placement where he can attach to carers who are attuned to his needs and who are able to keep him safe in a settled and safe home environment. In my judgment, that is Z&#8217;s primary welfare need, both now and throughout his life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final care plan is one of adoption. As outlined already, I must consider Z&#8217;s welfare for the rest of his life. Adoption will mean a change of placement. but there is nothing to suggest that he will be unable to attach to new carers.<span style="color:#FF0000"/>Nevertheless, Z&#8217;s relationship with his parents and wider family will be significantly impacted by a plan of adoption and so that loss and the emotional impact of it upon Z, must be carefully balanced against the potential benefits that an adoptive placement will bring. Such a placement will provide Z with a forever home where his needs are met consistently and as a priority, and where he will be kept safe. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having weighed all of the evidence and all of the realistic options in the balance, I am satisfied that only a plan of adoption will do for Z. I am satisfied that Z&#8217;s primary need now is a permanent loving home where his needs will be met for the rest of his childhood and beyond, and where he can be kept safe. For the reasons I have set out, only a plan of adoption can achieve that for Z. </p>

I approve the plan of adoption and dispense with the consent of the parents to the making of a Placement Order on the basis that Z&#8217;s welfare throughout his life demands that I do so. I therefore make a Placement Order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of contact, there is a need to balance the important of Z understanding his life story and being able to maintain some level of contact with his parents, against the need for an adoptive placement to be found as soon as possible and for Z to be given the opportunity to settle into that placement. Whilst direct contact is something that could be considered in the future by Z&#8217;s adoptive carers or by Z himself once he is older, I am not satisfied that it is in the best interests of Z&#8217;s welfare to make an order. To do so would potentially undermine the search for an adoptive placement and, as I have already found, finding such a placement is now a priority for Z. In my judgment, the proposals for indirect letterbox contact strike the right balance between meeting Z&#8217;s needs to understand his life story and maintain contact with his parents, while also finding and settling in to his new, permanent home. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the father&#8217;s application for a &#8216;goodbye contact&#8217; with Z, I do not consider this to be in best interests of Z&#8217;s welfare and I entirely accept the evidence of the Local Authority and the Guardian on this point. Z has not seen his father for around 18 months now and has not spoken to him at all for almost a year. In my judgment, reintroducing the father to Z for one session of contact is likely to be confusing and upsetting for Z at a time when he is already about to go through a significant change of circumstances. That transition is now the priority for Z. The Local Authority have offered to send the father a photograph and/or a short video of Z, which I consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. </p>

I appreciate that today will be a very hard day for the mother, but I hope she is now able to focus on the future and on starting to address her own difficulties. She has her whole life ahead of her and in my view, it is very important that she focuses on that and gets the help that she needs. </p>
