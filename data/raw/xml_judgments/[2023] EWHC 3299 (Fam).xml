The parties have agreed that I should resolve them on the basis of written submissions.  I had understood that the parties had agreed to confine their submissions to a single page of A4.  Mr Basi for the father has done precisely that.  However, Ms Hayford&#8217;s submission for the mother extend to four pages and the father&#8217;s solicitors have sent an e-mail by way of reply to Ms Hayford&#8217;s submissions.  I have read all of these documents and the mother&#8217;s witness statement of 24 November 2023 which also addressed the issue of costs and have taken them all into account.</p>

I therefore start from the general proposition that the appropriate order in this case is that there should be no order as to costs, but I must then consider whether there has been reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance on behalf of the father which would justify an adverse costs order being made.  In her submissions on this issue Ms Hayford largely focussed upon the fact that the mother had been successful in resisting the father&#8217;s application, because of her misconception that CPR r44.2(2) is applicable.   However, Ms Hayford also criticises the father for pursuing this matter in the light of his knowledge of the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings as set out in the Guardian&#8217; report, and in her witness statement of 24 November the mother raises an allegation that the father is trying to drain her financially by inter alia making her pay double lawyers&#8217; fees in two countries.</p>

These proceedings became necessary because of the decision of the mother to remove the children from Qatar and bring them to the UK without the consent or knowledge of the father and I reject the mother&#8217;s allegation that the proceedings are part of an attempt by the father to drain her financially.  As I explained at paragraph [30] of my judgment:</p>

It is clear that she undertook the move to the UK (and indeed the earlier trip in April 2023) without the father's consent. The mother sought to suggest that the father was aware that she was planning to move to the UK with the children and knew everything apart from the exact date of the move. I cannot accept this evidence, which I consider to be at odds with the explanatory email of 8 July 2023 that she sent to the father after arriving in the UK. Whilst the mother may have tried to communicate a general intention to move abroad via the father's brother, she clearly did not tell the father in any detail what she was proposing let alone take steps to obtain his unequivocal consent. I consider that her likely reason for this was that she knew that if the father was aware what she was planning to do, he would have taken steps via the Qatari courts to prevent her from leaving.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Given the circumstances of the children&#8217;s removal from Qatar I do not consider that the father should be criticised for bringing these proceedings.  I certainly do not consider that these proceedings amount to reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance on the father&#8217;s behalf.  The decision whether or not to order a summary return was one that I had to determine by reference to the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Although I ultimately concluded that the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings were a factor of magnetic importance in this case, I do not consider that the father can be criticised either for seeking to explore the Guardian&#8217;s report in oral evidence or for arguing that in any welfare assessment greater weight should be attached to other statutory factors.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In her witness statement of 24 November, the mother opposes contributing to the costs of the report on a number of grounds.  She disputes the necessity of the report on the basis that (i) she did not seek to return to Qatar, (ii) that the children clearly wished not to be returned there, (iii) that the father did not initially seek a direction for expert evidence when he first issued his application and (iv) that the mother is an Egyptian national, and as such the laws in Qatar are not applicable.  In my view none of these reasons derogate from the necessity of the Qatari expert report.  As part of the welfare assessment that I was called upon to make in this case I needed evidence of the legal system in Qatar to consider whether issues surrounding the children&#8217;s welfare were capable of being tried in that country (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A child) (Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 80</ref> at [39]).  That the mother did not wish herself to return to Qatar did not diminish the need for this evidence.  The fact that children were expressing clear a wish to remain the UK indeed emphasised the importance of obtaining this evidence.</p>

It was clearly essential that I was able to understand what the Qatari court had decided and the obtaining of a certified translation of its judgment was the only appropriate mechanism of doing so.  I am less certain that it was necessary to translate other documents from the Qatari proceedings.  The supplemental bundle in this case contains 211 pages of documents from the Qatari proceedings of which around 50 pages are certified translations.   In fact very limited reference was made to this bundle during the hearing.  That said, I note that Russell J&#8217;s order provided only for the translation of documents that the parties considered to be relevant and I therefore assume that the parties did consider these documents to be sufficiently relevant to warrant translation.  Moreover, the total translation costs of &#163;327 are a very modest part of the costs in this case.  In the circumstances I again consider that the appropriate costs order in relation to the translation of documents is that these costs should be met equally by both parents.</p>

The mother&#8217;s first statement filed on 22 September 2023 did not provide any details regarding the visa application.  Following correspondence between the parties, the mother&#8217;s solicitors in an email dated 4 October 2023 identified that the children were in the UK on dependant visas valid until 31 December 2024.  Nonetheless, dissatisfied with this response the father issued an application for a disclosure order against the Home Office on 11 October 2023 to provide details of the mother&#8217;s visa application(s).  </p>
