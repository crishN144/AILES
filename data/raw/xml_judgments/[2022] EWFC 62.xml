	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have before me today an application by DR, who is the wife in divorce proceedings.  She has brought applications today for maintenance pending suit until decree and thereafter interim periodical payments on behalf of herself and the children of the family.  There is also an application for what we call a &#8220;LSPO&#8221; order, that is for legal fees funding, which she brings pursuant both to the Family Procedure Rules and pursuant to Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am not going to give very much of the background to this case.  This has been a rushed hearing by definition - that is not a complaint - but what happens in these interim hearings, just so the parties understand, is that I, as the judge, have to do the best that I can on the information that is available.  I do not make any findings of fact today, so anything that I say is not in any sense binding on me, if I am the judge that deals with this case, nor still less is it binding on any other judge.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The job of the judge in these interim applications is really quite a difficult one because the judge is normally faced with contrasting presentations as to value, as to income and as to need.  Well, need, it is easy enough to resolve, but value, for example, in this case, we have a presentation on behalf of the wife which suggests that the assets in this case are in the region of &#163;23 million; the husband says that the assets in this case are in the region of &#163;8&#160;million and illiquid.  It is not my task today, and it is not possible for me today, to make any determination at all as to the veracity of either party&#8217;s presentation on that issue.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The very short background is as follows.  The parties were married in 2008.  This was, I am told, an arranged marriage, with DR travelling from India to be married to ES, who was resident in England.  The parties have lived since they were married with the husband&#8217;s parents in a very fine property indeed just outside London.  I have seen photographs of the property.  It is impressive and I think it is fair to say a truly magnificent property.  As far as I can tell, it is owned one-third by the husband and two-thirds by his parents.  It is not right for me to go in any way behind that presentation today.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are two children, FT, who is now ten, and GU, who is now seven.  They are both at school locally in different private schools.  As I understand it, it is not disputed that the husband is going to pay the school fees for the time being.  Obviously by &#8220;for the time being&#8221; what I really mean, and that is the duration of the order that I am going to make today, that is until a final order is made in this case or until further order if there is an earlier order than that.  It was suggested to me that my order would last only until the FDR.  Well, I hope that this case will settle at the FDR, it should, and I will say a little bit more about that in a moment, but if it does not, it would be quite wrong for the funding, either of maintenance funding or legal fees funding, to be cut off at that date.  Of course, it is open to either party to apply for a variation of the order that I am going to make today, but the reality is that the cost of making and preparing for and pursuing that application would almost certainly outweigh the benefit that either party might derive from making that application.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">And so the sad background here is that the parties have become embroiled in expensive, bitter and really quite dangerous litigation.  It is not for me to make any findings, again at this stage, about whose fault that is, but there are certain things that have happened which do not sit very easily, I would suggest, with any judge who looks at these cases.  An example is the cutting off without warning of the wife&#8217;s credit cards.  This is a high-spending family.  I am not going to get into hyperbole or adjectives about it, but it is fair to say, on any view, it is a high-spending family, and the wife has had the use of credit cards and it is beyond my understanding how anybody could have thought that it was in any sense appropriate simply to cut her off without warning.  It creates what Mostyn J described in a slightly different context in another case, something of a &#8220;nuclear winter&#8221; that descends over everybody.  It causes a very bad feeling indeed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Another curious thing that the husband, I am told, has done in this case and, again, I make no finding about it, was to sell the wife&#8217;s personalised numberplate on her high end SUV and replace it with an ordinary number.  Well, given the assets in this case, selling a numberplate for &#163;15,000, I bet it caused far more than &#163;15,000-worth of legal fees and hot air generated as a result of that really rather horrible move.  The husband may have a defence to that; he may say he had a very good reason for it; he may say that he told her about it.  I reassure him, I am not making findings, but if he did do that, I really do ask him to examine his conscience as to what benefit he thought he could possibly gain from it other than something like an act of spite.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I hope that, following this hearing, the parties will press the pause button on everything they are doing in this case except trying to get the case ready to have a sensible negotiation.  They need to instruct an accountant.  The businesses need to be valued.  There are two businesses, two companies.  I am told that they are owned one-third by the husband and two-thirds by his parents.  One of the companies. in particular, owns a vast number of extremely valuable properties, some commercial, some residential.  I am told they are in the accounts at cost value.  Some of them have been written down.  I think, from an accounting perspective, that is allowable.  I do not know whether these are properties that have gone up or down in value.  I can well see that commercial property such as one engaged in events or a hotel might have gone down during the last extraordinary two years that we have had in the world, and who knows where and when the pandemic will end.  I can well imagine that residential properties, some of them dating back to as long ago as 2003, may well have gone up in value.  And so the parties are going to have to find a way to have some sample valuations.  It would be far too expensive to value all of them.  It is not for me to advise on that, but when I was at the bar in cases like this, I would sit down with my opposite number, counsel or solicitor, or both, on the other side, and the instructed accountant, and have a discussion about it.  How do we sensibly have a valuation of this portfolio which is proportionate and is appropriate?  And, obviously, the husband and his parents are going to have to be involved in that exercise because they know the properties.  They, of course, cannot have the last word, but there is no reason why they should not get on with this straightaway, and I am not at all clear why it has not already been started.  Only when they have those sample valuations and then the accountant&#8217;s report as to valuation can they start a sensible negotiation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The other issue of some significance in this case is going to be the extent to which, if any, there is a discount for the fact that the husband has a minority holding in these two or more companies.  Instinctively, a one-third shareholding might be said, well, it is obviously a minority shareholding, and one might therefore look at a discount, but it might also be said in this case that the husband holding shares in companies together with his parents (they each own a third), it might be seen as a quasi-partnership company, and that third, in reality, might be worth a third of the total value.  After all, it is hard to see how there would be a sale except with the consent of all of them.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Well, those are all issues for another person on another day, but I strongly encourage the parties to put all of their efforts and all of their legal expense at the moment into moving towards the position where they can either have a court-based FDR or a private FDR.  Counsel, very experienced leading counsel, in front of me both know only too well the benefit, sometimes, of a private FDR.  I say no more about that.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So far as the children are concerned, they have always lived in the large house which I have referred to, being looked after both by their parents and their grandparents, and that is an entirely lovely thing for them to have been able to enjoy.  The parents have now, with the help of extremely experienced leading counsel, been able to negotiate a situation where they are going to transition towards shared care, by which I mean, of course, that the children will spend approximately half the time with their mother and approximately half the time with their father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother, as part of that agreement, has agreed to move out of the home.  The reason why it is appropriate for her to move out in this case is obvious: that is that it must be a very difficult environment indeed for all of them, living together, given the tension that there now is between the husband and the wife, and given that the property is co-owned by the husband and his parents, it is obviously the wife who is going to be moving out.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is a dispute here about the cost of property which she should have.  The wife has, and I can understand the frustration about this on behalf of the husband, the wife has put forward various figures for housing of &#163;3,500 a month, &#163;4,500 a month, &#163;6,000 a month.  I can understand the frustration of the husband and those advising him when the target keeps moving in that way.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The husband has put forward a number of suggested rental properties.  One or two of them really do not do him justice, particularly one property which he put forward, we all know which one it was, I am not going to dwell on it.  It is unreasonable to expect his wife and his children to move out from the grand property that they now live in to what is, by the standard of this case, a modest semi-detached house in an urban setting.  I am not going to run through all of the properties that there are in this case.  What I am aware of is that the wife needs to move imminently.  She has found a very fine property in a gated community within a very short walk of the school.  I can well understand why she wants to move to that property.  It would be very hard on her for the children to see her living in a significantly different and reduced situation from the one that the father is living in.  If the transition to shared care is to work, as I hope it does, and as I hope the parents want it to, then it needs to be on the basis that the children like both of their homes.  </p>

My guess is that whatever figure I alight upon today as a suitable figure for rent, she will actually decide to spend some of the other money that I am going to order that the husband pay her on her rent, because she particularly wants this property, and in a sense, the better her home situation, the less money she is going to need to spend on other things like going out to eat or going on holiday.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MR EWINS:  Somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000, but I do not have the figure to hand.</p>

So the figure under council tax is the actual figure that it is, please.  That is the one to be inserted in that column, and bear in mind I think that they go up in March normally, so you might want to allow for, I do not know, a 5 per cent increase, but that figure will not be a made-up figure, it will be an actual figure according to what the----</p>

That is the figure that I will put in.  I think in terms of an inflationary increase, it is just going to have to be absorbed.  I mean, it is, in the context of this case, a 5 per cent increase in that is not an amount of money to make too much difference.</p>

Well, there could be any number of reasons for that, but one can understand the wife being suspicious that it has suddenly stopped now.  Against that, it may very well be that ES&#8217;s parents have decided that, given that their son is spending so much money on legal fees and other things that they just do not want to go on giving him that amount of money.  Time will tell as to what the reasons were and whether this will be reinstated, but the only way that the husband, as far as I can see, is going to be able to fund the orders that I am going to make, because I have not come on to the legal fees funding part of it yet, is by borrowing.

If the values of the properties are more than the historic or written down values in the accounts, well then, the loan to value ratio will go down.  I, of course, equally have to accept that if the properties have gone down in value, then the loan to value ratio will have gone up, but it seems to me that there is clear evidence of the husband&#8217;s or the company&#8217;s ability to borrow money in order to fund this crisis, and it is a crisis; it is a temporary crisis, but that is where the parties are, and if this was a crisis that they had met together as a family, that is husband, wife and paternal grandparents, they would all have sat around the same table in the same room together and found a way to pay for the crisis, but because the crisis is one where the husband and wife are pitched against each other, it is obviously going to suit one side to say it cannot be done, and the other side to have to find ways that it can be done.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Now, I know from my own experience when I was at the bar that, sometimes, a vulnerable or anxious or talkative client can spend two or three hours doing something that should have taken one, and sometimes I would have said to my client, &#8220;You know, this is quite expensive social work&#8221;, but sometimes you have just got to do it, and it is important for the husband that the wife is properly advised and that she understands what she is doing.  He is a commercially aware sophisticated businessman dealing with property and companies in England.  The wife came to England in the circumstances that I identified, and she is not commercially aware, she does not understand the husband&#8217;s business circumstances, she has to ask the questions through her lawyers, and it does not surprise me at all that she incurs greater costs than he does in the initial phase.  It may be, of course, that the time will come when his costs will be greater because his team have to spend a lot of time preparing detailed answers to questionnaire and all of the documents that go with those answers but, at the moment, I am not prepared to accept the criticisms made of the lawyers&#8217; bills.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hale, on behalf of the husband, made the very valid point that when one goes through  an assessment of costs, you get about 30 per cent knocked off.  Well, that may be true in civil litigation, it may be true where one party is ordered to pay the other&#8217;s costs in some family litigation, but my job at the moment is not assessing costs in that sense of somebody being made to pay an order for costs, it is dealing with debt.  The wife&#8217;s debt to her solicitors is a debt that she has to pay, and if she does not pay it, there is a serious risk that they will not continue to act.  There is no reason why solicitors should act as creditors or bankers to litigants, and many firms are unable or unwilling to do so, particularly when the numbers are in six figures, as they are here.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The law in relation to the payment of solicitors&#8217; costs is very well known to all of the lawyers in this case.  I have been referred to in the very helpful documents prepared by counsel, but I am not going to repeat them for the purposes of this judgment and, as I have indicated, everybody agrees that I have the jurisdiction to deal with it in the way that is requested by the wife.  The question is whether, on the facts, I should do so.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The starting point is, on the one hand, debt, a need to pay fees, and, on the other hand, a lack of liquidity and ability to pay those fees.  I have indicated already that the husband is going to have to borrow money, I suspect, to pay the order that I am going to make, and therefore there is going to have to be some time to deal with this.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The wife seeks a legal services provision order, first of all, of &#163;433,700 in respect of outstanding and estimated future costs of the financial remedy proceedings up to and including the FDR.  It is essential that she is fully funded so that she can conduct the FDR with the benefit of her experienced solicitors and counsel.  I am going to make an order for that figure.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The figure sought in relation to future costs of the Children Act proceedings are &#163;224,380.  I am very troubled indeed about the Children Act proceedings.  The parties were on the brink of a three-day fact-finding hearing.  It is not for me to comment on whether it was the right decision to order such a hearing.  Some cases cannot be progressed without one.  If there are really serious allegations of assault or, heaven forefend, sexual assault, then sometimes it is absolutely essential to have a fact-finding hearing.  Whether this is one of those cases, it is not for me really to question further but, mercifully, with the aid of Mr Hale on behalf of the husband and Mr Verdan QC on behalf of the wife, two extremely experienced leading counsel, the parties were able to save themselves from jumping over the cliff, as it were, and to enter into what seems to me to be a thoroughly sensible consent order.  There is going to be a review hearing where that consent order will be looked at again.  I would have thought the sensible thing to do is for Mr Hale, if still instructed in relation to the children matters, and Mr Verdan, or whoever it is who is instructed in relation to children matters, to meet.  I think that in this case there should be an advocates meeting before brief fees are delivered for this next Children Act hearing so that they can do their best to hammer out an agreement, because an agreement is what is needed.  I am going to say that, in respect of the outstanding and estimated future costs of Children Act proceedings, the figure to be paid is &#163;150,000.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I know that is not as much as the wife wants, and I know that is far more than the husband says that he can afford to pay, but the fact is, for reasons I have indicated, the wife has a large debt to her solicitors, and she has an estimated bill to her solicitors for the future.  The lawyers in this case will be only too familiar with the provisions for a legal services funding order.  There has to be the proper understandings that any money that is paid and not used will be reimbursed, that proper accounts will be kept by the solicitors; all of that will go into the order which counsel are going to draft, and you do not need me to say more about it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I really want to end with this, and I hope it does not sound like too much of a lecture but, DR and ES, you have two wonderful children and you both love them, and you will share the care of them, you will, one day, hopefully, go to their wedding; you will, one day, hopefully, be grandparents to their children.  So I would really say you have to stand back and try and resolve now the dispute in relation to your children, which I think you have largely done, and with the expertise that you have, both with your counsel and your solicitors, once you have the figures, you will be able to resolve the financial aspect of this case.  If you go to a final hearing, probably in about a year&#8217;s time, you will spend at least as much again in costs as you have spent already, and probably more and, as I have said before, every pound you spend on your lawyers is a pound that is lost to you.  You cannot get it back.  So please bear that in mind.</p>
