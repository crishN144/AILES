Without ever losing sight of that human reality, however, and acutely conscious, as I am, of the stress, worry and anxiety burdening parents in such cases, and of the powerful human emotions that are inevitably engaged, this case is, from a legal perspective, straightforward and simple. It raises no new point of principle, and I can therefore be brief.  </p>
