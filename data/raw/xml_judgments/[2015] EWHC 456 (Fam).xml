She married her first husband in 1985.  Her first child, a daughter, K, was born in 1988 and is now twenty-six.  That daughter has recently returned to Hong Kong for work after a number of years here and was described by her mother for the first time in her oral evidence as one half of her reason for wanting to return to Hong Kong, the other half being her wish to take up a job offer.  It is astonishing to me, if that were a significant part of her desire to relocate, that she entirely failed to refer to it before in statements or to the CAFCASS officer, Miss D.</span></p>

In passing I note the mother also has an older brother, D, and his family living in Manchester, and an uncle and an aunt living in Portsmouth, all of whom, to a greater or lesser extent, are part of her and R&#8217;s lives here.  It is not argued, and cannot be on the evidence, that she is isolated and lonely here.  </span></p>

The by then teenagers, K and K, flew to Hong Kong sometimes as unaccompanied minors to see him when the mother&#8217;s visits did not coincide with theirs.  I mention in passing that it is suggested by Mr. Harrison QC (who acts on behalf of the mother) that, at some stage in the comparatively near future, perhaps at five years of age, it will be appropriate, if the mother&#8217;s application is allowed, for R to travel to and from Hong Kong as an unaccompanied minor as some airlines seem to permit.  </span></p>

In January 2004 she became the assistant director of RLG&#8217;s asset management company in London, and in December 2007 she became operations director of it based also in London though working very closely with the Hong Kong office.  In 2011 RLG sold that company.  In June 2013 the mother, along with most of the founding staff, was told by the new owners that she would be made redundant.  The 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013 was her last day there.

The first was his employment with the Metropolitan Police force and subsequently with Transport for London ending in 2007.  The second was and remains his working life as a dance teacher and originally co-owner with the mother of a dance school.  When they bought that school in June 2010 it was rather run down, but now, although it provides very limited and indeed almost non-existent income, it continues to operate, despite all current business pressures.  Other dancers and companies use the facilities there with key entry and, on a number of afternoons and evenings the father runs the dance classes over which he presides.  </span></p>

On such occasions as he is absent, it seemed to me something of a hotchpot arrangement operates to keep the classes open and also the school, but it could by no means be described as fixed contingency plans.  Although he has over the past few years taken very short breaks of four to six days, and went to Los Angeles for ten days for the purposes of the IVF treatment on two separate occasions, I accept his evidence that the exigencies of running the school and building and the complex arrangements needed for others when willing and available to operate when he is absent make it almost impossible for him to leave it even for short-ish periods.  This has very real implications for his ability to visit Hong Kong if I give permission to the mother to relocate.  </span></p>

It is between &#163;5 and &#163;100 per week, more or less.  He told me, and I accept, that in fact his main source of income is from the dancing lessons he gives at another venue altogether, and it varies, before all expenses associated with it are accounted for, between about &#163;200 and &#163;250.  The mother in an email told him he should be ashamed that his assessed contribution for the financial care of R is only &#163;5 per week.  He agrees with her and I find he is genuinely ashamed, though as noted above the figure was arrived at by a jointly agreed mechanism.  Of further note in this context of finances is that when they were together it was the mother&#8217;s contribution to the business to keep the account books and, despite the very low earnings figures mentioned by him and supported by a letter from the Benefit&#8217;s Agency, the mother did not then, nor has she following separation or at this hearing, suggested that he earns more.  </span></p>

She has tabulated the jobs she applied for and the relevant agencies, but, in reality, she seems to have applied for only twelve between January and April 2014 and then nothing much, if anything, until October last year when apparently the issue was discussed at court.  There were then limited and sporadic applications by her totalling over the whole period January 2014 to January 2015 approximately twenty-one.  I do not regard this level of enquiry as sufficient to establish that there are no jobs in the United Kingdom.  From all the applications made by her or on her behalf by agencies, it is said there was only one unsuccessful interview.  It is said by her and the recruitment consultant responsible for arranging that one interview - the latter reporting in an undated, unheaded letter - that there are few senior appointments on offer and that the mother is overqualified for the restricted number of lower grade jobs available.  In addition the mother says she does not have the expertise demanded in many areas of the financial services sector in this day and age.  </span></p>

Thus I am left in a genuinely unsatisfactory position with no real help from what I would hope in an ordinary case would be a variety of credible sources as to the mother&#8217;s employment prospects here, her strengths and her options.  The mother has such a powerful wish to return to Hong Kong that she is not, in my view, a sufficiently impartial provider or assessor of that information and, as I noted in para.28, I am not satisfied on this evidence that she cannot get a job here.  I also accept the evidence provided by the father that there are a number of other agencies which the mother did not approach at all, even though they work in the relevant field of the financial sector.  </span></p>

The luncheon took place but she gave me the impression that there was almost no, if any, talk between them about jobs.  I cannot, given what she says about their long professional association with him, understand why she did not ask his advice about jobs in the United Kingdom given his standing in the financial services world.  The answer is, I find, she made it quite clear that she wanted to return to Hong Kong.  I note also in an email she sent to the father she refers to wanting to talk to RLG about &#8220;a&#8221; job.  That &#8220;a&#8221; may of course be interpreted in more than one way.

She has proved for the most part to be powerfully resistant to this proposition, initially, for example, citing total financial inability to pay for them but that she would go to them if the father paid the not inconsiderable expenses of such sessions.  There was, however, some limited mediation, which led in May 2014 to an agreement that the father could see R for two periods per week for four and a half hours on each occasion.  I am rightly not privy to the cause of the collapse of other attempts.  I find the father&#8217;s repeated invitations to the mother to mediate were not lip service but genuine attempts by him to resolve the issues, or at least some of them, in a less corrosive manner than by recourse to the law.  I cannot understand the mother&#8217;s refusal to engage in that approach. The argument of financial inability does not survive sight of the statement of finances.  </span></p>

Let me give but one example.  In November 2013 R developed lumps on his neck and skull leading the mother to take him, without notice to the father, to the General Practitioner.  In consequence of that visit an appointment was arranged for R to see a consultant.  The father was informed of none of this and only found out once he bespoke a copy of R&#8217;s medical records very shortly before this hearing.  Although happily the consultant reassured the mother that there was no real problem, the mother, even in her oral evidence to me, could not really see and accept that the father had a right to know about this condition and the outcome of the appointments, and also that he should have been invited to, at the very least, the consultant appointment.  She attempts even now to pass off the consultant&#8217;s appointment as nothing of note because, she says, the GP said there was not a problem and the consultant was only seen because she had private medical health cover.  In fact the medical records show that the GP was sufficiently worried to make the onward referral; he being concerned that R might have cervical lymphadenopathy and wanted the view of the consultant.  </span></p>

This might fit in with the holiday entitlement in the contract with RLG of twenty-one working days plus or minus the unspecified number of statutory holidays, the dates of which may or may not fit onto either end of the contractual holidays.  If the mother is indeed proposing two 2 week periods that might or might not fit in with the twenty-one days, she nevertheless seems to exclude from calculation flying times of twelve hours each way, recuperation from the flight, and jetlag, though she did suggest there might be a period when R would need to settle.  She left out of account when these holidays might occur.  If, for example, in the summer school holidays when R is older, the two weeks might be manageable without loss of school term; but, as to the timing of the other period, she gave not even the most general of indications when they might occur and I doubted from listening to her evidence that she had made any real enquiries about the practicalities.  She does not say where she and R would stay when R was not with his father on a return to the United Kingdom.  She seemed to indicate that she would have to see how R felt about the contact.  Not unreasonable of course, but it might well lead to for an abbreviation of even those limited times with the father.  </span></p>

She offers the use in such visiting periods of her own and R&#8217;s home (which Miss D. thought might be appropriate), but in respect of which the father was wary given the historical disputes between himself and the mother, and the fertile territory such an arrangement would provide for accusation and acrimony.

For the avoidance of doubt I have, as stated earlier, applied the Statutory provisions in English domestic law with of course firmly in mind Article 8 of the European Convention For the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.

Both these parents are capable of raising R physically and of giving him physical care and nurture.  It is the mother&#8217;s inability to recognise in any real way the value to R of having his father in his life and to facilitate and encourage it, which leads me to I find that the likelihood is that she would in reality let R&#8217;s opportunities for continuing and developing his relationship with his father wither or even cease more abruptly.  This weighs with me along with the inevitable emotional harm to R when that occurs, especially given the history of his conception and the acute value to him of having his father in his life at the point when he is struggling with that part of his identity, as well as in the years leading up to it and after. </span></p>

But for the purposes of this supplementary judgment I shall concentrate on paras.8 and 9, which I incorporate in extenso by reference only whilst highlighting the following: R was relaxed in his father&#8217;s care.  He was encouraged in proper politeness.  She observed a close bond between the two.  The father was enthusiastic without being over-demanding when with his son.  He made all proper concession to the age of his son and the way in which they were playing.  They chattered and smiled to each other.  There were affectionate overtures and considerable sensitivity shown by the father towards his son.  She noted in particular that R was happy and relaxed in his father&#8217;s care, and at ease with the proximity between them.   R was described as easily separating from his father - in my view, a good sign showing an un-anxious relationship between them - and excitedly playing with his paternal grandmother whilst the individual interview took place with the father.  So importantly the independent observation corroborates the joint mutual parental account of a good relationship.  </span></p>

In many ways it may be said that the problems he faced could easily have impeded the establishment of the sort of relationship there on display in that report.  It is a great credit to the father and to R that there is now the relationship therein described.  </span></p>

I do not mean by that that the handovers lacked tension as occasionally in circumstances like this they do, but that once the handover is negotiated this little boy moves happily between the two homes.  He spends from about lunchtime on Wednesday through to lunchtime on Thursday with his father then being taken to his nursery in the afternoon of the Thursday by his father.  He stays over with his father again on Sunday night through to Monday.  </span></p>

I do not regard that as such a shattering change from what has gone before, and in recent times particularly, entirely without problem.  </span></p>

In his submission it requires a full and careful examination of matters and the expertise of a CAFCASS officer to tell me about propositions with which I am familiar after over forty years in the Division.  </span></p>

For my part, I consider I have carried that out and that it is entirely in the welfare interests of this little boy to spend more time with his father.  I do not see that the proposal I make is so revolutionary as to entirely overturn the equilibrium of this child who is so demonstrably at ease with his father.  </span></p>

My only response to that at this stage is: so?  I do not consider that those two dates and the changes that will come with them are sufficiently potent, or indeed may ever be proved to be sufficiently potent, to alter a regime with which R appears predictively to be one of ease.  </span></p>

Accordingly, I confirm it.  It seems to me unhappy that it should now be said that the case was not argued.  It was there for all the world to see from an early stage and the evidence necessary for its resolution was in place.  I confirm that order.  </span></p>
