In short, H and his mother lived in Lithuania in 2013 before coming to this country.  The identity of H&#8217;s biological father is unknown.  His mother&#8217;s case is that, when she was pregnant with H, she married another man (hereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr A&#8221;), with whom she lived for a number of years and who was registered as H&#8217;s father.  The mother has said in the course of these proceedings that Mr A was violent to her during their relationship.  That allegation has not been proved and I make no findings in respect of that matter.</span></p>

The local authority suspects (although again this has not been proved) that they were the victims of people trafficking.  Although H was given a place at school, his attendance was erratic and school staff had growing concerns about the mother&#8217;s behaviour.  On a number of occasions, she was observed to be drunk when in charge of H.</span></p>

First, following the breakdown of H&#8217;s previous foster placement, as described in paragraph 33 of the May 2015 judgment, H has been placed in another foster home where he has settled well.  Having been excluded from school earlier for misbehaviour, there has been no repeat of that type of conduct.  In his new placement, he has established good relationships with his carers and with an older child in the home.  The social worker describes it as a warm, loving environment with very clear boundaries.  H is also having the benefit of monthly respite care with other foster carers with whom he has formed a good relationship.  His main foster carers are now willing to offer him a long-term home.  Because of the location of the new placement, H has now moved school.  Although he has made considerable progress educationally, he is still behind his peers in a number of respects.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times'">Secondly, H has had contact with his mother on a number of occasions.  Prior to May, the mother&#8217;s attendance at contact had been very sporadic.  Subsequently, her attendance had improved somewhat, although she continues to miss some visits including the most recent planned visit.  Throughout these proceedings, the mother has been unpredictable and unreliable, not only in keeping in contact with H but also in keeping in contact with the professionals in this case, including her own solicitors.  She has not attended court today despite knowing that final orders could be made at this hearing and despite repeated warnings and advice from her solicitors and social worker.</span></p>

The social worker observes that it is likely that H, if returned to her care, would once again be at risk of neglect and physical harm and could be exposed to domestic violence, as apparently in the past, and also to his mother&#8217;s own alcohol abuse.  He would, suggests the social worker, grow up possibly angry, insecure and unable to form healthy relationships with other children and adults.  His health and physical development would suffer.  He would not be able to achieve his potential educationally.  He may grow up with unresolved emotional problems affecting his long-term ability to form and sustain healthy relationships.</span></p>

It may be that a foster placement could be found in Lithuania, but the response of the Lithuanian authorities themselves hitherto has suggested that a residential home would be the likely option were H to be returned to Lithuania and not placed within his natural family.  That would, of course, enable him to grow up within his own culture and possibly with contact with members of his extended family.  It would, however, mean another move for him from the home where he is now settled.  Furthermore, without in any way wishing to criticise the arrangements that other countries make for the care of children outside the family, for my part I would consider it a far better option for this little boy to be placed within a foster family rather than within institutional care in a residential home.</span></p>

The advantages are that he would grow up where he is, where he is currently settled, building on the family and social relationships he has established, giving him a sense of continuity, belonging and normality.  Furthermore, as the local authority propose, therapeutic work which he requires around his emotional needs can start, enabling him to address and resolve these issues as quickly as possible.  Thirdly, the educational and social progress that he has made in the care of the local authority would be maintained, giving him every chance of fulfilling his potential as he grows up.  This stability would remove the ongoing uncertainty and unpredictability in his life which he has suffered from hitherto.  Under a foster arrangement, the legal link with his birth family would not be broken and he would retain the opportunity of having contact with his natural family, in particular his mother, thereby ensuring that he retains a sense of his own culture and identity. This important relationship with his mother would not be lost, and, if the mother sustains her participation in contact, that relationship may yet be able to flourish.</span></p>

Thus, it is to be expected that he would experience a sense of loss.  Furthermore, he would have limited contact, indeed very limited contact, with his wider family in Lithuania.  So he is likely to grow up separate from them which runs the risk of a sense of isolation.  He would, as the local authority accepts, become increasingly Anglicised and might lose his Lithuanian identity and ability to speak his birth language.  There is, of course, always the possibility of a breakdown in a foster placement, leaving him vulnerable to further disruption.</span></p>

In my judgment, the best option here is for H to remain in long-term foster care under a care order in this country with his current carers, with regular contact with his mother, assuming she takes up that commitment, which is manifestly in her son&#8217;s best interests.  Although the full details of his past life are unclear, there is sufficient information available to conclude that he has suffered years of upheaval, uncertainty and neglect and occasionally abuse.  There is no doubt that this background lies behind and explains his own misbehaviour (as demonstrated since he was placed in care) and demonstrates a real need for therapy which is a feature of the local authority&#8217;s plan, and, in my view, an urgent requirement.  Although it is still early days, the placement with his current excellent carers seems to be going well.  I accept the analysis that it will provide him with a warm and stable environment and also, very importantly, with very clear boundaries.</span></p>
