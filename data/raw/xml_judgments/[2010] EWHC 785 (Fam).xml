Article 5 is to be distinguished from Article 2 of the Fourth Protocol (not ratified by the UK) which deals with mere restrictions on liberty of movement. The Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi</span> said &#8220;in order to determine whether someone has been deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5, the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question &#8230;the difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is nonetheless merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance&#8230;deprivation of liberty may . . . take numerous other forms" than "classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman": This statement of principle has been repeated through a long line of authority, and specifically in cases relating to mental health, psychiatric in-patient treatment, and admission to care homes.</p>

The prisoner has no freedom of choice about anything. He cannot leave the place to which he has assigned. He may eat only when and what his jailer permits. The only human beings he may see or speak to are his jailers and those whom they allow to visit. He is entirely subject to the view of others&#8221;.

For most of his life he had been an in-patient at the Bournewood Hospital, a learning disability hospital. He was then placed in the care of adult foster carers for a period of about 3 years. He was readmitted to the Bournewood Hospital after he had become agitated at a day centre and the foster carers could not be contacted.  He was unable to speak, was incapable of consenting or dissenting to admission, and once in hospital he made no attempts to leave. Because he did not resist admission nor seek to leave he was not detained using the compulsory powers under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. He thus had no right to review of his detention. His foster carers, as next friends, sought judicial review of the decision to detain him, habeas corpus directed at the Trust, and an action in damages for false imprisonment. They sought to establish that HL had been detained or subject to imprisonment and that the detention was unlawful. At first instance the application was dismissed, it was allowed in the Court of Appeal, and the matter went to the House of Lords. The House of Lords held by a majority that HL was not detained. They unanimously held that even if he had been detained his detention was justified on the grounds of common law necessity (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health Trust ex parte L </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] AC 458" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] AC 458</ref>, HL).</p>

In the first care home in which he had been placed the front door was operated by pushing a button on the wall to release the door and therefore he would have been unlikely to be able to find the exit doors and open them without assistance. In the second home he was free to leave his room unaccompanied at any time he wished. He had unfettered access to the premises. He could use a telephone, but was unable due to his needs to remember a number and dial it himself. The home had a keypad entry system so service users would need to be able to use the keypad to open the doors to get out into the local areas if they wished to go out generally they asked the staff to help them. He had never tried to leave the home nor asked the staff to open the door so that he might leave. But he had consistently expressed the wish to leave the home to live with his wife (the judge set out three pages of references from the evidence supporting that conclusion). The evidence of his wife, which the judge accepted, was that it had been made clear to her that she was not allowed to take DE home with her.</p>

The fundamental issue in this case, in my judgment, is whether DE was deprived of his liberty to leave the X home and whether DE had been and is being deprived of his liberty to leave the Y home. And when I refer to leaving the X home and the Y home, I do not mean leaving for the purpose of some trip or outing approved by SCC or those managing the institution; I mean leaving in the sense of removing himself permanently in order to live where and with whom he chooses, specifically removing himself to live at home with JE&#8221;.

The facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Austin</span> were far removed from the incapacity cases. At a demonstration in central London in 2001, a police cordon had been put around demonstrators. The appellant had been a participant in the demonstration. She was found to have been well aware that the aim of many of the demonstrators was to cause violence, and though there was no suggestion that she was engaged in anything other than peaceful protest or had any wish to cause violence, she had taken the risk of violence, and she had joined in with others to obstruct the highway.  She brought an action for false imprisonment. The judge at first instance found that the sole purpose of the cordon was to maintain public order, that it was proportionate to that need, and that those within the cordon were not deprived of their freedom of movement arbitrarily. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal.</p>

If so, in what kind of cases can this be relevant?

He concluded that bearing in mind the duties of the police and their need to protect against disorder and violence &#8220;it seems to me to be unrealistic to contend that Article 5 comes into play at all, providing that the actions of the police are proportionate and reasonable; and any confinement is restricted to a reasonable minimum<span style="font-style:italic">&#8230;&#8221;</span> [60].</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">DE v JE</span> the word &#8220;intention&#8221; is used in the sense of the mental attitude with which a person acts, whereas &#8220;purpose&#8221; in the sense that it is used in Austin is more akin to motive, the motive of the police being to exercise crowd control, rather than to confine the demonstrators. Lord Scott however in stating at [39] that &#8220;the intention of the police was to maintain the cordon so long as was reasonably thought necessary&#8221; uses the word &#8220;intention&#8221; in the sense of mental attitude, whilst Lord Hope in saying at [24] &#8220;detention in the paradigm sense was not in the minds of anyone&#8221;, seems to be referring to &#8220;motive&#8221;. The heart of the case lies in the passage in the speech of Lord Walker &#8220;what were the police doing&#8230;? What were they about? The answer is &#8230;that they were engaged in an unusually difficult exercise in crowd control&#8230;&#8221; [47]. The question of purpose posed at the outset is in the end answered only in the qualified ways set out above.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.13in">I accept that the question of intention in the sense of mental attitude is irrelevant to the question of whether a person is deprived of their liberty. A person&#8217;s belief that they are not depriving another of their liberty is likely to be irrelevant and may be inaccurate.  In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> the hospital representatives denied that it was in their minds to confine HL because he was free to leave at any time, a concept which Lord Steyn in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Bournewood</span> described as a &#8220;fairytale&#8221;. So I treat with extreme caution the suggestion that purpose is relevant in this type of case, save that it does seem to me to be realistic to put into the equation when trying to discern the factual matrix and whether these girls are objectively deprived of their liberty, that both girls were placed in their respective placements as children in need, because they need homes, rather than because they require restraint, or treatment. It is also relevant in my view to consider the reasons<span style="font-style:italic"/>why they are under continuous supervision and control.</p>

In my view as the subject of statutory Care Orders neither MIG nor MEG can be said to have been deprived of their liberty simply by their placement in foster homes (and then in the case of MEG in a residential home) when the Local Authority had parental responsibility under the Care Order and was exercising its statutory duties, and in the absence any more specific measures to deprive either of their liberty. In MEG&#8217;s case she was still subject to an Interim Care Order when she moved to B Home in the summer of 2008. </p>

By chapter 10 of the Code of Practice, Paragraph 10.12, it is provided that &#8220;application to the Court of Protection should be made before deprivation of liberty begins. A Court of Protection order will then itself provide a legal basis for deprivation of liberty.&#8221;  The same point was made by Munby J in Re <span style="font-style:italic">GJ, NJ and BJ (Incapacitated Adults)</span>. There is no statutory requirement for such an application to be made prior to deprivation of liberty taking place, and the guidance quoted above uses the word &#8220;should&#8221; rather than &#8220;must&#8221;. There must be power, in my judgment, to make a welfare order authorising deprivation of liberty when the deprivation of liberty has commenced under a care order, and that care order is no longer in existence.</p>

Secondly, whatever JW&#8217;s contractual status, she is undoubtedly the Local Authority&#8217;s agent. MIG was placed first of all by the Local Authority pursuant to a court order. The court has authorised her placement in the home. The only sense in which it is said that JW may be depriving MIG of her liberty is by providing continuous supervision and control whilst MIG is in her household. It is the Local Authority and the court who have restricted her contacts (so it is said) and who have the responsibility for deciding on her placement.</p>

In my view there must be a significant element of confinement, of restriction, which crosses the line between restrictions on liberty and confinement. In <span style="font-style:italic">JJ</span>, the House of Lords held by a majority that 18 hours a day confinement in a small flat with other restrictions on movement constituted deprivation of liberty. Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood (one of the majority) was the only member of the committee who gave consideration to what would cross the line. He said &#8220;18 hour curfews are simply too long to be consistent with the retention of physical liberty. In my opinion they breach Article 5. I am equally clear however that 12 or 14 hour curfews&#8230;are consistent with physical liberty&#8230;.for my part I would regard the acceptable limit to be 16 hours leaving the suspect with 8 hours (admittedly in various respects controlled) liberty a day. Such a regime&#8230;can and should properly be characterised as one which restricts the subject&#8217;s liberty of movement rather than one which actually deprives him of his liberty. Permanent confinement beyond 16 hours a day on a long term basis necessarily to my mind involved the deprivation of physical liberty.&#8221; </p>

Whether there is deprivation of liberty and so a breach of Article 5 will depend on the effect of the restrictions. Thus a 16 hours curfew coupled with restrictions on visits for one removed from his home area and so living where he knows no one and so effectively subjected to isolation may well mean that 16 hours can be regarded as excessive. Having said that, it is clear from the speeches in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ</span> that what must be the principal focus is the extent to which the controlled person is actually confined.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> the ECHR held that the fact that the patient was unable to consent was irrelevant. He did not positively object to being placed in the hospital. He was still deprived of his liberty. However in my judgment that cannot be the determinative factor. No single factor is likely to be enough, save in the paradigm case. The Deprivation of Liberty safeguards contain a detailed checklist, and if the question of lack of capacity to consent were determinative that checklist would simply be unnecessary. In my judgment the question of whether &#8216;P&#8217; is in an institutional setting also cannot be left out of the evaluation. It is notable that in <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span> it was not suggested that HL would be deprived of his liberty in the domestic setting of the home of the foster carers, a placement to which he also lacked capacity to consent or dissent, and which he was not free to leave. The foster carers are described as &#8220;paid carers&#8221; and they must, I assume, have been employed by the Local Authority with social work responsibility for HL.  In <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span>, although I accept that the principles were not there so clearly defined as in subsequent cases, the setting in which HM was living seems to have been one of the factors which was taken into account. A valid point is made by Munby J that in <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> the Strasbourg court stated that HM had the capacity to consent. But in <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span>, at paragraph 93, the Court remarked that the fact that the regime in the foster home in <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span> was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span>entirely different to that applied to the present applicant<span style="font-style:italic"/>(the foster home was an open institution which allowed freedom of movement and encouraged contacts with the outside world) allows a conclusion that the facts of the HM case were not of a degree or intensity sufficiently serious to justify the conclusion that she was detained&#8221;. In <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> the factors outlined by the court plainly constituted objective confinement and deprivation of liberty. They are in marked contrast to the circumstances in which either MIG or MEG finds herself.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">There is a valid distinction in my judgment between a confinement within the home: equivalent to house arrest, as in the control orders cases, and the mere fact of being placed in a foster home. As Collins J said in <span style="font-style:italic">GG</span>, it is the effect of the restrictions and the extent of the confinement which matters. And Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ</span> stressed the need to examine what the person&#8217;s life would have been like had they not been placed in the location where they are said to be confined. I do not accept that mere placement in a residential or domestic setting can be construed as creating confinement of itself just because the person cannot legally decide whether to remain there or not. In my judgment, if a person is living what is for them a normal life in a family home, and would not be living any different life in any other setting including in their own family home, then it is very difficult to see how they can objectively be confined, simply because they lack the capacity to consent to that placement.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">A person who lacks capacity and who cannot therefore give or withhold consent may nonetheless express a wish not to be in a particular setting. In <span style="font-style:italic">JE v DE</span> Munby J placed very considerable weight on the fact that although incapable of taking a decision as to his residence, JE consistently stated his wish to leave. The applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> wished to leave the hospital and attempted to run away. Notwithstanding that MIG and MEG cannot consent to their placements, the fact of happiness in their respective environments, each regarding the place where they live as home, and their wish to stay there, must be relevant to the question of both the objective and the subjective element.</p>

She is part of a loving and committed foster family with whom she has formed healthy relationships and learnt to develop her independence. &#8230;she is significantly dependent on (JW) for her emotional well being. If for any reason this placement were to suddenly end, we predict that MIG would collapse&#8230;Some of the parenting that (JW) provides for MIG is in line with the parenting usually provided to a much younger child.

It is possible that tranquilising medication prescribed for her &#8216;Risperidone 1mg at night&#8217; may have helped as well.&#8221; In addition he felt that the fact that MEG has a structured day programme has &#8220;helped a lot&#8221;. The effect of the medication on MEG was not explored in any way in the hearing before me and Dr Xenitidis in particular was not asked about it in the letter of instruction or in evidence. Miss Morris tells me that the Official Solicitor takes the view that the fact that MEG is medicated means that the arrangements go beyond &#8220;ordinary restrictions&#8221; in a children's home for adolescents when taken together with the restraints which have to be exercised temporarily and from time to time when she has a tantrum.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">In my judgment the fact of administration of medication in itself cannot create deprivation of liberty. On the material before me I do not conclude that medication plays a part in restraining MEG so as to create a deprivation of her liberty. She was not medicated in order to secure her admission and is not medicated to prevent her from leaving.  My reading of the evidence was that she would require this medication in any setting. There were no specific references to measures of restraint in the evidence save that in the final care plan it was stated that MEG had sometimes to be guided away from an activity which could trigger unpredictable behaviour using &#8220;MAYBO&#8221; (physical intervention programme) techniques in a way which did not involve physical restraint, although I understood from the descriptions of seriously aggressive incidents (now rare) that there might have had to be appropriate physical intervention. This physical restraint in my judgment does not amount to a deprivation of liberty. </p>

In my view it is not irrelevant in MEG&#8217;s case that she is under 18. I accept that the fact that she is under 18 does not mean that she can be arbitrarily detained or confined even on the authority of those with parental responsibility for her. In <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span>, in contrast to <span style="font-style:italic">Nielsen v Denmark</span>, the Strasbourg Court held that the fact that &#8216;P&#8217; (aged 15) had been detained and confined in hospital with the intention that she be detained and confined there by her parents who had parental responsibility for her did not prevent her from being deprived of her liberty. Nevertheless the fact that there are specific duties on the Local Authority to accommodate MEG is relevant to examining the reasons why she has been accommodated.</p>

The placements of MIG and MEG in their respective homes were not arbitrary. In <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom </span>HL was removed arbitrarily from his home when the authorities had no legal authority so to do to a hospital setting, in <span style="font-style:italic">Storck v Germany</span> the girl was physically detained and medicated to restrain her in a hospital having been placed and confined there in purported exercise of parental responsibility and where there was no court order, in <span style="font-style:italic">JE v DE</span> the husband was taken to an institution where there were restraints on his liberty where the Local Authority did not seek a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction. There are immediate contrasts with this case, where both girls have been placed under the lawful authority of a care order, MEG is still the subject of specific statutory duties, and the courts have been involved throughout. In my view the fact of their removal from their homes and placement in public care under the care order and subsequently pursuant to an order in the Court of Protection is in my view not enough to cause a deprivation of liberty in itself. </p>

I add that if mere lack of capacity to consent were enough then all such persons placed by a Local Authority would be considered to be deprived of their liberty. The provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and the Code of Practice and the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code plainly do not support that analysis. Although neither is able to consent to their living arrangements, the fact of their wishes is an important part of the factual context: each wants to remain living in her present environment.</p>

In the draft order submitted at the hearing the relevant declarations sought in the event that I concluded that there was a deprivation of liberty were that each should live in their respective homes, attend C College, and have contact with family members as set out in the schedule to the draft order. There was no reference to medication. No more specific measures were referred to in the draft order, or in the care plans which were sought to be authorised.  On the basis, as I have found, that placement in itself and lack of consent in itself is not sufficient to create a deprivation of liberty in the circumstances of this case, then there must in my judgment be some other specific course of action adopted or measure taken whereby restraints or restrictions are placed upon an individual of sufficient degree and intensity to constitute a deprivation of liberty. The guidance in the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code supports this analysis. </p>

In the case of each there are overwhelming welfare grounds for them not to live in their family of origin. In relation to both girls, the primary intention is to provide them each with a home. Within those homes, they are not objectively deprived of their liberty. In neither of those homes are they there principally for the purpose of being &#8220;treated and managed&#8221;.

But were MEG&#8217;s behaviour such that she needed to be prevented from running away she would have been placed in a secure unit, probably by way of Secure Accommodation order.  As I have said above, it is of some significance here that the Local Authority saw no need to seek any order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> Children Act or the inherent jurisdiction.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">Neither was it felt necessary to make any application to the Court to authorise deprivation of liberty before the final hearing. I appreciate that the Official Solicitor had highlighted, through Miss Morris&#8217;s position statements, (although not in his in his final report dated 24 April 2009) the issue of deprivation of liberty as one that needed to be considered once the amendments to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> came into force and rightly perceived it to need careful consideration, and considered that MIG&#8217;s case was near the borderline. Nonetheless no pressing need was felt to regularise a situation which was, if there were a deprivation of either girl&#8217;s liberty, unlawful.  Of course I accept, particularly bearing in mind the comment of Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Bournewood</span>, that the perception or intention of the detainer cannot prevent there being a deprivation of liberty, but I cannot ignore this history in my assessment of the proposition that either of these girls is objectively deprived of their liberty, particularly since the authorities establish that authorisation must be sought before the deprivation of liberty commences. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">I have not met MIG or MEG but I have read much about them and heard much too. Their wishes and feelings are manifest and clearly expressed. They plainly have no subjective sense of confinement. In a non legal sense they have the capacity to consent to their placements. I cannot imagine that any person visiting MIG at the home of JW, or MEG at B Home would gain any sense of confinement or detention.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">Miss Morris submitted to me that the purpose of the legislation is to protect vulnerable persons who are subject to more than minimal intervention. She says that MEG will be subject to intervention and physical restraint because she is in a residential home and is medicated and that it would be &#8220;sad if she didn&#8217;t get the benefit of the legislation&#8221;.  But that is not the test. The question is, are the restrictions of such a degree and intensity that she is objectively deprived of her liberty. In my view they are not. </p>
