	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This matter was listed before me last Thursday, 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, to determine whether this court has jurisdiction in relation to proceedings issued by the mother under the inherent jurisdiction concerning two children,<span style="font-style:italic"/>X and Y, twins, age 5 .  The applicant is M, who is the mother of the children, and the respondent is F, who is the father of the children.  For convenience I will refer to them in this judgment as the mother and father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The mother asserts that this court does have jurisdiction on alternate grounds.  Firstly, that the children are habitually resident pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) Number 2201-2003 of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, more commonly known as Brussels IIR.  Secondly, that there has been prorogation of jurisdiction pursuant to Article 12(3) of Brussels IIR on the grounds that the father is habitually resident in this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction of the court was unequivocally accepted by both parties at the time the court was seized and is in the best interests of the children.</p>

They had gone there on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November at a time when it is accepted the mother and the children were habitually resident here.  It is accepted it was only for a relatively short period and the intention was to return, at the latest, by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017, to enable the children to return to their primary school in the north of England where they had been attending since September 2016.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The mother&#8217;s case is that she always intended to come back and has been prevented from doing so due to the father seeking orders in the United Arab Emirates that removed the children&#8217;s passports from her care and her control on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;December&#160;2016.  Since then she has returned alone to this jurisdiction twice; first at the end of February until early March and more recently so that she could attend this hearing last Thursday to enable her to give oral evidence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father&#8217;s case is that the mother changed her mind about returning here after she went to the United Arab Emirates on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November and expressed the wish to remain there.  He had to seek, he says, the order removing the children&#8217;s passport from her control as he said the mother had threatened to take the children where he would not see them.  He accepts his solicitors wrote the detailed letter dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 after the mother had issued these proceedings on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2017, after he had been served and had had the benefit of legal advice in relation to jurisdiction where he said he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; the mother was going to return to the United Kingdom with the children. The letter sought and obtained the agreement of the mother&#8217;s solicitors to adjourn the hearing then listed on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April to enable the practical arrangements for their return to be made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father then set out in a letter two weeks later, dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April that he had changed his mind.  He did not consider it was now in the children&#8217;s interests to return here as he was concerned about the lack of support for the mother and he intended to return to the United Arab Emirates at the end of this year.  As a result of that change of position when the matter came before Her Honour Judge Jakens on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2017 directions were made for this hearing to be listed to determine the issue of jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This matter was listed with a time estimate of one day.  The oral evidence did not conclude until just before 5pm.  It was a gross under estimate. This was, and always was, a two day case.  I directed written closing submissions and I am giving this judgment on the next working day, as the mother was returning to the United Arab Emirates before the judgment and the father was going to be unavailable other than for a limited period of time today.</p>

A draft order was submitted by Miss Guha with her closing submissions. The father was clear in his oral evidence that he would ensure that any order, if it was made by this court, would be complied with.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Essentially, the father disputes that the children have habitual residence.  He says it has been acquired in the United Arab Emirates.  He does not accept that he, in the terms of Article 12(3), has unequivocally accepted the jurisdiction of the court and even if he is unsuccessful in relation to both of those matters he says if the court does decide it has jurisdiction it should decline jurisdiction on the grounds of <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens,</span> in that the United Arab Emirates is the more suitable forum and these proceedings should be stayed.  The mother resists the court exercising its discretion in relation to a stay on <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>.  She does not accept there are any proceedings afoot in the United Emirates and that any involvement she may have had with procedures there she submits that has been through no choice as they post-dated the father&#8217;s steps in removing the children&#8217;s passports from her control.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The relevant background, the essential background, is not disputed and can be taken quite shortly.  The father was born in the Lebanon to Palestinian parents.  They moved as a family to the United Arab Emirates in 1982.  The father remained there until 1998, when he moved to Slovakia to study medicine.  He obtained Slovakian citizenship in 2012.  The mother was born in the United Arab Emirates, but has Jordanian nationality.  She was brought up in the United Arab Emirates although went to Jordan to attend university, before returning back to the United Arab Emirates after that.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The parties were married in Abu Dhabi in November 2010.  The mother joined the father in Slovakia in February 2011.  She soon became pregnant and returned back to the UAE for a number of months, before returning to Slovakia for the children&#8217;s birth on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2011.  The children have Slovakian citizenship.  The mother returned back to the UAE in late 2011 so she could have the support of her family and returned back to Slovakia with the children in April 2012.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Between 2012 and late 2013 there followed a pattern of the mother spending time in Slovakia with the children and the father, then going back and spending time in the UAE with her family whilst the father remained working in Slovakia.  Both parties give differing accounts as to why this took place. The mother was concerned at the father&#8217;s long working hours and there was a suspicion of other relationships. The father says the mother could not cope without the help and support of her family.  There was some limited evidence that the mother had some medical treatment for depression in Slovakia during this time, although the parties disagreed as to the reasons for this intervention.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father completed his studies and training in Slovakia at the end of 2013 and secured employment as a consultant cardiologist in the United Kingdom in January&#160;2014.  The mother and children joined him.  The intention then was for the father to be able to work in this jurisdiction for a period of five years, which would enable him to get the necessary licence to enable him, if that was the agreement between the parties, to practice back in the UAE.  He initially worked in Lincolnshire, which is where the mother and children joined him. The mother and children lived there until they moved to North West England with the father in October 2015.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">During this period the mother, as she had done before, returned back to the UAE to see her family and ensure her residence status in the UAE was kept up to date.  When she was in Lincolnshire with the children, the children attended nursery and the mother was their primary carer.  During the time the family was in England from October 2015 the mother and children had about two relatively short visits to the UAE, but otherwise remained living in England.  In September 2016 the children started attending primary school, following their attendance at nursery before then.  According to the mother the children quickly settled into school, were happy there, they liked different aspects of the school.  She described in her oral evidence X liking computers whereas Y had a good and close relationship with his class teacher and the headmaster and they both joined in and took part in various school activities.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The mother became pregnant again, there were complications with that pregnancy and she required hospital treatment.  At that time the father was working during the week as a consultant cardiologist in Devon.  Although there is a disagreement between the parties as to the precise circumstances of the decision, it is agreed the mother and children went to the UAE on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. This decision was made quickly as the mother at that time felt well enough to travel.  Agreement was reached with the school for the children to have a temporary leave of absence from the school to enable the mother to go back to the UAE and for the children to be back for the start of the January term, which was 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017.  A single ticket was purchased for the mother and children due to the cost of purchasing a return ticket at such short notice.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">There is a dispute between the parties as to what discussions there had been at around this time about divorce, and who instigated it.  The mother says it was raised by the father, as set out in paragraph 19 of her third statement. The father says it was the mother who raised it shortly after she had returned back to the UAE.  It is clear that by the time of the message between the parties from the father to the mother on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;November 2016 there had been some discussion about divorce. There is a reference to that when the father says in a message to the mother, he sets out various things and includes at paragraph 4:  </p>

During that period he made three trips to the UAE. He last saw the children face to face on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January 2017.

They were sent at an entirely different time, in an entirely different context and after a significant gap of time.  The fact is that in December 2016 the mother was seeking to return here, as had been planned and agreed between the parties in November, and the father was not agreeing and had by then taken unilateral steps to prevent the mother returning to this jurisdiction by removing the children&#8217;s passports.  Any steps taken after that by the mother have to be viewed, in my judgment, in that light.</p>

She was very clear in her oral evidence she did that in circumstances where she was unable to bring them back to this jurisdiction, as had been planned, that the children were bored. She was unable to register them for school because they were then in the UAE on a three month tourist visa, so she took steps to keep them occupied. She said initially they settled in but quickly became bored, because all of the children there were much younger than them and became reluctant to attend.  They have not attended nursery since the middle of May.  The only other activity that they have done is karate.  They have weekly karate lessons, which they enjoy, but apart from that there have been no other steps taken in relation to providing them with any wider education or integration in the society there.</p>

The mother gave oral evidence with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter and her statements that she had signed had been translated.  However, it was clear during her oral evidence that her understanding of English was quite good.  In fact she gave a number of her answers in English.  She acknowledged that if she came back initially that it is likely to be at the expense of her family, as the father was refusing to assist her financially due to what he described were his difficult financial circumstances.  She set out that her plan is to return to North West England, to rent accommodation and she had made some preliminary enquiries, and for the children to return to their previous primary school. She had been in communication with the school, they had been unable to confirm the place because the children need to be physically present in the jurisdiction to be able to make an application, but the mother had understood they would be treated as a priority.</p>

As with the analogy of a see-saw, as the child quite quickly put down the first roots which represented the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up would probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state at the point at which he achieved the requisite de-integration from it.</p>

First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction in relation to matrimonial proceedings alone.  It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility.  Second, the emphasis is on the acceptance of jurisdiction &#8216;expressly&#8217; or &#8216;in an unequivocal manner.&#8217;  This must mean that acceptance of jurisdiction of a court other than that of the child&#8217;s habitual residence is not lightly to be inferred, and that the paradigm case will be actual agreement by the parents at the time the matrimonial proceedings are instituted.&#8221;</span></p>

I did not consider she was untruthful about some of the key aspects.  I accept her evidence that she did not raise the issue of divorce first and I accept her evidence that she did not change her mind about returning back to this jurisdiction.  Whilst there may have been discussions about the difficulties in the parties&#8217; relationship, it was the father who took the lead on this and any discussions regarding divorce.  The mother&#8217;s third statement at paragraph 19, which considers this, is supported by the electronic communication on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016.  It is quite clear the father was taking the lead in this matter, which is entirely consistent with what, in my judgment, was obviously the dynamics in this relationship, which is where the father has been and needs to be in control of the situation.  It is not without note that two days after that electronic communication was sent on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November the mother miscarried on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November.</p>

I do not accept the father&#8217;s evidence that the mother threatened to remove the children to somewhere where he would not find them.  Her intention was to return back here, that has always been her intention.  She wanted to return here with the children.  That remained her position and she was thwarted from fulfilling that step by the action the father took in removing the children&#8217;s passports in December 2016 and thereafter ignoring her request to return back here.  That position is supported by the communication I have already referred to by the mother requesting flight tickets to be bought in December 2016 and the father&#8217;s ignoring that request, by her issuing these proceedings promptly once she had received legal advice about what the position was.  I reject the father&#8217;s reliance on what he says the mother said in the communication on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January&#160;2017 about speaking to the school.  That was in the context where the mother was unable to return.  She said she had spoken to the school, the headmaster, but the class teacher was not clear about what the position was. She had been contacted by one of the other mother&#8217;s at the school and she considered that clarification should be given to the school.</p>

Any step taken by the mother regarding the children, as I have said, needs to be seen by that light.  As she described in her evidence registering the children with the nursery was to alleviate the children becoming bored, they could not be registered at school for the reasons she gave.  It was not ideal as the children quickly became bored at nursery and then became reluctant to attend.  This is far removed from the situation where it could be said that the children had become integrated within a different jurisdiction.  As she said when she was asked in oral evidence about the communication asking the father to speak to the school on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January 2017, she had no choice as she could not return because of the removal of the passports.</p>

Whether this is regarded as a condition defeasant makes no difference: the result in the actual decision depends upon what happens later.  It might be possible to take a similar approach to prorogation, so that the apparent seisin when the application is lodged does not mature into actual seisin until the respondent is served and has an opportunity to indicate whether or not he accepts jurisdiction.

That is supported because <span style="font-style:italic">Gogova</span> can be distinguished from this case because there the applicant was unable to serve the father and the court had appointed a legal representative to represent the father, who then accepted jurisdiction but who had not had direct instructions with the father. That is a very different situation to the situation we have here, where the father had been served, had legal advice specifically in relation to issues of jurisdiction and then wrote the letter dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April effectively setting out that he consented and was expressed to be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">delighted&#8217;</span> about the orders being sought by the mother.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I agree also with Miss Guha that the change in position regarding jurisdiction by this father between 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April was a tactical manoeuvre by him, to bolster his change in position that the children should not be returned to this jurisdiction. That again is consistent with the court&#8217;s assessment in relation to his controlling nature regarding these matters and is consistent with the without notice steps he took on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;December to remove the passports. His controlling attitude continued to be displayed in texts.  I read just one by way of example. In the text exchanges on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;April 2017 he says as follows<span style="font-style:italic">:  &#8220;I am the one who decides how my kids will live and where and according to the will of God.  I do not want any more discussions.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The children and the mother have been in a state of limbo since 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016, unable to take the steps she wished to do as a result of the father&#8217;s actions. Whilst I acknowledge there will be some disruption in returning here after such a gap the mother has made the essential initial enquiries regarding the practical arrangements in relation to school and accommodation.  In the absence of any financial contribution from the father, or only a limited contribution from the father, she will have some financial support from her own family.  Whilst acknowledging the father no longer lives in North West England, the family will at least be in the same jurisdiction.</p>

Miss&#160;Chokowry accepted that once Article 12(3) has been satisfied it cannot be resiled from.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Turning, finally, to the issue of <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>.  There is no issue between the parties regarding the relevant principles.  In my judgment, applying those principles, I am satisfied this jurisdiction is the relevant jurisdiction and that any application for a stay should be rejected.  I reach that conclusion for the following reasons.  Firstly, whilst the parties and the children undoubtedly have a connection with the United Arab Emirates, as I have already set out, the mother&#8217;s continued presence there since December 2016 when she wished to return here has been primarily as a result of the unilateral steps and actions taken by the father.  In effect, as the mother said in her oral evidence, she has had no choice but to remain there.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Secondly, the mediation the parties took part in between family members has to be looked at in the context that was after the father had removed the children&#8217;s passports.  I accept that the mother had no choice but to engage in those steps there, but agreement was not reached.  The existence of and status of any proceedings in the UAE is far from clear.  The mother&#8217;s team produced on the morning of the hearing last week a letter from Byron James, who is employed by an organisation called Expatriate Law.  It appears he is an English barrister who is based in Dubai.  No leave was sought for that instruction.  Those representing the father question Mr&#160;James&#8217; expertise.  I have given no weight to the contents of that letter.  The father accepts in his oral evidence that he has not issued any petition for divorce or equivalent document and there are no judgments and no proceedings in relation to the children extant in the UAE. The only document the court has is the one from the Judicial Department dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, which refers to the family guidance file and that on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2017 the parties requested <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to keep the file until further approach&#8221;</span>, there has been no further approach.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Thirdly, the first language of the adults is Arabic, but they both speak English. The father&#8217;s obviously is far better than the mother&#8217;s, but hers is reasonable. As I said, she was able to answer some questions in evidence in English. The mother says the children speak English first and know little Arabic. They have attended English speaking nurseries, the schools they attended here were English speaking although they did attend Arabic Saturday school.  Whilst I consider that she was perhaps painting a slightly more enthusiastic picture than was the reality I accept her evidence in broad terms that the children have a good knowledge of the English language.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Fourthly, whilst I acknowledge the situation for the children and the mother returning here may be difficult, it was only eight weeks ago that the father expressed his delight that this was going to take place and that it had his full support.  The evidence of a significant change in his financial circumstances and changes regarding his intention to return to the UAE are somewhat vague and I strongly suspect is presented in a way to support his position and decisions that he has unilaterally made as to what he considers is in the best interests for the children.  The message that I read out about how he is the only one who decides how the children will live, where and he does not want any more discussions is a revealing window into the father&#8217;s attitude.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Fifthly, the issues concerning the father&#8217;s fears about the mother&#8217;s ability to care for the children in this jurisdiction can and will be, if necessary, considered in contested proceedings here. Whilst any move here may cause the children some emotional upset this has to be due in large part to the father&#8217;s actions that I have indicated, namely, removal of the passports on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December and changing his position about the issue of jurisdiction here which has resulted in yet further delay.  From the children&#8217;s perspective the delays caused by this jurisdictional dispute have been contrary to their welfare, but not to the extent that the court should stay these proceedings.  I am satisfied that the mother will ensure that all their needs will be met, as she has done to date.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Sixthly, the special circumstances that exist here are that the mother was unaware of her legal position in relation to issuing proceedings here until February 2017 and the mother&#8217;s position has really been as a result of not being able to come back here due to the unilateral action taken by the father in removing the passports.  It is quite clear, as I have already found, the mother wanted to be able to return back to this jurisdiction and was making requests to do so in December 2016, which the father ignored.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Finally, I have weighed in the balance the mother&#8217;s immigration position and her entitlement to be here on a spousal visa, which is valid until 2020.  There are mixed messages in the papers regarding the parties&#8217; marriage and the status of their relationship. The father was hopeful for a reconciliation, but on the papers that only appeared to be possible on his own terms.  Again these are matters that will no doubt need to be explored within proceedings, whatever they may be, in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied this court has jurisdiction and the court should not exercise its discretion and order a stay of proceedings here. The closing submissions of Miss Chokowry assert that this is not a suitable case for summary return as the children have been out of the jurisdiction for seven months.  In the light of my findings set out above that has been primarily due to the father&#8217;s conduct both here and in the UAE, which the mother did not consent to or had no real choice about.  I reject Miss Chokowry&#8217;s submission. The delays have been due to the father&#8217;s actions.  He should not then be able to rely on the unilateral action he has taken to support a submission that the children should not return here, a state of affairs he was only willing to endorse a few weeks ago on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April when he was enthusiastic about the mother and children&#8217;s return back here.  The matters he relies on to support the court refusing a summary return have been seen through his eyes only.  The mother may, or may not, agree with him. That is a matter to be considered in the context of these proceedings, once she has had the opportunity to consider them with the benefit of legal advice and with the wider perspective of what is in the child&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The final issue concerns release of the father&#8217;s passport.  In her very helpful submissions, Miss Chokowry sets out that the father&#8217;s primary position is to seek for his passport to be returned forthwith for the very obvious reason of him wishing to visit his mother who still has ill health, but there is a realistic recognition in the closing submissions that the court may defer a decision on that until the mother and children have returned back to this jurisdiction. I will now hear brief submissions in relation to that unless the parties have been able to reach agreement on it.</p>
