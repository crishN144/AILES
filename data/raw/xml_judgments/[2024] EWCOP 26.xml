Irwin Mitchell requested the cooperation of the family to progress the personal injury claim and sought to address the concerns of the family. The meeting did not secure the family&#8217;s cooperation. P&#8217;s parents are alleged to have stated that for there to be cooperation by the family in the case, Irwin Mitchell should obtain an urgent interim payment for P to be paid into his Court of Protection Deputyship Account, for which P&#8217;s mother is the Deputy, as well as provide disclosure of Irwin Mitchell&#8217;s full file of papers to family. </p>

It is said on behalf of the Official Solicitor that each attempt at contact has either been ignored completely or has been met with a response which suggests that Irwin Mitchell, the Official Solicitor and even the Court are acting in a way that is dishonest and discriminatory.</p>

Prior to this, it is understood that the local authority previously had contact with P in 2019, when his relationship with his family reportedly broke down and he became homeless for a period. Subsequently, a social worker visited P in around March 2022, accompanied by police, and Irwin Mitchell were subsequently informed that P appeared to be safe and did not wish to receive further support from adult social care. P did not provide consent to the local authority to share further information with Irwin Mitchell.</p>

The position statements lodged by P&#8217;s mother in support of this application repeated allegations previously made about the conduct of the case by Master Eastman, the Defendant&#8217;s solicitor, an expert instructed by the Defendant, experts approached by the P family to act as expert witnesses in the claim, and Irwin Mitchell, including allegations of bad faith and dishonesty, professional errors in the conduct of the claim, and conflict of interest. The application came before Master Eastman on 23 December 2021. Master Eastman found that the second set of proceedings brought by P&#8217;s mother were an abuse of process and they were struck out. The first set of proceedings was to continue, and the Official Solicitor remained appointed as Litigation Friend.</p>

It is alleged that there is a premeditated plan between leading Counsel, Irwin Mitchell and the Official Solicitor to defeat P&#8217;s claim;</p>

On behalf of the Official Solicitor, it is accepted that there are several issues which will require co-ordination between this Court and the King&#8217;s Bench Division including the management of any monies P may receive. Further, this Court may, in due course, be required to authorise any care arrangements put in place as a result of the civil proceedings, such as any arrangements depriving P of his liberty. This overlap between the two sets of proceedings is perhaps inevitable given the welfare concerns in relation to P were raised in the personal injury proceedings. However, there are significant and relevant differences between the two proceedings. The personal injury proceedings are about compensation for injuries received. The Court of Protection proceedings were initiated because of safeguarding concerns about P and concerns about his capacity to decide (amongst other matters) where he should live, who he should have contact with, and issues about his care and treatment.  Those will be best interest decisions will be matters for this court. </span></p>

Accordingly, I do not agree with P &#8217;s parents&#8217; argument that these proceedings should be dismissed, and all previous orders should be discharged. This court has jurisdiction. The proceedings before this court are necessary and have a purpose which cannot be fulfilled by the personal injury proceedings alone. The King&#8217;s Bench Division will determine the level of P&#8217;s compensation and his needs in that context. This court will consider his best interests when making any welfare orders that may be required in the future.</span></p>

It has a high value which I respect and factor into my decision making. Part of open justice is that all parties to proceedings have the same case papers at the same time.  The proceedings before me are adversarial in nature and for one party to be deprived of material available to other parties means that they will not be litigating on an even playing field. However, there are rare cases where that inequality is justified in the interests of justice. I find that this is one such rare case.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in"><span style="color:#000000">Having read the closed material, there is a real possibility that disclosing that relevant information to P&#8217;s parents at this stage would place P at risk of significant harm - physical, emotional, and psychological &#8211; in breach of his Article 8 rights. In addition, I consider that there is a real possibility that disclosing the material at this stage to his parents would prevent a fully informed capacity assessment. A fully informed capacity assessment is necessary if there is to be, in due course, a fair process leading to a fair trial on the issue of capacity. P has a right to a fair trial; his Article 6 rights are engaged. An assessment which is not fully informed will undermine that right. However, I weigh against that a consideration of whether P would benefit from full disclosure, including to his parents, now. Such full disclosure would ensure equality of arms at all stages of the process. However, against that I take into consideration that P may have the opportunity to challenge the material if it is put to him by the assessor as part of the assessment process. Further, whether or not it is used by the assessor in that manner, P or his representatives will have the opportunity to challenge the closed material and any assessment based upon when the assessment has been completed and filed within these proceedings. At that stage, the closed material can be disclosed to all parties including P&#8217;s parents and they too will have the opportunity to challenge within the proceedings that material and any conclusions the assessor has or has not drawn from it before any substantive decisions are made based upon that assessment. Thus, there will be an opportunity for challenge on P&#8217;s behalf and by his parents, and they will not be deprived of the opportunity to make representations. I consider that so long as the closed material is disclosed before any substantive decisions are made on the basis thereof and/or the assessment, then there can be a fair hearing on the substance of the matter and the proceedings as a whole will have been fair. In that way, the Article 6 rights of P and his parents will have been respected.</span></p>

I consider that there is a real possibility that withholding material from them will feed into that lack of confidence. However, I weigh that against the significant history in this case of non-engagement and non-cooperation that already exists. Sadly, I consider that the disclosure of the material to them at this stage would not restore their faith in the court and this process. Indeed, given the content of the materials, it might even make matters worse. I place in the balance that non-disclosure to P&#8217;s parents of the closed material will prevent P&#8217;s parents from challenging the material before it is used by the assessor and will prevent them from presenting to the assessor material which may contradict the closed material. However, that unfairness will be ameliorated by disclosure of the closed material when the assessment is filed and before any final decisions are made based upon it, and it is justified by the need to protect P from the risk of significant harm. Thus, whilst this part of the process will deprive them of an equal footing with the other parties, the proceedings as a whole will not be unfair, so long as they have the opportunity to challenge the material before any substantive decisions are made on the basis of the assessment and/or the closed material. </span></p>
