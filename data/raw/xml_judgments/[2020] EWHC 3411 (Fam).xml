	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">As this matter was listed before me for final disposal on 13 November 2020, the application of the family members came very late in the day, with little notice to the other parties.  I had, and continue to have, grave doubts as to the standing of the wider family&#8217;s application.  It seemed to me that it could only be considered after determination by the court of the Mother&#8217;s application.  The reference by their counsel to <span style="font-weight:bold">Re B (Paternal Grandmother: Joinder as Party) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 1358" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 1358</ref></span> does not assist as that relates to a period before the public law proceedings had concluded and, not, as here, long after the care/placement and subsequent adoption orders were made. Otherwise, the cart would be placed firmly before the horse.  Only if the Mother&#8217;s application is granted, and the orders set aside, is the door opened for the family members to be considered (or, more accurately in this case, reconsidered) as carers. I toyed with the idea of refusing them permission to participate in the hearing before me, certainly until the outcome of the Mother&#8217;s application was decided, but on balance I decided to permit them to appear through counsel, for two reasons. First, the Mother&#8217;s application includes as a plank of her case an asserted need to reassess members of the wider family.  Second, given the history of the case to which I will refer, it is preferable for all possible matters of relevance to be considered in the round so that there can be no question of procedural or substantive unfairness.   </p>

The half day time estimate was inadequate, particularly with the additional recent application of the wider family to consider. The bundle exceeded 500 pages, and lengthy skeleton arguments made reference to a large number of authorities. Accordingly, I adjourned to a 1-day fixture.  This judgment sets out my decision. </p>

Their future was thought to have been settled definitively by the courts.  Should I accede to the applications, there will necessarily be a re-opening of the fact finding and/or the welfare analysis. Prolonged litigation will follow. The implications for the children are profound. </p>

The Mother, by application dated 28 October 2019, sought leave to oppose the adoption order.  Her principal argument was that a twofold change of circumstances had taken place namely (i) the Father now accepted that he had caused the injuries and (ii) she and the Father had separated. HHJ Booth gave directions for filing of evidence and set the matter down for a full inter partes hearing. Notably, she did not advance any matter relating to potential kinship carers as a reason for seeking leave to oppose. </p>

The parents were properly notified of the hearing date in accordance with s141(3) of the Adoption and Children Act and FPR 14.15. By this time, the country was in its first lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  HHJ Booth initially set up a remote hearing by telephone, and then notified all parties that their attendance was excused, and the telephone hearing would not take place. He rejected the Mother&#8217;s application for an adjournment. I am not aware whether the Mother, who has been represented throughout, presented submissions in writing beforehand; if so, they will surely have been taken into account by the judge.  If not, she can have no complaint that the judge did not take account of any further points she may have had.  The judge proceeded to make the Adoption Order.  It is hard to see what other order he could have made in the light of the history which I have set out. </p>

This is partly because it affects the status of the person adopted, and indeed adoption modifies the most fundamental of human relationships, that of parent and child. It effects a change intended to be permanent and concerning three parties. The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents." </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">Initially, the Mother argued before me that a different test applies on an application made by her for the grant of permission to apply for an order under the inherent jurisdiction, which presupposes that she needs permission to apply. She submitted that I need only be satisfied that she has an arguable case.  She did not point to any procedural rule or case law justifying this assertion. I reject the submission.  This is not a filter stage for the Mother&#8217;s application, akin for example to requiring permission to appeal.  She does not need permission to apply. This is the final hearing of the Mother&#8217;s substantive application to revoke the care and adoption orders.  The test is clearly as set out in the authorities cited above.  By the end of the hearing, the Mother accepted this analysis and I approach the case accordingly. </p>

Further, the Mother has unsuccessfully sought to appeal both the final order and the leave to oppose adoption order.  Either (i) she unsuccessfully placed arguments of procedural unfairness before the Court of Appeal (which I cannot say as I have not seen the Court of Appeal documents) or (ii) she did not place an argument of procedural unfairness before the Court of Appeal in which case she undoubtedly should have done and cannot now rely on such matters. </p>

Second, it was the Mother&#8217;s case at the leave to oppose adoption hearing that the Father had admitted responsibility. And now, third, the Mother presents a vitamin D deficit theory. Quite apart from being far too late in the day to raise, in any event the vitamin D theory was dealt with in the written medical evidence at trial (see pages F58 and F128 of the bundle before me) and there is no suggestion of any challenge to the expert reports at that time. All the research papers relied upon now by the Mother predate the trial and were therefore available to be deployed on behalf of the parents.  I reject this ground for reopening the findings of fact.
