They have three children: S aged 6, Y aged nearly 5 and A aged 3. They all have British passports. In December 2017 the family consensually relocated to Libya. The three children have been in Libya ever since. In 2018 the mother travelled from and to Libya. She last had direct contact with the children in September 2018. Following that contact the mother returned finally to this country and has not returned to Libya since. </p>

She invoked the ancient <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae </span>jurisdiction, which is based on the British nationality of the children, as the basis for the making of the order. She accepted that she could not satisfy the usual jurisdictional criterion of habitual residence of the children or the retained jurisdiction under Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 ("Brussels 2"). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Plainly, a motive of the mother, in all likelihood her primary motive, in making her application was to lead the court to conclude that the best, if not sole, way of protecting these children would be to order the father to repatriate them from Libya. However, even though this was likely the mother&#8217;s primary motive, it is important that I recognise, for reasons which will become apparent later, that the subject matter of the application before me is the protection of the children under the inherent jurisdiction and that the specific issue that I have to decide is whether the children should be protected, and if so how.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This was not the first attempt by the mother to retrieve the children from Libya. On 30 November 2018 the mother had started wardship proceedings, seeking an inward return order. She claimed that the children were habitually resident in this country, alternatively that there had been a wrongful removal giving rise to the retained jurisdiction under Article 10. Cobb J on that day made an order, ex parte, making the children wards of court. They have remained wards of court ever since, although that continued status was likely the result of an oversight, as I will explain. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application for an inward return order was heard over two days by HHJ Hillier, sitting as a High Court judge, on 3 and 4 September 2019. She had a substantial amount of written evidence and heard the oral evidence of the parents, the father giving his via video link from Libya. On 25 October 2019 she handed down a detailed comprehensive written judgment in which she found that the children were not habitually resident here on 30 November 2018 nor had there been a wrongful removal or retention engaging Article 10. Therefore, the application for an inward return order was dismissed. Curiously, the judge did not dismiss the wardship proceedings and de-ward the children. This seems to have been an oversight, but it has had the consequence that the children have remained wards of court to this day. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the proceedings before HHJ Hillier the mother put all her eggs in the basket of habitual residence and/or Article 10. She did not advance the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> doctrine as a backup. That said, the mother did describe in her witness statements how extremely dangerous life was in Libya, an anarchic place notoriously riven by factional strife, violence and lawlessness. Thus, in her witness statement dated 15 May 2019 she spoke of being petrified because the civil war in Libya had &#8220;again escalated since April 2019&#8221;. She described how, as a result of the ongoing fighting, rockets had landed in the area where the children were located. She exhibited the latest advice from the FCO regarding travel to Libya and the situation in Tripoli. This stated that the political situation in Libya remained fragile; that the security situation remained dangerous and unpredictable; that fighting can break out anywhere without warning; and that many civilians had been killed in outbreaks of conflict in residential areas. It strongly advised against travel to Libya. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Similarly, in her witness statement dated 9 August 2019 she stated that she was extremely concerned about the children&#8217;s safety. In the last few weeks, she stated, fighting had again erupted in Tripoli, with shells landing in the street where the children lived as recently as 11 July 2019. She exhibited news reports of people being killed from that barrage, as well as the FCO travel advice. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the mother did not advance the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> doctrine as a backup. After all, she was by no means assured that she would win on the question of habitual residence or Article 10.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">However, counsel for the father did raise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> doctrine in a pre-emptive manoeuvre. He sought a finding that it could not apply on the facts of this case. HHJ Hillier was not to be drawn. She recorded in her judgment that the mother had made neither an application nor advanced any submissions asserting that the court should exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction; therefore, there was no need for her to analyse the modern scope of the jurisdiction or whether in the absence of habitual residence or wrongful retention she should consider making any orders by this route. HHJ Hillier must be taken to have concluded that the evidence of the mother about the dire situation in Libya was not sufficiently compelling to guide her, on her own initiative, to instigate an investigation whether it was feasible for the court, exercising the sovereign&#8217;s protective role in relation to children, to take steps to rescue these wards of court from peril. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Although HHJ Hillier was not primarily concerned with the quality of the father&#8217;s accommodation I note that in para 97 of her judgment she found that the father&#8217;s apartment within the apartment block occupied by members of his family was separate and of a good standard. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother appealed. In an appeal notice dated 6 November 2019 she advanced six grounds of appeal. Essentially, she challenged HHJ Hillier&#8217;s factual findings in relation to habitual residence and alleged wrongful retention. She did not then say that HHJ Hillier was wrong not to invoke the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> doctrine. The skeleton argument in support, also dated 6 November 2019, makes no mention of the collapse of civil society resulting from the civil war in Libya. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 6 February 2020 Moylan LJ granted permission to appeal but observed that as the appeal was largely, if not solely, against findings of fact the mother would have to surmount a high threshold for the Court of Appeal to intervene. The appeal was fixed for 24 March 2020. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">At some point after 6 February 2020 those advising the mother came to the view that the failure of HHJ Hillier to invoke, on her own initiative, the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction should also be put before the Court of Appeal. Therefore, on 10 March 2020 the mother issued an application notice seeking permission to rely on an additional ground of appeal. That additional ground was as follows: &#8220;Further or in the alternative, the court should have investigated whether it was appropriate to exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction.&#8221; On 16 March 2020 Baker LJ directed that the permission application should be heard rolled up with the substantive appeal on 24 March 2020. </p>

It recorded that a peace conference had been set up to take place from 14 to 16 April 2019. Unfortunately, one of the factions on 4 April 2019 launched an offensive to seize control of Tripoli. The fighting led to hundreds of deaths and the damage of critical civilian infrastructures aggravating humanitarian needs and forcing displacement.  </p>

On 9 April 2020 the appeal was dismissed in relation to those grounds where permission had been granted. Permission to appeal was refused in respect of the proposed additional ground. The only judgment was given by Cobb J: <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/515" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 515" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 515</ref>.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Cobb J refused permission in respect of the proposed additional ground for three reasons. First, it had been no part of the mother&#8217;s case before HHJ Hillier that she should exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction: see [55] and [56].

Therefore, I agreed entirely that the mother had to seek to set aside the order of HHJ Hillier, and I expressed the opinion that at the trial that application should be the lead application. I further expressed the view that the mother was likely to face at trial an argument that she had been guilty of <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson </span>abuse. That argument, if successful, would preliminarily deprive her of the relief that she sought on the basis that it would be procedurally abusive for her to seek it in circumstances where she could and should have advanced that very claim before HHJ Hillier. </p>

He points to the Upper Tribunal country guidance of July 2017 which stated that Libya was then in such a state of civil unrest that it would be in breach of human rights for asylum seekers to be forcibly returned there.

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;In applications under rule 12.42B, the starting point is that the order which one party is seeking to have set aside was properly made. A mere allegation e.g. that it was obtained by fraud, is not sufficient for the court to set aside the order; evidence must be provided. Only once the ground for setting aside the order has been established (or admitted) can the court set aside the order and rehear the original application. The court has a full range of case management powers and considerable discretion as to how to determine an application to set aside an inherent jurisdiction order, including where appropriate the power to strike out or summarily dispose of an application to set aside. If and when a ground for setting aside has been established, the court may decide to set aside the whole or part of the order there and then, or may delay doing so. Ordinarily, once the court has decided to set aside an inherent jurisdiction order, the court would give directions for a full rehearing to re-determine the original application. However, if the court is satisfied that it has sufficient information to do so, it may proceed to re-determine the original application at the same time as setting aside the inherent jurisdiction order.&#8221; </p>

If it survives this preliminary sift the court will give the necessary directions for evidence and set the case down for trial. At trial the court will determine the application and, if it is successful, will go on to determine anew the original application. Such a two-part process is routine for all kinds of applications. It happened in this case although it was not pressed on me at the directions hearing that the application to set aside HHJ Hillier&#8217;s order should be summarily dismissed or struck out.

In my opinion the welfare ground should be aligned with the change-of-circumstances ground. There must have been such a fundamental change in circumstances that the welfare analysis is completely undermined, and a fresh analysis of the child&#8217;s welfare demands a different disposition. Any other approach is to encourage duplicative litigation and to defeat finality, which is contrary to the public interest. </p>

This means that it may on occasions decline to allow a full hearing of the evidence on certain matters even if the strict rules of issue estoppel would not cover them. Although some might consider this approach to be a typical example of the lack of rigour which some critics discern in the family jurisdiction, it seems to me to encompass both the flexibility which is essential in children's cases and the increased control exercised by the court rather than the parties which is already a feature of the court's more inquisitorial role in children's cases&#8230; </p>

It concerns the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people. The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very varied; those which give rise to the instant appeal must surely be unique. It would, in my view, be most unwise if this House were to use this occasion to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed categories the kinds of circumstances in which the court has a duty (I disavow the word discretion) to exercise this salutary power.&#8221; </p>

As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedings an issue which could and should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appears that the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party's conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice.&#8221; </p>

The Crown has an obligation as <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> to protect those who are unable to protect themselves, whether by reason of non-age or mental incapacity. It is a corollary of the duty of allegiance owed by British subjects to the Crown.  That duty extends to British subjects travelling abroad on a British passport, as William Joyce discovered to his cost. Thus, the corollary is that the Crown&#8217;s protective obligation applies, in theory at any rate, to British children and incapacitated adults who are overseas. This protective power of the Crown is a part of the Royal prerogative, the deployment of which has devolved to the High Court exercising its inherent jurisdiction.  </p>

It was not always thus. The main function of the wardship jurisdiction at the beginning of the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century was restricted to protecting wealthy orphans and their property (see Cretney: Family Law in the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Century OUP 2003 at 584). However, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Latey Report </span>noted in 1967 wardship had by then enabled the court to act &#8220;to protect the young and inexperienced from folly and exploitation up to the age of 21&#8221;. </p>

In that case KR, a teenage girl, was feared to have been lured to India to be forcibly married. The court deployed the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> power to find her, rescue her and repatriate her. Since then there has been a resurgence of the jurisdiction in relation to abduction, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, stranded spouses, radicalisation and terrorism.

Lord Wilson posed the question at [53] whether an order for the return of the child (which would, on implementation, inevitably have led to the appellant in that case issuing an application for residence with or contact to the child) would improperly subvert Parliament&#8217;s intention when enacting this legislation. He then posed the alternative question whether Parliament in fact intended that the interests of the child should prevail. And he answered neither question. </p>

Does the court need to assess the likelihood of noncompliance? Consider an application for a freezing injunction in respect of an asset overseas where the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the respondent. When considering whether to grant such an injunction the court will have in mind, perhaps at the forefront of its mind, whether the overseas court would reciprocally enforce the order if the respondent refused to comply with it. The court does not generally make an assessment, when making its decision, of the subjective intentions of the respondent as regards compliance with the order. Rather, the court is principally concerned with the question whether its order would be futile if the respondent breached it.  </p>

The normal response of the court is to say: "The order which should be made will be made, and we will test on some future occasion, if the order which has been made is not complied with, whether it really is the case that it was impossible for the respondent to comply with it." There is a sound practical reason why the court should adopt that approach, for otherwise one is simply giving the potentially obdurate the opportunity to escape the penalties for contempt by persuading the court not to make the order in the first place. That said, I have to recognise that the court &#8211; and this is a very old and very well-established principle &#8211; is not in the business of making futile orders.

He said:  &#8220;The purpose of such an order is to protect the child, not least by facilitating the child&#8217;s hopefully speedy return to the jurisdiction. In the days of Lord Palmerston, the Briton imperilled abroad had merely, in echo of the Roman of old, to assert <span style="font-style:italic">civis britannicus sum</span> to find rescue at hand, if need be in the form of the Royal Navy. The days of gunboat diplomacy are, at least in this context, long gone. &#8230; </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">The English court, of course, has no authority at all in a foreign state, and must always be astute to ensure that no order it makes could possibly be construed as an interference with the sovereign rights of another State. These are matters to be dealt with in accordance with the well-established principles of international comity between friendly States. Unless, conceivably, in the case of failed states where there is no effective functioning Government at all, we cannot, as it were, send in the Royal Marines, the SAS or the SBS to rescue a child. We have to engage the willing assistance of the foreign state. That is why judicial comity properly bridles at the use of a word such as &#8216;require&#8217; in an English order directed to a foreign court. A wardship order relating to a British child abroad which seeks the assistance of the foreign authorities, whether judicial or other, is couched in language designed to minimise all risk of offence. Typically, it contains explanatory recitals designed to engage the concern of the foreign authorities and to elicit their willing assistance; and it then &#8216;respectfully requests&#8217; that assistance.&#8221;  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is my clear judgment that where the court is exercising this exorbitant extraterritorial jurisdiction, it has to make first and foremost an assessment of the likelihood of reciprocal enforcement of its order in an overseas court. The court will need to be satisfied, therefore, before it makes an order for protection &#8211; and realistically the order will be almost invariably be an order which facilitates  repatriation &#8211; that in the event of non-compliance by the actor with the care of the children there is a reasonable prospect of the authorities of that country enforcing the order. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I approach my task with great caution and circumspection. My conclusion is that the mother does not surmount the substantive (which I take to mean &#8220;high&#8221;) threshold for the making of a protective order in respect of these children. I cannot conclude that the circumstances are sufficiently compelling to require or make it necessary that the court should exercise its protective jurisdiction. I now give my reasons. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This evidence is clear. The mother would be unlikely to be able to enforce an order for repatriation in the courts of Libya, even assuming that they were functioning. Therefore, an order for repatriation which seeks the assistance of the Libyan authorities in its facilitation would be a <span style="font-style:italic">brutum fulmen</span>, or an exercise in futility. </p>

Would he comply with it? Mr Tyler QC has pointed out that the father has fully and compliantly participated in both sets of proceedings and has never defaulted in respect of any procedural orders of the court. Why not just make the order and see if he complies?  I have explained above that an assessment of the likelihood of compliance by the father with an order for repatriation is not the ultimately determinative consideration in assessing whether the order, if extending to the Libyan authorities, would be futile.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In this case, looking at the matter realistically, I would be surprised if the father voluntarily complied with an order for repatriation were I to make it. In any event, there is no need for me to come to a decided view about the respondent&#8217;s probable state of mind, or what weight it should be given, if any, because of the weight of the other reasons for refusing the application, to which I now turn. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn to the question of change of circumstances. I am not satisfied on the evidence that since December 2017, when the family consensually relocated to Libya, there has been a major deterioration in the security situation in Libya. The evidence suggests that things are really no worse than they were when the Upper Tribunal issued its country guidance in July 2017. Indeed, it could well be argued that things have improved. </p>

On the contrary, it seems to me, while the situation in Libya is concerning, that things have not got worse and that it could be said that things have slightly improved since that date.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">So, these are the two primary reasons why the mother&#8217;s application is refused: (i) the order, if made, would likely be futile; and (ii) there has been no fundamental change of circumstances in Libya either since the arrival of the family there in December 2017 or since the order of HHJ Hillier in October 2019.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Although the mother has carefully framed her application in terms of protection, the stark reality is, just as it was in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, that as soon as the children arrived here (if they ever did) she would apply for residence with, or contact to, them. This means that the inherent jurisdiction is sought to be used to circumvent principled limitations which Parliament has placed upon the jurisdiction of the court. This would not be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">The fourth point at paragraph 65 above is that the inherent jurisdiction, while not being wholly excluded, has been confined to a supporting, residual role. Recently, in a public law case, I made orders under the jurisdiction authorising a local authority to collect a British infant born in Spain from the British Embassy in Madrid where she had been delivered by Spanish social services. That is a good example of the jurisdiction being used in a supporting, residual role. However, in this case, the mother seeks the jurisdiction to be used as the primary, indeed sole, form of relief. Again, this would not be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Those are the reasons for my conclusion. An additional reason (on which my primary conclusion does not depend) is that the mother has been guilty of <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span> abuse. She could and should have raised her <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> arguments before HHJ Hillier. The failure of her previous lawyers to advise her to place this argument before HHJ Hillier does not justify the default. For the father to have been forced to endure, if not an identical claim, then one that is strikingly similar, only four months after the conclusion of the first claim does amount, in my judgment, to unjust harassment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I cannot part from this case without urging the father to allow the mother to have meaningful contact with her children. This, I suggest, must lead him to enable the mother to visit the children in Libya when flights resume, and it is safe to do so. If the mother needs financial assistance to do so then the father, as a matter of basic humanity, should furnish that.  In the meantime, I urge the father to allow the mother&#8217;s WhatsApp video contact with the children to take place for reasonable periods rather than for the very short times that have recently been allowed by him. </p>
