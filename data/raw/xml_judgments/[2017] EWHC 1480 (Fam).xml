Following the parties separation M removed GP from the family home to Sommacampagna, Northern Italy, 450 Km away.   F reported this unlawful removal to the police and Court proceedings were commenced.   In November 2014 M was sentenced to 1 year in prison for the removal of the child, by the &#8216;Court of Ascoli Piceno, Criminal Division&#8217;.  An appeal against that decision was rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ancona on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017.

The Court is referred to decision in relation to the Mother&#8217;s appeal and the findings made in relation to the Mother&#8217;s conduct within that judgment.

It is also necessary to record that on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014 the Court of Ascoli Piceno granted joint custody of GP to M and F.  That Order, which has been filed in these proceedings, provided that GP shall live each year in the care of M from 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September until 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and in the care of F from 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June to 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.  In addition, there was provision for alternate weekend contact and midweekly contact, F was ordered to pay child support of 300 Euros per/month.  I note that the maintenance order was also subject of an appeal, dismissed by the Court of Appeal in Ancona on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015.</p>

Accordingly, repeated attempts were made by the Tipstaff to serve M at the uncle&#8217;s address.  It is not necessary for me to set out those efforts, I merely observe that M was eventually served on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2017.   Whilst M denies any knowledge of the proceedings until early March, I find that wholly unconvincing.  It is inconsistent with her case that she spends every weekend with her brother.

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will, of course, be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13(b) and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span></p>

It is not enough as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be real it must have reached such a level of seriousness has to be characterized as grave. Although grave characterizes the risk rather than the harm there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as grave while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span></p>

However, they do gain colour from the alternative &#8220;or otherwise&#8221; placed &#8220;in an intolerable situation&#8221; (emphasis supplied). As was said in In re D <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 619" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 619</ref>, para 52, &#8220;&#8216;Intolerable&#8217; is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean &#8216;a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate&#8217;&#8221;. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child. </span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child's immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist.</span></p>

Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221; </span></p>

The Italian courts are seized of these issues and the Court of Appeal in Ancona has, in an admirably succinct judgment, made its findings on these issues.   The basis upon which it is contended that GP&#8217;s return puts her in an &#8216;intolerable&#8217; situation is essentially: F is only able to make limited financial provision (300 Euros per/month); no accommodation has been provided for M or GP; M is unlikely to find satisfactory employment; M faces a custodial sentence on her return.  </p>

The advice is less than pellucid in clarity but it is apparent that a 12 month custodial sentence is far from inevitable.

Moreover, to conclude otherwise would be, it seems to me, to undermine the central principle of comity which underpins these proceedings.  Every child who is returned to a country from which he has been wrongfully removed must, logically, face the prospect that the abducting parent may be incarcerated.  All children bear a burden when a parent serves a custodial sentence.  These are part of the inevitable repercussions from which children can not always be protected.  Indeed, the realisation that actions have consequences and that breaches of the law may attract punishment, may be harsh lessons for a child but ones which carry at least some longer term benefits.  GP, as is clear from the CAFCASS report, is a resilient young girl who has had to adapt to much change.  She is, sadly in many ways, better equipped to face disruption than some children of her age might be.  </p>

In particular, it would not lead to considerations which are undoubtedly relevant being lost, as they will be given full consideration as part of the discretionary stage. It would be unwise of me to attempt to expand or improve upon the list in &#167;46 of Re M of the sort of factors that are relevant at that stage, although I would emphasize that I would not view that list as exhaustive because it is difficult to predict what will weigh in the balance in a particular case. The factors do not revolve only around the child's objections, as is apparent. The court has to have regard to other welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence that will be available as part of the summary proceedings. And importantly, it must give weight to the Hague Convention considerations. It must at all times be borne in mind that the Hague Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly. To reiterate what Baroness Hale said at &#167;42 of Re M, "[t]he message must go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among contracting states". </span></p>

Certain features can perhaps be treated as tolerably well established. </span><br/><br/><span class="Strong" style="font-style:italic">(1) Factual matters</span><br/><span style="font-style:italic">35.&#160;It is established that whether a child objects to being returned is a matter of fact, as is his or her age, see for example Re S [1993] at 782 and Re T at 202. It seems to me that the degree of maturity that the child has is also a question of fact.&#160; </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">36.&#160;The authorities reveal a mild debate over whether, once the child's age and degree of maturity have been established and the court moves to the question of whether it is appropriate to take account of his views, it is making a finding of fact or exercising judgment. I am not sure that it would be of great assistance to get involved in this debate over how to categorise the process. What matters is how to go about it in practice and I will undoubtedly have to address that later.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span><br/><br/><span class="Strong" style="font-style:italic">(2) No chronological threshold</span><br/><span style="font-style:italic">37.&#160;A second established feature is that there is no fixed age below which a child's objections will not be taken into account. However, the younger the child is, the less likely it is that he or she will have the maturity which makes it appropriate for the court to take his or her objections into account, </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">Re R (Child Abduction: Acquiescence)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 716" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 716</ref> at 729/730. </span><br/><br/><span class="Strong" style="font-style:italic">(3) Objections and not anything less</span><br/><span style="font-style:italic">38.&#160;A further feature about which I think there is, in fact, no real difficulty is that the child's views have to amount to objections before they can give rise to an Article 13 exception. This is what the plain words of the Convention say. Anything less than an objection will therefore not do. This idea has sometimes been expressed by contrasting "objections" with "preferences".</span></p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically her own&#8221; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</span></p>

GP was very distressed when she met Ms Julian.  I was told by Ms Julian in evidence that GP started to cry, quite suddenly and continued to do so throughout her interview.  The crying stopped as abruptly as it began.  Ms Julian plainly felt that there was a degree of artifice involved.  She is also clear that GP had a strong allegiance to her mother and reflected some of her mother&#8217;s negative views about F and the paternal family.  </p>

All sensibly agreed that I should not talk to GP about the case.  Ms Chaudhry submitted that I should speak to GP only after I had arrived at my decision.  GP was already present at court, I did not want to send her away and I was not sure whether a decision would be available that day.  More importantly however, it strikes me as disempowering for a child to be spoken to by the judge conducting the hearing only after the case has been determined.  It seems to me to undermine the whole purpose of seeing the child and trying to help her to feel included within a decision making process which has such an impact on her life.  </p>

The meeting is primarily for the benefit of the child, rather than for the benefit of the forensic process by providing additional evidence to the judge. As the Guidelines state, the task of gathering evidence is for the specialist CAFCASS officers who have, as Mr Gupta submits, developed an expertise in this field.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">iii)&#160;A meeting, such as in the present case, taking place prior to the judge deciding upon the central issues should be for the dual purposes of allowing the judge to hear what the young person may wish to volunteer and for the young person to hear the judge explain the nature of the court process. Whilst not wishing to be prescriptive, and whilst acknowledging that the encounter will proceed at the pace of the child, which will vary from case to case, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which such a meeting would last for more than 20 minutes or so.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">iv)&#160;If the child volunteers evidence that would or might be relevant to the outcome of the proceedings, the judge should report back to the parties and determine whether, and if so how, that evidence should be adduced.&#160;&#160; </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">v)&#160;The process adopted by the judge in the present case, in which she sought to 'probe' K's wishes and feelings, and did so over the course of more than an hour by asking some 87 questions went well beyond the passive role that we have described and, despite the judge's careful self-direction, strayed significantly over the line and into the process of gathering evidence (upon which the judge then relied in coming to her decision).</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">vi)&#160;In the same manner, the judge was in error in regarding the meeting as being an opportunity for K to make representations or submissions to the judge. The purpose of any judicial meeting is not for the young person to argue their case; it is simply, but importantly, to provide an opportunity for the young person to state whatever it is that they wish to state directly to the judge who is going to decide an important issue in their lives.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found GP to be a striking and delightful young girl.  I told her from the beginning that I knew exactly what her wishes were and so it wasn&#8217;t necessary for us to talk about it.  She agreed to this with complete equanimity and seemed entirely reassured.  She told me that I wasn&#8217;t what she was expecting.  By this she explained she had anticipated a man in a long Judge&#8217;s wig.  I told her that I wore one very rarely and brought it out of the cupboard for her to inspect.  She was intrigued that it was horse hair and thought it rather scratchy and uncomfortable.  I asked her what her favourite food was.  She responded immediately by asking if she could select a &#8216;dessert&#8217;.  I agreed and she told me with great enthusiasm that it was &#8216;panna cotta&#8217;.  It had to be home made and by her mother.  She has lived in England for barely more than a year, her English was faultless.  It was also spoken without any trace of an accent.  She volunteered that she found school in England to be much easier than in Italy.  At 11 years old she is fluent in Italian, English and Latvian.  Finally, she told me something of her plans for the day whilst we were in Court.  She was smiling and poised throughout our meeting.  As she left I said a few words of (tourist) Italian to her.  She seemed delighted.  She told me that Italy was a good place to go for a holiday but not to live.  I told her that I would do my best to get the right decision for her but I was very clear that the decision was <span style="font-weight:bold">entirely</span> mine. </p>

I am also clear that these views are coloured and influenced by her mother&#8217;s own wishes.  The objections are therefore not wholly authentic.  It is apparent that GP has been made aware of the issues at this hearing e.g. she stated in interview <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;if she (M) went back I think she would be in danger of going to prison&#8217;.   </span>The allegations made by GP against F are also conspicuously lacking in detail.  I note that the Italian Court of Appeal made the same observations about M&#8217;s allegations.  Though my meeting with GP was focused on respecting her wish to have some involvement in the process I observe that her remarks about Italy were not characterised by hostility.   In this I see a reflection of GP&#8217;s comments to the CAFCASS officer:</p>

This said, GP&#8217;s life has to date been characterised by upheaval and relocation.  I have no doubt at all that her affection for England is both sincere and strong.  She is obviously settled and happy.  In addition GP is, to some extent, free from parental conflict in England.   She is also, of course, deprived of her right to a relationship with F and the paternal family which the Italian courts have concluded was rooted in a &#8216;strong bond&#8217;.  The information before this Court seems to me also to reinforce the Italian courts&#8217; conclusion that M <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;created a situation where by she could keep the child under her exclusive control with the purpose of excluding [F] from any decision and contact&#8217;</span>.  More importantly, it is manifest that the Italian Courts, who have considered GP&#8217;s circumstance so carefully, are best placed properly to identify her welfare interests.</p>

For The Hague Convention to have both legitimacy and efficacy, the principle of international comity, whilst not unassailable, must always be central to these applications.  For the Convention to work, children who have been <span style="font-weight:bold">abducted</span> by a parent (it is important to use that term) from their country of habitual residence must expect to be returned.   A parent&#8217;s efforts to defeat that process require to be evaluated with healthy scepticism.

Whilst F&#8217;s undertakings, constrained by his financial circumstances do not ensure that GP&#8217;s &#8216;landing&#8217; is as &#8216;soft&#8217; as M would wish it to be, I am satisfied that it offers sufficient reassurance.  I am encouraged that M agrees to accompany GP, and express the hope that she will, despite the history of her behaviour, use her best endeavours to minimise the upset to GP that my decision will undoubtedly cause.  </p>

I request that F&#8217;s lawyers provide that Court with a copy of this judgment by 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017.  To facilitate this I invite Ms Chaudhry to redraft her order to give it effect in the way I intend.</p>
