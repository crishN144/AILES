Any interference with those rights or any of them must be for reasons recognised as valid under the Convention jurisprudence and in particular must be the least restrictive as possible and be proportionate.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Before leaving the introduction I wish to add that this is a particularly sad case in an area of family law where sad cases abound.  It is sad because it combines (a) assertions of serious mental ill-health (in respect of the father) with (b) assertions that his allegedly distorted ideas have been absorbed and replicated by the mother and the grandparents; together with (c) the fact that the love and affection of the parents and grandparents for both children is undoubted and (d) that when in the care of the family, the children were happy and well looked after.  These dynamics are compounded by the fact (e) that C&#8217;s period of time in care since 2008 has not in the event been one of stability or consistency and (f) by the fact that, for whatever complex reasons, she is now a very troubled teenager indeed.  It is also the fact (g) that this hearing is itself a rehearing of the care and placement proceedings in respect of D.  Care and placement orders in respect of her were made as long ago as December 2012.  There was then a long delayed appeal to the Court of Appeal, which eventually allowed the father&#8217;s appeal in October 2014 remitting the case for this rehearing.  D&#8217;s life has therefore been on hold for a very long time.  She is living in a foster placement which does not offer her a permanent home.  It has been uncertain whether she may be returned to her parents, or to her mother and grandparents, or to her grandparents, or go for long-term fostering, or go for adoption.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I have therefore devoted particular care and attention to the case, having spent very many days on it out of court as well as the time spent in court.  I have read, reread and in some cases read again all the documents in the court bundles.  I hope I have been indulgent to all family members in giving them time to say everything they could reasonably wish to say.  I want them to know I have listened to them with the greatest sympathy.  I am of the clear view that Mr. Hurst and Mr. Godfrey have said everything that could be said on behalf of their respective clients to achieve the outcomes for which they profoundly wish; and the same goes for the grandparents, who have represented themselves.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The information in this case is voluminous, going back not only to the birth of C in 2000, but further back into the lives of the mother, the father and even the grandparents.  Much ground has been covered during this hearing, although Counsel have been successful in containing it within reasonable proportions.  There is no way I can cover all the issues which have emerged on paper and in the oral evidence and submissions.  That does not mean that I have overlooked them or failed to take them into account.  I shall deal with and rule only on those issues which seem to me to be reasonably necessary in coming to the conclusions which I have reached.  Obviously I look at each child separately, but it is equally obvious that considerations relating to C and her life may inform the decision about D and vica versa.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I reiterate not only that the family deeply love both children, but also that their practical care for them was good.  There is no reason to doubt that the children returned the family&#8217;s love for them.  When they were living with the mother and father (and subsequently in D&#8217;s case with the mother and grandparents) they were well cared for, clean and tidy.  The home circumstances were good.  Immunisations were up-to-date.  Health visitor appointments were kept and D never missed her nursery even when it involved a long journey following the mother and D&#8217;s move to the grandparents in March 2012.  There were toys around the place.  The grandmother told me, and I accept, that there were lots of outings to the seaside, to nature parks and so on.  D was to the grandfather&#8217;s mind &#8216;good as gold.&#8217;  These are all true positives about life within the family.</p>

Although the family cannot or will not or may not recognise so, it is in their interests and in the interests of the children that these things are said, however much I would prefer not to have to do so.  Why is it in the interests of the adult family members that this Judgment should be blunt?  The answer is because the family would still have something of benefit to offer both children whatever were the outcome.  It matters to all children to know that their family members are alright and are thinking of them, even where circumstances do not enable the family to be together.  Why is it in the children&#8217;s interests in cases like this that the Judgment should be blunt?  This is because it is right that when they are older they should be able to read and know why, if this is to be the outcome, they were not able to be brought up by a loving family.  It is right that they should have direct access to the court&#8217;s reasons as distinct from receiving the perhaps quite different views and perceptions of the family.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In 1984 the mother and father began their relationship, which has endured to this day.  The mother was then about nineteen and the father about forty.  On [date] C was born.  She is now therefore fourteen years old.  From later that year there was child protection involvement by a number of local authorities according to where the family was living, notably [three towns stated] and in the area of Local Authority B.  There are before me three chronologies starting in 2000, some aspects of which have been investigated, but I fully accept most aspects have not, for good reasons of time and proportionality.  Between mid-November 2006 and early December 2007 the father was &#8216;sectioned&#8217; under the Mental Health Act.  At the end of that period he was discharged by a Mental Health Tribunal.  The consultant psychiatrist reporting to that hearing gave her opinion that the father had had a paranoid psychotic illness, but the tribunal ruled that it was not such as to warrant his compulsory hospitalisation.  The father has consistently denied that there was any justification for this &#8216;sectioning.&#8217;  He says it was a &#8216;set-up&#8217; and describes himself as having been &#8216;abducted.&#8217;</p>

At a core group meeting on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2007 the father is recorded as having refused to sign a consent to proceed with SEN and educational psychological assessments of C.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2007 in care proceedings brought by Local Authority B in the [town stated] County Court Her Honour Judge P QC made a full care order in respect of C on a care plan of her living with the parents at home.  That is the order which the parents now apply to discharge.  The parents were represented, but they did not attend court.  The father told me in evidence that they had instead taken C to see Father Christmas and to give her a Christmas dinner, because they expected that she would be removed from them after the hearing.  He said that if they had known the plan for C was to remain at home with them, then they would have attended the hearing.  This strikes me as very odd reasoning, but be that as it may.  The Judge decided to proceed in their absence since they had had &#8216;considerable notice of today&#8217;s final hearing&#8217; and had not provided their lawyers with any reason for their absence.  Unfortunately, no transcript has been found of her Judgment.  It is clear though that she found the threshold for intervention satisfied on the basis of a Threshold Statement (cross-referenced to the pages of supporting evidence in the then court bundles), which she herself signed [192(a) and (b) of the orders&#8217; bundle].  It was to the effect that C had suffered significant harm whilst in the parents&#8217; care &#8216;... in respect of the impairment of her emotional, social, behavioural and educational development.&#8217;  In addition the judge was satisfied that C would be likely to suffer further significant harm if a care order were not made.  Her, C&#8217;s, educational development was stated in the threshold document and thus established by Judge P&#8217;s finding as being &#8216;significantly delayed&#8217; following poor school attendance.  C&#8217;s &#8216;behavioural, social and emotional development&#8217; was found to have been &#8216;adversely affected.&#8217;  It was further found, as per the threshold document, that the parents had been &#8216;unwilling to acknowledge the concerns in relation to C, or to cooperate with the relevant agencies,&#8217; and that this had impacted on C&#8217;s welfare.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>A subsequent Judgment of Her Honour Judge P QC dated 7th April 2009 (to which I will shortly come) makes findings as to what happened immediately after that care order was made.  She records that the parents refused to sign a written agreement drawn up by the Local Authority to ensure their cooperation and she notes a visit by the social worker and an Educational Welfare Officer on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007 (three weeks after the hearing in November) when access to the family home was refused.  Her finding was that &#8216;... it is plain that the parents had no regard at all for the intervention by the Local Authority, which was then sanctioned by the court.&#8217;  In the early part of 2008 Local Authority concerns increased when the parents were invited to a number of meetings but failed to attend.  On one occasion in April 2008 it is stated in the Chronology &#8211; and I accept that this was not investigated in the evidence &#8211; that two social workers attempted a home visit, but were turned away by the father.  In any event the judgment to which I have just made reference made a finding that following the order of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2007 &#8216;...&#160;there was a history, regrettably, of non-cooperation ...&#8217;.  Consequently, on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2008 Local Authority B sought and obtained a recovery order which required C, then aged seven, to be removed from the parents&#8217; care and placed into the care of Local Authority B under the care order dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2007.  She has not lived with her parents since.</p>

A couple of days later under police powers of protection she went to be cared for by foster carers.  This was because the father was saying he would not allow social workers in to see her.  On [date stated], clearly following discussions, Local Authority B obtained an interim supervision order and D, a few days old, was returned to the mother and the father with an agreement of expectations [page 75].  On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2011 at the final hearing of Local Authority B&#8217;s supervision order application relating to D, a supervision order for twelve months was made with a contract of expectations [114].  </p>

On that day the supervision order was continued for a further period on the basis of an agreement reached at court that the mother would move with D from the family home and go to live at the maternal grandparents&#8217; home.  A residence order was made in her favour.  That was the last time that D has lived with the father.  Since then both parents have asserted that this arrangement reached at court was forced on them.  The father told social worker Kerry Chafer that his lawyer had purposely made him late with the result that the decision had already been made before his arrival.</p>

This was on the basis that the mother and D would continue to live at the home of the grandparents whilst further evidence was prepared in respect of Local Authority A&#8217;s application for a final care order relating to D.  The mother did not oppose this interim application.  The purpose of it was to enable the Local Authority to put in hand SEN funding for D so that she could have &#8216;one to one&#8217; attention at her nursery, which the parents were refusing to agree.  By sharing parental responsibility under an interim care order, the Local Authority could and did organise this.</p>

He found the threshold for state interference to be met, made various findings of fact and made a care and placement order.  D was removed from school that day and placed with foster carers, causing the family understandable distress which still pertains.  She still remains with the same foster carers.  The father immediately applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal, but there was a very considerable delay.  The application first came before Black LJ on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013, but she had, I think, been deluged with information by the father (as I get the impression) in a convoluted and difficult to follow form.

The care and placement orders relating to her were thus set aside.  An interim care order was made in respect of D until the conclusion of the proceedings, which were remitted for hearing by a High Court Judge, myself as it has turned out.  It was recorded by the Court of Appeal that the father, who appeared in person, was not willing to comply with any psychiatric or psychological evaluation and that the mother was not willing to engage in any updated psychological evaluation.  It can be seen between paragraphs 37 and 39 of the Judgment of McFarlane LJ on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 that he tried very hard to persuade them to change their minds.</p>

As the father then again declined the opportunity to be involved in an assessment by a psychiatrist, the court directed (in the face of his opposition) that the parties have leave jointly to instruct an expert psychiatrist to conduct a paper overview of his mental health history.  That had been suggested as a possibility by McFarlane LJ in the Court of Appeal.  The father was refused permission to appeal that direction.  I am told he has since applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal it.</p>

It was submitted that she was either biased or corrupt and was party to an unfair conspiracy against the father; further, that the father had a pending appeal against the order giving leave for her to be instructed.  <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Second</span>, Mr. Godfrey applied for an adjournment of this hearing in order that C could have separate representation, i.e. separate from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  I rejected both those applications, giving a short, extempore Judgment on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015, which needs to be read alongside this one.  In short, I could see no objection to Professor Mortimer&#8217;s report, which Moylan J had regarded as &#8216;necessary&#8217; for the resolution of the issues before me.  I took the view that it was the responsibility of anyone wishing to go to the Court of Appeal about an interlocutory (i.e. case management type) decision, such as that of Moylan J, to ensure that it was heard there before the final hearing came on.  That had not happened.  </p>

On what I had read at that time that seemed very likely.  In any event an adjournment of this hearing would have meant that the children&#8217;s lives (or at least C&#8217;s) would have continued to be on hold until a further lengthy period of High Court Judge time could be identified.

The Children's Guardian told me that she and C&#8217;s solicitor had considered separate representation for C earlier on and had wholly rejected it.  She says she is in no doubt at all that C would not have the necessary understanding to give instructions to a lawyer, that being a view which she said is shared by the manager of the home where C is placed.  The Children's Guardian considers it would absolutely not be in C&#8217;s welfare interests to be asked about or given the opportunity for separate representation, since it would destabilise and make her even more anxious.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I have already mentioned Professor Ann Mortimer, who has prepared a report on the father as a paper exercise, as he declined to be psychiatrically examined for the purpose of this hearing.  She is from her CV a very experienced psychiatrist, having been involved in the work since 1982, having become a consultant in 1988 and a Professor of psychiatry in 1995.  I accept her evidence that she has had no prior involvement with this family, there being no evidence or suggestion that she has had.  Her report runs to thirty closely typed pages and presents a complete overview.  Most particularly she summarises two previous psychiatric reports which are not in the papers and one psychological report which is.  She records that on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2007 Dr. Mumford, consultant psychiatrist, made a thirty-nine-page report on the father following six hours of interviews.  Dr. Mumford had at that time reviewed all the case papers then in existence regarding C.  He alluded to the parents having refused a special educational needs&#8217; assessment for C on the basis that it was a ploy to put her into care; and to the fact that the father had described a core group meeting as illegal and had referred to a head teacher using C to acquire money for his or her school.  Professor Mortimer records Dr. Mumford as having found that the father felt everyone was conspiring against him to protect the system, the police, local authority and teachers.  He, Dr. Mumford, recorded the father&#8217;s views as being &#8216;abnormally paranoid.&#8217;  Dr. Mumford&#8217;s report under discussion also contained an overview of the father&#8217;s GP records, which included periods of depression and the use of antipsychotic medication.  </p>

The father&#8217;s letter to the GP alleged that the GP was part of a conspiracy unlawfully to participate in secret family courts, racism and religionism against the father&#8217;s family, falsifying and manipulating documents and files to reveal secret third parties and participation in genocide against British families.  The father&#8217;s letter went on to assert that the GP had forcibly taken various body samples, including &#8216;female part samples backdated to 2005.&#8217;  The psychiatrist involved in the father&#8217;s &#8216;sectioning&#8217; in 2006 was recorded by Dr. Mumford as being &#8216;staggered&#8217; to find that the father had been released by the Mental Health Tribunal (paragraph 12 above).  </p>

Following interview, Dr. Pilgrim made a diagnosis of a paranoid personality disorder, considering that the father fulfilled the personality trait of suspiciousness with a pervasive tendency to distort experience by misconstruing neutral or friendly actions as being hostile.  He, Dr. Pilgrim, felt that the father had a combative and tenacious sense of personal rights with a tendency to experience excessive self-importance and that he was preoccupied with unsubstantiated conspiratorial explanations of events.</p>

It is a report on both the mother and the father.  The father at first asserted that Dr. McGeown would be acting illegally in assessing him, but to his credit he did attend the interview.  Dr. McGeown&#8217;s view was that there were risks to a child of being exposed to the father&#8217;s paranoid ideation, to his distrust of professionals and his assumption of malicious intent.  The risks would be such that a child would assimilate such views.  Dr. McGeown points out that the father is dismissive of his psychiatric history, which is in fact lengthy.  She recommended a full psychiatric assessment of both parents.</p>

In her opinion the father&#8217;s false beliefs preclude him from accepting the reality-based perspectives of childcare professionals or health and educational professionals in respect of D&#8217;s needs.  She does not think that any treatment is possible and she views his capacity to engage in such treatments as there are as being zero.  </p>

It was suggested that the court&#8217;s (my) attitude was biased because there were numerous documents (I was told about a thousand pages in three Lever Arch files) and five DVDs which I had not seen.  I had in fact simply received and pre-read the agreed bundles which had been placed before me.  I immediately said in response to Mr. Godfrey&#8217;s submission that I was more than willing to read the three bundles which the father was anxious for me to do and to watch the DVDs.  Anyone with a due and proper interest in this case should read the three bundles.  It is a long and daunting task.  This is due in no small measure to the singular and complicating way in which the father expresses himself in numbered paragraphs using numbers for people or organisations; also because, as I said during the hearing, many of the originally attached documents to which cross-references are made by the father are no longer attached.  However, I did succeed in reading the three bundles by setting aside the whole of the first weekend of this case to do so.  They have been called &#8216;Supplemental Bundles 1, 2 and 3&#8217;.  </p>

I have therefore prepared an Appendix as best I can (not an easy exercise) drawing inferences when the numbering system used by the father (in place of people or entities or events) seems to me to break down.  I have included a sub-appendix of the people and organisations to whom he has sent complaints and so forth and one of newspaper articles which he has attached from time to time.  These appendices should be read alongside this judgment.  I shall not read them into this judgment now for lack of time, but I will give some examples later under my heading &#8216;Findings.&#8217;</p>

One can see the link between the father&#8217;s asking me to view these speeches and his grievances about his own children, even though the blunt reality is that nothing was gained thereby which could not have been put over in a couple of sentences.  It goes without saying that whatever may be the conclusion of the European Parliament when it has investigated the matters concerned (and when one imagines it has heard the competing arguments) I have to deal with D&#8217;s case on the basis of the current law in the 2002 Act and rule on Local Authority A&#8217;s valid applications before me.</p>

There was, however, on the face of it a significant disconnect between the witness before me and the author of some of the demanding and grandiose letters which he has written.  It came over nevertheless that he is a strong and forceful character.  He was unshakeable in his beliefs that the Local Authorities&#8217; actions in respect of both of his children have been part of a conspiracy targeted on his family perpetrated by multiple lies and fabrications by many people.

Both parents say that their relationship is a strong one and there is nothing to suggest otherwise.  There is no doubt, as I have said, that the mother, like the father, greatly loves the two children and that she finds separation from them painful.  She worries about them in care.

However, she came over as hesitant and timid to an extent rarely seen.  She just seemed to be lacking in confidence.  Although she was adamant that she always stands up to the father and does what she herself wants to do, which she may believe, it was difficult to envisage that as being the reality of their relationship together.  Having seen them both give evidence and noted their differing demeanour throughout, it came over strongly that the father greatly dominates within the dynamic of their relationship and that the mother by and large goes along with his views, beliefs and decisions.</p>

They made it clear by their questions, evidence and demeanour that they cannot see that the circumstances in respect of their grandchildren are entirely different.  There was a palpable sense of bewilderment as to why either child was taken into care and as to why the children might not be able to be returned home to the parents, or else to themselves, to be brought up within their own loving family.

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In response to these concerns expressed by Local Authority A about how things had gone when D and the mother lived at the grandparents&#8217; house, the grandfather told me  that at an interim hearing on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012 Mrs. Recorder Q had preferred the family&#8217;s evidence to that of the social workers.  I am quite sure he genuinely believed this and was not trying to mislead me, partly because he told me that he had not actually read the Judgment.  When one does read the Judgment however, it can be seen that it in no way provides support for the grandfather&#8217;s case against the social workers; if anything the other way about.  The hearing concerned (14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014) was for an order requiring the mother to move out of the grandparents&#8217; house, leaving D with the grandparents.  The Recorder heard oral evidence, including from the social worker (unnamed) who she said had &#8216;... given an account of the mother arguing, shouting and swearing and of D being present throughout and of needing to intervene to ensure that D was removed.&#8217;  The mother was recorded by the Recorder as seeing no basis for the requirement for her to live with D at her parents&#8217; home and the grandparents as feeling the same.  The finding of Mrs. Recorder Q was: &#8216;... I am satisfied from what I have heard that the grandparents and the mother are minimising and have minimised the extent of the difficulties in their relationship.  They have alluded to disputes and little arguments.  Those have undoubtedly occurred, but I think at times it is probable that the mother has expressed her views and feelings very strongly, because she does feel very strongly that she is losing her role in relation to D.  She is angry with the way in which these proceedings have been brought and continue and has expressed that anger.&#8217;  The Recorder felt that Local Authority A might have become &#8216;overly anxious because of the backdrop and lengthy history of the case,&#8217; and in the circumstances she did not think it necessary that the mother and D should be separated prior to the final hearing, which was then pending in December 2012.</p>

The 999 call was an expression of this and I accept Kerry Chafer&#8217;s evidence that the grandparents told her that the mother had said afterwards that she had blackened their names by calling the police.  I accept too Jessica Southwell&#8217;s clear impression as to the dynamics as between the mother and the grandmother in respect of D&#8217;s care and I am satisfied that the mother was feeling increasingly pushed out.  This (as I find the grandparents told Kerry Chafer at the time) led to increasing arguments.  I agree with Mrs. Recorder Q that Local Authority A may well have become overanxious about the strictness of supervision of (respectively) the mother and the father by the grandparents, which the family found put them under additional stress.  They came to regard it as Local Authority A trying to &#8216;catch them out&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>There were a large number of social work visits, some thirty or so, in the nine months between March and December 2012, although such visits were not on a more or less daily basis as the grandparents suggested in evidence.  There were also a couple of police visits.  Local Authority A were concerned about things which the father might say to D if left alone with her (a) because of their concerns about his distorted ideas and (b) because of his objection to having to live apart from the mother and D.  They felt, although they were wrong, that he might have been at the grandparents&#8217; house outside permitted contract times.  They were also concerned because the mother had threatened to take D and collect C and go off with them.  The mother accepts she said that, but says she never really meant it.  These concerns for D&#8217;s well-being caused Local Authority A to keep checking on the arrangements in the grandparents&#8217; house, which, as I say, caused resentment and therefore a reduction in the quality of the relationship between the grandparents and the social worker.  Most importantly for today&#8217;s purposes is the fact that the grandparents showed themselves to lack insight into why it was considered necessary for them closely to supervise the father&#8217;s contact with D and to ensure that the mother was not left alone with her either.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>There was before Her Honour Judge P QC in April 2009, when she dismissed the parents&#8217; application for a discharge of the care order relating to C, a psychological report on C by psychologist Pam Tower, dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2009, with a supplemental letter dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2009.  By that time C was at the G Child Unit and had been cared for by Local Authority B for about eight months.  The mother and father had strongly objected to C&#8217;s being psychologically assessed, which had been requested by the then Children&#8217;s Guardian.  They refused to be interviewed by Dr. Tower.  She, Dr. Tower, therefore described her report as being incomplete for lack of any input from the parents about C&#8217;s development and early life experiences.  What she did say though was that C presented (in January 2009): &#8216;... as a child who has not mixed with other children from an early age and, although she can learn the rules of simple games, she has not learned to share or play cooperatively.  In effect she presents as a child who has not had the opportunity for developing reciprocal peer relationships.  She is also a very anxious little girl who displays that anxiety through controlling behaviour and a need for routine.  This pattern of behaviour often arises as a response to having few boundaries and in effect to being &#8216;in charge.&#8217;  This assessment of C provides some evidence that the pattern of her care she has received has been of the nature described above.  The documentation includes many indications that the mother and father have parented C in this way and may have mental health difficulties themselves, which would reinforce the particular fixations or obsessions that C has.&#8217;</p>

She spoke of C&#8217;s withdrawing into a fantasy world at times of stress and of her having a marked delay in her emotional development.  She said &#8216;... most children of C&#8217;s age have developed a very clear investment in peer relationships and relate to peers in depth.  C does not show signs of having an understanding of how to relate to peers.  It is as if she is functioning at a level much younger than her chronological age in social terms.&#8217;  She regarded C as presenting as a &#8216;complex little girl with considerable emotional and social difficulties.&#8217;</p>

She, the judge, recorded Dr. Tower&#8217;s opinion that C was not an attachment disordered child, but that she had an attachment of an avoidant defended nature.  She, Dr. Tower, did not consider that C had problems falling within the autistic spectrum or that she suffered from pathological demand avoidance syndrome.  The judge accepted Dr. Tower&#8217;s view that C would have received good enough parenting up to about the age of two, but that the difficulties became clear at around the age of three (August 2003) when C was at nursery.  C&#8217;s presentation was, in the view of Dr. Tower, as recorded by Judge P: &#8216;... that of a child whose basic attachment needs have been met and who knew that her parents had kept her safe and looked after and cared for her, but who had no clear boundaries and was not encouraged to have independence.&#8217;  Dr. Tower&#8217;s opinion as recorded by the judge was that C needed &#8216;... a highly structured environment where there are very clear, consistent boundaries imposed by carers who could decode her distorted emotional signals.&#8217;  Her Honour Judge P described C as &#8216;... a highly troubled child&#8217; and expressed herself as being &#8216;... driven to the belief that this is as a result of the parenting she has received.&#8217;  The judge further recorded the views of the then Children&#8217;s Guardian, who she said had known C for some time, as being that &#8216;... C continues to have difficulty relating to her peers within school and is observed to play as if she were much younger.  Academically she is still far behind her peers, remaining at levels expected in infant school.&#8217;  C was then aged about eight.</p>

During this time there were many occasions when contact with the parents was recorded as going well, contact which included D, who had been born in January 2009.  There were, however, periods of time when a therapeutic worker or workers at the H Unit thought it would be in C&#8217;s interests for contact to be suspended so that various works could be done with C and that is what happened.  In November 2011 the Independent Reviewing Officer recommended that the parents should sign and adhere to a contract of expectations since it was being alleged that they had undermined and been negative about the placement at the H Unit.  Meetings were set up to discuss this, but the parents did not attend.  So a letter was sent to them followed by a reminder that contact would be and would remain suspended until they engaged with social care.</p>

I have read all the contact notes in Supplemental Bundle 5, which confirm this.  C&#8217;s behaviour was unpredictable.  She had swings in mood and behaviour which were difficult to handle, although the parents did their very best.  What was particularly difficult for the parents (and understandably so) was when C spoke negatively about the placement since this chimed with the parents&#8217; own very strong view that she should not be in care at all.</p>

There are [number stated] other girls at the J Unit.

The J Unit meets the recommendation of Dr. Khan.  He advised that the F Unit was not ideal as it turned out for C&#8217;s needs and that she would be better served by a small residential unit with no more than [number stated] children.  Both Dr. Eke and Dr. Khan were clear in their evidence that it is impossible to disentangle C&#8217;s life experiences as between before and after her going into care, in terms of the likely causation of her being the seriously troubled teenager she has become.

The reports would simply have to be read in full by anyone with a due interest in this matter.  In as brief a summary as possible, Dr. Knight-Jones, consultant paediatrician, saw D with the parents on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010, when she was one year and nine and a half months and living at home with her parents.  This was on an instruction from D&#8217;s then children&#8217;s guardian and must, I think, have been regarding the supervision order application heard in February 2011.  He found her neurodevelopmental progress to be mildly, but not severely delayed.  He felt she was more like a child of eighteen or nineteen months rather than her actual age of twenty-one or twenty-two months.  Her expressive language was more delayed, being at around one year, i.e. about nine and a half months behind; but her understanding was better, being about one year six months, only three and a half months behind her chronological age.  Dr. Knight-Jones said he was not too worried about this.  He thought that D at that age appeared to be within normal social limits and that the parents were very caring, speaking to her and playing with her.  He explained to them that normally such a child is referred (i) for speech and language therapy and (ii) to an audiologist and (iii) to a local paediatrician.  In his opinion, the delay was likely to be intrinsic rather than environmental and he recommended that D be referred (iv) to the genetic service to see if there was any medical diagnosis to account for her delay.  He did not, however, mention this last possibility to the parents, as he felt that they already seemed worried enough by the other referrals he was advising.  He said that even if they refused the recommended referrals he would not be thinking in terms of informing the Social Services, although he would want to continue monitoring D, probably three-monthly, in the anticipation that her speech would start to develop.  In the body of his report he spoke of repeated concerns at that time, (November 2010) from the health visitor and Social Services that the father appeared very much in control and that the mother deferred to him before speaking, practically never attempting to insist that D did something.</p>

He considered that there was a risk that the father might frighten D when in the grip of anger, even if it were not directed against her, and that therefore it seemed reasonable for the family to be the subject of social work and health visitor monitoring.  He did not think there was any sign then that D had suffered any mental or physical harm and he did not consider her delayed development to be the result of defective parenting.  He noted that the parents did not seem to have any insight into the concerns about C&#8217;s [sic] educational delay and difficult behaviour.  He said he could not see the needs of the family fitting into a model in which there would be a brief period of Social Services&#8217; intervention.  Rather he thought they would need long-term surveillance, in case the mental health of either parent should deteriorate, together with long-term support from the extended family and from the statutory services, including health, education and social care.  He recorded a hundred per cent attendance by the family at health visitor appointments.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Ruth Monks became D&#8217;s health visitor when the family moved into Local Authority A&#8217;s area in June 2011.  She had by then been practising as a health visitor for some twenty years since 1992 and she told me that seeing the development of children is the core of her daily work.  Her assessment tools identified a need for referral to &#8216;speech and language&#8217;; but the parents refused.  At nearly two and a half years of age in June 2011 Mrs. Monks says she did not observe D using any of the two hundred words which would be expected of a child that age.  According to Mrs Monks, D was not observed chattering to herself during play and only copied back words spoken to her.  She performed such tasks as &#8216;making dolly wave&#8217; only after being shown.  In D&#8217;s presence the parents reported back to Mrs. Monks that C [sic] had been illegally stolen and physically and sexually abused whilst in the care of Local Authority B.  Despite explanation and the sharing of literature with them, Mrs Monks says they consistently refused consent for a referral for further assessments by speech and language and audiology.  This was notwithstanding the contract of expectations signed by both parties in February 2011 that they would consult with their GP to discuss Dr. Knight-Jones&#8217;s report at paragraphs 99 and 100 above (with its recommendations for assessments by a community paediatrician, a speech and language therapist, an audiologist and a geneticist).  Mrs. Monks says that as at 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012 &#8216;... none of these referrals had been made due to parental non-engagement.&#8217;  She noted that three letters of complaint had been received from them regarding the health visiting service.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The parents&#8217; explanation for not agreeing with those recommended referrals was that Mrs. Monks had agreed to defer consideration of them.  It is right to say that on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2011 Mrs. Monks did record, &#8216;I negotiated with the parents that I would review D&#8217;s development and assessment within three months,&#8217; i.e. expiring in about December 2011.  At that time, (September 2011) her opinion was that D presented &#8216;... with very significant expressive language delay, appearing a very passive, expressionless child and no spontaneous play seen.&#8217;  She recorded the father stating that social workers no longer needed to be involved with the family and his talking about the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>

She showed them a book detailing the normal parameters of child development from one to five.  She recorded the father telling her that he was aware of a school in Local Authority B&#8217;s area being closed down due to him; that he was in the process of getting C&#8217;s placement, Unit H, closed down; and that he had requested the removal of a local head teacher.</p>

Arrangements were made in the event for D to see a paediatrician, Dr. Gondwe, who saw her on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012 for a medical assessment at the request of Miss Chafer.  She was by now aged three years one month and still living at home with the mother and father.  Dr Gondwe recorded hearing mainly single words with a few two-word phrases.  She was physically well.  He concluded that she had delay in her speech and language development, for which referrals would be required for speech and language therapy and for audiology.  A heart murmur was also noted, for which the parents did agree to an assessment in cardiology and it turned out to be benign.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>By February 2012, Mrs Monks says she had seen D three times and that each time she had been concerned about her development, particularly speech and language, play and social skills.  On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2012 She (Mrs Monks) attended for three hours at the E Nursery to observe D in many situations.  She recorded noticing no spontaneous interaction or communication from D, with D not demonstrating any exploration of her environment, nor interacting with any other children.  D&#8217;s play was repetitive, allowing adults to provide a verbal commentary.  According to Mrs Monks, she showed no awareness of the nursery&#8217;s routines, being unable to wash her hands without support.  At outdoor times, she did not make choices as to which toys or equipment to play with: she appeared to withdraw into herself and just stood in the middle of the playground.  When given one to one attention by nursery staff she would copy, but always needed adult prompting to bring her out of her &#8216;own little world.&#8217;  Mrs. Monks recommended one to one full-time support to encourage D&#8217;s self-help skills, language and social skills in preparation for full-time education.  When Mrs. Monks shared with the parents her report of these observations of D, the father said that it was the &#8216;biggest load of rubbish&#8217; he had ever read.</p>

The parents reported to the therapists that they had no concerns regarding D&#8217;s play skills, understanding of language, expressive language or speech sounds.  In brief, the therapists reported that they found D to have &#8216;a delayed and disordered pattern of language development.&#8217;  </p>

He stated that the doctor had said there were no grounds for a geneticist assessment and had agreed with &#8216;... the family plan to return C home and to the [named] School.&#8217;  The father also wrote that Dr. Chisabingo had said that bereavement counselling over the loss of C was not appropriate.  This letter must have gone to Kerry Chafer.  She referred back to Dr. Chisabingo, who sent her an undated letter in which he denied telling the father that a geneticist assessment was not needed; rather that he had told the father he would need more detail from the health visitor as to why she was suggesting it.  He said he had told the father he had no idea as to the effectiveness of grieving therapy and that: &#8216;... I did not agree with family plans to return C home (I had no idea of any plans!) to [named] School, as I was not aware at the time that the child was even at this school.&#8217;  He described the father as having misrepresented their consultation and it looks as though he probably did.</p>

When Mrs. Hunter and Miss Gains were trying to deal with these issues with him, he became irate and said he would be taking his complaints to Ofsted.  He kept saying, &#8216;What are you going to do about this?&#8217; and would not listen to Miss Gains, keeping talking over her.  He said he was not going to leave and wanted something done about his complaints or he would go to the press.  In due course he calmed down and left.</p>

They spoke of normal interaction with other children.

He concluded that D &#8216;...&#160;clearly has significant speech delay,&#8217; and that she appeared to have &#8216;delay in her social skills.&#8217;  He said that over a period of a few weeks she needed (i) a comprehensive assessment of her development strength and weaknesses carried out by a multidisciplinary team led by a developmental paediatrician and (ii) therapy from a speech and language therapist, which would need to go on for many months and possibly years.  He felt that with active cooperation D might well function within the mainstream, but that &#8216;... barriers external to D are represented by the inability or unwillingness of carers actively to cooperate with advice.&#8217;  For D to flourish he advised that she must be cared for by carers who &#8216;... clearly will consistently cooperate with all advice given by therapists and other professionals regarding mechanisms to nurture her development.&#8217;</p>

She reported having told a professionals&#8217; meeting on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012 that D was then working at the level of twenty months in all areas of development.  At that time D had been thirty-six months of chronological age, so a delay of some sixteen months.  Mrs. Hunter had then begun to work as an extra staff member in D&#8217;s room, specifically so as to support D&#8217;s development one to one.  In that way progress was made.  Mrs. Hunter says the speech and language therapist gave her a package with which to support D.  Following the interim care order on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012 when Local Authority A could organise SEN funding (consistently rejected by the parents) resources came through for a further six hours per week one to one help.  Throughout the summer of 2012 D continued to make progress in her development such that by September 2012 she was working at the level of twenty-two to thirty-six months on the nursery&#8217;s monitoring sheets.  In evidence Carol Hunter told me it would be fair to say at about thirty-four months.  This was at a time, September 2012, when D was about forty-five months of chronological age, thus now only about eleven months behind.  So she was showing catch-up.</p>

She had observed D at the E Nursery on four occasions for about an hour accompanied on one occasion by Jenny Kernan, the speech and language therapist.  She noted that D appeared to have limited curiosity and limited motivation to explore, requiring an adult prompt to experiment or try new activities.  She concluded that D had an erratic attainment profile due to gaps/disorders in language and social development.  She considered D to present as a child with subtle but significant processing difficulties heightened when anxious and distressed.  She thought that D had learned formulaic verbal responses.  She regarded her as &#8216;highly dependent on adults&#8217; and considered her social presentation to be a cause for concern, because she (D) seemed to have learned mostly from adult modelling rather than from childlike interaction with peers.  She (Miss Brankin) noted that D had made at least sixteen months of progress during the previous twelve to fourteen-month period.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012, the day before the hearing before Judge R, geneticist Dr. Dobbie made a genetic report on D.  This had been strongly opposed by the grandparents and parents, none of whom could see any need for it, as they saw D&#8217;s development as normal.  Therefore, it had been necessary, as I understand it, to get a court order for a genetic report, although I cannot find it in the bundle of orders.  Prior to the appointment Dr. Dobbie had received a letter from the father that he did not wish the consultation to go ahead and at the beginning of the appointment both the father and mother said the same.  However, when Dr. Dobbie had explained what the review would consist of, and that it would be valuable to know if D did have a genetic condition, the mother and father and grandparents cooperated fully.  The father told Dr. Dobbie that he himself was well and had no problems that would have affected D.  That was his perception.  Both parents told him that C was well and that they were happy with her development.  Dr. Dobbie found D able to speak sentences, as he would have expected at her age and to be able to name colours.  He considered that she was mildly delayed in at least one developmental axis.  He saw some indications that might suggest a genetic causation, but also that some areas of her development had been improving, which is not, he says, a feature of genetic disorders or syndromes.  His conclusion was that D does not have a genetic syndrome.  It was at this point in the sequence that Judge R gave his decision on 13th December 2012 and D was removed into care.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>A year later, on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013, Suzie Maleham, speech and language therapist, saw D in school for a review of her speech, language and communication skills.  D had thus been in care now for one year.  Her foster carer was present.  D appeared &#8216;... happy, relaxed and confident throughout the session and making continued progress in all areas of her speech and language.&#8217;  D&#8217;s foster carer reported that D was enjoying her time at school and the schoolteacher reported that she had settled in well.  D&#8217;s use of language appeared to Miss Maleham well structured and appropriate for her age and stage of development.  The following strategies were suggested by Miss Maleham, namely: to address D at eye level, so that she could see mouth, lip and tongue positions to help her with her speech production; to use short, clear sentences; to reduce language and to &#8216;chunk&#8217; larger pieces of information into sections; and to check that D had understood things.  D was then discharged from the speech and language service with an open twelve months&#8217; referral.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014, Dr. Yvonne Melia, clinical psychologist, reported on D.  This was brought about by an original referral from CAMHS in February 2014 on the basis of some concerning behaviours, including D&#8217;s flapping her hands, repeating phrases and being unsettled in unfamiliar situations.  The foster carers and the school had expressed concerns about D&#8217;s refusal to eat; her difficulties with large class sizes; her struggling on occasions with even simple instructions and her not liking busy or noisy environments.  The foster carer was asking for help as to how to respond to these behaviours without making D feel uncomfortable.  Dr. Melia reviewed all the files on D, undertook three assessments with her and interviewed her at school.  In her report she summarises the whole of the background, which I need not repeat.  D&#8217;s carer reported to Dr. Melia various behavioural oddities, including screaming if there was too much going on around her, or too much noise.  The foster carer reported to Dr Melia that she found D to be tentative in play and perceived that she, D, would do things repetitively and quite obsessively.  She, the carer, told Dr. Melia that D was saying such things as, &#8216;Did I come out of your tummy?&#8217;; &#8216;Am I your Mummy?&#8217;; &#8216;When I get a new family ...&#8217;; and, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t I live with my Mummy and Daddy?&#8217;  The schoolteacher reported to Dr. Melia that D functions well on a one to one basis and will work well when she has an adult with her.  She had been noted at school to be about two years behind her peers in terms of emotional feelings and behaviour and about a year behind in terms of making relationships.  The teacher said to Dr. Melia that D manages &#8216;...&#160;quite well in the school context once routines are established.&#8217;  She reported that her main concerns about D were in respect of her not understanding simple instructions, seeming forgetful, having obsessions and not being able to soothe herself after becoming upset or frustrated over seemingly minor triggers.  During the assessment, with the use of &#8216;feeling cards&#8217;, D showed missing her old family, mentioning her father and her grandparents.  She then added her mother.  She referred to them by first names and noted sometimes feeling cross with [the foster carers], because she was not with her old family.  Dr. Melia recorded the results of her WPPSI-III testing of D&#8217;s IQ as follows: verbal IQ low average; performance IQ extremely low; full scale IQ (67) extremely low.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In Dr. Melia&#8217;s &#8216;Conclusions and Recommendations&#8217;, she stated, &#8216;... the assessment identified that D has clear learning difficulties.&#8217;  She said that historically and in her current behaviour D shows features that are clearly consistent with an autistic spectrum disorder, there being longstanding concerns in terms of her social skill, development, play and social language, poor eye contact and behaviours such as echolalia [the automatic repetition of things said by another person] and flapping.  Dr. Melia&#8217;s observations of D clearly indicated D as being rigid and concrete in her thinking, and as being one who tries to make sense of the world in black and white terms.  Dr. Melia&#8217;s opinion is that D has a poor understanding of social context and how to behave in particular settings.  Although she is still very little, her communication shows poor understanding of how she needs to adjust what she is saying so that another person can understand her perspective.  She struggles to understand the intentions, beliefs or feelings of others and to use their &#8216;cues&#8217; to inform her own social behaviour.  She has some clearly preoccupied interests and anxieties at times with very poor emotional and self-regulation.  Dr. Melia goes on, &#8216;... I would suggest the most important need right now is for D to receive a package of support to meet her general learning, emotional and social needs.&#8217;  She recommends that a formal diagnosis of D be made only when D has achieved some stability, because it is as yet &#8216;&#8230;unclear what contribution her parents&#8217; mental health difficulties, emotion regulation deficits and distorted thinking and perceptions may have made to D&#8217;s presentation.&#8217;  Dr. Melia describes D (as at October 2014) as well accepted and supported both at home and school.  She recommends considering an application for a Statement of Educational Needs to help D engage more effectively in learning with one to one support.  She made various other recommendations which I need not set out.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>That is an overview of the expert evidence before me relating to D.  She has not seen the parents nor her grandparents since August 2013.  It seems that the intention of Local Authority A at that time was to set up a final contact for her with her family members pursuant to the care plan then approved by Judge R in December 2012 (although subject to the father&#8217;s still pending application to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal that decision).  Neither the parents nor the grandparents were responsive to the efforts of Local Authority A to arrange final contact sessions, nor again did the parents attend an appointment offered them on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 to assess the management of their proposed indirect contact with D.  D&#8217;s life has now been on hold, as I have said, for two years and three months and she clearly needs to know her long term plans.  Rachel Payne reported in October 2014 just after the father&#8217;s appeal over D was allowed, that D had asked her foster parents when she would be getting a new Mummy and Daddy and whether she would be staying with them (the foster parents) until she became an adult.</p>

The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  I need to be cautious about information deriving from persons I have not seen or heard.  In respect specifically of the application for a discharge of the care order regarding C it is for the parents to show that such discharge would be in her best interests, her welfare being paramount in taking that decision.  It is very rare to go back to revisit the circumstances in which a child was taken into care and, for good reasons, I have not been asked to do so.  I would not have done so because, to state the obvious, we are where we are regarding C, whether one likes it or not.

Harm is defined to include the impairment of health or development.  Development means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development; and health means physical or mental health.</p>

There is no dissent to or disagreement about that and (although in fact protective measures have been in place almost all D&#8217;s life) the precise date selected is of no consequence, because the case is based on alleged future likelihood of harm, not past actual harm.

I also accept that C was much loved when she was living at home, although I cannot comment meaningfully on the quality of her care, because in the nature of things it has not been examined at this hearing.  D was physically well and attended all her immunisations and health visiting appointments.  She attended the nursery properly and the parents would phone in to say if she was ill.  I repeat that the numerous photographs which the mother has asked me to look at and the eighteen DVDs (which includes the two about the European Parliament) put in by the father show both girls interacting happily within their family.  I accept that the father and the mother are non-drinkers and non-smokers.  There are no criminal convictions in the family.  The grandparents too are decent people who love their grandchildren, who brought up their own children, who worked hard until retirement and who would never have expected to become involved with Social Services; nor for that matter to be contemplating the care of two children when in their seventies.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">Unhappily, however, I am satisfied on the expert evidence and on everything I have seen, heard and read, that the father has been and is now mentally unwell.  He does not recognise this, nor does the mother, nor do the grandparents.  There is, however, abundant and solid evidence for that conclusion.  Specifically I refer to the opinions of Dr. Mumford, Dr. Pilgrim, Dr. McGeown and Professor Mortimer.  I also refer to the contents of Supplemental Bundles 1, 2 and 3.  Initially the contents of those three lever-arch files seem sometimes completely incomprehensible.  This is partly because of the father&#8217;s idiosyncratic writing style and partly, as I have said, because many of the attachments are missing.  However, I have come to realise as the case has gone on, particularly on hearing the father, that there is underlying his tortured logic a just about intelligible reason for why he fires off most of the complaints and demands which he does.  Most emails, with some exceptions, can be seen to relate essentially to his sense of grievance about the loss of the children and his obsessive but unsupported beliefs that this is based on multiple conspiracies, malpractices, lies and hidden agendas.  Unfortunately, these paranoid and distorted beliefs have led him to overreact beyond the bounds of reason with cross-references in his mind to other people, organisations and events having in reality nothing to do with his children.  They, the children, become joined into his whistleblowing-type campaigns, because his mental ill-health distorts his ability to see things in proportion and to distinguish as regards the children the relevant from the irrelevant.  Through his distorted thinking, much of his time must have been taken up with researching supposed culpabilities and pursuing them, often in a grandiose manner, without apparent empathy for those on the receiving end, nor for the inconvenience which he may have been causing to third parties.  These suspicions and beliefs have unhappily been fuelled by the coincidence of Local Authority B having been placed by the government into a form of trust and by [certain] scandals emerging locally in places like [named], as extensively reported in the media.</p>

I have noted more than fifty individuals and organisations (ignoring just copying in) to whom the father has sent correspondence, including by way of example [named] University, [named] University, [named] University, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the International Criminal Court at the Hague, the police, the DPP, the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, the RSPCA, News Corporation, Zurich Insurance, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, Tesco, the British Humanist Association, and so on.

The reality is that they help to justify and support the conclusions of Professor Mortimer.  Her Honour Judge P QC made the same point (at paragraph 72 above) in April 2009.  Professor Mortimer told me in evidence that although she had not read all the father&#8217;s documents in the three bundles, she had read enough to recognise them as being &#8216;... typical of the sort of material produced by persons with this type of mental disorder.&#8217;  When it was put to her by Mr. Godfrey on instructions that she had given &#8216;totally false and biassed weight&#8217; to the cases of the local authorities and had ignored the father&#8217;s case, she disagreed, saying that she had not ignored the father&#8217;s material, but on the contrary had &#8216;... used it in arriving at her professional diagnosis and conclusions.&#8217;</p>

This has been painfully but abundantly obvious (i) from everything which each of them has said to the social workers, (ii) from the questions which they have caused to be put in cross-examination (or in the grandparents&#8217; case have put themselves) to the local authorities&#8217; witnesses and (iii) from their evidence in the witness box.

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">The father&#8217;s refusal to cooperate in an up-to-date psychiatric examination, as strongly advised by McFarlane LJ in October 2014 and repeated by myself in January 2015, and his refusal to speak to the Children&#8217;s Guardian, have greatly diminished his prospects within these proceedings.  I doubt that this is a product of stubbornness, for I can see that he can be a pleasant and cooperative person.  I suspect it is more a product of his mental ill-health and his complete inability to see that there would be a benefit to him (and thus to all the family, including the children) from an up-to-date psychiatric diagnosis, coupled with whatever medication or other help a consultant psychiatrist might offer.  The mother too has diminished her prospects by refusing to have an up-to-date psychological assessment, or to meet with the children&#8217;s guardian.  An up-to-date psychological assessment of her would have been invaluable as to whether she has fully and truly embraced the father&#8217;s beliefs, or whether she is simply unable to confront and challenge him.  These refusals by both parents demonstrate a lack of insight into what materials a court needs to determine a difficult case like this in the best interests of the children.</p>

I further accept the Professor&#8217;s view, as to which she is in agreement with the previous psychiatric and psychological experts, that the father will stay as he is without treatment.  She gives the opinion that there is &#8216;... no hope at all of any spontaneous resolution&#8217;.  I accept that opinion.  She advises that the natural course of untreated schizophrenia is a gradual, slow cognitive decline, with the defects tending to be in reasoning, judgment, memory and concentration.  This is a sad prognosis, but that is what it is.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">I am satisfied from everything I have seen and heard that those social workers, health visitor, nursery school workers, care home staff and contact supervisors who have made statements and/or whom I have heard in evidence have carried out their duties and functions with due professionalism, without dishonesty or fabrication and in pursuit of what they have considered would best serve the welfare of the respective children.  The proposition only has to be stated that all these professionals have been drawn into a conspiracy involving dishonesty and perjury by a wish to get back at the parents for some complaint the parents made about C&#8217;s school in 2005, to realise how fantastic it actually is.  Yet the family members have become blind to this and in the case of the mother and grandparents have become disabled from critically examining or challenging it.  As Miss Stanistreet put in cross-examination, the father&#8217;s case involves professionals in every discipline involving three counties over ten years having actively lied and made things up in order to get the children into care: yet that is the case relied on by the family members.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">I find that whilst, as seen on the DVDs, the father can be pleasant and charming, there is also a blustering and domineering side to him, when he can be insistent on getting his own way over things which he sees as important.  On occasions I find that he has behaved in intimidating ways, as appears in places throughout the evidence, including with professionals such as social workers and at the nursery.  This makes it extremely difficult to reason with him or to discuss things usefully with him: reference for example Rachel Payne&#8217;s efforts to discuss with him Dr. Melia&#8217;s psychological report, in respect of which she effectively had to give up.  Further, the mother and the father have had a habit of simply not turning up on occasions for meetings about the children.</p>

They did not think they were necessary.  They refused to go along with social work and nursery advice about SEN funding for extra one to one help, on the illogical basis that this would &#8216;label&#8217; D, when the whole idea of such extra help was that she would then keep up with her peers when moving on to her first school.  It took the interim care order in mid-2012 before the extra funding could be obtained.  When Mrs. Monks explained her observation of D&#8217;s delay at the nursery to the father, he called them &#8216;rubbish&#8217;.  He said in cross-examination that the one to one help eventually obtained for D by the professionals had not helped her at all.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">I find that the situation when the mother and D lived with the grandparents was an increasingly difficult one and I accept that the grandparents admitted as much to Miss Chafer.  It is quite understandable why this should have been so.  I find, however, like Mrs. Recorder Q, that the tensions have (as happens) been minimised in the minds of the mother and the grandparents.  It was not a situation which would indefinitely have continued to provide D with a calm and stress-free environment.  I accept that the grandparents told Kerry Chafer that the father was overstaying his contact at times (not just being allowed to make up lost time when public transport made him late) and that they found it difficult to challenge him.  It is clear that they were told by Social Services after the mother&#8217;s 999 call on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2012 not to leave the mother alone with D, but that they did so (ie did leave the mother alone with D) in the firm belief that this was justified, as there was no way the mother would harm D.  This must raise serious concerns if D were to be in the grandparents&#8217; care about their ability to protect D against the emotional pressure likely (as I find) to be imposed on them by the mother and father&#8217;s strong views about getting the children back to their home.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">It is a fact, and I so find, that all the family members have an antipathy to the Social Services with whom (along with other agencies) there would absolutely have to be cooperation if D lived within the family.  Even putting the family&#8217;s case at its very highest, no outcome could reasonably be countenanced without at the very least a supervision order.  The father stated in his most up-to-date statement (23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2015): &#8216;... I do not like the local authorities and do not want their involvement in my family.&#8217;  The mother told me that she sees the children and the family members as &#8216;victims&#8217; and that &#8216;... I want nothing to do with the Social Services any more.  I want no involvement with them, because I hate them.&#8217;  The grandfather spoke in his evidence of anyone having dealings with the Social Services as being &#8216;in for a life of hell.&#8217;</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in">I find it to be extremely likely, indeed virtually unavoidable, that any child living with the father and mother would be exposed to their distorted views and beliefs across a wide range of areas.  It would involve such a child being brought up in an ethos where those in positions of a sort of authority (schools, social workers, health visitors and so on) are seen as conspiring, lying and acting with motives of personal gain or promotion.  There would be surrounding such a child a sense of the morality of &#8216;whistleblowing&#8217; in respect of persons with whom one has no particular relationship or connection and of the appropriateness of setting oneself up as a sort of guardian of public probity.  There would be an absence of inhibition in expressing hurtful views about others, for example that another person is an &#8216;obese dwarf&#8217;.  (Both children incidentally have issues with eating).  This lack of normal inhibition and of empathy for others would be harmful to an impressionable child, all the more so given Professor Mortimer&#8217;s prognosis that the likely prognosis of the father&#8217;s mental health is downhill.</p>

As to her ascertainable wishes and feelings, I frankly do not think that at the present time these are actually ascertainable.  In 2014 she veered between enjoying her parents&#8217; company and lashing out at them (as I find) both physically and by the things she said.  The preponderance of her utterances since the distressing contact occasion on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 have been negative about even seeing them, let alone moving to live with them.  On the other hand, she might prefer home to the thought of continuing in a residential unit.  I just do not think we can discern at the present time what outcome she would most like to see in her life.  As to C&#8217;s physical, emotional and educational needs, she has expressed satisfaction with the school, which must have been selected with special attention to her particular needs.  Her emotional needs need to be met by patient, consistent and very firm but fair boundaries and routines skilfully enforced (extremely difficult although this is now going to be).  As to the likely effect of any change in her circumstances, one can only say that she has moved about so much in the past that a period of time in the kind of very small unit specifically advised by Dr. Eke would appear to be the best plan, in circumstances which no-one would have chosen in the first place.  A change in her circumstances to living with her parents or grandparents, with all the difficulties already discussed, would be highly likely to create further anxieties for her.  There would be all sorts of conflicting and quite probably overwhelming emotions.  If as seems probable it broke down, then she would be faced with yet another &#8216;failure&#8217; in her short life, with consequential trauma and a yet further period of re-adjustment to some other form of state-organised care.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As to C&#8217;s age, sex, background and any special characteristics of her&#8217;s, these are apparent from what has gone before and by reading the F Unit&#8217;s records.  She has the characteristics of being extremely troubled, confused and unhappy arising from all aspects of her upbringing, with the consequence that she shows hugely challenging and disruptive behaviours on an almost daily basis.  As to any harm which C has suffered or is at the risk of suffering, it is abundantly clear from her present sad circumstances that she has suffered great harm from her life&#8217;s experiences.  Understandably, the family put this down to her time in care, believing her to have been perfectly alright until she went into care.  This is not however borne out by an open-minded and objective review of all the records relating to the entirety of her life; nor by the previous findings of the court in the person of Her Honour Judge P QC.  The finding in 2007 was that C had suffered and was likely to suffer significant harm with her parents; and, in 2009, Her Honour Judge P attributed the responsibility for C&#8217;s difficulties at that time largely if not entirely, to them.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As for the capability of the parents and grandparents of meeting C&#8217;s needs, I have effectively covered this consideration above.  As Local Authority A have said, with the endorsement of the Children&#8217;s Guardian who independently represents the children, the family cannot meet C&#8217;s needs, because they cannot see further than the belief that all her problems have been caused by her treatment in care and that all would be well if she were back within the family.  It is easy to conclude that care has not served C well, in that she is now the unhappy and distressed teenager she clearly is.  That is not, however, to say that those caring for C have not done their best for her and in what they have seen as being her best interests.  Nor is it to say that she would have been any better if left within the family, faced with the deficiencies of parental care identified by Her Honour Judge P QC.  It is not to say that a discharge of the care order would be in her interests and I am not persuaded that it would be. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As to contact to C, Local Authority B have evolved a contact plan whereby following this hearing they will offer to work with the grandparents in helping them to gain an understanding of this judgment and of the father&#8217;s communications in Supplemental Bundles 1, 2 and 3.  If some insight is gained into C&#8217;s needs at contact, and if the grandparents show themselves able to accept advice as to how to deal with the sort of things she might say and do, then contact to the grandparents would be re-introduced to see how it went.  For the time being Local Authority B do not propose to include the parents in this, on the basis that it would or could be overwhelming for C whilst re-introduction of contact with the grandparents was being attempted.  If such a re-introduction to the grandparents succeeded, and if the parents could show some insight into C&#8217;s needs following this judgment and could show themselves able to accept advice as to how to deal with the things she might say and do, then there could be a possibility of a further attempt to re-introduce contact between C and the parents in due course.  That is not, however, intended to be in any way imminent; nor is grandparental contact, if it restarts, necessarily to act as a conduit to parental contact.  These plans about contact to C seem to the Children&#8217;s Guardian and to me to be reasonable and proportionate and in C&#8217;s best interests.  I therefore approve them.  They will require a continued <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34(4)</ref> direction permitting Local Authority B to continue to refuse the parents contact, but against the backdrop of the plan just mentioned.  I will make such a direction and I ask that there be a preamble referring to the plan.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The first question is whether the threshold for state intervention in the life of D and of the family is met.  In this context I need to bear particularly in mind the President&#8217;s second fundamental point in the <span style="font-style:italic">Darlington</span> case above.  He stressed at paragraph 12 the need to demonstrate why &#8216;... facts A plus B plus C justify the conclusion that the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering significant harm of types X, Y or Z.&#8217;  He continues that:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">&#8216;... sometimes the linkage will be very obvious as where the fact proved is physical harm, but the linkage may be very much less obvious when the allegation is only that the child is at <span style="font-style:italic">risk of suffering emotional harm</span> or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect.&#8217;  [Emphasis added].</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Here there is no doubt in my mind that the necessary &#8216;linkage&#8217; is established, in particular by the specific findings which I have set out in Part I above.  As I have explained, D would be exposed to all the outward signs of the father&#8217;s mental ill-health, which he and the other family members do not recognise.  It is likely to get worse with time, per Professor Mortimer.  In the care of her parents D would be likely to be brought up within a world of suspicion, criticism and disinhibition from making remarks which most people would find offensive; a world of disproportionate overreaction to perceived slights and petty mistakes; a world where people doing their best are seen as targeting, conspiring and fabricating; where newspaper cuttings are sent around, having sometimes little, if any, connection to the point in hand; where the police are sent in to arrest people; where it is accepted that one can write to cause someone&#8217;s grant to be cut off; where retailers are told to desist selling some product, social workers to lose weight and pregnant women not to work; where librarians are told to remove posters and signs which others would find inoffensive or would simply ignore.  An upbringing in this sort of atmosphere coupled, as has happened (which I find) with remarks in front of her about the unjustified loss of C from the family, would be likely to cause D to embrace such belief systems, or to find her own thinking influenced by them.  This would be to the detriment of her growing up amongst her peers and in society generally as a reasonably well-balanced individual.  Unhappily, there would be no protective element in the situation from the mother or currently from the grandparents, being totally imbued with the father&#8217;s beliefs.  The fact of the mother&#8217;s hesitancy in caring for D and in picking up on her &#8216;cues&#8217; as to her wishes and needs is concerning, but pales into relative insignificance by comparison with the risk to D from the father&#8217;s untreated and unacknowledged mental ill-health.  In the result, I find the threshold regarding D to be met on the basis of a likelihood of significant emotional harm.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Therefore, I have to evaluate D&#8217;s future on the basis that the paramount consideration is her welfare throughout her life.  It is necessary since the care plan is one of adoption that the checklist in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the checklist in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> are both considered.  In short I adopt the welfare checklist analysis set out by the Children&#8217;s Guardian in her report for a placement order dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015 at internal page 7, page 728 of the main bundle.  As to D&#8217;s wishes and feelings I agree with the Children&#8217;s Guardian that D is not of a sufficient age to express an informed view regarding such a difficult question.  Clearly, she would wish to be within a safe, loving, secure environment where her needs were consistently met.  She is clearly already aware (see above) that this may be with a new &#8216;forever&#8217; family, not her own family, whom she has not (for whatever reason) seen for nineteen months.  As to D&#8217;s particular needs, she has all the needs of any child as just mentioned, but also the additional needs identified by Dr. Melia, whose evidence I accept, as arising from her learning difficulties.  She needs consistent care from carers who can acknowledge those needs and meet them with support willingly received from relevant agencies.  D needs permanence and a sense of belonging.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As to the likely effect on D of having ceased to be a member of her birth family and becoming adopted, all the usual considerations apply to D as apply to any child.  She would have the detriment of losing her birth family, and of losing her immediate and direct contact with her roots through the society of her parents, her grandparents and other relatives, including C.  She might as she becomes more mature come to regret and resent this loss.  She has a right to respect to her right for a life within her birth family, unless overriding considerations relating to her welfare make this impossible because it would be seriously detrimental to her.  On the other hand, by way of adoption D would be brought up by a new family which would have been matched with her specifically in mind and having regard to her particular needs; a family who would have made an investment in looking after her for her childhood and beyond.  If as I have found, D would be likely to suffer significant emotional harm within her natural family and this is unlikely to change and would significantly impede her healthy emotional and social development, then an upbringing elsewhere is effectively what it has to be.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As between adoption and long-term fostering I agree with the tabulation of the advantages and disadvantages of each as laid out by the Children&#8217;s Guardian at page 729 of the main bundle.  As in every case, adoption would provide permanency, security, stability, consistency and a sense of belonging; but it would sever her relationship with her natural family, having an irreversible impact on her sense of heritage and identity.  Long-term fostering conversely would not sever the natural family relationship and would not therefore impact on her sense of identity and roots, at least not in theory.  The mystery of adoption and the risk of subsequent regret and resentment of it would not arise.  On the other hand, the status of long-term fostering would confer no sense of permanence and would leave D at risk of being the subject of future legal proceedings.  Foster placements can be more easily terminated, whether by the foster carers themselves, by the local authority, by the natural parents or even by the child.  If continued involvement with the parents were attempted, as it might be, there would be the real risk of the foster placement being undermined, as has been seen with C (through the things said to her about coming home).  Further, in long-term foster care, D would remain the subject of the involvement of Children Services, with ongoing meetings, reviews and appraisals.  She would have an allocated social worker or consecutive workers and would be subject to regulations.  As to D&#8217;s age, sex, background and characteristics, I consider these have been sufficiently covered, as indeed has the harm which D is at risk of suffering.  As to the relationship which D has with her relatives and the other considerations in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>(f) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, clearly D&#8217;s close relatives are more than willing to provide for her.  Their wishes are for her to be returned home and with no further social work involvement.  However, if this cannot happen for all the reasons set out above, then (although taken into account) the wishes and feelings of D&#8217;s relatives cannot weigh decisively in the evaluation exercise.  The family would still have much to offer her (if they are willing) by consistent compliance with the plans for indirect contact.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian is satisfied, and I agree, that all possible placements within the extended family have been investigated by Local Authority A; but without success.  The remaining sections of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> have already been sufficiently covered, save perhaps for (g) (the range of powers available to the court) which I have well in mind.</p>

This is not a matter of blame or culpability.  In reaching that conclusion I have set against an upbringing within the family all the disadvantages of adoption or long-term fostering.</p>

Conversely, I consider that the disadvantages of long-term fostering for her outweigh its advantages.  In the result I accept the opinion of Local Authority A supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian on behalf of D herself that the outcome which would be most likely to serve her best interests throughout her life is that of adoption.</p>

For all the reasons already discussed, D&#8217;s most potent need at this time in her life is for permanency.  It is not in her interests to be, as C has been (and one sees many repetitions as between C&#8217;s life and D&#8217;s life) in a situation of long-term fostering, with the disadvantage of the continuing legal ties to a natural family dissatisfied with the arrangements, unable to see why she should not be living at home and determined to have her home if possible.  I do conclude therefore that it is necessary in D&#8217;s interests to dispense with the consent of the mother and the father to a placement order, subject to one point referred to in a moment.  Such an order will therefore be made for a second time.  I am only sorry that the family have had to go through such a stressful and sad process twice.  Before actually making a placement order I do have to invite any party to comment on the proposed contact arrangements which Local Authority A have in mind, which is annual letterbox contact.

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As I have said, I have listened to this case with the greatest of sympathy, but the reasons in the Judgment still pertain and I will not repeat them.  If I could have made an order which would have kept the children in your family, Mr. [grandfather], I would have done so, believe me.  I have to consider the question of contact before making a placement order in accordance with the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>.  I conclude, having done so, that actual face to face contact to D at this stage would be contrary to her best interests.  She would not know if she were coming or going frankly, having not seen the family since August 2013 and being told that she is on the point of being placed for adoption.  Any meeting or meetings would be highly emotional for the natural family and I am not at all sure that they would be able to contain their emotions or keep them from D.  I would be very concerned that they would feel they were just giving D hope by saying things that would confuse her and make the transition which she now has to make greatly more difficult.  I can see no realistic way that any contact directly could be in D&#8217;s interests, painful though this is for the family members.  Mr. [grandfather] and Mrs. [grandmother] have just addressed me movingly on this point, but there has to be a placement order and there has to be no order for direct contact; but rather approval of the care plan, which is for annual letterbox contact between D and the parents and grandparents.</p>
