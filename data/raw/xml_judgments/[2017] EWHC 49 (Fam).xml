A separate judgment will deal with Case K. That amounts to 24 cases in all. A further five cases have recently been issued. I am told that at least another two cases are in the pipeline and likely to be issued in the near future.</p>

Each of the clinics is and was regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. I shall refer to the applicant in each case as X, the respondent as Y and the child or children as C.

In each case Y is wholeheartedly supportive of X&#8217;s application. In each case the clinic, the HFEA, the Secretary of State for Health and the Attorney General have all been notified of the proceedings. With the exception of Care Fertility Group Manchester, which was represented, although not joined, and the HFEA, which attended court though not the hearing, in Cases P, Q, R, S, T and U, none has sought either to be joined or to attend the hearing. In each case, given the nature of the issues (see below) I decided that there was no need for C to have a guardian appointed. </p>

In my judgment this omission does not invalidate the relevant consent, which is plainly recorded and signed on the second page. Where, as in this case, Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Form PP have been properly completed (for a description of these see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 28) and the second page, which contains section 3, has been signed at the foot, that is sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements. The completion of section 5 on the third page is not a pre-requisite to the validity of the Form PP for the purpose with which, alone, I am here concerned.

The Form WP was properly completed. The Form PP was signed and correctly dated at the foot of the second page but the declaration on the third page, although signed, was incorrectly dated. There are two reasons why, in my judgment, this error is immaterial.

Secondly, and as set out in paragraph 13 above, the completion of section 5 on the third page is not a pre-requisite to the validity for present purposes of the Form PP. In these circumstances X is entitled to the declaration she seeks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, both Y and X signed a Form IC which, in all material respects, was in the same form as the Forms IC I have considered in previous cases. I need not go into the details. In the circumstances, X is, in principle, entitled to the declaration she seeks on this ground also.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Case S</span>: Again, the problem in this case is very shortly stated. The Form PP was properly completed by X. The Form WP, to be completed by Y, was defective in two respects. First, the consent box in section 3 was not ticked. Secondly, and more fundamentally, although the first page was indeed a Form WP, the second and third pages were actually parts of a Form PP. (How this astonishing mistake came about has not been explained.) The names of X and Y were correctly set out in the Form WP, which was signed by Y, both at the foot of the second page and after the declaration on the third page. So, to put the matter shortly, the correct person, Y, signed the Form WP but parts of the text in sections 3 and 5 were wrong. In my judgment it is clear that there was a mistake, even if we are in the dark as to how that mistake came about; it is clear what both X and Y intended when Y signed the Form W; and it is clear how the Form WP needs to be rectified to accord with the parties&#8217; intentions. In these circumstances, rectification is both an available and the appropriate remedy: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 47, and, more particularly, <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Case G) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/729" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Case T</span>: Again, the problem in this case is very shortly stated. The Form PP was properly completed by X. There is no Form WP nor, it is accepted, any clear evidence that a Form WP was ever completed. There is a Form IC which, in all material respects, was in the same form as the Forms IC I have considered in previous cases. But X and Y each signed the wrong part of the Form IC: X signed the part that should have been signed by Y, and Y signed the part that should have been signed by X. Ms Fottrell submits that there are two alternative solutions to the problem. First, and relying upon <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 98, that the mistake is so obvious, as also the &#8216;correction&#8217; required to remedy it, that the problem can properly be overcome by a process of construction, without the need for rectification. Secondly, and relying upon <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Case G) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/729" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)</ref>, that the Form IC can and should be rectified. For much the same reasons as I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Case G</span>, paras 20-21, I prefer to proceed here by way of rectification. In my judgment it is clear that there was a mistake, even if we are in the dark as to how that mistake came about; it is clear what both X and Y intended when they signed the Form IC; and it is clear how the Form IC needs to be rectified to accord with the parties&#8217; intentions. In these circumstances, rectification is both an available and the appropriate remedy. X is entitled to a decree of rectification and the declaration she seeks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Case U</span>: Case U relates to a second child born to the same parents as in Case T, following a later cycle of treatment. The problem is shortly stated. The Form WP was properly completed. There was no Form PP. The question is whether the Form PP that X had completed prior to the treatment which led to the birth of their first child continued to operate as a valid PP in relation to the later cycle of treatment leading to the birth of their second child. Both Ms Fottrell and Ms Morgan submitted that it did. That was also the stance of the HFEA in the evidence it had helpfully filed. Ms Fottrell and Ms Morgan took me painstakingly through <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/44" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>, through my analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, paras 23-25, and through the Form PP itself. I need not follow them through the exercise in detail, grateful though I am to them for their submissions. At the end of the day, the key point is the language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/44/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(1)</ref>(a), referring to consent in relation to &#8220;any child resulting from treatment provided.&#8221; That language, unsurprisingly, is tracked in the relevant part of the Form PP (see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 28): &#8220;any child born from my partner&#8217;s treatment.&#8221; The point, in my judgment, is a short one. &#8220;Any&#8221; means any; and, so long as the consent has not been withdrawn (and that manifestly did not happen here), there is no temporal or other limitation to the quite general expressions referring to the &#8220;treatment.&#8221; So the Form PP completed before the first cycle of treatment continued to operate for the subsequent cycle of treatment, and notwithstanding the birth of the first child. In these circumstances, X is entitled to the declaration she seeks. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Fottrell very properly drew my attention to the fact that, shortly before the proceedings were issued, X and Y had moved to Scotland.
