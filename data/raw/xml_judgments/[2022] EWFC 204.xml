The father was given permission to notify the Court by 11 December that if he chose to remain in the UK and to be the children&#8217;s primary carer, that if that were to happen then the matter would be listed for directions and the children&#8217;s move to their mother&#8217;s care would be suspended.</p>

In that judgment, Her Honour Judge George found that both parents were equally capable of looking after the children. In weighing the pros and cons of the children moving to Country A with their father or moving to live with their mother in a city in the South of England, the Court recognised that the likely change in circumstances for the children would be significant, whatever the decision.</p>

This is because he did not genuinely support or encourage contact, and particularly in the context of knowing that A holds negative views, he has done nothing to try and alleviate those difficulties.</p>

It is not in Eve&#8217;s best interests, and she should not risk losing her relationship with her mother which has taken at least the last three years to rebuild to be on a positive footing where she now enjoys the time she spends with her mother.</p>

The reality is that neither of these parents trust the other. Their relationship is so poor that they both hold negative views of the other although I accept that the mother does not openly share her views with the children like the father does.</p>

That means I am less confident about what her intentions might be if she were permitted to take Eve to the Country in Asia, especially in circumstances where Eve does not want to go and the father maintains a huge objection to it, albeit on a tit for tat basis.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my view, the Guardian&#8217;s analysis is the safest and fairest course of action to take, which is to ground Eve from visiting any non Hague Convention countries until, and I find this is both proportionate and necessary, she is 16 years of age, save for school trips without a parent. I do not find there are exceptional circumstances on this particular application and on the facts of this case to permit me to ground her until she is 18, when both parents and the Children's Guardian accept that at this current time with A being 17 and D being 16, if they chose to go to Country A now, either to live or to visit, that that in fact would be their choice. So I am not prepared to treat Eve in this circumstance differently to her brothers.</p>

The father should also be permitted to travel to Europe for a holiday in the first half of the summer holidays, unless of course he wishes to go to Country A and leave all the children with the mother for this year, so all of the school holidays. That is a matter for him to decide and give the mother notice.</p>
