That application was determined by the Justices sitting in the Family Court in Nottingham on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of January 2022. Following a contested hearing, the Justices provided that L should live with M, and should have both direct and indirect contact with F in accordance with a schedule, which was structured around F&#8217;s work commitments. The arrangements quickly foundered, breaking down entirely in May 2022, following a referral to social services arising from allegations of physical abuse made by L. On May 2022, M filed an application to vary the final order to make provision for supervision of L&#8217;s contact with F.</p>

That application has been consolidated, and will be heard together, with the parties&#8217; respective applications. Following completion of the s.37 investigation, the Local Authority concluded that the threshold had not been met for care or supervision orders, but instead proposed a s.17 Child in Need Plan for L, in respect of which both parents are cooperating.

Pending the outcome of a Local Authority risk assessment, it was proposed by the Social Care supervisor, Ms Charlene Comrie, that further contact should, until further notice, be supervised by the local authority.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though it should be obvious, it is necessary to emphasise that the obligation of parents on separation is to ensure that, in a different context from that which was planned, their child has a family life in the fullest and most meaningful sense. The responsibility of the parents is to ensure that the child has the best possible relationship with each of them, recognising that is the child&#8217;s right. Intrinsic to that right is an understanding that the child who grows up happily moving between the lives of her two parents, who both remain committed to her welfare, has a much greater prospect of achieving stability and security which will in turn provide her with the best possible platform from which to achieve her potential. Ongoing conflict, particularly in the sphere of litigation, is not only inimical to these objectives, but also harmful to the child. It has often been said, but bears reiteration, that it is conflict, not separation that damages children.</p>

At approaching 11 years of age, she is poised, intelligent, and engages charmingly, when she chooses to do so. For nearly half of her short life, her parents&#8217; conflict in this litigation has swirled around her and has inhibited her potential and marred her happiness. Both parents, perhaps to differing degrees, bear the responsibility for that. It is important, to my mind, that both realise the weight of the renewed obligation upon them both to free L from the conflict she has lived with, and to make reparation for the harm that they have undoubtedly caused her, the evidence of which is clear in the case papers.</p>

Sometimes, a sea change can occur in parental relations, where parents recognise that everybody in a family conflict loses. Here, over the past few months, there has been what can properly be described as significant progress in L&#8217;s relationship with F. Though the past history might never have predicted it, L has begun to have overnight contact with F and the parties now contemplate L spending a few nights away on a half term holiday on the Northeastern coast. Most striking about this holiday plan is the extent to which it is dominated by L&#8217;s own interests and enthusiasms.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An Improving Child and Family Arrangements (ICFA) programme began. The ICFA worker found L to be a &#8220;worrying case&#8221;. It was her clear view that L was not afraid of F but was pretending to be so. A Section 37 Report was ordered from the Local Authority, which concluded that if contact arrangements continued to be hindered, this would be a case in which the court would be required seriously to consider a change of residence. Following the Section 37 Report and a Compliance Report, there was a sudden and positive improvement in the contact arrangements. This sadly dipped in March 2024 when L made allegations that F had physically harmed her. As the summary of the background history above shows, such allegations had been made before. Investigations on this occasion assessed L&#8217;s complaints as false. L became subject to a Child Protection Plan. The contact arrangements again, improved.</p>

L described her time with him as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;perfectly fine&#8221;</span>, though she said she would not want anything more or (notably) less than one night every two weeks. She told the Guardian that this was because she has a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">full life&#8221;</span>. It must be said that L&#8217;s charm is not without precocity. She went on to explain that she was going to Whitby <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;with Dad&#8221;.</span> M is of the view that the change in L towards F is because social care has, as she sees it, a better understanding of L&#8217;s needs. She also tells the Guardian that she considers the interactions between her and F are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;more amicable&#8221; </span>and at least insinuates that this helps L too.</p>

Moreover, he sees the rapid change in L&#8217;s attitude to him as evidence of M&#8217;s capricious and alienating behaviours. He regards the threat of protection procedures and change of residence as having had a significant impact. Dr Thorp, the court appointed psychologist has stated that it is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;highly possible that [L] feels an obligation to report negative things about her father, this is very unhealthy for her and will cause long term psychological damage&#8221;</span>. The Guardian has also stated that L has felt guilty for enjoying her time with F.</p>

More than that, it is plain she takes pleasure in his company, though she remains inhibited in the expression of that pleasure. In her meeting with me, she was also relaxed and comfortable when talking about F, whom she mentioned spontaneously, in exactly the way the professionals had identified. She moved deftly from talking about Taylor Swift (whose lyrics she told me she knew by heart, merely because she had heard them so frequently, insisting that should not indicate that she liked her music) to talking about F, with no discomfort or hesitation.</p>

The contemplated plan, in such a scenario, envisaged a bridgement foster placement. However, I have already signalled that given the recent professional observations discussed above, I would have taken a great deal of persuasion as to the appropriateness of that course and signalled that I would have been far more attracted to a direct transfer to F&#8217;s care. Whatever may be the motivation, M plainly now has powerful incentives to promote contact. Accordingly, it is impossible to say, with any degree of certainty, how a suspended &#8216;Lives With&#8217; Order might come into effect. It is this uncertainty that renders such an order inappropriate in this case. This said, I note that the history reveals a lack of judicial continuity. That invariably provides fertile ground for a recalcitrant litigant. For this reason alone, I have reserved this case to myself, should there be any future applications.</p>

However, I note that the orders made in March and May this year have been complied with, despite the absence of a Penal Notice. In those circumstances, it would, in my judgement, be wrong to introduce a more draconian measure. I prefer gently to encourage M at this stage. She is an intelligent woman who is under no misapprehension as to the seriousness of the situation and the view that I have taken of it. The Penal Order risks inflaming the situation, in which I consider it is better, at least for now, to endeavour to pour oil on troubled waters.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Ms Moran invites me to make a costs order against M. The applicable provisions are the Family Proceedings Rules (FPR) Part 28 and Practice Directions 28A. They grant complete discretion as to costs, see FPR Rule 28.1. The general rule that costs follow the event are disapplied, see FPR Rule 28.2. There are many reasons for this. Primarily, family proceedings are intended to be non-adversarial and investigative. It is not difficult to imagine F&#8217;s reaction to this proposition. Nonetheless, the behaviour of a particular litigant does not dislodge the central philosophy of the process. In investigative proceedings, there is almost by definition no successful party. This case is in many ways a paradigm illustration of this point. F&#8217;s application for a change of residence is not pursued, but he has succeeded in gaining a level of contact with his daughter, beyond that which he has experienced for many years. Quite how that might redound in costs is not immediately obvious. Additionally, a costs order against the primary carer will inevitably reduce the funds available to meet the needs of the child. It is also, of course, predictable that a costs order would inflame tensions in a case which I have already indicated requires a sensitive and constructive approach. In this case, an order for costs would most likely cause M to feel punished in circumstances where she requires to be proactively encouraged. Moreover, the history of the case indicates that were she to feel punished, there is a real risk that this might impinge ultimately on the welfare of the child, see <span style="font-weight:bold">Re T (A Child) Order for Costs <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/36" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 36" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ [36</ref>] and [50]</span>.</p>
