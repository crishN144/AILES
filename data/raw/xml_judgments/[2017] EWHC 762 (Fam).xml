I have seen bank statements which show the majority of the Mother's earnings were transferred to the Father&#8217;s account, but it is perfectly possible that this was just for the costs of maintaining the home. </span></p>

She was initially threatened with being forced to leave the house. Three days later whilst out shopping she phoned the police. Her father-in-law was arrested and she and K were taken to a refuge for a week. After a week she says she phoned the Father and they decided to give the marriage another chance and she returned home.

I do not accept that submission as the Mother&#8217;s behaviour is very consistent with common patterns found in cases of domestic violence. It is not possible to know, on the evidence, why the police did not pursue charges.  However, as I have said I am not going to make any findings of fact in this regard. </span></p>

The Father was arrested and released the following day. She was visited on a number of occasions by a social worker from the local authority. According to the Mother, the Father agreed to move out of the home. At the hearing the Father gave evidence that he had told the social worker that he was intending to take the children on holiday to Madagascar and his wife was going to India to visit her family. This was the first time this had been suggested and there was no disclosure request to the local authority, so it is not possible to determine whether this was the case or not. The Mother says the social worker knew, as she believed to be the case, that she and the children were going to stay with her parents in India. </span></p>

She says that she went round the Temple for about one hour and then got the same taxi driver to take her back to the hotel. The taxi driver said that he had taken the Father and the children to the airport. Once back at the hotel the Mother said she realised the Father and children were missing, she went to the airport and after some searching and phone calls discovered the Father and children had flown to Abu Dhabi and then on to Madagascar. The Father had taken her passport.</span></p>

However, when the Mother accused him of abducting the children he decided that he could not return to the UK but would instead stay in Madagascar. He left the car at Heathrow. </span></p>

She says that what contact there was, was instigated by her, that in did not last more than 2-3 minutes and that sometimes the Father did not actually allow the children to come to the computer.</span></p>

(ii) The test is essentially a factual one which should not be overlaid with legal sub-rules or glosses. It must be emphasised that the factual inquiry must be centred throughout on the circumstances of the child's life that is most likely to illuminate his habitual residence ( A v A , In re L ). (iii) In common with the other rules of jurisdiction in Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;) its meaning is &#8220;shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity&#8221;. Proximity in this context means &#8220;the practical connection between the child and the country concerned&#8221;: A v A , para 80(ii); In re B , para 42, applying </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mercredi v Chaffe (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-497/10PPU" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-497/10PPU</ref>) EU:C:2010:829; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] Fam 22" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] Fam 22</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> , para 46. (iv) It is possible for a parent unilaterally to cause a child to change habitual residence by removing the child to another jurisdiction without the consent of the other parent (In re R). (v) A child will usually but not necessarily have the same habitual residence as the parent(s) who care for him or her (In re LC). The younger the child the more likely the proposition, however, this is not to eclipse the fact that the investigation is child focused. It is the child's habitual residence which is in question and, it follows the child's integration which is under consideration. (vi) Parental intention is relevant to the assessment, but not determinative (In re L , In re R and In re B). (vii) It will be highly unusual for a child to have no habitual residence. Usually a child lose a pre-existing habitual residence at the same time as gaining a new one (In re B). (viii) In assessing whether a child has lost a pre-existing habitual residence and gained a new one, the court must weigh up the degree of connection which the child had with the state in which he resided before the move (In re B &#8212;see in particular the guidance at para 46). (ix) It is the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">stability </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of a child's residence as opposed to its </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">permanence </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">which is relevant, though this is qualitative and not quantitative, in the sense that it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than a mere measurement of the time a child spends there (In re R and earlier in In re L and Mercredi). (x) The relevant question is whether a child has achieved </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">some degree of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">integration in social and family environment; it is not necessary for a child to be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">fully </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">integrated before becoming habitually resident (In re R) (emphasis added). (xi) The requisite degree of integration can, in certain circumstances, develop quite quickly (article 9 of Brussels IIA envisages within three months). It is possible to acquire a new habitual residence in a single day (A v A; In re B). In the latter case Lord Wilson JSC referred (para 45) to those &#8220; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">first roots </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; which represent the requisite degree of integration and which a child will &#8220; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">probably </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; put down &#8220; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">quite quickly </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; following a move. (xii) Habitual residence was a question of fact focused upon the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or indefinitely  (In re R). (xiii) The structure of Brussels IIA, and particularly recital (12) to the Regulation, demonstrates that it is in a child's best interests to have an habitual residence and accordingly that it would be highly unlikely, albeit possible (or, to use the term adopted in certain parts of the judgment, exceptional), for a child to have no habitual residence; As such, &#8220;if interpretation of the concept of habitual residence can reasonably yield both a conclusion that a child has an habitual residence and, alternatively, a conclusion that he lacks any habitual residence, the court should adopt the former&#8221; (In re B supra).</span></p>

The principles from the speech of Baroness Hale are well known and I do not need to set them out in detail. The Court must act in accordance with the welfare of the children (para 25); summary return should not be the automatic reaction but may be in the best interests of the child (para 28); the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that is it is likely to be better for the child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there but the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously (para 32); an important variable is the degree of connection with each country (para 33); and the length of time the child has spent in each country (para 34); great weight should be given to the child&#8217;s need for a meaningful relationship with both his parents (para 41). </span></p>

Delhi is not on the way to Madagascar and the Father then flew back to Abu Dhabi to change planes for Madagascar. Such a course of conduct makes even less sense with very small children. It therefore seems to me to be highly likely that the Mother did not know of the Father&#8217;s plan, and that he flew to Delhi in order effectively to leave her in India and remove the children.</span></p>

It would be an extraordinary coincidence if the Mother happened to lose her passport at exactly the point her husband and children went to Madagascar.

It seems unlikely that the Mother would have agreed for him or K to go to Madagascar with the Father, without her.</span></p>

These are very young children who had spent virtually their entire time with the Mother until the Father wrongly removed them from her care. The Father&#8217;s conduct both to the Mother, but also to his own children can only be described as callous in the extreme.  It may be that the children were upset by seeing their Mother over the IMO internet link, but that can only be as a consequence of the Father&#8217;s actions in removing them in the first place.</span></p>

Up until giving that oral evidence the Father had made no proposals for contact, and said that he thought contact would be detrimental for the children. This indicates to me that firstly he is unlikely to continue to support contact and secondly that he has no appreciation of the importance for the children of having close contact with their Mother. </span></p>
