	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This case concerns an application by an NHS Trust (hereafter referred to as the &#8216;Trust&#8217;) relating to the first respondent, XB, who has serious hypertension that is placing his life in danger. This condition requires urgent medication with antihypertensives which the Trust wish to administer to XB, but he is refusing to take it. </p>

The Trust state if such medication is given it would have to be covertly administered. The Trust therefore seek a declaration regarding XB&#8217;s capacity and that it is XB&#8217;s best interest to covertly administer certain antihypertensive medication in accordance with the Covert Medication Care Plan. </p>

Their position has been that whilst they understood the need for XB to have the medication due to the urgent medical need and did not actively oppose the declaration, they have fairly and repeatedly made the point of the need for this issue to be brought before the court. whilst they can see no alternative due to the significant risk to XB&#8217;s health of any other option they have sought, since at least October 2019, for the issue to be the subject of an application to the Court of Protection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Although this application is being heard in open court the proceedings are subject to a Transparency Order made by MacDonald J on 2 September 2020.

In addition, it prohibits identification of XB&#8217;s detention in a mental health hospital, his forensic history, his ethnic origin, hospital and Trust in order limit the risk of jigsaw identification. </p>

At that hearing the court raised the issue of delay in issuing these proceedings and directed the parties to provide further submissions that address that issue by 14 December 2020. That further information was provided on 16 December by the Trust and the Official Solicitor, together with subsequent emails from YB and ZB commenting on the additional information. The matter was listed for judgment on 21 December 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The court is going to make the declaration sought that XB lacks capacity to consent to antihypertensive medication and it is lawful for XB to be given antihypertensive medication covertly, in accordance with the Covert Medication Care Plan dated March 2020. The medical evidence is clear that if XB does not receive that medication going forward there is a very serious risk to his health, including his death. XB lacks the capacity to make that decision regarding medical treatment as he does not accept he has hypertension due to his mental ill-health and consequently is unable to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of taking the medication prescribed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The administration of covert medical treatment is a serious interference with an individual&#8217;s right to respect for private life under Article 8 ECHR. whilst the family may have realistically recognised the need for such treatment to be administered if the position was urgent and life threatening, they continued to express concern about it and wanted the matter considered by the court where XB would have the opportunity of representation, and the decision would be taken separately from those who have a therapeutic relationship with XB and the family who seek to support XB. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Making an application to the court was raised by YB and ZB as long ago as July 2019, albeit in the context of proposed urology treatment, and was repeated again by them in October 2019, in the context of antihypertensive medication. By then this medication was being given covertly to XB following a Best Interests meeting on 26 September 2019 where the family views were reported. YB and ZB were not invited to this meeting, which the Trust now accept was a mistake. Whilst XB discovered he was covertly being given this medication on 30 November 2019, the management of that did not obviate the need for an application. It remained clear XB was likely to continue to object to having the medication and the medical evidence was likely to remain the same regarding the urgent need for him to continue to have it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further avoidable delays resulted in the application not being made until 6 August 2020, even though the Trust accept they had received legal advice on 16 April 2020 that an application was necessary. The hearing not taking place until 11 December 2020 was largely due to the failure to secure a fixed hearing date in the directions order made on 2 September 2020.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The consequence of these avoidable delays is that the court is being asked to consider declarations over 7 months after the Trust had re-started covert administration of antihypertensive medication on 23 April 2020, and at a time when it is recognised that XB should be informed of the administration of the covert medication in the next few weeks. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In making these observations the court does not seek to undermine the declarations it has made and the evidence that support those declarations being made, but it remains the position that this application and this hearing should have taken place much earlier than it has. This view accords with the Guidance issued by the Vice President of the Court of Protection dated 17 January 2020 <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/2" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 2</ref></span>, in particular paragraphs 8 c) and 10.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> This statement recognises the key importance of the autonomy of individuals who refuse treatment but recognises there are times when severely incapacitated patients can neither consent or refuse treatment. In those circumstances the treatment should be made available to severely incapacitated patients judges according to their best interests and administered in the least restrictive way. In exceptional circumstances, this may require the administration of medicines within foodstuffs, when the patients is not aware that that is being done. The College advocates in such circumstances the need to keep clear records of the decision making process and the need to keep the decision under regular review. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, XB suffers from serious hypertension as outlined in the report from Dr Braganza. XB&#8217;s blood pressure readings when he is not on antihypertensive medication have reached very high levels. The goal is to reduce the levels to below 140/90 mmHg. All the guidelines agree that by the time the levels reach 150-160/95-100 mmHg drug treatment is recommended to reduce the risks of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and end stage renal disease. Severe hypertension is defined as over 180/100 mmHg. XB&#8217;s highest recording has been 231 systolic and between October 2019 and May 2020 averaged at 184/122 mmHg. Dr Braganza&#8217;s report sets out at para 2.5.7 the clear reduction in blood pressure readings during the time XB has been in receipt of amlodipine, nearly reaching the treatment targets of less than 140/90. It is noted in the recent statement from Dr G he sets out that since 4 October 2020 only one reading has been less than 140/90 mmHg, so the position remains serious. Consequently, there is a continuing need for the medication to be administered to prevent the serious risks to XB&#8217;s health as outlined above. </p>

XB understands what hypertension is and the serious consequences if left untreated. However, he continues to refuse treatment because he does not believe that he suffers from hypertension. He considers staff are lying to him about his diagnosis in order to damage or control him. As a result of his mental ill health he is unable to use or weigh up the information about the benefits and risks of taking or not taking the medication, as he does not believe he suffers from the condition being treated.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the evidence there is no dispute regarding XB&#8217;s lack of capacity to make decisions about his medical treatment. Due to his mental ill health he is unable to accept the clear medical evidence that supports his diagnosis of hypertension and, as a consequence, is unable to understand the need to take the antihypertensive medication, or balance the serious consequences for his own health if he doesn&#8217;t take it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The decision taken at the Best Interest meetings on 26 September 2019 and 12 March 2020 to administer antihypertensive medication covertly may have been  recognised by the family as being necessary due to the serious risks to XB&#8217;s health if it wasn&#8217;t taken, however that was in the context that they have repeatedly made clear they consider an application should be made to the Court of Protection. This view is consistent with the views expressed by the family in July 2019 relating to the proposed urology treatment. As was acknowledged by the Trust at the hearing, both YB and ZB have always sought to assist and support XB in any way that they can. In the light of the history to this matter they were entitled to rely on the Trust making an application in a timely way. The Trust acknowledge the family should have been invited to the September 2019 Best Interest meeting and the family had made clear prior to that meeting and afterwards that a court application should be made.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In those circumstances it is difficult to understand the rationale of the Trust who now state they did not consider an application to the Court of Protection was necessary prior to March 2020. I do not accept, as the Trust submit, that the family were aware that until 12 March 2020 the Trust did not consider that an application to the Court of Protection was necessary. On the contrary, there was a positive decision to issue proceedings in July 2019 (albeit in the context of the urology treatment), YB had stated in October she still wished that to happen and there is a reference buried in a case note of the discussion between YB and Dr G that proceedings may be required if covert medication was to be a longer term plan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The rationale relied upon by the Trust for issuing proceedings in March 2020, as set out in paragraph 68 above, were as applicable in September 2019 as they were in March 2020. The evidence demonstrates the continuing anxiety expressed by both YB and ZB about the administration of covert medication to XB. Such a course is a serious interference with XB&#8217;s Article 8 rights and, in my judgment, falls within the category of cases where because of the particular circumstances there should be no reticence about involving the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The further delays after March 2020 are unfortunate. In my judgment the application should have been issued and not awaited expert evidence. Such evidence could have been sought after the application was issued. The Trust had the primary evidence to support the decision to administer covert medication from the treating Consultant Cardiologist, Dr N. By issuing proceedings earlier XB would have had the benefit of independent representation, the parties would have been assisted by the structure of the court proceedings and it is very likely the hearing would have taken place much earlier. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The court recognises this decision is being made with the benefit of hindsight, and understands the need to take account of the very real pressures on the Trust due to Covid-19. However, in my judgment, what happened in this case demonstrates the need in cases such as this for very serious consideration to be given by any Trust in a similar situation of the need for an application to be made to the court.   </p>
