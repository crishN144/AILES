	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by the paternal grandfather, J and step grandmother, K, (&#8220;the Applicants&#8221;) for contact with A, aged 6. The application is opposed by the M and supported by the F. The application was refused by HHJ Walker on 4 October 2023, but that decision was overturned by Mr Justice MacDonald on 5 February 2024 and the matter remitted to me as Family Presiding Judge for the Midlands. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The M and F had a relationship and the M became pregnant. By the time A was born in December 2017, the F had been convicted of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison. The F will therefore spend the entirety of A&#8217;s minority in prison. The M was convicted of assisting an offender by impeding his apprehension/prosecution in a murder case in 2018 when A was about 3 months old. She was not given a custodial sentence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is of relevance to understanding the emotional background to this case, that the F has a long list of previous and serious offences. There are 26 convictions for 37 offences, including sexual assault of a child under 13 (4 offences in 2009), possession of cannabis, battery (2012 and 2016) and common assault (2017). The police report recorded in an earlier Cafcass letter several &#8220;no further actions&#8221; for a broad range of other serious offences. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between A&#8217;s birth and the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020 A had regular overnight contact with the Applicants (approximately every fortnight), when the M was working on a Saturday night. All parties agree that this was a positive time for A who had a close and loving relationship with the Applicants and with other paternal family members. This contact stopped with Covid lockdown, then restarted in the summer of 2020, although perhaps less regularly, stopped again in the second lockdown, and then restarted in March/April 2021. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in May 2021 the F made an application to the Court for contact, his contact having stopped in March 2020. The M stopped contact with the Applicants in May 2021 and it is has not resumed since. Therefore, A has not seen the Applicants for approximately 3 years. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The M says that she stopped contact because she was so upset/concerned about what the Applicants had said in their statements in support of the F&#8217;s application and her overall concerns about J&#8217;s behaviour in respect of the F, and herself. Neither party has put those statements before this court. Ms Hibbert says, on instruction, that the statements were not filed until December 2021, so the M must have simply stopped contact because the F made an application. I cannot determine this dispute, but ultimately I do not consider it to be critical to the decision I have to make. </p>

J said in evidence that he did not organise the contact at the prison, because that had to be done by the F, and he denied knowing or having agreed to organise it. This either suggests that the F misled HHJ Walker in making the order, or that J is not now telling the court the full truth about what he agreed with the F. I can quite understand why the M found this &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; both confusing and worrying. I note that J appeared to show no curiosity or remorse about the fact that HHJ Walker seems to have been led to believe that he would organise contact, when he says he had never agreed to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">J named a family friend, B, on the C100 as A&#8217;s godfather. I understand B to be a fairly prominent member of the local community.  It was quite unclear to me why he had done that save perhaps to seek to influence the M by use of B&#8217;s name. The M had never been asked to agree to B being A&#8217;s godfather and, until she got the C100, knew nothing about the suggestion that he was. J said that the F had told him B was the godfather, and he never thought to ask the M about whether she knew or had agreed to B being a godfather. It must be remembered that this is in the context of the F already having been in prison throughout A&#8217;s life, and the M therefore being the child&#8217;s sole carer. Again, J seemed to show little or no curiosity or, in my view, genuine remorse about the fact that he appears, on his evidence, again to have been misled by the F. </p>

I have to say that J&#8217;s evidence in respect of his attitude to the M did not ring true. HHJ Walker had given the Applicants permission to send letters, cards and presents once per calendar month to A. However, they had not sent any presents or letters. When I asked why they had not sent A presents in order to try to re-establish some relationship with him, and regain the trust of the M, he immediately said he did not believe the M would pass them on. The M was clear, and I believed her, that she did pass on the cards. </p>

He was extremely quick to defend the F; when I pointed to the long list of offences, his immediate response was to say correctly, but unnecessarily, that the sexual offences were when the F was a child. Both his evidence, and the various documents strongly suggest that J will defend his son and support his &#8220;rights&#8221; in respect of A, rather than have any understanding or insight into the effect that the F&#8217;s murder conviction has had on the M, or inevitably in the long run, on A.

I fully understand, as Mrs. BAW told me that she is &#8220;desperate&#8221; to see her grandchildren, But that is not the test. The test is whether it is in the interests of the children for such contact to take place, and as the later part of this judgment will make clear, the grandparents' wholesale support for their son and their hostility to the children's mother are strong pointers against contact.&#8221;</span></p>

But the rationale of that approach is that contact is to be denied because the child is put at serious risk of major emotional harm if the mother were to be compelled to accept a degree of contact to the father against her will: see the judgment of Waite LJ at pp7-8. In the instant case, as I have already stated, the judge found not only that the grandparents&#8217; case for contact had &#8216;overwhelming merit&#8217;, he also found as a fact that there was a risk of significant harm to the child if face-to-face contact was not established reasonably soon.

Although this is in many ways admirable, I wholly understand the M&#8217;s nervousness about what the Applicants may say to A about his father and his offending history. They offered undertakings not to speak about his offences. However, I think it likely they would seek to portray him in a good light, and to minimise his past behaviour. For a mother who is desperately trying to move on from a very dark period, it is obvious why this would be so worrying. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the Applicants, and indeed Ms Ali, seemed to feel the nature of F&#8217;s convictions were almost irrelevant. For the M, trying to bring up and protect A, that cannot be the case, and is inevitably troubling in respect of what the Applicants may say to him. I am confident that J was seeking both to minimise the F&#8217;s convictions, but also the chronological spread and thus the degree of potential parental responsibility involved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not possible to get to the truth of some of the M&#8217;s allegations against the Applicants. However, there is nothing unreasonable about her relying on what the probation officer said to Cafcass. I also agree with her that putting B on the C100 as a godfather was either grossly insensitive or designed to intimidate her. J never bothered to check whether the M even knew that B was supposed to be a godfather. He simply, according to his evidence, took the information from the F. This shows a lack of respect for the M which is striking. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most important factor in not ordering direct contact between the Applicants and A is the impact that such an order would have on the M. The M is A&#8217;s primary carer. It is clear that she has no trust in the Applicants and is vehemently opposed to A spending time with them. She is trying to help A (aged 6) grapple with the fact that his father is in prison for a long time for &#8220;hurting someone&#8221; and how she will explain the offence to him. This must be a massive burden and be very challenging to any parent. I accept that she will find supporting contact once a month with the Applicants traumatic. It is also important that A is only 6 years old, and the Applicants are virtually strangers to him. Expecting in those circumstances that the M should send him off to overnight contact once per month is in my view unrealistic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her upset and unhappiness will undoubtedly then affect A. This is a factor Ms Ali simply has not considered. She has put A&#8217;s &#8220;identity&#8221; way above the emotional impact on his primary carer, and the degree to which any 6 year old child gets their own emotional stability from that primary carer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Weighing all these factors up together, I take the view that the impact on the M and, through her, on A, clearly outweighs any benefits to A from contact. It is important to give A and the M the space to come to terms with visiting the F and the implications of his offending on A. The M also needs a break from litigation and the constant stress of having to, at least in her eyes, protect A. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not necessary in this case for me to make a s.91(14) order because grandparents have to gain permission to bring an application in any event. Ms Hibbert submits that a s.91(14) order would be a substantial interference in the grandparents&#8217; rights. The grandparents had not made multiple applications. She further submitted that the lack of notice of such an application should constrain the Court. However, I note that the Guardian did raise a s.91(14) as a possibility, and it is open to the court to make an order of its own volition. The hurdle of permission to bring an application does not remove rights, but it does protect a parent and the child from being caught up in almost endless litigation, as happens too often in private family law disputes. The strain on the M of having to deal with litigation concerning A for much of his life is intense, and it impacts on A&#8217;s best interests. Although the grandparents have not themselves made more than one application, they have supported the F&#8217;s frequent applications and enforcement applications, despite the fact at least one of them was plainly misconceived. In my view it is strongly in A&#8217;s interests that there be no more court cases for at least three years. I will allow monthly indirect contact via letters, cards and presents to A. I hope that process will allow the Applicants to genuinely attempt to regain the M&#8217;s trust, and that she will then feel able to support a future relationship between them and A. </p>
