She did not respond to visits by IAOT over three days, so they decided to readmit her.  By 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2009 IAOT workers had still not made contact with QR.  While they were trying to gain access to her flat, they heard QR fall. They entered with the help of police to find her collapsed on the floor.  There was blood in her vomit.  She was again admitted and treated for acute renal failure caused by dehydration.  The bloody vomit was thought to be caused by self medicating with non steroidal inflammatory drugs.  QR had also broken her arm.  She was transferred to a specialist facility as an informal patient, started again on medication and she slowly improved.  She remained at the specialist medical facility, being allowed unescorted leave during which she visited her brother who was by now living in her flat and doing some reception work.  She started to consider the possibility of supported living and visited some placements.</p>

In their view she is ready to move into a more independent living arrangement.  However they do not agree that she should return to her flat. They argue that, because of the history outlined above, it is too dangerous for QR to live on her own.  She must live in accommodation which provides 24 hour support and monitoring, so that QR will continue to be compliant with her medication and avoid the risk of a possibly fatal relapse.  This conclusion by the treatment team determines the terms of the CTO.</p>

They had done everything they could to try and make that degree of independence work for QR.  It had ended in failure and recognition that QR needed more support than could be made available by regular visits from IAOT.  On each occasion QR would stop taking her medication and evade calls from IAOT workers.  Her mental health would deteriorate leading to a crisis, whether in her mental or physical health, which would necessitate admission to hospital.  In 2009 IAOT abandoned that option, recognising that living in her own flat would never give QR sufficient support.</p>

She still fears contamination of her water supply and gives different accounts of the episodes of dehydration to different people.  In Dr Killaspy&#8217;s view QR&#8217;s long period of stability on medication since her admission to hospital and then to ABC has not resulted in an improvement in her insight into her condition.

LBI wishes her to live at a supported living option with 24 hour on site at D Road.  (&#8220;the DR flat&#8221;).  QR&#8217;s Counsel asked Dr Killaspy whether QR&#8217;s reaction of feeling unsafe when she visited the DR flat and found a number of men of an ethnic minority background in the office was delusional.  Dr Killaspy responded that QR is sensitive to her vulnerability to sexual violence for good reason and that IAOT take that seriously.  She has some good reasons for being reluctant to take up the tenancy of the DR flat which IAOT can address.  However she has other reasons which demonstrate that she lacks insight including the rejection of the need for 24 hour support.   The placement is a stepping stone, taking QR towards her goal of living independently and it is not sensible for her to deny it.  IAOT have spent some years trying to find a supported living placement to which QR would agree to move.  She could have another council tenancy in the future but she cannot move forward without relinquishing her current tenancy.</p>

QR has a hierarchy of preferences: she will do everything possible to avoid hospital admission, she would prefer to remain at ABC until she has suitable independent accommodation (she would prefer to get a transfer to a different council tenancy), she would accept supported living tenancy as a last resort as long as the accommodation is not restrictive and invasive of her privacy.  Dr Akenzua considers that it is this analysis which has led QR to decide that she prefers to have her own flat and will not willingly relinquish her tenancy, even if it means the matter has had to go to court and the court decides that she has to go into supported living accommodation.

Even if QR exhibits some delusional views, they are not sufficiently in play to prevent her decision on residence being made with capacity.  She does not have to have a perfect understanding of the issues; I must not set the test too high.  QR may make an unwise decision but that does not make it incapacitous.   There is no issue that QR has capacity to understand the terms and obligations of the tenancies or that she lacks understanding sufficient to be unable to instruct solicitors or understand the issues.</p>

The Court cannot require LBI to put other options on the table.  QR has failed to take this on board.  Returning to her flat or moving to accommodation which has off-site support are not available options.  Her only decision is whether to surrender her current tenancy and sign an agreement for a supported living tenancy.  QR does not demonstrate a logical thought process in objecting to the three supported living options put to her.  She is unable to weigh the salient details of her decision.  She has given a great many reasons why the DR flat is not suitable but it is clear that fundamentally she does not consider that she needs 24 hour care.</p>

While she was aware that IAOT were proposing the move because it would provide a less restrictive environment for her, QR did not appear to attach weight to that aspect.  She objected to 24 hour support as being regimented, like boarding school and denying her the privacy and independence that she seeks.  However if she remains at ABC she will be choosing a living situation which as I understand it is more regimented and offers her less privacy and independence than the proposed supported living accommodation.

She values the independence and privacy that it gives her.  She rightly recognises the value of a secure council tenancy, both for itself and as a means of exchange for another secure tenancy.  She wants to keep the option of completely independent living open.  She has a number of reservations about the supported living options which have been offered to her which would be shared by any woman: fear of being unsafe in a particular area, fear of being unsafe in relation to other tenants generally and in view of their mental health histories, anxiety when having to face a group of male workers.  Dr K acknowledged that QR is sensitive to her vulnerability to sexual violence for good reason and that IAOT take that seriously.  She did not like aspects of all 3 options such as room size, back yard.  I acknowledge that all of these are good and rational reasons for being reluctant to move somewhere.</p>

Without that understanding she cannot give due weight to the risks she faces if she does not take her medication, the implications of her long history of episodes of non compliance with medication and the role of 24 hour support in keeping her well.  That is of central importance in a decision about whether to move on to a more independent living situation which requires her to accept 24 hour support to avoid those risks.  It also prevents her from understanding the essential nature and purpose of the tenancy agreement for supported living which is based on her need for 24 hour support.</p>

In this case I do not consider that I have set the standard for capacity too high.

She might then make what might be regarded as an unwise decision which as a person with capacity she would be free to make.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In the case of Sheffield City Council v (1) E(2) S, Munby J (as he then was) addressed the issue of whether a person could have litigation capacity while lacking subject &#8211;matter capacity.  He said</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The question, as we have seen, is always issue specific.  There may be different answers to the questions, Does this person have litigation capacity? and Does this person have subject-matter capacity? As Bracewell J said, it all depends on the circumstances, There is no principle, either of law or of medical science, which necessarily makes it impossible for someone who has litigation capacity at the same time to lack subject-matter capacity.  That said, however, it is much more difficult to imagine a case where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity than it is to imagine a case where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity.  Whilst it is not difficult to think of situations where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity, and such cases may not be that rare, I suspect that cases where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity are likely to be very much more infrequent, indeed pretty rare.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that only in unusual circumstances will it be possible to conclude that someone who lacks subject matter capacity can nonetheless have litigation capacity&#8221;.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The court should be most cautious before concluding that the probability is that there is a disturbance of the mind.  Such a finding (of lack of litigation capacity) is a serious step for both parties.  It takes away the protected party&#8217;s right to conduct their litigation.  It may constitute&#8230; a serious disadvantage to the other party.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Is this one of those very rare cases where a person may not have subject-matter capacity but has litigation capacity? I have been the judge giving directions and conducting hearings in this case since October 2013.  I have been told by QR&#8217;s solicitor that she has no concerns about QR&#8217;s capacity to litigate and her ability to get instructions from her.  The case has not involved disputes as to the facts.  I have noted what Dr Kingett had to say about QR&#8217;s understanding of the legal process and her relationship with her solicitor (see paragraph 51 above).  Dr Akenzua, QR&#8217;s expert witness, provided evidence which was directed to the issues in the case and was of assistance to me.  Her case was most ably presented by counsel at the final hearing.   It would fly in the face of my own experience of dealing with the case to find that QR lacks capacity to litigate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have described above the matters in which QR has understanding and an ability to use and weigh information.  She is in a stable state as regards her mental illness and recognises many of the realities of her situation.  Her delusional illness affects her core understanding so as to prevent her making decisions for herself about the issues in this case, but does not prevent her from being able to manage her life and make most of her decisions for herself.  She is able to understand the court process.  Removing a person&#8217;s capacity to litigate is a significant interference with her rights. I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that QR lacks the capacity to litigate.</p>

I propose to publish this judgment in anonymised form on BAILII but will listen to any representations on the anonymisation from either party at the next hearing.</p>
