CD was represented by Mr Bagchi KC and Ms Lim, SP was represented by Ms Pemberton, FW was represented by Ms Richards and the Children&#8217;s Guardian was represented by Mr Hadley. Ms Pemberton only attended those parts of the hearing which directly impacted on her client (a small portion). This was a wholly appropriate model that should be adopted in other cases where one parent has only a small role to play in the proceedings, for whatever reason. </p>

This is a composite hearing to deal with both fact finding and welfare outcomes.  The LA care plan at the start of the hearing was for X and Y to live with their father, SP, and for Z to remain in long-term foster care with the hope, but no certainty, that at some point in the future he might be able to return to the care of his mother or his father, FW. </p>

It is accepted by all parties that X should be placed under a care order in a residential placement; Y should be under a supervision order with his father, SP, and Z should be under a care order in long term foster care. It is however proportionate and necessary for me to determine various disputed facts given that both CD and FW seek in the longer term for Z to be returned to their (separate) care, and FW has a number of other children, in relation to whom my findings may have some relevance. </p>

There were then various periods when CD reached out to the LA for support referring to her mental health problems; difficulties setting boundaries for the children; and the lack of family support.  There was a period in 2018 when the children were on a Child in Need Plan for a short period. Since 2020 there have been a number of times when X went missing from CD&#8217;s home and these were reported to the police and social services. On 6 September 2021 X was made subject to a Child Protection Plan and the younger children a Child in Need Plan. X was then placed in an out of area placement. X was at this placement at the time when B died. </p>

K would have been 13 at this point. In early 2018 CD was referred for a mental health assessment and was prescribed Quetiapine (an anti-psychotic). On 8 May 2018 there was an incident when CD went to FW&#8217;s house; there was an altercation and the police were called, CD was 5 months pregnant.  Z was born in September 2018. CD and FW had a break in their relationship, and it resumed when Z was about 9 months old. At that stage the relationship seems to have got even worse, partly because FW was having sex with at least one other woman. </p>

It is possible that CD&#8217;s limited consumption entered B&#8217;s system through breast milk. It is possible that it was through handling, either by CD or more likely by RN. In either case CD was grossly neglectful in exposing a small baby to cocaine, whether by her own consumption or by spending large amounts of time with RN when she was using cocaine. Equally, if the exposure was from FW, then CD clearly believed FW was consuming cocaine, but did not prevent him from handling B. </p>

The civil standard of proof applies, namely the balance of probabilities. If the Local Authority proves that it is more probable than not that a disputed event occurred, then it becomes an established fact for the purposes of these proceedings. If the event in question is not proved, it is treated as having not occurred.  That is the binary system that operates in the Family Court.</p>

In my view, she routinely prioritised that relationship over any proper care of the children. The evidence is overwhelming that she left the children alone on a large number of occasions when they were far too young for that to be appropriate. This follows from the evidence of the police finding Y and Z alone on 23 July 2021, X being found out on the streets alone, and evidence of CD simply leaving Z when a baby on the grass. There are numerous other references where CD left the children to go to FW&#8217;s house, either to have sex or to check whether there was another woman with him, and leaving the children at home. </p>

This is particularly troubling given that they were usually sleeping on the sofa, where the risk of CD lying on top of B and her being suffocated was even greater than in the bed. This risk was even further exacerbated by the fact that CD continued to consume cannabis, on her own admission, before B died. </p>

This is necessarily hearsay, and I take into account that CD, FW and K have described Y as being something of a fantasist. However, he was very consistent on this point about CD being drunk. I did not think RN was a reliable witness in respect of how much alcohol CD had consumed. Her aggression and dysregulation in the witness box may well have been a method of obscuring the fact that she was not telling the truth.</p>

No accident or other event has been referred to which could give rise to these injuries.

I therefore find that the most likely cause of those injuries is that they were inflicted by CD. There is no evidence that she injured B intentionally, but potentially through a combination of the effect of alcohol and drugs the injuries were inflicted. I note that there is reference to CD being very tired at times, and to B crying a lot. It is not difficult to see that this combination of factors led to CD handling B in a wholly inappropriate way that led to the injuries. </p>

The evidence on these injuries is less clear cut than on the other injuries because both Professors Arthurs and Mangham accepted that in principle this type of fracture could be a consequence of CPR. However, given the evidence of Professor Mangham I find on the balance of probabilities that they too were inflicted injuries. </p>

However, in my view he simply fails to take any responsibility for his own actions and choices, and for the effect that has on his multiple children and their mothers. His attitude to those women, including CD, has had the direct consequence of the children being exposed to domestic abuse, including physical abuse. I do not accept that FW has always been the victim of physical assaults and has only acted to defend himself. The situation here, as with so many cases of domestic abuse, is that most of it has happened in private and there is no independent third party evidence. However, in this case there is the evidence of TB, who saw FW being verbally abusive and demeaning to CD, then spoke to CD when she was very distressed in the presence of FW, and then saw CD the next day when she had a number of facial injuries. I have no doubt these were inflicted by FW. </p>

They were both responsible for serious incidents of domestic abuse taking place in front of the children. Neither party has much or any insight into the harm they have inflicted on the children through this behaviour, although CD appears to have at least some appreciation of the impact, whereas FW takes no responsibility and appears to have no insight. </p>
