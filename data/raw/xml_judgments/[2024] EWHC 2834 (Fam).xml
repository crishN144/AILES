	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2024 the court [Sir Andrew McFarlane P and Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia] handed down judgment at the conclusion of proceedings under the Hague International Child Abduction Convention ordering the return of two children to the USA, A and B. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2024, Moylan LJ refused an application by the children&#8217;s mother for permission to appeal. Unfortunately, the parents have been unable to agree the terms of a final order and the case was relisted on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2024 to resolve these outstanding issues. On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October, solicitors instructed directly by the children issued an application (a) seeking permission for the children to be represented separately from their current CAFCASS guardian and (b) for the final decision made on 28 June to be set aside &#8216;due to a change in the children&#8217;s circumstances&#8217;. In the event, the application for separate representation was also listed on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November and was heard before, and, as a result of the time that it took, instead of, the father&#8217;s application to fix the terms of the final order. The purpose of this judgment is to determine the children&#8217;s application for separate representation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The factual background is fully set out in the judgment of 28 June &#8211; Re HR (Parallel Child Abduction and Asylum Proceedings) [2024] EWHC 1626 (Fam). The children, A and B, are now aged 12 and 10 years. Like their parents, they are American and had no previous connection with the United Kingdom before they arrived in England with their mother on 4 August 2022. On arrival, the mother claimed asylum for herself and the children. On 25 March 2024, the First Tier Tribunal [FtT] dismissed the mother&#8217;s claims and her subsequent attempts to appeal that decision failed. Subsequently, in its June 2024 judgment, this court held that the father&#8217;s application under the Hague Convention, which he had made in March 2023, must succeed.  The mother admitted that she had wrongfully removed the children from the USA and the court dismissed her case under both Art 13(b) of the Hague Convention and her case based upon the children&#8217;s objections. The two children had been joined as parties to the Hague proceedings at an early stage, in accordance with guidance, solely because there were parallel asylum proceedings. They were represented by a guardian and a legal team at the Hague final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the centre of this case is the mother&#8217;s sustained assertion that her sons have been sexually and physically abused by their father. These assertions were investigated by the authorities in the US and, on 6 July 2022, following a one-day hearing in the Court of Common Pleas in Delaware County, Judge Love held that the allegations made against the father were not proved. The mother immediately made a fresh referral, repeating the allegations, to the local social services who, following a further investigation, informed her that the allegations were &#8216;unfounded&#8217;. The mother then removed the children to the UK.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the start of the June hearing, Mr Mark Jarman KC, counsel for the mother, applied for an adjournment so that the children might meet with Ms Nina Hansen, a most experienced solicitor, with a view to an assessment of their capacity to be separately represented in the final hearing of the Hague Convention proceedings. For the reasons recorded in our judgment [paragraphs 18 to 21] we dismissed that application and the hearing proceeded with the children&#8217;s interests continuing to be represented by Ms Baker, a CAFCASS guardian, Mr Niven-Phillips (CAFCASS Legal) and counsel.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.27in">The children&#8217;s views are firmly based upon the narrative that their father has abused them and is an altogether malign individual. The allegations that underly that narrative have been investigated by the CYS on a number of occasions, the US Family Court and the FtT. Each of these bodies has found that the evidence fails to support the allegations and that they are unfounded or unproved (even, in the FtT, on a lower standard of proof). Although we accept that the children&#8217;s subjective view are firmly held, the weight to be attached to the children&#8217;s objections that are based upon an unfounded narrative, in this case, must be substantially reduced.</p>

In terms of the policy of the convention these matters are for the court in the children&#8217;s home state but, more importantly in this case, the involvement of the father can realistically only be achieved if they are back in the US.</p>

There is no credible evidential basis for this belief, yet the children were abducted, in breach of orders of the US court, and have been kept, initially secretly, in the UK because of the mother&#8217;s belief. There is a strong policy ground based on comity between member states and the father&#8217;s application.</p>

In refusing permission to appeal, Moylan LJ held that there was no need for the children to be separately represented in order for their voice to be heard.

Nonetheless, he submitted that, for child A, regardless of the source of his views, he has sufficient maturity, intelligence and understanding to give Ms Hansen instructions.  As the children were already parties to the proceedings, the issue for the court was confined to that of representation. Mr Hames explained that, as the children did not have a live avenue of appeal against the June decision, &#8216;the best hope for them is for the order to be set aside&#8217;. In those circumstances, Mr Hames accepted that the court would necessarily have to consider the prospects of the application to set aside succeeding.</p>

An ability to understand that their solicitor put their case but also has duties of honesty to the court, an ability to understand that the judge makes a decision based on an overall evaluation of the best interests of the child which balances many competing factors; the ability to understand that they might attend court, could give evidence and could read documents; the ability to recognise the stress of exposure to the court process and the arguments between others.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jamie Niven-Phillips, on the instructions of the children&#8217;s guardian Ms Baker, accepts that Ms Hansen&#8217;s assessment of the children&#8217;s current ability to give instructions is likely to carry more weight than their previous assessment made a year or so ago. They do not therefore challenge Ms Hansen&#8217;s conclusions. Mr Niven-Phillips, whilst noting that Ms Hansen did not consider that B was clearly competent to instruct, submitted that, if A was competent and the position of both boys was a common one, then the threshold for assessing competence might be lower, thereby permitting B to do so alongside his brother. No authority was cited for this submission, which was not one that was made or supported by Mr Hames. Mr Niven-Phillips thus adopted an essentially neutral position on the issue of representation.</p>

In this regard, Mr Hames&#8217; description of the children&#8217;s case for set aside fell well short of satisfying the high threshold that is required. The following three discrete points fall to be made before turning to the test itself:</p>

It is not right to side-step this important requirement by submitting, as Mr Hames did, that as the children had not argued the point at the first Hearing themselves they are not &#8216;re-arguing&#8217; it now. If the case now to be put by the children was previously argued by another party or parties and determined by the court, the court should prevent it being re-argued through a set aside application. The focus must be on the need for a fundamental change that undermines the court&#8217;s decision;</p>

Any asserted change in circumstances is to be measured from the date of the court&#8217;s decision in June 2024. Thus, the relevant period is five months and not over a year as submitted, and any asserted further settlement in the UK is to be evaluated against that five month yardstick;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The submissions made on behalf of the children and of their mother each fall into error by only referring to the need to establish a change in circumstances. The first error relates to the quality and degree of change that is required, namely a &#8216;fundamental change&#8217;. Whilst being conscious of the need not to be unduly concerned with semantics, it is the case that Mr Hames described his case as relying on there being &#8216;a material change in circumstances&#8217;, whilst Mr Jarman referred to there being &#8216;fundamentally a significant change in the landscape&#8217;. Each of these formulations falls short of contemplating a &#8216;fundamental change&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second, and much more consequential error, is that the submissions made on behalf of both the children and their mother wholly failed to engage with the need to establish that such change as there may have been &#8216;sufficiently undermines the basis of the court&#8217;s decision and order to require the application to be reheard&#8217;. In this regard, Mr Harrison&#8217;s reference to the evidence before the court in June is important. The strength of the children&#8217;s objection to returning to the USA was front and centre before the court in June; it was, to a large degree, what the hearing was about. It was known that A had, over a year ago, spoken of killing himself should there be a return order. Against that background it is not the case that &#8216;the nature and force of their objections has materially changed&#8217;, as Mr Hames submits, let alone fundamentally changed so as to undermine the basis of the decision made in June. Indeed, for the children now to say that they will refuse to board a plane, is of a piece with the presentation of their wishes and feelings in June. Despite that being the case, the court determined that they must return to the USA. This is a difficult case. The children have been placed in an impossible situation by their mother&#8217;s unlawful actions. The strength of the boys&#8217; opposition to return was a &#8216;known known&#8217; in June, and the fact that five months later they are still firmly of that view in no manner undermines the basis of the court&#8217;s decision to order return.</p>

I have considered this option at some length during the hearing and when preparing this judgment, and have finally concluded that it would not be in their interests to remove them as parties at this late stage in the process. My primary reason for so holding is the way in which such a decision is likely to be viewed by the boys. It might well be seen in a very negative light by them and, because the proceedings have concluded, to make such an order would be of no procedural consequence. I will not therefore discharge the children as parties, but the conclusion that there is now no proper basis for them to be a party does carry some weight when determining the application for separate representation and it goes against granting that application.</p>

The children&#8217;s views must be compromised to a significant degree by enmeshment with their mother&#8217;s all-pervading view of their father. Her view has not been found to have any basis in evidence, yet the children, who have lived in one room with their mother for over two years, and have had no contact with their father in that time, must be wholly immersed in it.</p>

Whilst Ms Hansen was, as she states, concerned that there was a finding that both boys had been influenced by their mother, it is not clear from her statements that she fully contemplated the degree to which this is likely to be the case on the basis that I have now summarised.</p>

That, in my view, is the end of the matter so far as B is concerned at this time. There is a need for a principled approach and if the necessary standard of understanding is not met then the model for representation is for a children&#8217;s guardian to be the source of instruction rather than the child himself. I do not accept the submission put forward by Mr Niven-Phillips that where there is an older child who does have sufficient understanding then, in some unspecified way, the degree of understanding required from his younger brother could be reduced.

For the reasons that I have given, that proposed application is unarguable and has no prospect of success. Thirdly, A is currently a party because of the now historic parallel asylum case. If he were not a party there is now no additional justification for making him one and, were it not for the adverse message that this would send and for the fact that the proceedings are at an end, the proper order should be that he now be discharged as a party.</p>
