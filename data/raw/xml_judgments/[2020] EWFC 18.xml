The Local Authority also sought an emergency protection order. Given the father&#8217;s status the case was allocated within the Family Court to High Court judge level and came before me the following day, 22 January 2020. Clearly, the question of the immunity of the father and of members of his family forming his household from civil proceedings needed to be examined carefully. Until that issue had been determined no emergency orders could be made. Therefore, I granted the Local Authority permission to withdraw the application for an emergency protection order. My substantive order contained a recital which stated that the parents were warned that their conduct towards the children, of which there was strong prima facie evidence contained in the documents before the court, must not be repeated. Further, there was a recital that expressed the opinion of the court that it would be reasonable for the children to be able to speak to the Local </p>

This is the first case in this country concerning a serving diplomat (as opposed to a former diplomat or a member of a mission&#8217;s staff) where the issue has had to be considered. Indeed, the researches of counsel have only identified one other case anywhere in the world where the immunity of a serving diplomat from child protection proceedings has been considered. That was in New York in 1988, but in that case the supremacy of diplomatic immunity over local child protection laws was conceded (<span style="font-style:italic">In the Matter of Terrence K</span> (1988) 524 N.Y.S.2d 996).  </p>

This I granted. However, the following day the court was informed that the Foreign Secretary had decided not to intervene in the case at this stage. A similar communication was received from the Secretary of State for Education. Neither chose to send an observer to the hearing. This is extremely surprising. In virtually all the cases to which I was referred the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office had intervened, but none of them concerned a currently serving diplomat. I would have been greatly assisted had the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office intervened and made submissions. </p>

Mr Pipi explained that things tended to move at a slow pace in the foreign ministry and that the reason for the delay might well be because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was taking the advice of the Attorney-General. It is regrettable that the stance of the foreign government is not known, not least because a formal invitation to waive diplomatic immunity in respect of all members of this family was extended to that government by the Guardian of the children. </p>

However, during the course of the proceedings the diplomat&#8217;s posting came to an end and he returned to Saudi Arabia.

Indeed, the first preamble to the 1961 Convention recalls that peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents. In this country, as Lord Sumption explained, the concept of diplomatic immunity was first put on a statutory footing by the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1704 following the arrest for debt in the street of the Russian ambassador, who was returning in his coach from an audience with Queen Anne. Plainly, the potential offence caused to Tsar Peter the Great was extremely worrying. Therefore, the preamble to the 1704 Act states: </p>

In 1961 when the Convention was formed, and in 1964 when the Convention was being considered by Parliament, little regard was paid to the welfare and protection of children at risk. Hence the exceptions are exclusively to do with money and property. However, with the advent of human rights laws the protection of children has come to the fore. Article 1 of the 1953 European Convention on Human Rights obliges the contracting parties to secure to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">everyone</span> within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the convention. Article 3 of that Convention provides that no one shall be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Repeated judgments of the court in Strasbourg have emphasised the importance of protecting children from such treatment. The obligation is reinforced by the 1990 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child signed by both this country and the foreign government, article 19(1) of which states:  </p>

Hence, it is argued, the only way in which the state can discharge its duty to protect these children at risk is to &#8220;read in&#8221; the further exception which I have mentioned. It is argued that such a process would not be inconsistent with the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as article 31(2)(b) and (c) of that Convention permit later practices and later developments in international law to be taken into account when interpreting a Convention provision.

It is not clear as to the extent to which the Local Authority or the police could enter or intervene if the child was beaten at home. There is a suggestion in the textbooks, supported by cases across the Atlantic, that steps could be taken in an emergency to protect the offender and avert a dangerous situation. In a case where the rights of a child under article 3 of the European Convention were breached, I would like to believe that this would be seen as an emergency and action taken.&#8221;  </p>

This relief was not sought by the Local Authority in its application. It was too late for that relief to be sought at the hearing before me since the requisite 21-day period of notice to the Crown prescribed by FPR 29.5 had not been given. It will be apparent from what I have written above that I am of the view that inasmuch as articles 31 and 37 of the Convention prevent protective measures being taken in respect of the children of diplomats who are at risk then they are irreconcilable, and therefore incompatible, with the duties imposed on the state under articles 1 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They are probably incompatible with the rights under articles 6 and 8 also. However, as the application was not formally before me and as I heard no specific argument about this form of relief, I will say no more about this beyond observing that such a declaration would likely be no more than symbolic given that the British government would not be in a position unilaterally to amend the terms of the Convention. </p>
