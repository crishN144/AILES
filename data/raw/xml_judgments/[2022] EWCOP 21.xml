In this judgment it is my intention to preserve her privacy. For that reason, not only will I anonymise her, but also her family members, the name of the CCG bringing this application and its employees, and I will refer only in very general terms to where she lives.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The CCG has decided that FZ lacks the mental capacity to consent to the vaccine, and that it is in her best interests to receive it. They consulted with TZ&#8217;s family and sought their agreement. However, it became clear by early this year that their agreement would not be forthcoming. As a result, proceedings were issued in the Court of Protection (COP) on 14 February 2022. On 16 February 2022, I made directions and listed the matter for a directions hearing which eventually took place on 1 March 2022, by video link at Manchester. The matter was then listed for a final hearing that took place on 4 May 2022, by video link at Manchester. The delay between hearings was due to lack of judicial availability.</p>

I was also greatly assisted by TZ. Although she is not a lawyer, and has a great personal emotional investment in FZ, she was measured and respectful in her opposition to the CCG&#8217;s case.</p>

She suffers from learning disability and Down&#8217;s syndrome and, due to those conditions and the effect they have on her, she is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision, and certainly is not able to use and weigh that information to make a decision about whether or not to receive it. </p>

The evidence, including Dr HS&#8217;s assessment rebuts the presumption of capacity under s. 2 MCA. FZ lacks the capacity to make the relevant decision here, namely whether she should receive a vaccination against COVID-19.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear to me that a decision has to be made at this stage. The CCG has a duty to ensure that FZ is offered treatment, including vaccinations that are in her best interests (as the CCG assess them). Just because she has disabilities, FZ should not be disadvantaged or discriminated against in the offer of healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic is still with us. So it is necessary for a decision to be made now. I need to decide whether the option placed before me- including the vaccination support plan- is in FZ&#8217;s best interests.</p>

However, as I will outline below there is some evidence of a history of past wishes and feelings towards vaccines that I will consider. I have to take into account the "beliefs and values that would be likely to influence [her] decision if [s]he had capacity", and "other factors that [s]he would be likely to consider were [s]he able to do so". </span></p>

I must also take into account the views of other people close to FZ who would influence her. In this case that means her carers and family. These are the people she would be likely to be influenced by, were she making the decision for herself (sub-s (7)).</span></p>

There is a strong element of substituted judgment in such cases. I must consider FZ's welfare in the widest sense and not just in a narrow medical one (see Lady Hale at [39]). If I conclude that FZ would be more likely to be less ill, or less likely to die if she receives the vaccine, and that the likely adverse consequences of the vaccine are outweighed by those benefits, that is not the end of the best interests exercise. To a large extent I must try to put myself "in the place of the individual patient and ask what [her] attitude to the treatment is or would be likely to be, and [I] must consult others who are looking after [her] or interested in [her] welfare in particular for their view of what [her] attitude would be". </span></p>

Here, FZ was probably never capacitous. However, I did hear evidence that she used to be more able to make decisions in the past, so this maybe of some assistance to me in this case.</span></p>

This is a particularly important subject when considering the administration of a vaccine designed to prevent the spread, or at least the rapid spread of a virus. In other words: might FZ have behaved like a responsible citizen and consider the effect of her decision on other people had she made the decision for herself?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The CCG&#8217;s approach is as follows. As I see it, it falls into two parts. First, taking into account FZ&#8217;s vulnerability due to her disability, diagnosis of Down&#8217;s syndrome, her South Asian ethnicity and history of asthma, she is &#8220;extremely clinically vulnerable&#8221; (see Nurse SP, and the second opinion doctor). There are no obvious risks associated with the vaccine itself that would be so significant as to tilt the balance away from FZ receiving it. Without more, it is in her best interests to receive it. </p>

The CCG recognises that due to her previous history of refusing vaccines and her hostility and fear of the act of vaccination by injection, a special support plan must be adopted to stop the process causing her trauma, and perhaps making it impossible. As part of the plan, devised by Learning Disability services, a PA would be commissioned who would befriend FZ over a number of visits prior to the vaccination. Then, on the day, partly through distraction and partly by support, the &#8220;vaccinator&#8221; would attend and inject her swiftly, essentially before she was able to understand what was happening. When pressed on this, SP agreed there would be no use of physical interventions and restraint beyond the entirely usual holding of the target arm to ensure a safe injection.</p>

This is alleged to have caused her great trauma. I simply refuse to accept the comparison. A swift and sudden injection with nothing but a sore arm for a few hours is in no way as distressing as being left blind with eye patches on without understanding how or why.</p>

This has been dealt with elsewhere at some length (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DC</span>). However, in summary, I agree that the COVID-19 vaccines are novel (mRNA type). Their introduction has been accelerated due to the public health need to address the rapidly spreading and mutating virus to ensure that it did not kill more people and that rampant serious infections did not damage the healthcare infrastructure. To that extent there are aspects of these vaccines that are unusual. However, as already cited, the COP is not the proper venue to deal with theories concerning the safety of a vaccine or vaccines that have been approved by the regulators. Furthermore, in view of the emergency situation caused by the pandemic, an urgent and less than perfect response has been necessitated.</p>

They may have a particular view of their faith that is not mainstream. They maybe outliers. In this case, I am not concerned with the main foundations of Islam and whether and to what extent observance of them is required in the case of those who lack capacity: as was the case, for instance, in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re IH (Observance of Muslim Practice)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2017/9" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCOP 9" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCOP 9</ref> (Mr Justice Cobb). I am concerned with what attitude FZ&#8217;s family has towards the COVID vaccines when applying their faith. However, I did not find TZ&#8217;s explanation of the objection at all coherent- which was in contrast to her evidence in general. My overall conclusion on what she says about the vaccine being un-Islamic is that it does not convince me, and I doubt it convinces her, either.</p>

Were FZ to be subject to the treatment, even using the planned intervention outlined in this case, it would cause FZ trauma that would last for the long term.

She would not tolerate abdominal ultrasound or pressure checks. She removed attached equipment placed on her by an anaesthetist who was trying to monitor her chest- although she had allowed him to place them on her initially. A COVID swab had been obtained from her, but that was by her brother. She was agitated by the visit of a GP and learning disability nurse but was settled by reassurance from family members.

SP was questioned and I pressed counsel for details as to how it would work in practice. It seemed to me almost inevitable that FZ would react with agitation when confronted with a vaccinator, even if she was able to trust the PA sent to befriend her- which in itself seems less than likely. How many times would they try this? To what extent would they find themselves distracting her momentarily so as to inject the vaccine in her arm as she was distracted? Would it not be inevitable that the hand on the target arm would involve a forcible hold once FZ realised what was going on? What would the fallout be for TZ and the rest of FZ&#8217;s family?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Another factor I must consider is the non-medical benefits/dis-benefits of the vaccine. Earlier this year it was widely believed that normal life &#8220;after&#8221; COVID-19 might be difficult without proof of vaccination (&#8220;the COVID-passport&#8221;). It is not clear to me whether that is still the case. However, in FZ&#8217;s case, she lives with her family and I was told they are almost her entire world. With or without the vaccine, TZ told me, FZ would still engage in the activities she always has.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have found this case extremely challenging. The benefits of the vaccine are plain. However, the difficulty in administering it in a way that is likely to work is immense, and the damage a failed attempt could cause to the relationships within the family is hard to assess. I am quite sure, however, that the plan put forward by the CCG would be met with resistance and there would have to be a retreat by the vaccinator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the matter at great length, I wonder what the proposed plan actually amounts to? It seems to me what is proposed is to engage with FZ, if that is possible. That engagement would then lead to an appointment with the vaccinator which FZ would not know about. She would not even see the vaccinator until the moment immediately before the injection. At that point, I am not sure what is envisaged. I am satisfied that it is almost inevitable- certainly more likely than not- that FZ will resist. This will be verbal, and physical. I base that on the evidence of past interventions and the evidence of what happened when the entirely friendly and benign Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative visited her just to speak.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When making a choice in this case I have to look not only at the outcome of the treatment, but how it will be carried out. I am satisfied that vaccination will have a good outcome for FZ. However, I am not satisfied that the option I am being asked to approve will achieve that outcome. I am satisfied that it will be met with resistance and will in all likelihood have to be aborted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already made clear above, best interests have to be evaluated by taking into account factors that go beyond narrow medical concerns. In this case, I am satisfied that the CCG is right to advise that the vaccination should be offered to FZ. They have made efforts to ensure that a sensitive plan is devised to enable the vaccination to take place. I have no criticisms of them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, taking all the factors I have discussed into account I am not satisfied that the option placed before this Court is in FZ&#8217;s best interests. It is likely to result in trauma for her (and her family). It is likely to have to be aborted and then, possibly tried again and again until the CCG finally removes it as an option. I am satisfied that it would be wrong for me to authorise the plan before me. </p>
