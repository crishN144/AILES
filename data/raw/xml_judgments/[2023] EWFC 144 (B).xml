Miss Fottrell KC summarised it by saying that a section 31 care order is the more draconian order and more interventionist. This is undoubtedly the case as not only does a local authority acquire parental responsibility pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(3)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> when a care order is made, but also under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(3)</ref>(b)(i) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> the local authority may &#8216;determine the extent to which a parent may meet his or her parental responsibility&#8217; for the child in question. In other words, as it was put in argument, when a care order is made, the local authority may (by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/33/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>), in order to &#8216;safeguard or promote the child&#8217;s welfare&#8217;, &#8216;trump&#8217; the parents whenever there is an issue between them. By contrast, as Ms Fottrell says, a section 20 accommodation order facilitates partnership and where it is functioning well under an agreed care plan, not only is the making of a care order not necessary but it is disproportionate. To make a care order in such circumstances would not she submitted, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, be &#8216;better for the child than making no order at all.&#8217;</span></p>

Thereafter, the parents can exercise their parental responsibility only to the extent that the local authority determines. As this court explained in In re B, that intrusive power clearly engages the article 8 rights of the parents and children. It follows that a care order can only be made, even if the statutory threshold criteria under section 31(2) are met, if such an order is necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the child(ren)&#8217;s right to grow up free from harm. That means that the order can be made only if it is proportionate to the needs of the situation. See especially Lord Wilson at paras 32-34, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury at paras 73-79 and Baroness Hale of Richmond at paras 194-198. And it follows also that, as Lord Wilson put it at para 45, a judge considering a care order has an obligation not to act incompatibly with the article 8 rights involved. In truth, the obligation under article 8 ECHR, so clearly recognised in In re B does no more than re-state the longstanding proposition of English childcare law that the aim must be to make the least interventionist possible order, but the emphasis given to the issue in In re B was overdue&#8221;.</span></p>

They accept that this is not due to any suggestion that the parents would withdraw their section 20 consent.  They do assert however that R will be fast approaching independence, and would have her own choice to revoke her section 20 status to the exclusion of her parents upon reaching 16 years old.   The local authority assert in their final statement that as R will be 14 in late 2023, the local authority would therefore have around 18 months to come back to the court should a concern be raised if R was to advise she wanted to discharge herself from foster care at the age of 16.  They point out that would be another set of proceedings, which could be destabilising for R.  If the order is made now R can be told that she will remain a child in care until she reaches adult hood, and they assert this would provide her with stability and security in terms of her long term plan.  It was submitted by the local authority that this argument was really the key reason they seek the care order. </span></p>

The parents suggest that there have been recent incidents which were concerning in relation to R, such as her injuring another child, and R running away, and they were not told by those caring for her, it was R herself who told them.  Some discussions they understand have taken place between R and a person working with her which they view as inappropriate.  They are also worried there could be disputes in relation to the devices that R is allowed, with the suggestion particularly of R having access to an iPad and a mobile phone concerning them. They do not assert however that would cause the Court to consider a care order necessary, but rather the opposite, that they need to be able to work together in partnership.  The clear undercurrent is that the parents are concerned they will be sidelined if such an order is made. </span></p>

It appears to be accepted that in general her needs are being met within her current accommodation, but perhaps inevitably there are some issues which still needs to be addressed. She is not accessing a full range of education, but it appears to me that that is not necessarily something that is lacking, rather potentially it is thought there is a need to tackle and calm one issue at a time at the moment. She has only been placed there since March of this year, certainly they appear to be managing well most of her other needs, although she still presents with a high level of complex issues. </span></p>

They suggest that would impact upon her if that was necessary in a couple of years time, and it would be better for her to know now that she is the subject of a care order for the remainder of her childhood.  I accept there are benefits to that approach, particularly in relation to proceedings in relation to R being settled, being able to be explained to her, and a greater certainty that there would not need to be more proceedings.</span></p>

It also seems to me that whilst in general we would not want there to be further proceedings, if in the future if the local authority decided there did need to be a care order, R would then be of an age to be very involved in that process, she would have the benefit of her own guardian, and the situation could be looked at properly at that time.  Her needs and wishes may be such that it was appropriate for there to be court scrutiny of that aspect. </span></p>

Although the guardian does query whether that might be due to matters such as mobile phones, it seems to me more likely to be a concern in relation to Rs ability to go out alone etc. That certainly raises the prospect however potentially of more litigation.  That will not be the case if she remains accommodated and if her parents are imposing boundaries in discussion with the home that would be expected for a child with her level of understanding and risk.  To that extent therefore there is less likelihood of litigation with no care order of course. </span></p>

It is a difficult balance in this case, which is slightly different from Re W, in that it does seem to me that there is more prospect in this case of there being disagreements between the parents and the local authority as to the best way that R's needs are met.  It could of course be argued that would support a care order being made, as it would be clear that the local authority could take steps with their increased parental responsibility. It seems to me however it could also be argued that the need for the local authority to agree matters with the parents, potentially promoting greater collaborative working, may be better for R&#8217;s welfare.  It does seem to me I should place great weight upon the knowledge and skills of these parents, who know their daughter very well, and who have looked after her for many years.  </span></p>

I note however that one of the issues for example was that the parents were very concerned as to the level of supervision in relation to R, suggesting that she was a risk to herself and to others.  It transpires they were of course right, as shown by the significant injury R imposed upon one of her workers.</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.18in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">These are parents who advocate strongly for their daughter, and have the skills and ability to do that.  It appears to be accepted that R is not entitled to any greater support and assistance through a care order then if she is simply accommodated pursuant to section 20.  It seems to me there is a reality that if her parents are able to be driving issues forwards by using their parental responsibility, to ensure for example appropriate educational provisions are in place, and they are capable and committed to do that, it would be counter intuitive to pass that greater responsibility onto the local authority with the pressures upon their social workers.  There is a risk that R is therefore not always the first thing that a social worker can deal with, considering the many pressures on a social workers time.  It seems to me she will be always be a top priority for her parents.  </span></p>

However, on balance it seems to me that a situation where the parents need to respect the views of the unit where R is living, and where they must accept they have delegated day to day responsibility; but they must also respect the units&#8217; views and wishes, then that potentially creates in fact less room for conflict than the wider sharing of parental responsibility, with the LA having a trump card.   This is of course discussed in detail in the  Re W judgment in terms of the parents delegating their parental responsibility to the local authority voluntarily, whilst maintaining the partnership approach.</span></p>

Since March 2022 the parents and the local authority have met R&#8217;s needs.  There have been disagreements, but I consider that to be inevitable in such a case.  Some challenge and disagreement both ways can be healthy, to ensure the cross check of R&#8217;s needs, as long as there is some respect for differing viewpoints.  That is easier when the people caring for R are on a more equal footing with her parents, and less easy in my mind when the local authority are simply able to overrule the parents, particularly when I see no evidence that there is a need for these committed parents to be overruled. </span></p>

When I consider proportionality in this context, factoring in all of those different matters I have set out, it seems to me the proportionality cross check mitigates heavily against there being a care order in place.  The local authority and the guardian can only point to their being a potential need for it in the future.  I am satisfied that the far more draconian order could in fact create greater conflict and problems for R.  The current situation has enabled her needs to be met over the last year and a half, so the proportionality argument in my view falls clearly to the least interventionist order that is necessary, and that is no order. </span></p>
