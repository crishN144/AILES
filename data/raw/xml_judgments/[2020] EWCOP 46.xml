On 31 January 2020 the court granted P permission to make her application for committal of Ms Griffith.  The applicant is represented by Ms Simcock of counsel.  Ms Griffith has not attended the hearing in circumstances I will come to below but is represented by her solicitor advocate, Mr Adam Tear. </p>

At the last adjourned final hearing I directed, with the consent of all parties, a further statement from Nicola Mackintosh QC dealing with those questions that Mr Tear on behalf of Dahlia Griffith wished to put to Ms Mackintosh, Mr Tear having confirmed that the scope of the challenge he was instructed to make to the evidence filed and served with respect to the committal application was sufficiently limited to render this a just and proportionate approach. </p>

On that occasion, having been informed by Mr Tear that Ms Griffith was stating she was too ill to attend court, I adjourned the final hearing to allow her to provide medical evidence to that effect.  Ms Griffith failed to supply that evidence and her further failure to attend the first stage of this hearing remained unexplained despite attempts by Mr Tear to contact her ahead of the matter being called on. </p>

In addition to no credible reason being advanced for her failure to appear today, Ms Griffith has also failed to provide any medical evidence in support of her contention that she was too ill to attend the adjourned committal hearing on 1 September 2020.  Within this latter context, I have no confidence that a further adjournment would be likely to secure her attendance.  At the last hearing, and again at this hearing, Mr Tear confirmed that Ms Griffith intended to exercise her right to silence in respect of the contempt alleged and would rely on the challenges made by Mr Tear to the evidence deployed by the applicant.  Within this context, any disadvantage to Ms Griffith of not being able to give her account of events is mitigated.  I am likewise satisfied that, in these circumstances, no undue prejudice is caused to the forensic process by the absence of Ms Griffith.  By contrast, any further delay in these already significantly delayed proceedings would cause the applicant considerable prejudice, not least in circumstances where this committal application remains the only extant application in proceedings that have otherwise been satisfactorily concluded.  Having regard to the terms of the overriding objective to deal with cases justly, expeditiously and fairly, it would not be appropriate, in the circumstances I have outlined, to further adjourn the final hearing. </p>

Where this occurs as a result of the act of a party who is bound by the order or of others acting at his direction or on his instigation, it constitutes a civil contempt by him which is punishable by the court at the instance of the party for whose benefit the order was made and which can be waived by him. The intention with which the act was done will, of course, be of the highest relevance in the determination of the penalty (if any) to be imposed by the court, but the liability here is a strict one in the sense that all that requires to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent doing by the party bound of that which is prohibited. When, however, the prohibited act is done not by the party bound himself but by a third party, a stranger to the litigation, that person may also be liable for contempt. There is, however, this essential distinction that his liability is for criminal contempt and arises not because the contemnor is himself affected by the prohibition contained in the order but because his act constitutes a wilful interference with the administration of justice by the court in the proceedings in which the order was made. Here the liability is not strict in the sense referred to, for there has to be shown not only knowledge of the order but an intention to interfere with or impede the administration of justice&#8212;an intention which can of course be inferred from the circumstances.&#8221; </p>

To burst into a court room and disrupt a civil trial would be a criminal contempt just as much as if the court had been conducting a criminal trial. Conversely, disobedience to a procedural order of a court is not in itself a crime, just because the order was made in the course of criminal proceedings. To hold that a breach of a procedural order made in a criminal court is itself a crime would be to introduce an unjustified and anomalous extension of the criminal law. &#8216;Civil contempt&#8217; is not confined to contempt of a civil court. It simply denotes a contempt which is not itself a crime.&#8221; </p>

In Aldridge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt 5th Ed. At 3.45 the authors note that &#8220;In the case of criminal contempts not falling within the strict liability rule, it would appear that an intention to interfere with the administration of justice is required, at least for publication contempts. For other types of criminal contempt, the mental element is less clear.&#8221;    </p>

It is, of course, important to again acknowledge that the burden of proof remains at all times on the applicant.  Within this context, I accept Ms Simcock&#8217;s submission that such a contention does not, in any event, fit well with the facts.  As at the date of the purported order, Ms Griffith was acting in person.  Further, whilst on the date the order was emailed to Barts NHS Health Trust it is the case that Ms Griffith had instructed Sinclairslaw, she sent the email containing the purported order to Barts Health NHS Trust herself and not through her then solicitors.  Further, had Sinclairslaw been the author of the purported order, it is very difficult to see why they would have thereafter consented without comment to a third party disclosure order being made against Barts Health NHS Trust by Cohen J on 6 November 2019, which order again did not provide for disclosure to Dahlia Griffith.  Finally, in her affidavit Ms Shaughnessy of Sinclairslaw confirms, in evidence that was not challenged, that the documents were provided to that firm at the request of Ms Griffith. </p>

Within this context, I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from Ms Griffith&#8217;s action in seeking to obtain, by way of a forged court order, disclosure of P&#8217;s confidential medical records that she knew the court had repeatedly declined to order in the course of the proceedings is that she intended to circumvent the court&#8217;s principled decision on this issue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Against these matters, Ms Griffith acted intentionally in forging a court order in order to obtain disclosure which the court had denied her.  Ms Griffith&#8217;s action in forging a court order, whilst not resulting in her receiving P&#8217;s medical records, resulted in confidential medical records to which she was not entitled being disclosed to her solicitors.  It was only a matter of chance that Ms Griffith actions were discovered when a legitimate order was made by the court.  Within this context, P was, to a certain extent, prejudiced by Ms Griffith&#8217;s contempt, particularly in circumstances where medical records are confidential to the individual and it is crucial to respect the privacy of a </p>

These actions by Ms Griffith were undertaken in the face of repeated, principled decisions of the court that Ms Griffith should not have such disclosure. In the circumstances, a high degree of culpability must attach to Ms Griffith&#8217;s actions which, as I have noted, were deliberate in nature. Ms Griffith has shown no remorse for these actions, and indeed has failed to co-operate with the court by attending court in response to the application to commit her.  There is no indication that she appreciates the gravity of her conduct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Further, the act of forging a court order strikes at the very heart of the due administration of justice.  The need for litigants and third parties to be able to have confidence in the integrity of orders made by the court is fundamental not only to the integrity of individual proceedings but to the maintenance of the rule of law.  Any course that acts to undermine confidence in the integrity of court orders is accordingly highly corrosive of both the administration of justice by the courts and to the rule of law more widely (see <span style="font-style:italic">Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs v. Munir</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2015/1366" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 1366 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 1366 (Ch)</ref> at [9(i)]).  Within this context, the counterfeiting of court documents is considered by the courts to amount to a very serious contempt of court (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Dryer v HSBC Bank Plc</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2014/3949" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3949 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3949 (Ch)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v Patel and others</span>).    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, as I have noted above, one of the legitimate objectives of any penalty for contempt is to deter others from engaging in the course pursued by the contemnor (see Patel v Patel and Ors at [22] and [23]) and this objective will have particular resonance in cases where the conduct in issue has impeded the proper administration of justice </p>

Each committal application will, of course, turn on its own facts, both with respect to the question whether the contempt alleged is proved and with respect to the sentence that is appropriate where that contempt is proved.  However, as part of the sentencing exercise in this case, I have borne in mind the need to deter others from forging orders of the court by making abundantly clear that by doing so they would place themselves at grave risk of an immediate and lengthy sentence of imprisonment. </p>

I make clear that but for the fact that Ms Griffith has not to date experienced prison, and the current impact on the nature of custody of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would have imposed on her an immediate sentence of imprisonment of 18 months for forging the court order with the intention of interfering with the due administration of justice.   </p>
