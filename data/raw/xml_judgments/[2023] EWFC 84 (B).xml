Initially, a finding of fact hearing was listed for five days in December 2021 but vacated at the PTR a month earlier.

The final hearing was listed in November 2022, but was adjourned as by then the mother&#8217;s symptoms prevented her from participating in a final hearing and the surgery was imminent.

A negative associated with this option is that A might be exposed to Father's unhealthy and unacceptable attitude towards third parties and in particular Mother. A further risk associated with this option derives from Father's inability to sustain a positive relationship with his older children, X and Y. I can say little about Father's relationship with X, but I am clear that Father's behaviour towards Y has been abusive and unsupportive. There is a risk that, without extensive intervention and monitoring, Father's relationship with A will degenerate into the sort of relationship Father now has with Y. I accept that the evidence suggests that Father is presently meeting A's emotional needs but there is a significant risk that he would be unable to sustain that positive relationship with A when A becomes more demanding, more challenging and more independent as he grows older.&#8217;</span></p>

The judge had earlier identified positives and negatives of adoption for A, but noted again the difficulty A might be expected to find in forming attachments to new parents at his age, and having lived all his life within his birth family.  He said this difficulty would be likely to be &#8216;more tangible&#8217; the longer A had to wait before he could move to an adoptive placement.  The judge went on to say: </span></p>

I have already identified that A is very likely to experience significant trauma in being removed from the care of his parents. There is a risk in my assessment of that trauma being reinforced by a second move into an adoptive placement. There is a serious risk of A becoming wholly displaced in society by virtue of experiencing, sequentially, the loss of his family of origin; the loss of a home and, it would be hoped, stability in the care of foster carers and then for him to be uprooted from that placement into an adoptive placement.</span></p>

In this case the evidence shows that Mother is not in a position to meet A's global needs: she can meet some of them but by no means all.

Mother was clear in her evidence that Father was, with support, capable of being a good Father to A. The Guardian advances the case that A should move into Father's care under a regime that would enable the local authority to provide support and guidance. This option has not been assessed in any great detail. I was initially attracted to the concept of adjourning these proceedings to enable Father's parenting capability to be tested over a longer period of a few months. On reflection I take the view that A needs a degree of finality, these proceedings having already been afoot for an unconscionable period of time and I have settled on the view that A should be placed in Father's care with a support package. That would have the benefit from A's perspective of bringing these protracted proceedings to an end and imbue in him a sense of finality.</span></p>

In my assessment A should be afforded the opportunity to remain in the care of one of his biological parents and I do not think his situation would be seriously compromised were he to face the possibility of entering a therapeutic foster placement followed by adoption at some time in the future. It would in my view be quite wrong for the Court to support the local authority's care plan for adoption unless and until the option of A being placed in Father's care had been explored and shown to have failed.</span></p>

The proposals included a supervision order, intensive monitoring by the local authority, a tightly worded written agreement, attendance on a domestic abuse perpetrators course, a parenting course, and possibly therapy.  In the short term, the judge noted that observations of A in his father&#8217;s care were positive.

The judge noted that A had been seen to be much more regulated in his behaviour when with his father than in his mother&#8217;s care.  The judge noted that A&#8217;s mother had given evidence that she thought the father was capable of caring for A, with support.
