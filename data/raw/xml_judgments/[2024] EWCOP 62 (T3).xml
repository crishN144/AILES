	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Until March 2015 AB was a lively, energetic and much loved mother to three children, with an wide circle of family and close friends. Tragically, on 30 March 2015 AB, age 50, suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage, secondary to a right cerebral artery aneurysm during an exercise class. She was intubated and ventilated at St Mary&#8217;s Hospital and then transferred to the intensive care unit at Charing Cross Hospital where she underwent neurosurgery to stem the aneurysmal bleeding. In July 2015 she was transferred to the Brain Injury Service at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability (the RHN) for formal assessments of awareness, disability management and discharge planning. In December 2015 she was discharged into the Specialist Nursing Home within the RHN, where she has remained for nearly nine years.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Since the injury AB has remained in a prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC), and is diagnosed as being in the lower end of a minimally conscious state (MCS minus). She is entirely dependent on others for all aspects of her care and receives clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Since 2015 AB has had little or no conscious awareness of herself or her environment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with an application by the North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) dated 10 May 2024 for the court to determine whether it is in AB&#8217;s best interests for continuation of CANH. The clinical view of the RHN is that it is not in AB&#8217;s best interests for CANH to be continued. That view is shared by some of AB&#8217;s family but not all of them, with the result this application is brought before the court to determine. AB is represented by her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. The other parties to the application are AB&#8217;s sister, CD, and her eldest son, PB.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The hearing took place on the 16 October 2024 and was attended by members of AB&#8217;s family and friends, many of whom were present in court. AB&#8217;s two aunts, who live abroad, attended remotely. In addition to the extensive court bundle I heard oral evidence from Dr D, Consultant in Neurorehabilitation at the RHN. The family were able to ask him questions through Ms Paterson KC for the Official Solicitor.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to set out the background to the case I would like to pay tribute to AB&#8217;s family and friends who attended the hearing. They listened with great care to the oral evidence, sought further information through questions by Ms Paterson and have liaised with the other parties in the lead up to and during this hearing. The court recognises how difficult this hearing must have been for them and the sadness they all feel for the situation AB is in with the loss that represents for each of them. Their continued involvement in discussions regarding AB&#8217;s care over so many years and these proceedings speaks for the strength of their loyalty, affection and love for AB.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I would also like to recognise those who care for AB on a day to day basis. During my visit to the RHN to see AB it was very clear that her day to day care needs have been met to the highest standard by a dedicated clinical team. The ward matron has worked at the RHN throughout the period AB has been there and many of the other nurses on the ward who care for AB had been there for a number of years. They all spoke about AB with enormous care and appeared very attuned to AB&#8217;s day to day care needs.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For AB a formal best interest review was not started until early 2023, seven and a half years after her admission to the RHN. The RHN realistically recognises there has been delay to decisions being made, including for AB and her family. The reasons for that was a systemic failure in the RHN to have the relevant framework in place for making these best interest decisions in a timely way. Prior to the recent changes there was simply a vacuum within the RHN, with no system for best interest decisions to be made.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I fully associate myself with the observations made by Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">GU</span> about the impact of the delay in making best interest decisions on the person who is the subject of a best interest decision and the wider family. I agree with the Official Solicitor that there were inordinate and inexcusable delays that took place in this case in assessing and making any best interest decision regarding AB over many years in circumstances where AB&#8217;s situation had not changed and if AB did experience anything it was likely to be distress. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following their review in 2022 the legal framework and the wider landscape in the RHN are now pellucidly clear, providing a requirement for regular structured reviews of a person who is in PDOC, with an intense focus on their individual ongoing needs and timely best interest decisions being made. At each stage those decisions need to undertake the balance whether treatment which may have enhanced the patient&#8217;s quality of life or provided some relief from pain may &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">gradually or indeed suddenly reach a pivoting point where it becomes futile, burdensome and inconsistent with human dignity. The obligation is to be vigilant to such an alteration in the balance</span>&#8217; (per Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">GU [105]). </span>Whilst not detracting from the excellent care afforded to AB it is unacceptable that decision making structure did not happen in AB&#8217;s case for many years due to the essential framework for that to be done simply not being present in the RHN. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The framework now outlined in Dr Luttrell&#8217;s statements is a welcome and long overdue development that will ensure the delays in best interest decisions being made for those in PDOC will not occur in the future in the way they did for AB and her family. This includes, importantly, where there is no agreement or the decision is finely balanced for an application to be made to the Court of Protection to be determined.</p>

AB was referred to the RHN by her acute hospital as being in a PDOC for further formal assessments. AB was initially admitted to the Brain Injury Service (BIS) at the RHN for more formal assessments of awareness, disability management, and discharge planning. Five months later in December 2015 AB was discharged to the Specialist Nursing Home (SNH) at the RHN where she has resided for the last eight years. AB&#8217;s stay at the RHN SNH is commissioned by the ICB, funded through CHC (Continuing Health Care) funding and is reviewed annually.</p>

This leads to the removal of calcium from the bones and increased blood calcium levels. AB also suffers from an auto immune skin condition, hyperthyroidism and an element of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. These conditions are each managed by appropriate medications.</p>

AB sits in the lower category of the minimally conscious spectrum (MCS minus). This was in keeping with the national guidelines available at the time (Prolonged disorders of consciousness following onset brain injury: National clinical guidelines 2013) published by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). This has since been updated to the 2020 RCP PDOC Guidelines.</p>

In his oral evidence Dr D said that the assessments had shown that AB had exhibited half or one conscious behaviour and her levels of awareness had barely moved in nearly nine  years. Dr D did not consider there was any emotional content to AB&#8217;s smiles and the tracking with her eyes was due to her retaining her vision rather than any discerning behaviour. The smiles were more likely to be reflexive movements within her facial muscles than a response borne out of pleasure and/or affection. If AB did experience pain Dr D did not consider she experienced pleasure or comfort due to the extent and severity of her brain damage. He outlined in his oral evidence what he considered to be the deteriorating clinical picture as AB required more care interventions such as suctioning and managing her muscle tone and dystonia and if she did experience anything it was likely to be negative but Dr D remained uncertain about this.</span></p>

In his initial report he raised the issue as to whether obstructive hydrocephalus, as a reversible cause or treatable condition, had been fully excluded. Although he recognised the difficulties there would be in undertaking any further investigations or treating AB it was not his area of expertise. A 2018 scan was obtained which Dr Nair reviewed but maintained his recommendation that a report from a neurosurgeon was obtained to confirm that hydrocephalus was not contributing to AB&#8217;s presentation. A further opinion was sought from Mr Mitchell, Consultant Neurosurgeon. He confirmed if the hydrocephalus was treated it would not change or improve AB&#8217;s position.

They have described AB as being active throughout her life, as an extraordinarily great mother who loved her boys, the matriarch of the family who gave advice, tried to bring people back together, was outgoing, loved being around people and was social.  AB has been reported as being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">funny, bold, loved being around people, very strong, strong work ethic, loving, caring and [with an] infectious laugh.</span>&#8221;, she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">family-orientated, funny [a] happy person, worked every day, active&#8230;&#8221; and </span>&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">funny, cheeky, strong, independent, amazing</span>.&#8221;</p>

Both Dr D and Dr Nair agree AB is in a MCS minus, with a number of pre-existing medical conditions. Her existence is one of total dependence requiring 24 hour nurse led care. Among her medical needs she has a long term sacral sore which she is being carefully treated for; she has a tracheostomy which requires suctioning every 3 &#8211; 4 hours, sometimes more frequently, and a PEG which requires daily care to prevent infection. There is some evidence to suggest that she may experience some pain although Dr D puts it no higher than a possibility due to the extent of her brain damage. However, the evidence points towards the logistics of being able to care for AB becoming increasingly difficult, for example the need for increased suctioning, the increasing difficulty in managing the monthly change of her tracheostomy due to the tightening of her neck muscles and the increasing difficulty in managing her splint regimen.</span></p>

Dr D said in his statement </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8216;The nature of this distress is difficult to characterise in terms of its nature, intensity, and &#8216;moment to moment&#8217; recall of that experience.&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:11pt">As regards pleasure Dr D considered that the smiling that is reported is likely to be an involuntary movement without any meaning.</span></p>

Those burdens are, in my judgment, likely to get worse. I agree with the submissions of the Official Solicitor that AB now has little or no quality of life. Her life expectancy is inherently unpredictable, even with the high quality of care she is receiving and she is exposed to an increasing number of unpleasant, uncomfortable and undignified experiences through the level of nursing care that is required to keep her alive. AB&#8217;s Article 2, 3 and 8 EHCR rights have been upheld by the RHN&#8217;s adherence to the RCP PDOC Guidelines and the external review by Dr Nair and Mr Mitchell. The Article 8 rights of AB&#8217;s family have been protected through their full participation in these proceedings. </span></p>
