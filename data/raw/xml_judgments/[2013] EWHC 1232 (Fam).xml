	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principle<span style="font-weight:bold"/>that the marital acquest (i.e. the wealth generated by the parties&#8217; joint efforts during the marriage) should, on divorce, be split equally between them is now both uncontroversial and normally the starting point for determination of financial remedy proceedings, at least in so far as they involve the distribution of capital assets. However, the actual process of achieving that equal split can, in all but straightforward cases, be fraught with complex argument even when, as in this case, the parties have managed by sensible negotiation to agree the percentages, values and precise distribution of almost all of the major existing and future assets.</p>

And they agree about the destination of all but one of the important assets and many of the less important ones. There remain however 6 issues about which they cannot agree and where the court is required to adjudicate. They are:</p>

I had available thirteen lever arch files of documents (mercifully and practically reduced to a core bundle). I also heard oral evidence from the parties and one forensic accountant. Both parties were palpably honest witnesses doing their best to recall past events and trying to be reasonable to the other side&#8217;s case consistent with advocating their own. I found the husband&#8217;s recall was however a little more reliable. In addition I had written (and oral) arguments of the highest quality both at the beginning and end of the case. And many schedules from both sides.</p>

The husband is now almost 57. He describes himself as a &#8216;fund manager&#8217;. He is a Partner of MaisonBlau Capital Partners (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">MaisonBlau</span>&#8221;), a prominent Private Equity Investment house where he has worked for almost 30 years &#8211; i.e. since before the marriage.</p>

The marriage broke down in the late summer of 2010 from which time the parties had separate bedrooms, and in November of that year the husband left the matrimonial home. This is therefore a marriage of just over 20 years, although preceded by a period of cohabitation extending it, for these purposes, by two years.</p>

She is in her second year at St Augustine&#8217;s.

At the outset of the hearing there was a separate dispute about the value (if any) to be ascribed to the planning potential uplift on the Primrose Hill property if the basement was to be developed. However the husband, very sensibly, abandoned that point having heard the wife&#8217;s evidence and an early judicial hint. The valuation of planning gain is even more speculative than usual and to have gone down that route would have, I think, been a step too far.</p>

I shall work from the husband&#8217;s only because I find it a little clearer. The total, as I say, is a few pounds short of &#163;40 million for the presently available assets. On the basis that the husband keeps Falkirk Castle and I accept his valuation for the yacht (and I ignore the cars) equality is achieved by the payment of a lump sum to the wife of &#163;5.35 million or &#163;5.89 if she receives her share of the Ermine Street/Escher loan money now. If the wife keeps Falkirk (at her lower valuation) the equivalent figure for the lump sum is &#163;3.093 million.</p>

For the past three years his <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">post tax</span> income has been between just under &#163;3million and &#163;3.7m per annum. At one time he was talking of retirement but he has now abandoned that idea. Although nobody has ever suggested that this (or for that matter any) huge earning capacity can or should be valued as such, it is, I think, in all fairness, a factor in the equation. This is an inalienable ability to continue to amass huge wealth way above the husband&#8217;s strict need for income. Although the deployment of the ability would post date the separation, the ability, was nevertheless largely acquired and honed during the marriage. In other words he keeps the money making engine and, in fairness, in this case at least, it cannot just be ignored, in my judgment.</p>

The documents make it clear that they have worked on that assumption until the wife relatively recently, and as she candidly admits, changed her mind. She was never pressurised into her earlier position but I accept that it was in the immediate aftermath of the separation and she was not thinking very clearly about her long term future. On the basis of the agreed assumption the husband has cared for the place and visited it when he can, consistent with the demands of his work and the other leisure activities attendant upon owning the Verbier chalet and the yacht. To deprive him of it now without good reason seems to me unfair. What the parties once <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">agreed</span> was fair is more likely to be as fair as any decision to the contrary now imposed by the court;</p>

The other lesser assets do not signify so much to either side. The wife says she has to keep the former matrimonial home because of her parental duties but for whatever reason it is by far the most valuable piece of real property and the one the parties have owned longest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I hope I have done justice to both side&#8217;s ingenious arguments. Huge efforts were expended on the husband&#8217;s side to demonstrate how much time and which periods of time were involved in the generation of these very valuable assets both before and after the parties&#8217; separation. The arguments were reduced to a chart entitled &#8220;MaisonBlau Funds Timeline&#8221; which was the husband&#8217;s attempt to display graphically his arguments. It was, in my judgment, and on any view, a conscientious attempt to be fair to the wife as he saw it. Of course the wife refutes it because she says this is about more than merely analysing the problem temporally. The product of the husband&#8217;s efforts is from a continuum which stretches back into the marriage (especially if the important fundraising part of the process is fully included) and forward into the future. As I say dozens of pages of fascinating and at times somewhat abstruse evidence and written argument have been devoted to this aspect of the case. I have weighed it fully.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Fairness is what I am trying to achieve and both sides make sound points. Fairness (the somewhat diluted offspring of justice) is not just about arithmetic and precision of calculation but a broad recognition by the court, after considering all the factors, of the value of the claimant&#8217;s (in this case the wife&#8217;s role) in the whole marital partnership;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The industry standard/general rule that the date of trial is the date when both the categorisation of the pot and its value is assessed, should not easily be circumvented. The proposition that merely because an asset comes into existence after the date of separation it should be excluded is far too simplistic and is not appropriate when, as here, a respondent&#8217;s efforts are merely a seamless continuum of similar pre-separation activity and there is no obvious delay in the proceedings. It is as if the husband is banking his surplus income during the time between separation and trial;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">There is no absolutely right or wrong answer or methodology to be applied in this situation. To achieve fairness it is necessary to recognise fully the tension between the fact that the wealth was in part generated by the use of expertise built up during the marriage and in part by the expenditure of effort after the separation. Both elements are important. I do not think this part of the case can be analysed precisely either by reference to the time involved in each phase of the process and/or its relative importance. It is a product of both to some extent. But I make the general observation that the further into the future, post separation, the asset is created or achieves ascertainable value the less, it seems to me, it can be sensibly categorised as &#8220;matrimonial&#8221;. Beyond that drilling down into the deepest subterranean springs of the arguments adds nothing to the achievement of fairness;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">There is a distinction between the co-investment funds and the carried interests. The former are in the nature of capital saved out of annual income. The latter is in the nature of a bonus for effort earned for generating a super profit and is only ascertainable at the very end of the investment management process. Further, in this case there is a distinction to be drawn between the three funds;</p>

In both these funds the hurdle rate is yet to be achieved and so in each case the carry has not yet been earned and is presently of nil value;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the end, weighing all the arguments (and not forgetting the disparity in their earning capacities as explained above) I consider the fair outcome is for the wife to have 50% of all the co-investments (including cash and the undistributed escrow funds) in all three funds as at the date of trial. On the wife&#8217;s projections that should amount to some &#163;5 million approximately;</p>

But so far as Fund C is concerned, the carry may not be established or ascertained ever or at least for many, many years and so her entitlement to share in it is, I consider, miniscule. In any event in so far as she may have some small entitlement to a share in the carry of that fund I have, as suggested by Mr Marks QC, taken it into account in the shares in the other two funds;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the parties are to be applauded for achieving agreement on many of the major issues and certainly cannot be criticised for the disagreement over the apportionment of the MaisonBlau funds, a mild rebuke is justified over their approach to the lesser assets. The small differences (as a proportion of the pot) in the value of the yacht, the approach to cars, the credit cards etc, etc does not merit the time (and costs) spent on them. As the rules now make clear, <span style="font-weight:bold">proportionality</span> is the name of the game when costs are so high and court time is more and more at a premium. A much more rigorous approach to case management (especially in the field of the employment of experts) is being introduced in other areas of the family justice system to save precious time and money. This type of high value litigation cannot expect to be immune and parties to it can expect to be confronted more and more by a refusal by the court to participate in these disputes over the lesser assets and where in each case the difference is around 1% of the net value of the pot or less. Assets falling in this category should be bundled up together and an overall value for them all agreed. If not the court is itself likely to apply that system in a broad, even rough and ready, way. As Mr Marks QC observes the pursuit of precise accuracy is a spurious and vain endeavour where the figures are in most cases derived from professional valuations and opinion and assets are not being sold anyway.</p>

The extent to which part of that should be paid to each of them directly whilst at university is, I am sure, something the parties can and should agree at the time depending on the circumstances then existing but in the absence of agreement not less than 30% should be paid to the wife.</p>
