Whilst initially it was thought that she was the victim of a tragic  cot death, subsequent enquiries revealed extensive multiple injuries.  Her parents, the mother and E were arrested on suspicion of murder on 19/6/18 and remanded in custody.  A local authority issued care proceedings in respect of J. Since those events, until the days following my judgment of 23/6/20, he has lived with family friends.  To be clear therefore, he was in their care from 12/6/18 to 25/6/20.  Since the end of June 2020, he has lived in a house provided by his mother, cared for currently by his grandmother.  Going forward there is no dispute that he should remain living in the same house, cared for by his mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">Before turning to the live issues, it is worth recording some of the history of the proceedings.  Originally the fact-finding hearing was scheduled to be heard over several weeks over the summer of 2019.  Although the local authority objected, I decided,  having regard to the many difficult issues and the proximity of the murder trial that the hearing should be vacated to await the verdict of the jury.  In the criminal proceedings psychological reports prepared on the mother persuaded the prosecution to offer no evidence against her;  she was formally acquitted (an aspect with which the Local Authority evidently struggled) and gave evidence in the trial.  E was convicted by the jury and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years.  As I record in more detail in the Judgment of 16/12/19, the mother&#8217;s reactions (immediately post death and later) were really quite remarkable, even bizarre; a question arose as to whether those reactions were a result of the mother&#8217;s very unusual personality features and disorder, or whether they might be evidence of knowledge of E&#8217;s past, he having previously received a substantial sentence of imprisonment (9 years) for similar offences.  An important aspect which requires public scrutiny is how a man like E with a clear history of serious violence towards children can disappear off the radar and offend again  (I should mention that he had also been investigated on another occasion for different child related allegations which had not proceeded).  An important and central question arose as to the mother&#8217;s knowledge of E&#8217;s past, whilst the mother had spoken about his previous incarceration, she claimed not to have known the detail (as E to the contrary claimed). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">The redrafted Threshold Triggers were not helpfully drafted or particularised (especially in relation to paragraphs 9 and 10 in relation to E&#8217;s behaviour and conviction).

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">baby, as though somehow that justified the total absence of any evaluative reasoning to the sought particulars.  The local authority contended that the mother was minimising, dissembling and misleading the Court in relation to E, both in relation to his past and with regard to  his behaviours generally.  Within the papers there were a significant number of evidential contradictions and inconsistencies which might well  have formed the basis for such contentions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">Obviously the only safe way to proceed was to have a satisfactory and secure factual basis, identifying past events.  At that hearing the local authority was unable to identify or particularise relevant passages in the medical evidence (which might have supported the bald assertions being made). It became clear also that notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s acquittal in October 2019, for the local authority nothing had changed since their original contentions in March 2019.  I made it as plain as I could, that whilst it was obviously open to the local authority to argue its contentions, for example, did the mother know of the quality of the conviction? Did she know that it put herself, her children, possibly other children at risk?  Was each occurrence of injury to H evident?  Should she have known?  Did she notice and not act?  All those, and may other questions and contentions obviously arose. These were serious allegations which might well be central to the determination of the case and required proper identification.  I ordered the local authority to particularise their threshold document, making an order that they must do so by 14.1.20.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">In common with the local authority, J&#8217;s foster carers as early as July 2018, held  very strong views about the mother; in particular  that she had known the detail, or some of the detail of E&#8217;s past.  That was especially evident when it became known at the end of September 2019 that the mother was to be acquitted; they were frustrated, angry, and disappointed and considered that the mother &#8220;had got away with it&#8221;.  Additionally, they made it clear that they would no longer be putting themselves forward as long term carers for J (a fact which whilst known to the social worker was not disclosed to J, the parties or Court until very much later).

What they do record is a very clear mindset as to the culpability of the mother.  It is, I have finally concluded, the mindset of the local authority which lies at the root of the very serious failings which have occurred in this case.  Allowing for the very great pressure on the social worker, both on appointment and when she gave evidence (knowing that she would be subjected to very sustained and fundamental criticism), I was struck by how little she had applied herself to this case or given herself an opportunity to even properly read the case files.  Her early visits  on 22 July 2019 and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>September 2019 were framed by her almost total  lack of focus or enquiry.  Quite simply she was not on top of the case and was not therefore in any position to think anything through, let along give it a proper analysis.  Contrary to what is submitted to me  by the local authority, what she discovered at the meeting on 30 September 2019 from the foster carers in respect of their approach ,  could not have been made clearer.  To suggest that what she was being told by them was somehow an emotional blip, an exceptional reaction (not worthy of disclosure) illustrates how little grip she had on the case.  All the early failings are sought to be explained by not giving the case (any) proper attention. </p>

Even with all of these events  having taken place, the Authority sought to put forward the foster carers for the final hearing in March 2020 as long term carers of J, who were &#8220;able to prioritise his needs and had his welfare at the heart of their actions.&#8221; When  the  Covid-19 pandemic struck, the conduct of the foster carers became even more transparent, not least because the male foster carer became responsible for  the organisation and supervision of contact , and  had little truck  in  trying to dress up his thoughts or actions as being somehow in J&#8217;s best interests.

The Assistant Director&#8217;s statement is with respect a clear example of that.

If someone had bothered to create a chronology the significant deficits might have been revealed. What is crystal clear however, is that the overwhelming evidence existed in fact even on the face of papers, and was simply ignored (the more surprising because  the mother&#8217;s case  identified and clearly set out the situation on the ground for J as she saw it), that is that the foster carer were influencing J&#8217;s wishes and feelings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">It must surely have been clear to the social worker on 15 November 2019 that the female carer, 6 weeks later, presumably having had that time to calm down, was still saying she was not putting herself forward. Also, in my view, it is inconceivable that the carer did not tell the social worker on 15 November 2019 that she did not want J to know she was not putting herself forward as his long-term carer. The social worker&#8217;s note of 15 November 2019 has never been produced notwithstanding a number of requests and a court direction to produce it. I am driven to the conclusion that  the social worker at best simply acquiesced  in the carer&#8217;s view and did not tell J </p>

The first inkling was through the CG&#8217;s note of her meeting with J on 7 January 2020. It was that note which led to the request for disclosure of the foster care records. It is apparent from the foster care records that both arms of the local authority very clearly knew of the shocking and unsuitable  environment that J had been living in and not only failed to disclose it, but somehow chose to ignore it in their position taken  at the final hearing on 9 March 2020.  </p>

Yet  the parties and the Court were not told. Indeed, when the plan for the foster carers simply to &#8216;be around in the background&#8217; was presented to the Court on 25 March 2020 it was not explained that this was at  their behest. For a further two months the foster carers dictated the terms, and it seems that the social worker  was powerless to effect any change in J&#8217;s best interests. None of this emerged however until 22 May 2020, despite two further hearings taking place in between. </p>

The oral evidence of the social worker, together with the supporting documents conclusively demonstrate that the views of the foster carers , and the  obvious  risks flowing from them ,were not &#8216;obscured&#8217; by the fostering team, they were only too clearly &#8220; known &#8220;to the children&#8217;s team, who inexplicably chose to ignore them.
