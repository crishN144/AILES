In my view, it is right that B remains involved in those discussions and, for the short delay it will cause, C&#8217;s proceedings ought not be concluded in advance of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July.

Before I do so, I make the observation that the Court would have been assisted greatly in this case by the production of a chronology. It is exactly this type of case, involving specific issues, being raised on specific dates, over a significant period of time, where plans have changed, that a chronology dating back pre-proceedings would have been extremely helpful. As it is, I have pieced together the chronology from the various different pieces of evidence I have in the papers. As I have done so, I have applied the civil standard in my determination of that factual background and have applied the relevant legal principles, to which I will return.</p>

Although some time ago, it is clear to me that her passing had a significant impact upon her. The mother was already experiencing difficulties in school, reporting physical bullying and general unhappiness. She was diagnosed as being dyslexic, but the issues were only compounded by lengthy absences from school and home moves, due to the bullying. However, when her nana died it appears that her unhappiness grew. She would later say to the psychologist instructed in this case:</p>

Although their relationship only lasted 6 months, the mother fell pregnant and she gave birth to C in January 2016, when the mother was 20 years old. Although there are difficulties reported within the relationship, both during and after separation, it appears from the evidence that I have before me that there were no issues being raised in respect of any deterioration on the mother&#8217;s mental health or her ability to meet C&#8217;s day-to-day needs. The only Local Authority involvement seems to be in respect of an incident between her and B, which resulted in C falling out of her pram. Nothing I have read suggests that the local authority was raising concerns at that point in respect of the mother&#8217;s care of C.</p>

As she started that process, D was in her care. However, as the days went by, she told me that she had made arrangements for D to be looked after by the MGM. Although she thought that the overdose process would take 7 days, she ended up telling the social worker and her family action worker what she was doing. She was taken to hospital but shortly discharged home because the amount of medication she had taken was not life threatening and had merely made her unwell.</p>

It is important to note that there is evidence of positive change, including the mother no longer using substances for a prolonged period and the reports that she has positively engaged with the local authority throughout this time. I would note, however, that the independent social worker report indicates a period of stability in relation to the mother&#8217;s mental health for a period of approximately one-year and that the difficulties that led to her being under a mental health section, had been cumulative following a number of stresses&#8230; it is important to emphasise that the mother&#8217;s difficulties are longer-term. Indeed, based on the mother&#8217;s own self-report and the information in the case documents that were made available to me at the time of the initial assessment, the mother had experienced significant difficulties from adolescence, which included body dysmorphia and a number of overdose attempts as a teenager, with information in the case documents indicating that the mother had been diagnosed with a personality disorder a number of years ago, and that these problems had continued over a pervasive and sustained period.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I move on to the independent social worker&#8217;s evidence, it is important for me to note that the concerns around the mother&#8217;s lack of engagement comes from evidence filed from a Senior Community Psychiatric Nurse at Stockton Treatment and Intervention Team, situated at Wessex House. In that report dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2024, I am informed of the difficulties that the mother initially faced upon entering Roseberry Park in early June 2023. Those difficulties included showing paranoid delusions and behaviour with hyper vigilance of her surrounding environment. It is noted that the mother was using illicit substances prior to admission but that she remained abstinent from substances and started to make improvements. Upon discharge from Roseberry Park, she remained involved with the team until she was discharged from secondary mental health services on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2024. When she was discharged there were no concerns being expressed about the mother&#8217;s presentation and she remained stable with her mental state, continuing to take medication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, an offer was made by Wessex House for behavioural activation in advance of the possibility of engaging with CBT work. Despite multiple attempts to engage the mother in undertaking that work, the service says that the mother did not engage in attending appointments. She was therefore discharged from their psychological team due to non-engagement. It is not clear to me at what point in the chronology that the mother did not engage with that process. The mother tells me from the witness box that it was at a time when she had understood the LA plan was D&#8217;s placement with MGM. The Local Authority say that at the point of non-engagement, the mother was already aware that adoption was a potential plan for D at the time. I have heard evidence from the social worker as to the attempts made to try to get the mother to engage with services. However, following the change of plan, I am aware that the mother has made some attempts to engage in CBT with IMPACT. Again, there is some confusion in the papers as to what has happened in respect of that referral. The social worker final evidence dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2024 suggests that the mother is on a waiting list for CBT, but enquiries made by Ms Sinclair indicated that she may not have been. At the point of this final hearing, I am told that the mother has been referred and is awaiting a start date.</p>

However, she reflected upon the progress that the mother had made since her decline in early June 2023 and her engagement with professionals involved with her mental health, if not specific courses, since that time. Ms Sinclair was reminded in cross-examination that the mother&#8217;s mental health seems to have been stable but that it has been at a time when neither child has been in her care. Ms Sinclair again reflected that it could not be said that significant stressors were still not in play; for example, the removal of D into foster care, a change of plan to one of adoption and the ending of a romantic relationship during the proceedings. </p>

The latter is pleaded within the welfare findings sought, as the mother being inconsistent in her ability to provide emotional warmth. The social worker was able to point to a number of examples within the evidence to support that concern. Under cross-examination, the social worker accepted that the mother had, for a significant period of time within the proceedings, been suggesting that her contact could be separated or managed differently. The social worker told me that consideration had been given to how the contact might be managed, including separating out the siblings contact with the mother However, I was told that there is a long waiting list for family time and the resources were not available to allow contact between, for example, D only and the mother to take place.

As the mother told me in evidence, and as she told Mr Marshall, the incident with C had occurred first. She agreed for C to stay with B, albeit she is clear to me in her evidence that she did not consider it was to be long-term. It was after that when the mother started to take medication over a number of days before finally telling the social worker what she had done. As I have already indicated, the LA case on the chronology is unclear and I prefer the evidence from the mother.

If there were a decline in the mother&#8217;s mental health or she became distressed following an accumulation of difficulties, she may not be in a position to adequately meet D&#8217;s needs and may prioritise her own needs and act impulsively because of her own emotional crisis.</p>

Mr Marshall quite properly identifies long-term issues that the mother has, which require further work. He expresses a view as to the risk of the children being exposed to the mother&#8217;s presentations. But that does not equate to the children being at risk of significant emotional harm, as submitted by the local authority. I keep in mind the following aspects of the evidential picture:</p>

I make clear that I am mindful that the mother is likely to have been significantly impacted by the circumstances of H&#8217;s death in February 2022, but the issues raised by Mr Marshall are couched as &#8220;longitudinal&#8221; issues which had existed long before May 2023 and had resulted in her diagnosis when she was 18/19 years old.</p>

A plan could be put in place, involving wider services, whereby the mother could reach out and obtain support if she needed it. Whilst I do not mean to minimise the stresses of raising a child, I am drawn back to the fact that there has now been over a year whereby the mother has accessed support and assistance, through professional services, maternal grandmother and her close friends, and has not been impacted by way of a significant deterioration in her mental health.</p>

The concern is that the mother&#8217;s poor mental health may impact negatively upon D, not just now but throughout his life. There is a real concern that the mother has not seemed motivated previously to engage in therapeutic intervention when offered, and that those issues identified by Mr Marshall around the mother&#8217;s presentations, and inability to prioritise a child in her care, particularly at points of crisis, would remain unresolved.</p>

Adoption would allow D to build long-term and enduring relationships with a new family, the benefits of which would stay with him throughout his life.  He would have a family life free from the intrusion of the State.  There would be an element of normality to everyday family life.

It would mean that contact with his mother would stop.  The relationship between D and his mother would be severed in law and in fact.  He would lose the benefit of the natural affection and love that his birth mother and wider birth family, could provide.

I also acknowledge Mr Marshall&#8217;s view that there is an ongoing risk that the mother may present as inconsistent in recognising and responding to D&#8217;s emotional needs, if he were in her care.</p>

Despite the clear and understandable concerns raised by Mr Marshall, and echoed by the Local Authority and Children&#8217;s Guardian, I remind myself that this mother appears to have been able to adequately care for these children up until the incidents in May/June 2023. I am also reminded that this mother has successfully engaged with mental health services, both during her time in Roseberry Park and thereafter, without any concern being raised in respect of a significant deterioration in her mental health.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I lay the realistic options for D side by side and consider their respective pros and cons in the context of the 2002 Act Welfare checklist, I am led to the conclusion that the local authority plan for D is neither necessary nor proportionate to meet the risk of harm associated with D remaining in the care of his mother.</p>

As I consider the option of an adjournment, alongside that analysis, I am not satisfied that the option of adjourning the proceedings for a period of time is either necessary or proportionate. In my view, an adjournment would achieve little when my analysis concludes that D can be rehabilitated back into the care of his mother on the basis of the evidence already before the Court.</p>

Regardless as to the parties agreement, I confirm that I have undertaken my own welfare analysis, incorporating the 1989 Act Welfare Checklist, and am also satisfied that a plan of placement with B will meet C&#8217;s welfare needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Acknowledging as I do, the risks associated with a plan of rehabilitation, it is my view that all must be done to ensure that a plan of rehabilitation is successful. In my view, a rehabilitation support plan ought to be prepared to identify how the mother will be supported, be it through professional support, agency support or family support. It should set out what referrals have been made and what referrals will be made including for CBT, parenting work and counselling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered the role that maternal grandmother is able to play in supporting the mother. I have been told by the mother that she sees the maternal grandmother as a significant emotional support. Indeed, in my view it is likely that the absence of a significant deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health has been positively impacted by the support provided by the maternal grandmother over the last year. I can see how the maternal grandmother may be in a position to provide not only that emotional support, but also practical support moving forward. </p>

Despite the arguments put forward on her behalf by counsel, highlighting the positive progress the maternal grandmother has made to address the risk of harm to J, as identified by DJ Lalas, I am not persuaded that the maternal grandmother&#8217;s contact with either D or C ought to move to unsupervised contact. It is my view that there will need to be an assessment undertaken by the local authority to ensure that it is safe to progress in that way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But that does not mean that the risks identified by the Court in respect of J, mean that the maternal grandmother cannot play a practical support role for the mother. For example, I have asked myself what the risk would be to D of the maternal grandmother attending at the mother&#8217;s home to practically assist her or to let the mother have rest, whilst maternal grandmother looks after D. In my view, the risk of D being exposed to the type of harm identified by exposure to the maternal grandmother&#8217;s inappropriate relationship, and dishonesty about that relationship, is low. In my view, it is that type of support which ought to be clearly set out within a support plan.</p>

In my assessment of risk of harm, I have identified the continuing risk of harm, specific to C, as a result of inappropriate conversations and comments being made in contact. Much is about to change for this mother. I have already set out my concerns in respect of her ability to understand and reflect upon how things said in contact may negatively impact upon C. There will need to be a plan as to how news of D&#8217;s rehabilitation to the mother&#8217;s care will be managed with C. Great care will need to be taken in contact between the mother and C to ensure that C is not negatively impacted by that news. Until the mother has been able to complete parenting work around inappropriate comments/conversations, there is an immediate need for the mother&#8217;s contact with C to remain supervised.</p>

I invite the local authority to accept the Court&#8217;s analysis of risk and formulate a support plan to include those elements I have set out above.
