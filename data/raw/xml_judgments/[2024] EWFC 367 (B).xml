	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with SL, who was born on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023.  She is currently in foster care.  This is the local authority's application for a final care order and a placement order.  To summarise the history of this matter, the major issues relate to the parents' relationship, which was one which featured domestic abuse, and substance and alcohol misuse, which, along with the parents' dysfunctional relationship, has been present for a long time.  I note that there was non-engagement initially with the pre-birth assessment and pre-proceedings, and at the outset the local authority were not proposing that any further assessments should take place.</p>

To be fair, he has been in prison, which I will return to, and his position at this stage is primarily focusing upon supporting the mother.</p>

Father also suffers from poor mental health, which again could impact on his ability to meet the child's holistic needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, the concern is that any child placed in the parents' care would be neglected, as evidenced by the pre-birth assessment and the fact, of course, that when the child was born, the child did show signs of withdrawal with regard to Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.  </p>

Father's hair strand test similarly shows usage of cocaine, heroin and cannabis, and excessive alcohol.  The local authority maintain that the issues in relation to alcohol and substance misuse therefore remain.  </p>

	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority's case is that the mother is at the very early stages of engagement with services and needs to show a significant period of sustained changes, given the longstanding issues that these parents have, and hence the plan is that of a single track for adoption which is supported by the agency decision maker and the independent reviewing officer.  </p>

	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In essence, the local authority maintain that the combined risks associated with the parents can be summarised as a concerning criminal history; chaotic and unstable lifestyle; poor mental health characterised by difficulties in managing their emotions; and substance and alcohol misuse.  The local authority are concerned that the mother does not have the ability to make and sustain the necessary changes within the timescales of their child and the prognosis is uncertain.  Mother&#8217;s support network is also limited.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of those options?  The advantage of course, with a child who is now effectively eight months old, is that matters are concluded and a placement can be made, hopefully, in the near future to determine their forever family.  If I do not conclude it today, that will not happen, but potentially it opens the door to a possible rehabilitation with the mother's care.</p>

Sustained change, in my view, needs to be for a significantly longer period when judged on the history in this case.</p>

There has to be an audit trail of sustained growth and change which is subject to the rigours of life and tested over a longer period.  As I have indicated, that position has yet to be reached, and I do not believe it is likely to be reached in as little period as three months.  The Guardian's submissions in relation to that, I am afraid ring true.  </p>

Everybody makes mistakes.  The future will be determined by the actions that these parents take from now on forwards, and I wish them all the very best.  They have got engaged.  Father has had, he said, a wake-up call in relation to going to prison.  Mother has started her journey.  If they carry on with that trajectory, which I hope they will, the future (it may not seem it at this moment in time) I hope will be a lot brighter and they will look back at these proceedings as effectively a turning point itself.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MR CRUMPTON:  Sorry, judge &#8211; one point from me if I may.  In terms of the hair strand testing, where there is a dispute between the mother of the scientific testing, am I right in understanding that you accept the scientific testing?</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">JUDGE PARKER:  I have seen no evidence put forward to suggest the scientific evidence is invalid for any reason.  I note the mother says her hair grows at different levels, but of course, my decision is not based solely upon hair strand tests.  We know, on mother's own admission, that she is still drinking; that she had a relapse in December 2024; however, just because a parent misuses substances or indeed misuses alcohol does not necessarily strike them out automatically, however, there are wider issues in this case which are longstanding.  Accordingly, it is a combination of a number of factors for which the parents have only just started the road to recovery, but at this stage it is not sufficient in the child's timescales to enable me to agree to a further period of testing.</p>
