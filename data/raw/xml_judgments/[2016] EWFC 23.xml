This was a second marriage for both.  The parties were married in 1997, and the marriage effectively broke down after 17 years in late 2014.  The wife left and the husband remained in the former matrimonial home, where he remains.  In December 2014 the husband issued a petition for divorce and in the following month issued an application for financial relief.  That latter application proceeded through the conventional stages of the process (albeit not without some difficulties caused by non-compliance with directions), including a Financial Dispute Resolution Appointment (August 2015), before being listed on 3 December 2015.  At the final hearing, the wife was represented by solicitors and counsel (Miss Whittaker, who has ably represented the wife again today) but the husband was not represented.</span></p>

The principal order was the sale &#8220;forthwith&#8221; of the former matrimonial home, with 60% of the net proceeds of sale being paid to the wife.  Otherwise, the District Judge ordered a clean break in respect of all other forms of financial relief, including pension.

It is illuminating to note that following the judgment, Miss Whittaker contemplated the possibility of the husband vacating the property &#8220;within the next 14 to 21 days&#8221; but did not pursue this only because &#8220;there would be nobody there to look after the animals and that would not be fair&#8221;.   The District Judge indicates the need for the parties to &#8220;both arrange re-housing and move on &#8230; &#8216;get closure&#8217;&#8221;.  The judge goes on to indicate that &#8220;the order I will make in relation to the contents is&#8230;.that if the [husband] by 4pm on 10 December pays the [wife] and the [wife] receives cleared funds for the sum of &#163;1,879, then ownership of the items &#8230;.passes to the [husband]&#8221;; he added (addressing the husband directly) &#8220;if you do not [pay the sum] then [the wife] can buy them from you, paying the same sum&#8230; by the end of the year&#8221;.

The need to set aside the earlier order made by DJ Heppell has become, for reasons which I hope I have sufficiently elaborated, unavoidable; given the husband&#8217;s dissatisfaction (whether justified or not, I have not investigated) with the substance of the order itself, this is as good an outcome as he could possibly have achieved had he been represented.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This, I recognise, is a depressing outcome for both parties, who are now returned to the place they were in shortly before the final hearing in December 2015.    It is I recognise particularly frustrating for the wife who, perhaps with justification, considers that the husband has taken steps along the way to frustrate the process.  I agree with Ms Whittaker that this outcome appears to militate against the fundamental objective of disposing of cases justly, fairly and with an eye to their cost.  A return for a re-hearing feels disproportionate, and I am conscious that it is undoubtedly profoundly unwelcome to the wife.  I trust that the case can nonetheless be listed swiftly, and with minimal further preparation. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I propose to remit the case back to a District Judge (but not DJ Heppell given that there remains the husband&#8217;s unresolved application for permission to appeal against the earlier order) for re-hearing.  I shall give directions myself in order to ensure that the relevant up-to-date material is before the court for that hearing, and shall take steps to achieve an early hearing date.   There is now no disagreement about the sale of the property in principle; at least it appears that the issues may therefore have narrowed. </span></p>
