	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case before this court is one arising out of care proceedings brought by the London Borough of Lambeth (the local authority) concerning 4 children, SV (a girl) born on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2002 who is 12 years and 7 months old, JP (a boy) born 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2003 who recently had his 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, TR (a girl) born 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2010 who is 4 years and 3 months old and TY (a girl) born 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014 who is now just 7 months old (they are the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>-8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Respondents respectively). The children all have the same father (the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Respondent - SE). The two older children have different mothers JO and KP, respectively. The whereabouts of JO remain unknown despite attempts by the local authority to locate her and she has played no part in these proceedings. KP (J&#8217;s mother) has been represented throughout but she has had a limited role in the applications before me which related solely to issues of jurisdiction in respect of the youngest two, Tr and Ty whose mother is a Nigerian citizen and who, it is accepted, is habitually resident in Nigeria. The question arises as to the jurisdiction of this court to hear proceedings regarding Tr and Ty. If they are not habitually resident (although present) in England and Wales does the court have jurisdiction to hear and decide matters regarding their placement and welfare?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children all have connections with Nigeria and England as their father (E) came to live in the UK from Nigeria in 1999. The two older children SV and JP were born in England and have always lived here; there is no dispute that they are habitually resident in this jurisdiction. The youngest two have a mother (the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Respondent D) a Nigerian national who resides mainly in Nigeria. D and E were married in Nigeria in 2008 and remain married. They see their family as consisting of themselves, as parents, and the four children as their children.  Tr was born here and has lived with her mother in Nigeria for the greater part of her short life, Ty was born here shortly after the public law proceedings commenced and she has never been to Nigeria. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2nd April 2014 D&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the Nigerian High Commission regarding her case and the order of the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014 recorded that the High Commission would respond by the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014. There was, apparently, no response from the High Commission. When the question of jurisdiction was raised again Her Honour Judge Cox ordered (on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2014) that the local authority and D&#8217;s solicitors file correspondence with the High Commission with the court. On the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September Mr Justice Baker ordered that local authority liaise with the Nigerian High Commission and ordered that the court order should be disclosed to the High Commission and that they be invited to respond. When the case first came before me on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 there had been no response from the High Commission so the court ordered that further documents could be disclosed (provided that a named person had responsibility for the case) and that a further letter was to be sent to the Nigerian High Commission setting out the issues before the court in respect of jurisdiction and inviting them to respond and/or attend court to make representations. The High Commission was informed of the date of the IRH which was the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014. The High Commission did not attend the IRH nor was there any correspondence received from them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The High Commission attended the hearing on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October and were represented by Mr. Emeka Pipi. The court did not allow the three week adjournment which counsel sought as the fact finding and final hearing was due to take place during that time period which concerned all four children and the considerable delay which would be caused by adjourning that hearing would manifestly not be in the children&#8217;s interests. Moreover it would have caused a delay in the possible return to Nigeria of D accompanied by Tr and Ty; to have acceded to such an application would not have been proportionate to the needs of the parties, the allocation of court resources and the costs involved. The court was able, with the assistance of counsel, to list the matter for an extra day on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014, to provide additional time for leading counsel to be instructed and make submissions on the question of jurisdiction. Counsel for the High Commission set out their preliminary position that Nigeria sought the &#8220;return of the children to Nigeria&#8221; as it wished to stand by its nationals, the mother and children being Nigerian and she their primary carer.</p>

Whether the court has jurisdiction to continue to conduct a fact finding hearing in respect of those two children and make interim or other orders concerning them. Whether if the court lacks substantive jurisdiction the court can still conduct fact finding. Whether there is any alternate jurisdiction based on nationality, the inherent jurisdiction or some other factor. In essence what the court is being asked to decide is whether it has substantive or temporary and protective jurisdiction in respect of the two youngest children. </p>

The local authority plan is that Tr and Ty remain in their mother&#8217;s care and return to Nigeria with her. D has agreed, whatever the decision of the court, to remain in this jurisdiction and in the mother and baby placement until the conclusion of the fact finding and final hearing which starts next Monday, 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2014. She will give evidence at that hearing in respect of the allegations made by JP and Tr as to her excessive physical chastisement of S, JP and Tr which will allow fact finding to take place and for consideration of the future care and placement of all four siblings. This court does, however, have to conduct limited fact finding in respect of the habitual residence of the two youngest children.</p>

I hope I do no disservice to the highly competent and thorough skeleton arguments advanced by each party by setting their positions out in brief here. All agree that Council Regulation 2201/2003 (BIIR or the Regulation) applies in respect of jurisdiction in public law cases in England and Wales. Following the Supreme Court decisions of <span style="font-style:italic">Re I (A Child) (Contact Application: Jurisdiction)</span>[2009] UKSC 10, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] AC 319" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] AC 319</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (Children: Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/60" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 60</ref>, and by virtue of the amendments to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>, the Regulation applies to jurisdictional issues between England and Wales and non-Member States, in this case Nigeria.  Through counsel D strongly asserts that this court does not have substantive jurisdiction under Article 8 in respect of Tr because Tr is habitually resident in Nigeria. It is conceded that as a baby born in England who has never lived in or been to Nigeria, the situation in respect of Ty&#8217;s habitual residence is not so clear, however it is not conceded that the court has any residual or other jurisdiction either under Art 13 or Art 20. On behalf of E Mr Setright QC took a more neutral and pragmatic approach to the points of law, which the court found of considerable assistance. </p>

It was their case that such a reference in this case would be disproportionate, not least, as there are alternative routes to deal with Ty&#8217;s situation under Article 13 as she was and is present in the jurisdiction and the local authority further argued that the court retained provisional jurisdiction under Article 20 to continue to take provisional, protective measures. </p>

Alternatively it was argued that she had no habitual residence such was the transient nature of her presence in each jurisdiction and the court had jurisdiction under Article 13 (presence). On behalf of the children it was argued that if the court found that there was no jurisdiction under Articles 8 or 13 then a residual jurisdiction could be determined under Article 14 by applying the law of England and Wales, the common law or inherent jurisdiction and based on the children&#8217;s nationality. The children&#8217;s representatives had obtained expert advice that Tr had British nationality which was based on information about her father&#8217;s immigration status supplied by him which proved to be false, a matter to which I shall return. It was submitted that Ty was not habitually resident in Nigeria and was either habitually resident in the UK or had no habitual residence and, if the latter, there is jurisdiction by virtue of the baby&#8217;s presence in the jurisdiction and/or jurisdiction to take protective measures. It was also argued that the court may have residual jurisdiction under Article 14 as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span>based on her nationality. </p>

I heard from both parents and I found their evidence to be largely unconvincing, self-serving and contradictory; I shall return to this later. D&#8217;s statement of evidence in support of her contention that Tr is habitually resident in Nigeria was barely three pages long and lacking in detail about Tr&#8217;s life and integration into a social and family life in Nigeria. I have no sense of her home, her daily life and who cares for her when her mother is working and at college. E&#8217;s statement of evidence was even shorter, not quite two pages long and bereft of detail as to his role in Tr's life and that of her older half siblings. Yet both parents assured me that theirs is a family unit and a united family and that D was mother to all the children. I was told that they had, in significant part, decided to have children so that SV and JP could experience having younger siblings introduced into the family and that SV in particular would enjoy having a baby join her family.  </p>

D says that she travelled to the UK in June 2006 and spent &#8220;some time&#8221; with E, SV and JP.  In late 2007 E travelled to Nigeria with JP. D and E had a traditional marriage in early in 2008 during this visit. I was told by them in oral evidence that they saw D as being the new mother to the children and the family unit. D and E have described their marriage as perfect and family life in similarly glowing terms, but, again there is been little by way of detail or description of their family life, their home and the relationships of the children with their parents or each other.

It is not necessary to set the histories of the 2 older children out in detail. SV (who is 12 years old) has been described by her social worker (statement of Jocelyn Cruywagen dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014) as having significant and severe learning difficulties, as a result of chromosome abnormality, developmental delay, rethrognathia, impaired vision and no speech. She is a very vulnerable child who despite her difficulties is able to communicate and participate in activities at home and at school. JP is now 11. He has had behavioural difficulties which, in the opinion of the expert psychologist instructed in the proceedings, have arisen as a result of instability in his up-bringing. There is no dispute that the older two SV and JP are habitually resident in England and that the court has jurisdiction to hear any application in respect of their future placement and welfare.</p>

I was told that the return time varied but that as she was brought back by bus which had to go on a round trip to drop off other children it was often at 5 although she finished at school in the early afternoon some time after 2. D told the court that she has two sisters who live with her but it was not clear how much of the time they were there and what role they played in Tr's life as one was said to be at a residential school and another had been undertaking her national service. D&#8217;s father was also said to live in the flat, but, again the details are not clear as he also spends time in his home town when he stays with D&#8217;s married sisters. D said that in-laws, who were not identified, come round, mostly to bring food. Before Tr was in nursery and if the nursery is on holiday her mother takes her to college or to work with her and would intend do the same with Ty.</p>

Equally I accept that D intended to return in the future, with the two children, to spend time with their father and siblings in the family unit. Having heard from D I find it most unlikely that she allowed herself to be misunderstood by anyone interviewing her and therefore, it seems to be more likely than not that she and Tr lived on their own for the greater part of their time in Ibadan as set out in D&#8217;s written evidence.

He told the court that of D&#8217;s two younger sisters one lives at college and the other had just finished National Service and had been away for a year, which corroborates what D had said in her written evidence. He was untroubled, indeed laughed, at the thought of Tr being on a bus for up to three hours a day after nursery and said there were escorts on the bus employed by the school. Neither parent gave any details of who else was on the bus with Tr for most of the afternoon.</p>

He had made arrangements to see the GP who advised against travel as the pregnancy was in an advanced stage. Having said there were complications he changed his evidence and said that there was a subsequent visit to King&#8217;s College Hospital and that there was an infection that &#8220;might need antibiotics&#8221;; it was not a complication. This was in direct contradiction to his statement (dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 predating his oral evidence by 6 days) which said &#8220;Tr then travelled to the UK with [D] on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014 for the birth of Ty. There was never any intention for them to reside in the UK but to return to Nigeria following the birth of Ty. This is evidenced by the booked return tickets to Nigeria.&#8221; There was no mention in his statement of any discussion with D during which, he told me in oral evidence, he had told D she could go back subject to medical advice. I reject his oral evidence in respect of D&#8217;s intentions.</p>

He told the court that the family unit has a home in London and a home in Nigeria and that both apply. E said he could travel to the USA on his British passport (having been naturalised as a British citizen in 2013) but he was not thinking of leaving London. I accept that he intends to remain in the UK and that his two youngest children will continue to spend time with him here. He wants SV and JP to return home and the family unit to be reunited. E told me they would see Tr and Ty and his wife as often as they could afford it. </p>

Jurisdiction is ultimately a matter for the court and not for the parties. Secondly, the President has emphasized the need for judges to be alert to the question of jurisdiction. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re E </span>(paragraph [36]) and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F </span>(at paragraph [11 v)]) he reiterated the need for judges to be pro-active in considering jurisdiction and expanded on the need for the court to grasp the question of jurisdiction and set out in its judgment and order the basis on which it has accepted or rejected jurisdiction in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulation. He went further and said it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">necessary to demonstrate that the court actually addressed the issue and to identify, so there is no room for argument, the precise basis upon which the court has proceeded:</span>&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Habitual Residence: Tr.</span> Tr is four years old and her family live in two different places Nigeria and London. She has close familial ties and relations in both jurisdictions. Her parents remain married and are not separated in that sense and I am told that they see the family as a unit with the parents being parents to all four siblings who, in turn, are encouraged by their parents to regard each other as siblings. She knows her father is her father and that he lives in London and she has a home here with him and her siblings. The family unit which both parents are clearly committed to, and set great store by, straddles both countries but its core is in London. She has extended paternal family here, her aunts who she knows and with whom she has spent time in London. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In Nigeria she has had what seems to have been an isolated existence living with her mother and spending a great deal of her time either at nursery or travelling to and from nursery. She has a close attachment to D and has spent the greatest amount of time in her short life with her mother in Nigeria. But there is more to integration than time spent in one location or another. There was not evidence before this court of the family being centred on Ibadan, rather it was centred on London where the family exists and even as a small child Tr will be aware of being part of that familial entity. A large part of the intention behind travel to London is to maintain the family unit and to make Tr part of that unit. On the evidence before this court based on D&#8217;s account of the time Tr spent in Ibadan there was little or no evidence of Tr being integrated in to family life in Nigeria to the same extent, despite D living and working there. However Tr has been integrated into her nursery school and has spent time with her maternal family in Nigeria, although it is not clear how much she was integrated into that part of her family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The journeys to London, though short in duration and infrequent were more than holidays or mere visits; if the parents were separated or divorced that might be the case but both told this court that theirs is a family which lives in two countries, it is the way they live as a family and that they are together and very close. The time spent in London is time spent at home, for Tr, with her father and siblings; each journey back to Nigeria is anticipation of a further journey to spend time in her London home with her mother, her father, her siblings and her father&#8217;s family. I reject the submissions made on behalf of E that staying with her father as opposed to rented accommodation is of no significance. It is her home. Nor is it like a limited period of what used to be called contact, her parents are happily married and living as a couple when Tr is with them in London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the authorities referred to above I have in mind the Supreme Court cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Re KL (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/75" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 75" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 75</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC (Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/1" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 1" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 1</ref>. From the former I have taken the need to consider the intention behind the time spent in each country and from the latter the need to consider habitual residence from the point of view of the child. Or to borrow a phrase used by counsel for E, habitual residence is child-centric and not centred on the parent. Thus although I consider that family life is centred on London, and that the intention of the parties is that that should continue, from the point of view of a very small child she will have been aware in March 2014 that she lived in two places and has spent a great deal of time in Nigeria with her mother. Tr has now started school in the UK and although that because of the care proceedings I take into account the fact that Tr has said she prefers her school in London to the one in Nigeria (social worker&#8217;s statement dated 17 10 2014). Unsurprisingly Tr who remains in a mother and baby placement with her mother and Ty, wants to be in her mother&#8217;s care in Nigeria. I have reached the conclusion that I cannot determine Tr&#8217;s habitual residence for as can be seen above she has connections with and has been integrated into family and social life in both England and Nigeria.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Habitual Residence: Ty.</span> Ty has never been to Nigeria. While it is true as E said that there are people who live apart in this country and see their children once or twice a year there is a qualitative and evidential difference between separated parents and those who remain committed to their marriage or partnership. Had Ty been placed with her father as well as her mother since she was born in March then it would be a substantial argument for her habitual residence being in the UK. Instead Ty has been with her mother who is habitually resident in Nigeria. I cannot find that she is habitually resident in Nigeria on that basis alone nor that she is habitually resident in the UK on the basis of her presence: not only on the basis or current case law and European jurisprudence. I have found that her parents, both D and E, chose to have her birth take place in London and it is likely that she would be considered to have British nationality as her father is a naturalised British citizen. Moreover I am told by both her parents that the arrangements for her as part of the family would be the same as those for Tr which I have set out above. A new born baby has connections to her family over and above those of her mother and exists within her own social and family environment. Nonetheless in applying the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Mercredi</span> and subsequent authorities I accept that as an infant Ty is dependant on her mother, but also that her current residence in London corresponds to some degree and is in close proximity to her father&#8217;s, and therefore her, social and family environment. It may be taking it too far, factually, to find that she is habitually resident in the UK as she is dependant on her mother as a baby of 7 months, given that the court has accepted her mother&#8217;s habitual residence is Nigeria. This court cannot find she has, at this stage, a habitual residence in either country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to the question of jurisdiction I would like to thank His Excellency, the High Commissioner for Nigeria, for his assistance with this case since he became aware of it last week and instructed counsel to attend court on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October, 2014.  The Nigerian authorities have made this court aware that they intend to put in place protective and safeguarding provisions to enable Tr and Ty to travel to Nigeria and live there with their mother in keeping with the plans of the local authority. From the documents they filed with the court it can be seen the preparations they are making to provide the Family Court with details of the protective and monitoring provisions that they intend to put in place when D takes Ty and Tr to Nigeria are in keeping with the actions of another Member State in similar circumstances and are likely to meet the residual concerns of both the local authority and the guardian.</p>
