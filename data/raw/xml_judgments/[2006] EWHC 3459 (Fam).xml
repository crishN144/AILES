The second defendant, Surrey County Council (&#8220;SCC&#8221;), is the local authority which, since September 2005, has assumed responsibility for DE&#8217;s accommodation and care. </p>

Although there is plainly an overlap between the Convention concept of someone being &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221; and the concept of &#8220;imprisonment&#8221; in the context of the common law tort of false imprisonment, and although, no doubt, in many instances both consequences will flow from the same state of affairs, it is possible for someone to be &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221; within the meaning of Article 5(1) even though we might not hold that he is being &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; for the purposes of the tort.

Not only was the child not mentally ill within the meaning of the 1938 Act, but the Psychiatric Ward at the Hospital was in fact not used for the treatment of patients under the 1938 Act or of patients otherwise suffering from mental illnesses of a psychotic nature. Indeed, the restrictions to which the applicant was subject were no more than the normal requirements for the care of a child of 12 years of age receiving treatment in hospital.

It is the second ground which is relevant for present purposes. In this connection it is revealing that both the argument of the Government of Denmark (at para [71]) and the judgment of the Court (at paras [64], [69], [72] and [73]) laid emphasis upon the fact that what was being done to the applicant was being done at the behest of his mother and in what the Government asserted and the Court accepted was the responsible exercise of her parental rights. Indeed, what seems to have divided the majority and the minority (see at paragraph [29] above) was the question of whether the applicant&#8217;s mother was acting properly in the normal exercise of her parental authority or in abuse of her authority.

Like Judge Gaukur J&#246;rundsson, I find that the circumstances of the present case differ from those in <span style="font-style:italic">Nielsen v Denmark</span>. The factual basis of the latter case was the placement of a 12-year-old boy in the psychiatric ward of a hospital at the request of the mother, who had sole parental rights. Such a situation cannot be compared with the placement of an adult against her will in a nursing home, which was what happened in the present case. The Court considered that the facts in Nielsen amounted to an exercise of parental rights by the mother, not a restriction on freedom of movement by the State. In so far as the Court went on to state that the restriction involved in the child&#8217;s placement in a secure psychiatric ward did not amount to a deprivation of liberty, this statement (which has been subject to certain extra-judicial criticism) is linked to the particular facts and circumstances of that case and, specifically, the fact that the decision to hospitalise the child was taken by the mother in the exercise of her parental rights; <span style="font-style:italic">Nielsen</span> is again clearly distinguishable from the present case.&#8221;</p>

And if beneficent purpose cannot deprive what is manifestly a deprivation of liberty of its character as such, why should a beneficent purpose be of assistance in determining whether some more marginal state of affairs does or does not amount to a deprivation of liberty? No doubt it is some imperfection in my understanding or reasoning, but I confess to having great difficulty in identifying any satisfactory answer to the point made so convincingly by Judge Loucaides.</p>

In my view, this case falls on the wrong side of any reasonable line that can be drawn between what is or what is not imprisonment or detention. The critical facts are as follows. (1) When on 22 July 1979 at the day centre L became agitated and started injuring himself, he was sedated and then physically supported and taken to the hospital. Even before sedation he was unable to express dissent to his removal to hospital. (2) Health care professionals exercised effective power over him. If L had physically resisted, the psychiatrist would immediately have taken steps to ensure his compulsory admission. (3) In hospital staff regularly sedated him. That ensured that he remained tractable. This contrasts with the position when he was with carers: they seldom resorted to medication and then only in minimal doses. (4) The psychiatrist vetoed visits by the carers to L. She did so, as she explained to the carers, in order to ensure that L did not try to leave with them. The psychiatrist told the carers that L would be released only when she, and other health care professionals, deemed it appropriate. (5) While L was not in a locked ward, nurses closely monitored his reactions. Nurses were instructed to keep him under continuous observation and did so.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Counsel &#8230; argued that L was in truth always free not to go to the hospital and subsequently to leave the hospital. This argument stretches credulity to breaking point. The truth is that for entirely bona fide reasons, conceived in the best interests of L, any possible resistance by him was overcome by sedation, by taking him to hospital, and by close supervision of him in hospital. And, if L had shown any sign of wanting to leave, he would have been firmly discouraged by staff and, if necessary, physically prevented from doing so. The suggestion that L was free to go is a fairy tale.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;considerable emphasis was placed by the domestic courts, and by the Government, on the fact that the applicant was compliant and never attempted, or expressed the wish, to leave. The majority of the House of Lords specifically distinguished actual restraint of a person (which would amount to false imprisonment) and restraint which was conditional upon his seeking to leave (which would not constitute false imprisonment). The Court does not consider such a distinction to be of central importance under the Convention. Nor, for the same reason, can the Court accept as determinative the fact relied on by the Government that the regime applied to the applicant (as a compliant incapacitated patient) did not materially differ from that applied to a person who had the capacity to consent to hospital treatment, neither objecting to their admission to hospital. The Court reiterates that the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of Convention protection for the single reason that he may have given himself up to be taken into detention (see <span style="font-style:italic">De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v Belgium </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1971) 1 EHRR 373" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">(1971) 1 EHRR 373</ref> at paras [64]-[65]), especially when it is not disputed that that person is legally incapable of consenting to, or disagreeing with, the proposed action.&#8221;</p>

On 22 July 1997, following a further incident of violent behaviour and self-harm at his day-care centre, the applicant was sedated before being brought to the hospital and subsequently to the IBU, in the latter case supported by two persons. His responsible medical officer (Dr M) indicated clearly that, had the applicant resisted admission or subsequently tried to leave, she would have prevented him from doing so and would have considered his involuntarily committal under section 3 of the 1983 Act. Indeed, as soon as the Court of Appeal indicated that his appeal would be allowed, he was compulsorily detained under the 1983 Act. The correspondence between the applicant&#8217;s carers and Dr M reflects both the carers&#8217; wish to have the applicant immediately released to their care and, equally, the clear intention of Dr M and the other relevant health care professionals to exercise strict control over his assessment, treatment, contacts and, notably, movement and residence; the applicant would only be released from the hospital to the care of Mr and Mrs E as and when those professionals considered it appropriate. While the Government suggested that &#8220;there was some evidence&#8221; that the applicant had not been denied access to his carers, it is clear from the above-noted correspondence that the applicant&#8217;s contact with his carers was directed and controlled by the hospital, his carers not visiting him after his admission until 2 November 1997.</p>

A person can only be considered to have been deprived of his or her liberty if, as an additional subjective element, he or she has not validly consented to the confinement in question.

Therefore, she was considered to have the capacity to consent or object to her admission and treatment in hospital. It is undisputed that she did not sign the clinic&#8217;s admission form prepared on the day of her arrival. It is true that she came to the clinic herself, accompanied by her father. However, the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of the Convention protection for the single reason that he may have given himself up to be taken into detention. </p>

She had to be shackled in order to prevent her from absconding and had to be brought back to the clinic by the police when she managed to escape on one occasion. Under these circumstances, the Court is unable to discern any factual basis for the assumption that the applicant &#8211; presuming that she had the capacity to consent &#8211; agreed to her continued stay in the clinic. In the alternative, assuming that the applicant was no longer capable of consenting following her treatment with strong medication, she cannot, in any event, be considered to have validly agreed to her stay in the clinic.&#8221;</p>

That case concerned the confinement of an individual who was of the requisite age but lacked the capacity to consent in a psychiatric institution which he had never attempted to leave; the Court found that there had been a deprivation of liberty. In the present case, a fortiori, it must be concluded that there was a deprivation of liberty. The applicant&#8217;s lack of consent must also be regarded as the decisive feature distinguishing the present case from the case of <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span>, in which it was held that the placing of an elderly person in a foster home to ensure the necessary medical care had not amounted to a deprivation of liberty. However, the applicant in that case, who had been legally capable of expressing a view, had been undecided as to whether or not she wanted to stay in the nursing home.

(It was common ground that the Tribunal only has the power to discharge a patient from detention and to impose conditions upon discharge.

In fact (see para [19]) the actual question for the court was rather narrower, for it was conceded that, as the full detail of the measures contemplated by the Tribunal&#8217;s conditions was as yet unknown, the challenge on this ground could succeed only if it could be demonstrated that the implementation of the conditions would &#8220;inevitably&#8221; involve PH&#8217;s continued detention.

As for the requirement that he be escorted when outside the home, this, according to the witness statement, was imposed so as to facilitate rather than inhibit his freedom. The Tribunal was aware that he had not lived in the outside world for many years and there were concerns that he would become disorientated or would find it difficult to cope with such things as traffic and the value of money, especially since decimalisation.&#8221;</p>

Condition 3 is sufficiently broadly phrased as to allow for measures which would fall short of such a deprivation, and both it (where it deals with security) and condition 4 have as their purpose the protection of PH himself and would therefore be in his interests. I should add that there is some evidence to indicate that, in at least one care home, the staffing arrangements would be such as to enable PH to go out with an escort whenever he chose to do so. On this principal issue, therefore, I conclude that the conditions would not involve his transfer from one state of detention to another state of detention.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In arriving at that conclusion the Court of Appeal considered the Strasbourg jurisprudence. In a well-known passage at paras [14]-[17] Keene LJ summarised the relevant principles:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[14]<marker name="tab"/>There is little dispute about the principles established in the Strasbourg jurisprudence as applicable to the interpretation of Article 5(1). First, a basic distinction is to be drawn between mere restrictions on liberty of movement and the deprivation of liberty. The former are governed by Article 2 of Protocol no. 4 and do not amount to a breach of Article 5.  This has been repeatedly spelt out by the European Court of Human Rights in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi v Italy</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1980) 3 EHRR 333" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">(1980) 3 EHRR 333</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Ashingdane v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1985) 7 EHRR 528" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">(1985) 7 EHRR 528</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2002) 38 EHRR 314" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">(2002) 38 EHRR 314</ref>.</p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[15]<marker name="tab"/>Secondly, the distinction is one merely of degree or intensity of restrictions, not of nature or substance. Thirdly, the court must start with the concrete or actual situation of the individual concerned and take account of a range of criteria, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. Fourthly, account must be taken of the cumulative effect of the various restrictions. All these principles flow from the cases cited above.</p>
		    </content>
		  </level>
		  <paragraph>
		    <intro>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[16]<marker name="tab"/>Fifthly, the purpose of any measures of restriction is a relevant consideration. If the measures are taken principally in the interests of the individual who is being restricted, they may well be regarded as not amounting to a deprivation of liberty and so no breach of Article 5(1) would arise. This principle can be seen in two Strasbourg decisions. In <span style="font-style:italic">Nielsen v Denmark</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1988) 11 EHRR 175" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">(1988) 11 EHRR 175</ref> a child of about 12 was placed in a hospital psychiatric ward for children as a result of a decision by his mother, based upon medical advice. He claimed that there had been a breach of his Article 5 rights, but the European Court of Human Rights found that the objective of his hospitalisation was the protection of his health. The restrictions imposed were not in principle different from those obtaining in many hospital wards where children with physical disorders were treated. It was concluded that this regime did not amount to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 but was:</p>

		    <subparagraph>
		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;a responsible exercise by his mother of her custodial rights in the interests of the child&#8221; &#8211; para 73.</p>
		      </content>
		    </subparagraph>
		    <wrapUp>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[17]<marker name="tab"/>The second decision illustrating this principle is perhaps of greater relevance to the present appeal. In <span style="font-style:italic">HM v Switzerland</span> the applicant was a woman who at the age of 84 had been placed compulsorily in a foster home. The Court found that she had been placed there by the Swiss authorities in her own interests in order to provide her with necessary medical care and satisfactory living conditions and hygiene. In those circumstances the Court concluded, citing the <span style="font-style:italic">Nielsen</span> case, that her placement did not amount to a deprivation of liberty within Article 5(1), but was a responsible measure taken by the competent authorities in the applicant&#8217;s interests. Therefore, there was no violation of Article 5(1).&#8221;</p>

He is disorientated and needs assistance with all the activities of daily living. He needs a guide when walking. Although he suffers from dementia he is able to express his wishes and feelings with some clarity and force, though expert evidence suggests that he has a psychological dependence on others which is greater than that arising from his physical disabilities, so there is room for debate as to just how genuinely independent his expressions of wish actually are. Although this is a matter for final determination at the hearing in January 2007, the available evidence strongly suggests that DE lacks the capacity to decide where he should live. Indeed, as we have seen, Judge Bloom has already made an interim declaration to that effect.</p>

This has been described in witness statements by, respectively, Ms Jean Hills, SCC&#8217;s team manager, and Ms Lisa Soper, the manager of the Y home. So far as it goes their account is not challenged by anyone.</p>

The front door was operated by pushing a button on the wall to release the door. Ms Hills comments that, given his disabilities, DE would have been unlikely to have been able to find the exit doors and open them without assistance. </p>

Due to his visual and cognitive impairments, he does not feel safe doing this. He has unfettered access to the communal garden, the dining room, the lounge area and any other resident&#8217;s room. He is able to use the telephone when he wants. It is situated in the front hall. He can also use the telephone in my office when it is busy. However, the reality is that [DE] is unable, due to his needs, to remember a number and dial it himself. He tends not to ask to make phone calls. Instead staff prompt him to make phone calls for example when his wife is in hospital. He is contacted regularly by both his daughter and his wife.</p>

If service users wish to go out generally they ask the staff and we enter the code. This system was installed not to stop service users from leaving, but following an incident in another Surrey home where people were able to enter and exit the building without staff knowledge. [JE] was pleased when this system was installed as she voiced concerns previously that people were free to enter the building as they liked. This system was only installed in or around February [2006], prior to this service users were free to enter or exit the building without asking/informing staff.&#8221;</p>

She says she was frightened by this and therefore has not attempted to remove DE and take him home. (Ms Richards comments that JE&#8217;s interpretation of the letter accords with its natural meaning.) When JE tried to take him out on 7 December 2005 &#8220;I was told in clear terms that I was not allowed to remove [DE] from [the Y home].&#8221; She has understood that to be the position ever since.

(Although that is the phrase used in the skeleton argument, Ms Morris in her oral submissions explicitly disavowed any suggestion that there had been any change of policy or approach on the part of SCC.) I think in the circumstances that I should set it out in full because it is put before me as being an accurate statement of the facts and not merely an advocate&#8217;s submission:</p>

[SCC] will therefore continue to make arrangements to accommodate [DE] at [the Y home] and does not propose to facilitate a move to [DE] residing with [JE].</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Should [JE] remove [DE] from the home, neither [SCC] nor the home will physically prevent her. [SCC] and the home will, however, remind [JE] of the terms of the interim declaration in these proceedings and attempt to persuade [DE] and [JE] that he should not leave. If [JE] is abusive to [DE] or he appears not to want to leave, or if there is some disturbance or some other good reason relating to [DE]&#8217;s condition as to why he should not leave, then the police will be called. It is accepted, however, that the police will not be able to prevent [JE] from removing [DE].</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There are absolutely no restrictions on [DE]&#8217;s contacts with [JE] at [the Y home]. Indeed [SCC] facilitates contact by meeting some of [JE]&#8217;s travel costs for her visits to [DE]. Nor are there restrictions on [DE]&#8217;s contact with [JE] outside [th Y home], save that she should not take him far from his home at [the Y home], there should be an estimated time of return, and [JE] should be sufficiently well to ensure his safety; ideally the trip should be planned so a member of staff should be available to be called out to assist them if needed. [SCC] considers that contact should not be at [JE]&#8217;s home because of the risks to him. As with all vulnerable persons, [SCC] would not agree to [JE] taking [DE] on a visit away from the home if she were not reasonably settled and calm and able to protect [DE]. It would be desirable that any outing be local and planned so that they may be suitably supported by a member of staff to ensure [DE]&#8217;s safety. However, if [JE] decided to remove [DE] without these arrangements, then [SCC] could not physically prevent her. If the police were summoned, they might act to prevent an assault or breach of the peace, or once away from the home, if [DE] were in danger, the police could be asked to exercise their powers under section 136 of the MHA.</p>

Dr Jefferys observed the wide range matters over which, having regard to the circumstances, [DE] was able to exercise a choice and his autonomy. In particular, [DE] has regular contact with his daughter which they both enjoy. She is supportive of his placement at [the Y home].&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But the crucial question in this case, as it seems to me, is not so much whether (and, if so, to what extent) DE&#8217;s freedom or liberty was or is curtailed <span style="font-style:italic">within</span> the institutional setting. The fundamental issue in this case, in my judgment, is whether DE was deprived of his liberty to leave the X home and whether DE has been and is deprived of his liberty to leave the Y home. And when I refer to leaving the X home and the Y home, I do not mean leaving for the purpose of some trip or outing approved by SCC or by those managing the institution; I mean leaving in the sense of removing himself permanently in order to live where and with whom he chooses, specifically removing himself to live at home with JE. </p>

And I agree with them when they submit that DE was not and is not &#8216;free to leave&#8217;, and was and is, in that sense, completely under the control of SCC, because, as Ms Richards put it, it was and is SCC who decides the essential matters of where DE can live, whether he can leave and whether he can be with JE.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one other point to be made before I return to examine the evidence. A person can be &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221;, indeed detained in the fullest and most complete sense of the word, even though his departure from the place of detention is not prevented by a locked door or by any other physical barrier. After all, a Category A prisoner detained in a maximum-security closed prison and a Category C prisoner detained in an open prison are both equally &#8220;deprived of their liberty&#8221;, even though there is nothing more keeping the Category C prisoner in than a rule that he must not pass beyond a line drawn on a plan, a notice attached to a tree warning him that he must go no further and the threat of recapture if he leaves without permission. So the fact that there is no perimeter security at the Y home, and the fact that DE can walk out at any time merely by operating a key-pad (assuming he is able to do so) is not determinative of the question whether he is nonetheless being &#8220;deprived of his liberty.&#8221; As the Strasbourg court made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2004) 40 EHRR 761" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">(2004) 40 EHRR 761</ref> at para [92], whether a patient is kept in &#8216;locked&#8217; or &#8216;open&#8217; conditions is not determinative.</p>

Moreover, it is also apparent that SCC understood the common law doctrine of necessity as being something that &#8220;could be used to keep [DE] at [the X home]&#8221; and something indeed that &#8220;will be used to maintain [DE]&#8217;s placement&#8221; there (paragraph [92(iii)]), as being something that &#8220;could be used to prevent&#8221; JE removing DE (paragraphs [92(iii)] and [92(iv)]), and as something meaning that DE&#8217;s &#8220;wishes can be overridden in his best interests&#8221; (paragraph [97(v)]).</p>

The fact is that DE has repeatedly expressed his wish to be living at home with JE and has made it clear that he is in the Y home, as previously the X home, &#8220;against his will.&#8221; It is suggested by SCC that he would not have been prevented from leaving had he actually tried to. That, in my judgment, simply will not wash. In the first place, the assertion simply does not accord with the historical reality as noted in contemporaneous records. Secondly, and in any event, as Ms Richards points out, this was never communicated to either DE or JE. On the contrary, the &#8216;message&#8217; consistently given to them was understood by them, and reasonably and unsurprisingly understood by them, as being to precisely the opposite effect: the Police would be called in order to foil any attempt to take DE back home.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Morris takes a number of points in her ultimately vain attempt to escape this conclusion. She suggests that DE&#8217;s repeated statements of his wishes were, in significant measure, more the product of JE&#8217;s urgings rather than of his own true wishes and feelings. Even if that were so, I do not see how it would affect the outcome, for even if DE had capacity (which is extremely doubtful) there could, in the light of what he was undoubtedly saying, be no sensible basis for any inference that he was consenting to his confinement. And in any event, Dr Jefferys expressed the view (see paragraph [91] above) that DE&#8217;s stated wish to be with JE &#8220;appears to be deeply held and consistent.&#8221; Secondly, she submits that SCC has no objection in principle to DE living elsewhere than at the Y home, for instance either with his daughter or in some other residential establishment. That may be, but it wholly fails to meet the charge that he is being &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221; by being prevented from returning to live where <span style="font-style:italic">he </span>wants and with those <span style="font-style:italic">he </span>chooses to live with, in other words at home and with JE. And that, after all, as Ms Morris herself has to concede, is the very thing that SCC &#8220;will not agree&#8221; (see paragraph [104(iv)] above). Thirdly, she submits that the Police would not in fact have had any power to prevent DE being removed, unless, for example there was a breach of the peace or some criminal offence being committed. This, I have to say, is little better than a piece of legal sophistry, and in large measure <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto </span>legal sophistry at that. It is quite plain that SCC&#8217;s purpose in repeatedly making it clear (both to the institutions and to JE) that the Police would and should be called was to prevent DE being removed and, as it was explained on 14 December 2005 (see paragraph [97(i)] above), to facilitate his being returned if he was in fact removed. That, as I have already said, was how JE reasonably and unsurprisingly understood what she was being told by SCC. These threats, whether or not they were as devoid of legal content as SCC would now have us believe, were intended to achieve and, as it seems to me, did achieve, the desired objective of preventing DE&#8217;s removal first from the X home and then from the Y home. A person can be as effectively &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221; by the misuse or misrepresentation of even non-existent authority as by locked doors and physical barriers. In my judgment, none of Ms Morris&#8217;s points has any substance. </p>

The simple reality is that DE will be permitted to leave the institution in which SCC has placed him and be released to the care of JE only as and when &#8211; if ever; probably never &#8211; SCC considers it appropriate. SCC&#8217;s motives may be of the purest, but in my judgment, SCC has been and is continuing to deprive DE of his liberty.</p>
