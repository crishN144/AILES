	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by the Local Authority, the City and County of Swansea to extend a Reporting Restriction Order that I made initially on 11th March 2013.  An earlier version of that Order had been made by me on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 following an out-of-hours application by the Local Authority.  The Local Authority was concerned that some details of the case were about to be reported on ITV Wales. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My original order severely restricts media reporting of criminal proceedings instituted against XZ, the First Respondent, who is the Mother of the surviving children with whom I am concerned.  Indeed, it really only enables the media to report the charges she faces with reference to her identity being limited to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a woman from the Swansea area</span>&#8221;.  The order was to continue until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although the media was served with notice of the March 2013 application, it is right to note that the media was not represented before me and no substantive opposition was made to the order at that point.  I did not, therefore, hear full argument.  I was satisfied that, prima facie, the Local Authority was entitled to its order but made detailed directions for the trial of the issue should the media subsequently decide to challenge it.  I am quite satisfied that the fact that the media did not originally challenge the order is of no relevance to the issues which I now have to decide.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Mother was originally charged with two counts, namely the murder of her baby daughter, AZ (Child A) in August 2006 and grievous bodily harm with intent against her baby BZ (Child B) in November 2007.  Medical reports have since been obtained as to the Mother&#8217;s mental health at the time of the alleged offences.  Following production of those reports, the Mother pleaded guilty on 16th December 2013 to the infanticide of AZ and the wounding of BZ.  The Court (Wyn Williams J) and the CPS accepted the pleas.  The Mother is due to be sentenced on 13th February 2014.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority applied on 3rd January 2014 to extend my order notwithstanding the conclusion of the criminal trial.  It appeared at first that it was seeking an indefinite extension.  It has since, quite properly, been made clear that the extension sought is until the youngest of the children attains the age of 18.  The Local Authority&#8217;s application is supported by the Mother, the Father and the Guardian on behalf of the children.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At first, the position of the media organisations was to oppose the grant of anonymity to the Mother.  At that stage, the organisations did not have the full papers in the case available.  An application was made to me last week for permission to serve the full papers on them.  I granted the application as soon as it came to my attention but I consider that it was not a satisfactory situation.  I take the clear view that, in any case where a Reporting Restriction Order is applied for, the Applicant should immediately serve all evidence on which it relies on any media organisation that requests it, provided  the organisation has been served with notice of the application either directly or through Copy Direct. It is not necessary for the organisation to intervene formally to obtain the documents as I accept Ms Gallagher&#8217;s submission that it is very difficult for the media to know whether to intervene or not until it has seen the evidence.  The media is, of course, subject to the normal requirements for confidentiality.  It follows that there is no need to obtain permission to let them see those documents.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Once the media organisations had seen the full evidence on which the Local Authority relied, they changed their position to accept the need for anonymity in the quite exceptional circumstances of this particular case.  They did so solely as a result of the need to protect the welfare of the surviving children.  As I will explain in detail in due course, I make it clear that I am completely satisfied that this was the correct and responsible position for the media organisations to adopt.  It was a very welcome concession to make, for which all parties indicated their gratitude during the hearing.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It does, however, mean that the ambit of the dispute narrowed very considerably.  In essence, the only area on which I now have to rule is the extent of the restrictions necessary to ensure that the children are not identified notwithstanding the order for anonymity.  There is, of course, very considerable law as to when it is appropriate to grant a Reporting Restriction Order.  I will briefly outline the law in due course but I make it clear at this stage that the only restrictions on publication that are justified are those that are required to prevent identification of the children.  In this case, this inevitably means that the identity of the Mother cannot be reported either as to do so would itself inevitably lead to the identification of the children.  However, in every other respect, the media should be free to report.  I propose at the end of this judgment to make clear a number of matters that are not restricted by my order.  Indeed, as the hearing progressed, the differences between the parties narrowed considerably, with both sides of the argument making sensible and appropriate concessions.  </p>

It is not possible, nor necessary, for me to do more than give a relatively short overview of what has happened which will be necessarily restricted in my open judgement by the need to protect the identity of the children.</p>

There were two opposing curved arcades of greying bruising on her right thigh and left thigh and a faint grey bruise across the centre of her forehead.

He said that the reports of the care given by the parents to the other children had been uniformly positive.  He found, on the balance of probabilities, that both AZ and BZ had been the victims of non-accidental injury.  In particular, they had been the victims of shaking or shaking/impact.  Neither parent had been prepared to give him a truthful account in the witness box.  The Mother had been under immense strain and had a history of depressive illness.  She was not coping.  Although both parents fell under suspicion, he found that it was more likely than not that it was the Mother who had inflicted the injuries, having been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">overborne by the weight of her general plight</span>.&#8221; The Judge did not believe the Father had witnessed the incidents but he had obfuscated the truth in an attempt to cover up for the Mother.      </p>

In April 2009, the Mother indicated that she was pregnant again.  Her mother then died, which caused her yet further distress.  She then started to make admissions to Mrs Price, an Independent Social Worker.  Dr Holt subsequently changed his recommendation to adoption.  The Father then proposed that the Mother should move out of the family home and he should care for the children alone.  Wood J rejected this plan and found that the threshold criteria were made out in relation to the children.  The Court of Appeal allowed the parents&#8217; appeal and approved the plan for assessment of the Father as sole carer.  </p>

In March 2010, two of the children briefly moved from foster care to live with the Father.  The Mother was to have no unauthorised contact with the children but, within the first week, the children said they had seen their Mother.  The Local Authority therefore changed its care plans to propose adoption.  Charles J found that there had been clear and deliberate breaches of the agreement for the Mother to have no unauthorised contact but refused to approve the care plans proposing adoption and directed that a fresh rehabilitation plan be implemented.  The children were returned a second time in January 2011.  The intention was that, in due course, the Mother would return to the family home but it appears that her mental health, which had been much better, deteriorated again.  </p>

By 11th March 2013, it was clear that, despite the criminal charges, her mental health had not deteriorated.  I therefore directed that those children should return to live with her on 19th March.

These reports have been accepted by the Crown leading to the guilty pleas already outlined.  It is, of course, a matter entirely for the trial judge as to what sentence is passed.  I have been told that the Probation Report recommends a non-custodial sentence.  I am also told that custodial sentences following a plea of infanticide are virtually unheard of.  </p>

These events happened as a result of the actions of their Mother, who they love so much.  None of this was in any way their responsibility yet they are the ones who would now suffer the most.  They would have to move home and school.  They would lose their friends and all that is familiar to them.  They would have to change their identities.

The mother had been driven out of her home by abuse and harassment when it became known that she was HIV positive.  There was concern that publicity would lead to general outcry at the children&#8217;s nursery and that other families would either refuse to use the facilities or intimidate the family until they were prevented from attending themselves.  Potential foster carers would be put off by the reputation of the children.  It was not the knowledge of the criminal proceedings against the mother that would cause the harm but the assumption that the children were infected.

Lord Rodger of Earlsferry JSC, giving the judgment of the court, adds that the possibility of abuse is therefore simply one factor to be taken into account when considering whether an anonymity order is a proportionate restriction on press freedom. </p>
