He was diagnosed with a &#8220;simple motor tic&#8221; in [a year]. The tics are involuntary. There was no detailed explanation for any of the bruises which Dr Cardwell considers were caused at different times although again father latterly blamed his tics.</span></p>

The radiological appearances of the fracture are non-specific with regard to the exact mechanism of causation. The same fracture pattern could occur from an accidental or inflicted injury.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The fracture is the result of significant force applied to the bone. The amount of force required to cause this fracture is unknown, but in his opinion, it is significant, excessive and greater than that used in the normal care and handling of a child.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">This fracture would not occur from normal domestic handling, over-exuberant play or rough inexperienced parenting.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">At the time that the fracture occurred, R was less than x months of age and she would not have had the strength or level of development to self-inflict this injury.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">At the time the fracture occurred, he would expect that R would have been in pain and shown signs of distress which would have lasted for some moments. Following this initial distress, the signs and symptoms related to this fracture could have been variable and he would defer to the paediatricians in all aspects of clinical presentation, both at the time that the fracture occurred and subsequently.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">To cause any fracture requires both a suitable mechanism and a significant level of force.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Rib fractures are typically the result of severe excessive squeezing compressive force applied to the chest. The amount of force required to cause these fractures is unknown, but in my opinion, it is significant. For example, in life-saving cardiac massage where the chest is forcibly compressed by one third of its diameter, rib fractures very rarely occur.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Alternatively, an isolated rib fracture could occur from a direct blow or impact at the fracture site. From the radiological appearances, I am unable to determine whether the posterior right 9th rib fracture is the result of squeezing compressive force or a direct blow/impact.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">He confirmed that in his opinion none of the explanations proffered by the parents in relation to R being injured throwing herself forward and being stopped to prevent her from falling, being in her pram and  jolted when her father had a tic, breastfeeding, lifting her up into the air and down again would generate sufficient force to cause the rib fracture.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">He opined that if R was being held during a tic and her chest was squeezed then this could potentially create a suitable mechanism to cause the rib fracture but he was unable to determine the amount of force which these tics could generate and would defer to a neurologist/other suitable medical expert with regard to the likelihood of these tics being a possible cause of the rib fracture. He considered that it would be helpful to know whether or not the level of involuntary movement of the father&#8217;s hands during a tic would be severe enough to compress R&#8217;s chest by one third of its diameter in order to determine the likelihood of this action being a possible cause of the rib injury.</span></p>

He was standing and had R lying against his chest, right hand shoulder side with his right arm across her back (R effectively being held in the crook of his elbow). When he demonstrated how the twitch occurred his shoulder tensed inwards, the bicep clenched and became rigid, his wrist curled up and the hand clenched. The strength was quite severe, he estimated it lasted about 2-3 seconds. He said that R cried out in pain, at a higher level than she was crying before and it lasted for 15-20 minutes. Dr Johnson queried whether the level of force demonstrated was the same as applied at the time of the broken rib and father confirmed it was less in the demonstration and then attempted to demonstrate further.</span></p>

There then followed further questions about bruising and Dr Ameen&#8217;s knowledge of the same within a sustained cross examination and Dr Ameen was accused of exceeding his remit, Mr Gorton for the father suggesting that he should defer to the paediatric expert. Dr Ameen refused to do so and confirmed that he was fully capable of speaking about bruises from his own surgical knowledge and experience. I note that Dr Ameen has been a surgeon for 38 years and as such appears more than capable to offer an opinion relating to bruises &#8211; there is no rule that says that only paediatricians can have an opinion on bruising. In any event, counsel was actually cross-examining Dr Ameen about possible causes for the bruises at the time, it seems unusual to question a witness about something and then argue that they are not qualified to offer an opinion.</span></p>

Dr Johnson confirmed that the action in the video did not indicate a significant level of force such to cause a rib fracture. Dr Ameen and Dr Cardwell agreed. The rib fracture was the result of a single episode of significant force or trauma, not the effect of compound effect of multiple episodes of lower force. The force would need to compress the child's chest by about one third of its diameter. When asked by Dr Johnson if Dr Ameen thought the tic would cause such force, Dr Ameen stated that he did not consider that the father&#8217;s tics by themselves would cause the rib fracture, the tics were not so excessive. There would need to be additional forceful compression of the chest wall. He considered that there may have been a misunderstanding with his report; his position was that the tic alone would not be sufficient, force was needed too. Dr Cardwell confirmed that there would not necessarily be bruising with a rib fracture.</span></p>

A pinch would cause redness but not bruising. Dr Cardwell confirmed that the bruises were inflicted injuries but he could not describe the mechanism.

He, however, in his evidence submits that he has suffered significant tics on occasions and so should have been aware that if he did suffer a significant tic whilst handling R, this could potentially hurt her.

First, the burden of proof lies with the local authority. It is the local authority that brings these proceedings and identifies the findings they invite the court to make. Therefore, the burden of proving the allegations rests with the local authority.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Secondly, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (Re B [2008] UKHL 35). If the local authority proves on the balance of probabilities that J has sustained non-accidental injuries inflicted by one of his parents, this court will treat that fact as established and all future decisions concerning his future will be based on that finding. Equally, if the local authority fails to prove that J was injured by one of his parents, the court will disregard the allegation completely. As Lord Hoffmann observed in Re B:</span></p>
      </blockContainer>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">"If a legal rule requires the facts to be proved (a 'fact in issue') a judge must decide whether or not it happened.

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp;L [2005] EWHC 144 (Fam); [2005] 1 FLR 851 per Charles J). Thus, there may be cases, if the medical opinion evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of non-accidental injury, where a judge, having considered all the evidence, reaches the conclusion that is at variance from that reached by the medical experts.</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so (see Re D (Children) [2009] 2 FLR 668, Re SB (Children) [2010] 1 FLR 1161).&#8221;</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith&#8221;.</span></p>

There are many reasons for this which do not denote guilt, for example, fear, shame, loyalty, panic and distress. An innocent person may lie to bolster their case. A lie should never be considered as direct proof of guilt. In criminal proceedings, to be capable of amounting to corroboration a lie must be deliberate, relate to a material issue and be motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The same principle applies here. This point was emphasized again in Re A, B and C (Children) [2021] EWCA Civ 451.</span></p>

It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household.

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their longsuffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. This professional and realistic approach allowed the Court to focus on what was, in reality, the only live issue, namely; was GL's history of violence sufficient to lead to a finding of failure to protect upon the mother's part?&#8221; Similar points were made in G-L-T (Children) [2019] EWCA Civ 717.</span></p>

Having identified the alleged lies in issue, the court must ask itself whether the local authority has proved, on the simple balance of probabilities, that the alleged lie has been told. The court must accordingly seek to distinguish a lie from, for example, &#8220;story creep&#8221;, mistake, confusion, memory failure or distortion arising from impairment. Once the court has undertaken that analysis it moves to consider why the proven (or accepted) lie has been told. This is important because people may lie for many different reasons - embarrassment, a sense of shame for having caused an injury accidentally, a desire to hide some other wrong-doing or a mistaken belief that lying might improve their position. Of course, it is also imperative that the court reminds itself that just because a person lies about one issue, it does not automatically follow that they have lied about everything.

It is clear that he considered that Dr Ameen&#8217;s report could exonerate him from blame but clarification in the professionals meeting and in evidence confirmed that the issue was not necessarily the tics themselves, but added pressure with or without a tic. At the time of the father&#8217;s final statement he, in my judgment, believed that admitting to a very strong tic would be sufficient to explain the injuries, in particular to R&#8217;s rib. </span></p>

In the experts meeting it is clear that Dr Cardwell expected R&#8217;s behaviour to be different following the fracture.</span></p>

Further that the mother, who I consider to be an honest and truthful witness has never seen father tic-ing to such an extent that it could cause injuries or any other bruises or injuries to R over the x-month period from her birth until her removal. If the father was having constant tics and squeezing her as he says now, then it is likely according to Dr Ameen, that she would have had bruises before the [date] which would have been noticed by the mother. I can and do accept that the mother saw only one bruise on around </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">[a date]</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">, and I consider it inconceivable that she missed bruises since R&#8217;s birth. She would have mentioned them as a protective mother, as she mentioned the one bruise on R&#8217;s back to father and to 111. </span></p>

Dr Ameen stated that he would have expected to see more injuries on different days with such tics, not a single injury with bruises around one single period of time. The evidence from father about bathing suggests that R had a bath every 2 days so there would be many opportunities for the mother to note any bruising since birth. She has reported none and I found her to be a truthful witness whose evidence I accepted. She was clearly bewildered by the father&#8217;s admissions but even in her grief sought to be kind to him and not directly seek to blame him in her final submissions. I do not accept that she would have failed to act if she saw regular bruising, she would protect her child as she is clearly a doting and committed mother.</span></p>

I accept her evidence about the shower and swaddling in a towel and not checking for injuries &#8211; it would not be normal to do so when you trust someone as she did the father. Additionally I do not criticise her for not seeking immediate medical attention for a small bruise alone, she did of course mention it to 111.</span></p>

Father willingly accepts the evidence of Dr Johnson and Dr Cardwell which fits with his own final explanation, at least to some extent. Even then, however, whilst there is a mechanism which could have been used to cause the fracture, the issue of force is deferred to Dr Ameen and Dr Cardwell does not accept father&#8217;s explanation for at least some of the bruises. Mr Gorton for father urges me to disregard everything Dr Ameen said after his written report, both at the professionals meeting and in evidence. He has no legitimacy after the report, he stated, Dr Ameen was a &#8220;politician&#8221; who exceeded his authority, did not physically examine the father, dared to express opinions about bruising and his evidence was non-sensical and should be discarded. Despite these alleged misgivings about Dr Ameen, however, it was submitted that it is perfectly fine and acceptable for me to rely on his written report which father argues supports him. That approach is contradictory to say the least. If he was, as submitted by father, such a poor expert how can it be appropriate to rely on even the written report? I have already highlighted the fact that the father appears to hold the opinion that the written report supports his latest admissions but it simply does not and Dr Ameen stood firm to his opinion in the face of significant and forceful challenge. I have already commented on the issue of bruising and Dr Ameen&#8217;s expertise as a general surgeon for many years.</span></p>

He was quite clear that father&#8217;s demonstration and explanation for the fracture were a potential mechanism, but only if there was sufficient force/compression to R&#8217;s chest. The simple difference between he and the father is that the father submits that his tic alone provided sufficient force, Dr Ameen does not consider this to be possible.</span></p>

I note that this event actually took place 8 years ago, and question how it is relevant now, certainly there is no suggestion or evidence of repetition. I do not seek to minimise father&#8217;s affliction with his tics but the only recent evidence of any significant tics recently comes from father himself self reporting, including an event allegedly reported to the hospital after R&#8217;s injury had taken place according to counsel for R. No proof has been provided by the father to substantiate this incident or visit.</span></p>

Again it is simply the case that father submits they were caused by his tics; the experts do not fully agree. Dr Cardwell does not rule out inflicted injury and opines that whilst it is it is feasible that 2 of the bruises are &#8220;more typical of fingertip bruising&#8221; at least 2 and possibly 3 of the bruises are not explained by father&#8217;s explanation or demonstration. Further the number and areas of bruising cause concern about child abuse particularly when linked with the rib fracture.</span></p>

At the time of the injuries, this was a father under stress, and struggling with a colicky baby. He was also having tics but his evidence suggests that these happen 1000 times each day and he will to a degree be used to them and their effects.  In my judgment eventually his frustration, stress and failure to cope led to R being injured. </span></p>

It is too much of a coincidence, unsupported by evidence and indeed not accepted as a cause by the totality of the medical expert evidence. This is a father who has lied and lied throughout these proceedings, to everyone involved and his credibility is extremely low. He was a poor witness and seriously lacks credibility. I accept the submissions of Ms Begum for the local authority and Ms Noon for R that this was a father who could not cope and suffered a momentary loss of control and squeezed R too tight, fracturing her rib, possibly whilst also having a tic but that the tic alone was not to blame. It was not deliberate but was reckless and caused by stress and failing to cope.</span></p>

It is impossible to be precise with dating the bruises but Dr Cardwell was very clear that father had failed to explain the true basis for the bruises, particularly those numbered (ii) and (iv). The others were potentially caused by fingertips but the true mechanisms are not clear even with father&#8217;s final evidence where he admits causing the bruises over different days/times.
