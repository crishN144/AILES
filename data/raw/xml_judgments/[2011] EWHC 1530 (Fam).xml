The second is that where one is dealing with married parents and with a child of MAT&#8217;s age it is not open to one parent unilaterally to charge the child&#8217;s habitual residence   The third is that I was, of course, a member of the constitution of the court which decided the appeal in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re S (Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/1021" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 1021" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 1021</ref>. <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1146" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1146</ref>, in which Parker J had decided that a period of some 7 to 8 weeks&#8217; residence was sufficient to establish that a child had become habitually resident in England.

As I have already indicated, she points to a number of factors in her attempt to demonstrate that 2010 was different &#8211; including  to the fact that MAT came with the father &#8211; something which had not occurred in 2008.
