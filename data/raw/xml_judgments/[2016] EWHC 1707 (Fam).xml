I am required to do so by Section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989. What she needs, I find, is to be provided with an opportunity in which she can, in a peaceful and safe situation, be afforded the chance for her strong and lively mind to reassert its own independence. An environment in which there are the kind of vile images that I have described and the extreme polemic I have outlined, can only be deleterious to her emotional welfare. I hope she can be provided with an opportunity where her thoughts might turn to healthier and I hope happier issues. I have no doubt, as has been impressed upon me by her counsel, that she will find separation from her parents, particularly her siblings, to be distressing, though I note she was prepared to leave them to go to Syria. I do not doubt that the social worker will struggle to find a placement which meets the full panoply of her welfare needs which has been emphasised on behalf of the guardian, but I entirely see why the Local Authority plans or proposals are, of necessity, only general in outline and, to some extent, inevitably inchoate. However, I am entirely satisfied that this social worker will make every effort to ensure the best possible option is achieved for B. That is the Local Authority's responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>

On 6</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">th</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt"> December 2014, B was reported missing by her mother. Her mother stated that she may have travelled to Syria. This information, it is said, was given to the mother by B's brother. The account was that she, B, had informed her brother of her plans, confidentially, that very morning, i.e. the day she was due to fly. The Metropolitan Police Service Counter Terrorism Command were alerted, and they were able, operating on a narrow time margin, to intercept the flight only minutes before it was due to take off and B was removed. She had therefore very nearly made good her intention to get to Syria. She was, in due course interviewed by the police and, as a minor, questioned in accordance with the Achieving Best Evidence guidelines. During the course of that interview she was frank about her intention to travel to the Islamic State.&#8221;&#8230;</span></p>

It includes mass killings, sadistic torture (which I have been advised has symbolic significance and is not merely gratuitous), random killings by youths in a car by using AK47 machine guns, scenes of mass graves and bloodied lakes and killings videoed in such a manner as to create the impression that the viewer is the killer looking through the cross hairs of a telescopic sight attached to a rifle.  The written material includes sinister polemics designed to rally &#8216;good Muslims&#8217; to the cause of jihad.  Some of these documents deliver sophisticated messages to the reader, advising them how best to create the impression of social compliance whilst participating in an anarchic agenda.  I have personally read much of that material in order to try to equip myself to evaluate the evidence in an informed way, and to alert myself to any potential subterfuge.  I cannot imagine how it is that the officers of the CTU manage to view the material I have described whilst remaining inured to it.  I feel constrained to observe that which is obvious from the above, that the public owes them a debt of gratitude.  </p>

Their reports have been helpful in bringing context to the circumstances of this particular case.  Their research is of wider general interest and, accordingly, it has been agreed that the generic report should be appended to this judgment.  Some of the analysis within the reports requires to be set out extensively for this reason and because I consider the information should be more widely available within the profession and beyond.  Before turning to the reports though I would make two observations.  Firstly, I have now heard a number of cases concerning allegations of radicalisation of children and I have found that many of the observations within the reports, reinforced as they are by academic research, also resonate with what I have seen for myself in the courtroom.  Secondly, I would reiterate that which I have now said in various ways in a number of other cases: the family, as a construct, is infinitely variable and inevitably so too is the route by which children become radicalised within their family.  </p>

Firstly, it is conspicuous that radicalised material was not found on the boys' devices. Secondly, the boys, through a variety of sporting interests, have a much wider integration into society more generally and, on my, as yet, superficial assessment, a healthier range of interests. Between sport and study there is, I suspect, little room in their lives for radicalised interests. Thirdly, it was one of the boys who first sounded the alarm about his sister's flight. The exact account of that, like everything else this family says, must now be viewed with very great caution, but I strongly suspect there is a core truth that it was the action of one of the brothers that foiled B's flight to Syria.

Jihadi narratives rely upon rigid understandings of male and female appropriate roles in society, with clear expectations for behaviour. There are two elements to this, the first the &#8216;failings&#8217; in gender relations in the West, and second the correct and purposeful gender relations present and expected in Islamic State among &#8216;believing&#8217; &#8216;pure&#8217; Muslim men and women. They allege that European men are emasculated by European state agencies, and are not &#8216;real men&#8217; because of their failures to defend the &#8216;appropriate&#8217; gender order. They allege that women in the west are not respected and the roles of wife and mother are not valued. In contrast they present Islamic State as an opportunity for young men to demonstrate their &#8216;manhood&#8217;, by becoming a fighter/hero, by supporting and defending women, and by following God&#8217;s requirement that they live under Islamic law. It is presented as a rite of passage into adulthood. Furthermore they ask women to demonstrate their commitment to God and Islamic law by being a &#8216;support&#8217; to their (future/current) husbands in Islamic State and by bringing up the next generation of Muslims in the &#8216;correct&#8217; manner.  &#8221;</span></p>

Recruiters exploit their extensive knowledge of an individual by targeting any existing vulnerabilities in the young person&#8217;s identity and life experiences. Often they appear to focus on the lack of control and voice young women have in their lives - whether in the home, the community or at school.  Women&#8217;s experiences, opinions and lives are shown &#8216;not to matter&#8217; to the &#8216;outside world&#8217; and recruiters point to the failure of others to take potential recruits actions or words seriously.

In this &#8216;new life&#8217; young women are given &#8216;choices&#8217; (Islamic State allege) regarding marriage, work, and education - providing they abide by the strict rules of gender segregation. Recruiters emphasise how &#8216;meaningful&#8217; life is, and that hardships (in terms of electrical or medical shortages) are the burden they must endure in order to become better Muslims. Importantly young women are presented with illusion of &#8216;choice&#8217; in future husbands, providing their &#8216;wali&#8217; (guardian) approves of the match. In marrying a fighter, women are given status and prestige, something recruiters allege they will not get while living in the West. Furthermore Western women are &#8216;prized&#8217; potential wives (over local women) because they have shown their commitment to the cause by undertaking the journey, and because they have higher levels of education, and maybe linguistically closer to their future husbands.  </span></p>

Islamic State make it clear they do not anticipate women contributing to the &#8216;battlefield&#8217;, rather they are to provide supporting and domestic roles but this is a &#8216;political choice&#8217; as much as a personal one.  Images of women with weapons or dressed as a suicide bomber are signalled as a sign of defence but also to signify their support of violent &#8216;jihad&#8217; and to show off the capability and weaponry available to fighters of Islamic state. Women are &#8216;trained&#8217; in the use of light weaponry but only to defend themselves or their children, or to serve in two female-only moral police forces in IS territory.  Notions of &#8216;purity&#8217; therefore become important - purity meaning of femininity/masculinity tied to morality and of faith. It is reported that there is some shaming of young men and women in private messaging for their slowness or lack of commitment or violation of expected codes of conduct.  </span></p>

One consequence of this however is that her opportunities for social interaction have inevitably been limited and beyond her sisters of whom she is clearly very fond, she has few friends or acquaintances outside the home.</p>

There is however a significant body of unique material produced every day that is retweeted, posted on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and other platforms. The material focuses on life in Islamic State, presenting an idealised vision of &#8216;ordinary life&#8217;, the new rules and regulations of Islamic State, new areas of interest and promotional material. This material focuses on the failings of western states to allow Muslims to live according to their faith, it points to the violence of Western governments and state agencies against Muslims, it emphasises the faults of Muslims who adopt alternative understandings of Islamic history and way of life - particularly targeting Shia and Sufis. The material is replete with de-contextualised verses from the Quran and the Hadith (stories of the Prophet Mohammed&#8217;s life). The material offers a utopian vision  of itself - it identifies a problem with the world and living in the West, it presents an awe inspiring and grand solution (itself) and argues that young Muslims are responsible for its realisation and offers &#8216;hope&#8217; for a future. There is an underlying tension with this approach where it emphasises a new &#8216;good life&#8217; for potential recruits while simultaneously highlighting their belief in an imminent apocalypse. However this does not render IS a &#8216;death cult&#8217; rather death and violence is for a purpose - the protection of the new proto-state, and its &#8216;citizens&#8217;.&#8221; </span></p>

Islamic State is a &#8216;young persons&#8217; movement and the use of technology is authentic to its members. Online material is highly gendered using particular motifs to exalt behaviours and traits. For women modesty, piety and complementarity with men is emphasised through images of a lion and lioness, or a &#8216;green bird&#8217;, images of romantic love do emerge, but these are presented as the &#8216;beginning&#8217; of a new life rather than an end in itself. Online recruitment frequently relies on existing &#8216;real-world&#8217; contacts, but not always. Increasingly non-public platforms are being used - such as telegram, and WhatsApp. Public forums are used for general propaganda and maintaining community and a sense of belonging - having your twitter account suspended is valued and seen as an achievement and celebrated. Islamic State are increasingly suspicious of unsolicited requests, and some reports suggest they require a &#8216;recommendation&#8217; from a &#8216;known&#8217;/&#8216;trusted&#8217; individual. Peer-to-Peer recruiters also encourage young women to distrust friends and family or &#8216;traditional&#8217; authority figures, arguing &#8216;they don&#8217;t understand&#8217;. Moreover they argue that those in the West, follow an Islam that has been &#8216;perverted&#8217; by culture and traditions that are not Islamic, or that those in authority have become corrupted by working for European authorities. On line recruitment is now noticeably female-to-female - in the past some men were actively seeking to recruit women as future wives but this has been noticeably declined.&#8221;</span></p>

Some manuals provide information on developing chemical, biological and radiological weapons, but most concentrate on the more feasible homemade explosive and firearm weapons. Manuals are also available which give advice to adherents on how to avoid police or security service surveillance, on how to react if interviewed or interrogated by the security services, on how to blend into society without attracting undue attention, on how to communicate secretly with other extremists, how to carry out reconnaissance of potential targets, and a whole range of other activities of use to the potential terrorist.&#8221;</span></p>

The document established precedent for women's participation in Jihad as an individual duty. The document argued that a woman does not need her male guardian's permission to join Jihad. It supports the martyrdom of a Chechen woman who died in carrying out a human bombing killing 27 Russian soldiers. The material however argues that women's direct participation in violence is limited to particular circumstances (self-defence and when men cannot) and that women travelling to carry out Jihad face additional limitations. It then proceeds to say that as yet the circumstances of Jihad do not require women's active involvement as fighters but that they are obliged to support men in their fight. For example by carrying weapons, raising children in the correct manner, and training in combat first aid.&#8221; </span></p>

For the reasons set out below, I have not been persuaded of that aspect of the Local Authority&#8217;s case.

She has also worked in the capacity of Guardian ad Litem, CAFCASS officer and asserts in her CV that she &#8216;specialises&#8217; in &#8216;working with Muslim families&#8217;.  </p>

In her very lengthy report, which is essentially simple reportage of what the family has said to her, Ms Thakrar missed the opportunity to confront them with my earlier findings and to challenge their various belief structures.  Though I am satisfied that her instructions were clear and supplemented by a further set of instructions specifically directing her to the court&#8217;s concerns, she appeared to have very little understanding of the nature of the task she was engaged in.  Her view of the family was expressed with fulsome positivity, though I have found it impossible to identify any analysis in her report upon which her optimism could be founded.  More than that, within a report spanning over 130 pages I have struggled to identify any analysis of any issue in the case.  Rather unusually despite the glowing conclusions she advanced, I had no sense that the family had forged any kind of constructive relationship with her either.  Her conclusions require to be set out:</p>

He apparently told Ms Thakrar that he did not do this because he wanted to access material of his own.  In his evidence he disputed having said that to Ms Thakrar and contended that he asked a friend to fit the software for him.  This was also, as Ms Fottrell reminds me set out in the parent&#8217;s joint statement in the wardship proceedings.  I also heard from DS Kinkead that F had been advised by CTU to use a system known as &#8216;Pandora&#8217; which is regarded as effective.

This is simply irreconcilable with her position by the time of filing her report and it was an illogicality that she was unable to remedy in her evidence.  I do not question Ms Thakrar&#8217;s integrity or her independence, my complaint is with her method.  She spent 84 hours with the family including meetings with the children.  Though she was particularly asked to assess what might be the most effective intervention for the children in the light of the Silke/Brown report, I was not convinced that she had read the crucial updated report by the time she gave her evidence before me.  </p>

Others have identified something very similar and the mother herself sometimes unwittingly gives examples of rather controlling strategies.  In this context some of the extensive material within the report has forensic relevance and so has not been an entirely wasted effort.  It was however a missed opportunity to undertake a challenging, perhaps even ground breaking, piece of social work, looking in detail into the complex process of child radicalisation.  </p>

When the deficiencies in Ms Thakrar&#8217;s report came to light Ms Ukueku agreed, in the time remaining, to plan and undertake an assessment addressing the risk matrix referred to above.  This report was undertaken with a Mr Brian Sharpe and a Ms Juliette Thompson.  I heard from Ms Ukueku and Mr Sharpe in evidence.  It is an unfortunate fact that Judges have, from time to time, to be critical, sometimes highly critical of social workers.  Too often good social work goes without comment or commendation.  This case provides some opportunity to remedy that.  This family is extremely fortunate that Ms Ukueku was allocated to this case.  She has shown unstinting commitment to them, she has been tireless in her determination to help them, she has unhesitatingly sacrificed her own personal time and displayed an impressive mix of intellectual rigour and compassion.  Perhaps most importantly, whilst trying to work effectively with the family, she has not shied away from confronting them robustly and directly where she perceives there to be error or inappropriate behaviour.  She has, in my view, &#8216;worked&#8217; the case, in the sense that she has not merely recorded the attitudes or behaviours of the adults, rather she has actively intervened to try to change them where, in her assessment, they are contrary to the interests of the child.</p>

It is rarely necessary for the Judge or the lawyers to do so.  It is probably desirable that we should not.  The danger that we become inured to it is greater than might initially be thought.  Some of the material here is, plainly profoundly shocking.  Ms Ukueku took the view that if she were truly to understand what harm B had been subjected to she ought to look at some of the material herself.  She told me that on reflection she wished she had not done so.  It had caused her real, not merely superficial, distress.  She told me how some of the images are lodged in her mind and have from time to time intruded unexpectedly into her thoughts.  She twice needed to pause to maintain her composure, as she outlined this to the Court.  She told me, at this point, slightly tearfully, that she had been terribly shocked and deeply upset that B had been regularly exposed to such images.  It was a powerful and memorable moment in the hearing.  I noted that it had some impact on B which seemed to me to be chiefly one of real surprise.  I think this was both as to the effect the images had on Ms Ukueku as well as some realisation of the great effort made on her behalf.  </p>

This, they say, &#8216;cannot but have misinformed his thinking and such analysis as he drew from it of risk&#8217;.  This seems to me to be a criticism that could be made of any risk assessment which precedes a finding of fact hearing.  It is by no means axiomatic that a view of some the facts contemplated by a social worker, which in due course are not confirmed by the Judge, invalidates the risk assessment.  It will be a question of degree in each case.  It is for this reason I thought it appropriate to identify, at para 43 above, how, in my judgement, the social workers took particular care to establish their evaluation of risk on a factual substratum that seemed to them to be most solid, even if the facts themselves open a spectrum of possibility ranging in gravity.   E.g. did the father hold strong political views about Gaza, if so did he share them with B and, further, was the influence of these views on B&#8217;s radicalisation intended or otherwise.  Mr Sharpe plainly thought broadly and reflectively about some of the big issues this case presents but I did not detect that he had reached many firm conclusions.  I think his role in the assessment was largely to stimulate thought rather than proffer practical suggestions.  This was no doubt a useful contribution.</p>

Some of it is now trite law, albeit that the evolution of cases of this kind indicates that the application of facts to the law may be at times be both subtle and complex.  Though I have emphasised, now in a number of cases, that the issues here are a new facet of child protection which are best understood by reference to tried and tested safeguarding imperatives, it needs to be noted that apparent cooperation with professionals may not be sincere and misinterpreted may lead to a false evaluation of risk.  Thus, the usual weight afforded to a cooperative working relationship will require frequent testing to ensure the cooperation is genuine.</p>

Any impression to the contrary requires to be dispelled.   The starting point is that a party who asserts a fact must prove it, thus the burden remains on the Local Authority throughout.  The &#8216;standard of proof&#8217; refers to the level of probability required to prove a fact. In family cases, this is the civil standard of proof i.e. &#8216;the simple balance of probabilities&#8217;: <span style="font-weight:bold">Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35</span>.

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.&#8221;</span></p>

If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof.</span></p>

Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts.

The reality is that in this country there must be tens of thousands of children who are cared for in homes where there is a degree of domestic violence (now very widely defined) and where parents on occasion drink more than they should, I am not condoning that for a moment, but the courts are not in the business of social engineering. The courts are not in the business of providing children with perfect homes. If we took into care and placed for adoption every child whose parents had had a domestic spat and every child whose parents on occasion had drunk too much then the care system would be overwhelmed and there would not be enough adoptive parents.&#160; So we have to have a degree of realism about prospective carers who come before the courts."</span></p>

There was even a group of people who were really, really extreme and they were not even going to go to Syria, they had just made up their minds to carry out an attack here. There was a strong debate about following the rule of law in your own country. There is a hadith about this and so many people strongly argued that this was the right approach and that if you were in the Islamic State then you would follow Sharia law but in your own country you had to follow the rule of law there.  The majority thought it better just to go to IS and follow the law there. Others argued (and it got quite heated) that you should act to further IS in your own country even if that was against the law. I didn&#8217;t; join in with the arguments. I agreed with the &#8216;follow the rule of law in your own country&#8217; argument, and if you want to live under Sharia law just go there. Ultimately, that was why I got on the plane.

As she approaches 17 years of age she has a real thirst for knowledge and a striking academic curiosity.  Her core Islamic beliefs, as opposed to the distorted ones that have now gripped her, seemed to me to have inculcated into her a strong sense of intellectual discipline.  I noticed that she was adept at spotting and weeding out some of the contradictions in her own thought processes.  Though fully capable of absorbing the case advanced on her behalf she was both realistic enough and perhaps strong willed enough to divert from it where she considered it appropriate to do so.  I was struck by how B described her own thinking behind her changed position in her third statement which I have taken some time to set out above.  Hers was a far more pragmatic calculation.   She told me that as she thought about the case and as she knew the hearing was pending she began to realise that it was inevitable that findings would be made against her.  Accordingly, she felt driven to address some of the allegations that she had up until that point avoided.  Whilst I find there is an element of cynicism in this, it is not undiluted.   My impression is that the very task of approaching the evidence more realistically became cathartic to some degree.  In her evidence she proved herself to be at times remarkably candid.  </p>

I saw her face change as she identified her answer.  However, she at first responded by saying &#8216;there were none really&#8217;.  I told her that was not my impression.  She indicated that she had not responded immediately because she was diffident about sharing the image that she had in mind, conscious that it would shock people.  It did.

He said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the pity side of a person would be finished, the mercy.  If you watch something like [B] did it&#8217;s easy for the mercy to disappear from the heart.</span>&#8217;  I agree with Ms Sarah Morgan QC and Ms Lucy Sprinz in their closing submissions on behalf of the father that this illustrates that the father had reflected carefully on the issue.</p>

He told Ms Thakrar that as a Berber male from the Algerian community he held some negativity towards the French in their use of tanks in Algeria in the 1950&#8217;s.  He explained that his family had shown him photographs of this period which he considered revealed French tactics to be &#8216;unjust and upsetting&#8217; and which plainly had stayed in his memory.  In evidence, he drew a comparison with these grainy, black and white photographs of a conflict which pre-dated his birth and the videos seen by B.  The moving, &#8216;living&#8217; pictures in colour and so much more clearly defined were, the father said, much more searing.  </p>

The application, which I granted, was made before the Father went into the witness box.  The material included photographs of charred bodies and the cracked skull of a dead infant.  These were produced into evidence, I think, during the course of the cross examination of the Father.  In any event I did not look at them until the Father was asked to comment on them.  I was not expecting to see the kind of images they contained, indeed it took me a moment or two, from the rather poor quality photocopies, to realise what I was looking at.  I found them disturbing.  </p>

Nonetheless, I had the strong impression, as he responded to questions, that he too had, albeit in a different way to his daughter, become numbed to images of death.  Such photographs may well have triggered moral outrage in him, an entirely different dynamic to B&#8217;s objectives in looking at the material I have considered above, but for all that I sensed that something of his own &#8216;pity&#8217; and &#8216;mercy&#8217;, to use his expressions, had been compromised.  I do not think that he contemplated that the image of the child might not merely shock people, but that it might provoke a simple human distress reaction for the child which eclipsed the underlying humanitarian objective that he intended.  I consider that this resonates with something that he is reported as having told Ms Thakrar:</p>

I reject that.  There is much in that passage which is plainly accurate.  The father was fulsome in evidence about the atrocities in Gaza, as he sees them.  He plainly, in my assessment, was affected by what he had seen.  He confirmed that he watched Al Jazeera on the basis that he felt that was a reliable chronicler of world events and certainly accepted that he had brought back pictures.  All of this is essentially accurately recorded.  It is also very much of a piece with his evidence more generally.  I may have been critical of Ms Thakrar&#8217;s lack of focus and forensic rigour but, as I have already said, I have no reason at all to doubt her integrity.  Neither have I found evidence of regular misreporting, in what I remind myself were 84 hours of interviews. </p>

I consider that in the heat of his own outrage he was motivated to do so by what I have loosely referred to as humanitarian instincts.  Having been shown disturbing photographs of death himself as a child I do not think that he has ever extrapolated from that, that it is entirely inappropriate to present children with such images.  He does not appear to have absorbed that childhood innocence needs to be protected and that he as a father has that responsibility.  His failure to rise to those obligations is, in my assessment of the evidence, critical to what has happened to B.  I also consider that like B, he too has become desensitised, on a basic human level, to images of child and adult suffering.   His response is ideological rather than visceral.   </p>

He stated that the ISIS had manipulated her to travel to Syria by informing her she could study for free in medicine and qualify as a doctor. It appears that there had been some worries as to how her medical studies would be funded. (In a later meeting [the father] informed me that he planned to sell some family land to pay for her studies in the future.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Elaborating upon what was told to Ms Thakrar, the father explained to me in evidence how significant in his life is the situation in Gaza.  He told me that he has on four occasions involved himself in humanitarian convoys to the Gaza strip, journeys which he confirmed placed his own life in peril.  These trips took him away from his family.  He told me how distressed his youngest son had been when, on one occasion, he waved his father off.  It follows, as the father acknowledged, that on these occasions he had valued these humanitarian objectives more highly than his own life or the needs of his children for their father.  This is all the more poignant as the father himself was orphaned as a child.  Its significance seems to me to be that the father was, if necessary, prepared to die for a cause.  I record this without interpolating any censure.  In many different contexts adults have to make difficult and unenviable choices between the dictates of their conscience and the needs of those they love.  I record my findings here because they have   obvious resonance for B&#8217;s situation.  B too has been prepared to imperil her life for her beliefs.  That said, it does not appear to have been obvious to the father.   He comes close to it though when he stated, in evidence, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8216;maybe she is thinking if she goes to Syria she would please me&#8217;</span>.  I think that he is, in part, right.  But, like her father B is also complex and her motives in attempting to go to Syria were neither simple nor, given her age and immaturity, necessarily coherent.  </p>

I agree that this plainly causes B to want to please her father, as many have suggested.  She values his approval and he rations his compliments.  This may be, in part, due to his faith, which eschews strong emotions such as pride or anger.   Of course, not everybody finds it easy to communicate deep emotions.   He has however been entirely unable to hide the distress he feels at B&#8217;s determined and nearly successful attempt to get to Syria.  When he has discussed this, in the courtroom, he has not been able to retain his composure.  As I watched B and her mother react to this evidence my assessment of their reaction, as they lowered their eyes and turned their faces, was that they felt a sense of shame that their father should be brought to a position where he cries in the courtroom in front of so many people.  Their discomposure at this evidence was much greater than at any other point in the hearing. I have watched their reactions, as they sit behind their lawyers, very carefully indeed in this case and over a long period of time.</p>

The potent effect of those qualities in combination with the palpable closeness of their relationship might well go some way to explaining B&#8217;s actions.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is, of course, more benevolent to the father than my own analysis but, as Ms Morgan observes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;if this or something like it&#8217;</span> underpins B&#8217;s evolution to radicalisation then it is a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;long way from the way in which the Local Authority put their case against the father&#8217;</span>.  I accept that submission, at least to the extent that I do not believe that the father has deliberately indoctrinated or infected his daughter with radicalised beliefs.  He has however, created an ideological tinder box in which combustion was almost inevitable.   It is troubling that he expresses little insight into his own responsibility which, when I come to look at individual factual findings, I assess as considerable.  He has, despite his love for his daughter, caused her very significant emotional harm in a way that is directly attributable to his failings as a parent.  He spoke of the effects of exposure to the flood of death imagery that B has witnessed as causing &#8216;the pity side of a person to be finished.&#8217; He uses the perfect tense.  I hope he is wrong to do so because the central objective of future care planning is to restore &#8216;pity&#8217; and &#8216;mercy&#8217; to B&#8217;s &#8216;heart&#8217;, if I may use the father&#8217;s own terminology.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The central complaint made by the Local Authority against the father is that he promoted and facilitated B&#8217;s research by claiming, in December 2014, to have purchased and installed filtering software on each of the IT devices in the household with his own computer as the master, to prohibit the children accessing any inappropriate websites.  I found father&#8217;s response to this allegation, under cross examination, to be hollow, evasive and entirely unconvincing.  He can have been under no misapprehension as to the importance of installing the necessary spyware.  He directly acknowledged its significance in his statements.

One would have expected nothing less than hawkish vigilance on behalf of a parent in such circumstances.  I have used the term degradation because the father told me that he understood the life expectancy of a jihadi warrior to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;so short that the women would be expected to remarry quickly&#8217;</span> with all the physical and emotional consequences that carries.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of the father&#8217;s own hard drives, which were being used by other members of the family, there was pro Isis material and propaganda present.  I agree with Mr Barnes, on behalf of the Local Authority, that this indicates at very least that the father failed to conduct the most basic of checks, evidenced by the screen shots which have been downloaded, printed and incorporated into the case material.   There was no password protection or encryption or any attempt to hide the material.  The father had been given specific advice by the police as to the most appropriate software to purchase.  I recall that there was even discussion at Court as to how this would be funded.  It is not particularly expensive.  In simple terms Isis material was sitting there in front of him, on his own hard drive.  He failed to make the most fundamental of checks and claims to be unaware it was there.  All this I emphasise again follows: wardship proceedings; the involvement of the CTU; Social Services and considerable press interest in this family.</p>

I reject this account without hesitation nor can it be reconciled, in any sensible way, with his earlier statements.  Frankly, this was just embarrassing to listen to as I am sure B must appreciate, for she is no fool.  It is of course troubling on two bases.  Firstly, that the father&#8217;s account should be so unreliable on such a crucial issue in the case has clear and negative implications for his potential to work openly and constructively with the Local Authority in the future.  Secondly, that, as I find, the father has so fundamentally failed to protect his children from viewing the images in this case, there is a real difficulty in having any confidence in him to act differently in the future.  Of course if, as I think likely, the father knew this material was there and that it had been downloaded by B then he can only be taken to have given her research enquiries his tacit approval.  There is ultimately, I regret to say, no other logical conclusion. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second significant allegation levelled against the father relates to a USB stick found in the parents bedroom (ID K /88) and removed in the police search of August 2015.  The father initially denied that this belonged to him, though his position on this appeared to soften.  I agree with the Local Authority that the weight of evidence supports an attribution of all the material on it to the father. I would go further, in my view, the evidence is compelling.  Its significance is that the material on this device includes pamphlets which can be characterised as expressing jihadist leanings: lectures by Al-Awlaki which refer to violent military jihad; videos which contain death images; photographs of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay and general extremist opinion.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is obviously significant that the USB stick was found in the parents room and on the father&#8217;s boxes.  I have seen photographs of this household, it is meticulously neat and well organised.  It is inhabited by people who show great personal discipline in every aspect of their lives.  It is a small house for the size of the family who live there.  Books, work, personal items are carefully arranged into individual space and often very neatly stacked.  Accordingly, the fact of where the USB stick was found is, in my judgement, far more significant than it might potentially be in more disorganised or chaotic households.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, the father accepted that he used that USB stick when travelling abroad.  Following additional investigation during this hearing it was discovered that the other material on the USB stick included many of the father&#8217;s CV&#8217;s and certificates of accomplishment in which he took great pride and which it was important to him to preserve.  Conversely, there is no document on the USB stick which falls to be attributed to anyone other than the father.  Also, as Mr Barnes subtly teased out in evidence, the qualitative nature of the various texts seen here is different to those on B&#8217;s devices.  There is a generational complexion to it, it is rather more academic in its content and also slightly more dated.   The videos on this USB stick also resonate with the father&#8217;s interests.   As Mr Barnes notes in his closing submissions, there has not been any challenge to the record of the father&#8217;s discussion with the Prevent Intervention Provider where he appears to accept visiting a website which contained Dabiq and a tract entitled &#8216;How Muslims could be misunderstood&#8217;.  In addition, though it had not been foreshadowed to any great extent in the statements filed in the case, it became clear in evidence that the father frequently ventilated his political views on Twitter where, as I have already referred to, he posted graphic and disturbing death related images.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst evaluating the father&#8217;s role in the radicalisation of his daughter, both in relation to its extent as well as its motivation, it is important to survey the wider picture of this family&#8217;s life at the relevant time.  Following the Wardship proceedings and the foiling of B&#8217;s escape to Syria the CTU offered B support on the Channel project.  This is entirely voluntary.  The parents declined to accept it and B did not attend.  Both the father and mother have told me that they felt their family had quietly addressed the issue of B&#8217;s interest in Isis and that they wanted a period of calm in the family away from outside involvement.  Again, I do not accept this explanation as either sufficient or complete.  I am sure that there is an element of truth in it, but I have become equally clear that this family is resistant to the State and its involvement in their life.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority has characterised the father&#8217;s role as &#8216;pivotal&#8217;.  I agree that it is, though not in the way that the Local Authority initially contended.  As I have sought to analyse it, the father&#8217;s role has been a complex one in which he has, I am satisfied, often failed to appreciate the consequences of his own behaviour and its impact on his daughter.  He is, in my evaluation of the evidence, a headstrong man who has a deep suspicion of the press, the courts and to some extent the world generally.  He aspires to knowledge and respects learning.  I am satisfied that he was simply not prepared to monitor B&#8217;s use of the computer in the way that he had promised this Court and the CTU that he would.  He decieved all the agencies into trusting him to regulate his daughter&#8217;s use of the internet but, I find, made absolutely no effort to do so.  It was anathema to him to curtail B&#8217;s exploration of ideas however dark or dangerous they may have been.  I do not believe that he had ever stopped to reflect on the extent to which his daughter could inflict emotional and psychological damage on herself by what she viewed on the internet.  Here, in this particular case, a 16 year old girl has dehumanised herself by viewing a surfeit of death related images that have left her emotionally numb.  It is this that is the most striking feature of the case, more so than her reading the polemics or expressions of radicalised views.  Of course, they make their contribution too.</p>

I think his high handed disregard for the Court and for the Police glamorised him in her eyes as a rebellious figure who could not be easily subjugated.  The extent of the Isis related material on the family computers illustrates beyond any sensible contradiction that B felt absolutely no inhibition from viewing what she wanted without restraint from her father.</p>

B was an academic, &#8216;bookish&#8217; child in a family that enjoyed outdoor sporting activities.  The reality is that B, unlike her siblings, really did not seem to care for sports very much.  In her evidence the sister told me of the family&#8217;s irritation when B would not accompany them on their frequent outdoor activities.  By contrast with her vibrantly healthy siblings B is strikingly pale.  When talking about his faith, which is undoubtedly important to him, he did so in language that was moderate, unforced and lacking in zealotry.  He told me that he attended mosque regularly but he revealed no fanaticism.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the question of his religion the father spoke spontaneously and without guile.  Neither did he theologise or use language of his faith with any insistence on precision.  In this respect he was dramatically different to his wife and to B herself.  I found this both striking and revealing, I do not consider that the father shares or indeed spends very much time thinking about a heightened or more perfect aspirational Islam.  I also note that many who have been involved with him have found him to be kind, warm and generous.  He has been described as having a sense of humour too.  During this case he has also revealed those features of his personality in this courtroom.  I am satisfied that the father himself viewed Isis material though it was qualitatively less violent and damaging than that read by his daughter.  His denial of it until he was effectively trapped by the forensic evidence is a further example of his inability to work constructively with the Authority to protect his daughter.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite all this there is a naivety to the father&#8217;s behaviour rather than a deep seated destructive agenda.  For the reasons I have sought to explain above, he is badly placed to understand the effect of these grossly disturbing images on his daughter.   In some respects this has nothing to do with faith, political views, or radicalisation.  It is above all else a significant parenting deficiency.  The veneration of ideas and political causes eclipsed the instinctive obligation of every right thinking parent to protect a child&#8217;s innocence.   Though he did not fully appreciate it, perhaps not even at all, this father was complicit in the corruption of his daughter&#8217;s emotional integrity and a corrosive influence on the development of her personal autonomy.  If, as he speculated, viewing such images kills the &#8216;pity and mercy&#8217; of the human spirit then I regret to say that he, more than any other person, is responsible for this.  I can only hope that having captured the central issue in the case so movingly and succinctly the father will step up to his responsibilities in the future. I must of course add finally that in failing B in this way the father also left his other children potentially vulnerable to the insidious effects on these images.</p>

The fact that it was harmful is not disputed.  All parties accept that the character of the material is different to that ordinarily the subject of analysis by the Family Court.

In so far as there is an implicit suggestion that I should potentially curtail my findings, in order to keep open for B the prospects of a medical career, I have an uncomfortable sense that this might require me to treat B more favourably than an equivalent child whose future does not hold such a glittering prospect.  That said, it is B&#8217;s welfare which, on this point, is the paramount consideration and, in the context of Children Act proceedings, both the proportionality of the findings sought as well as their consequences are relevant to the primary objective of the legislation i.e. the lode star of the &#8216;welfare principle&#8217;.

In the Local Authority&#8217;s assessment sessions, she explained how the father&#8217;s commitment to his religion was something that she had found very attractive when they first met.  As she talked about Islam, in her evidence, it became obvious that her faith was not simply an important part of her life but utterly integral to it.  Her faith, it became clear, is vocational, in the sense that it is the most important thing in her life.  She is intensely clear about what is expected of a &#8216;good Muslim&#8217; and doctrinally precise in her use of language.  She explained how a Muslim should never give way to anger or succumb to pride.  Faith wasn&#8217;t confined to the mosque but, she told me, was about how a Muslim should live a more aspirant life. For the avoidance of doubt this is my summary of her evidence.</p>

To the secular mind this might sound arrogant but I consider that the mother is driven by piety and rejects rather than condemns a diluted or more earthly form of Islam.</p>

The definition she went on to give of this was disingenuous, in my judgement.  She described some kind of pluralist western utopia which celebrated difference.  These, I consider, were vacuous platitudes, a false cloak of liberalism.  It is utterly irreconcilable with the material she has been reading, containing as it does excoriating condemnation of western values and emphasising a duty to dismantle them through, it seems, whatever means available.  I have no doubt that B&#8217;s concept of Islam is far closer to that described by her mother.  Her views resonate very comfortably with the mother&#8217;s outline of her own beliefs which I have set out above.  Similarly, I see B taking the same care with language, eschewing immodesty or pride and, most notably, I see that, like her mother, B commits to any task before her with uncompromised effort and dedication.  This I believe she regards as a facet of her duties as a good Muslim.</p>

She explained that she liked to catch them when they came out of school at a time when their heads were full of the day&#8217;s activities.  &#8216;If I wait until they come home&#8217;, she told me, they have &#8216;moved on&#8217; to other concerns and the &#8216;opportunity has been lost&#8217;.  This struck me as, in some ways, rather poignant.  The mother is almost desperate to be in the thick of her children&#8217;s lives.  They are, in my judgement, integral both to her own sense of self worth and, in some more complex way, intrinsically linked to the way she perceives her obligations as a Muslim woman.  She aspires to do Allah&#8217;s will, through her children.</p>

What strikes me is that they resonate with B&#8217;s own account of herself as &#8216;addicted&#8217; to Isis material.  Typically, the addict is furtive, withdrawn, deceptive.  The children&#8217;s observations of B create precisely that impression of her behaviour.   I am very clear that this mother would have quickly been alert to her daughter&#8217;s changed behaviour and would have rooted out the cause with unstinting energy.  I find that even before the attempted flight to Syria the mother would certainly have known that her daughter was dangerously enthusiastic about the Isis agenda.  Having reached that conclusion, which seems to me to be irresistible on the evidence, I have wondered whether she was directly involved in her daughter&#8217;s attempt to leave the country.</p>

Though I am left with a very high level of suspicion concerning the mother&#8217;s knowledge about B&#8217;s escape to Syria, I am not ultimately persuaded, to the requisite standard of proof, that this mother knew of the plan.  As I have already made clear I consider the mother to be both controlling and a highly authoritative figure in the household.  I am sure that if this young boy had been pressed by his mother, even in the gentle way the friend describes in her statement, he would have told the mother that which he told the friend.  I think it unlikely that the mother ever asked him for an account, indeed she does not describe herself as having done so.   Given that she herself identified this boy as B&#8217;s closest confidante this is a troubling anomaly in the evidence.  This said, properly analysed, it does not establish a fact and I make no finding.  I should state that neither the Local Authority nor the Guardian invited me to.  Of course, the only possible inference that remains is that the mother was, as Mr Barnes describes it, permissive in her attitude to B&#8217;s interests in Isis.  This I do find to be established, on the balance of probabilities.  </p>

It is clear that B continued to use her Twitter account during the period after her return from the airport i.e. whilst she was a Ward of court and whilst the CTU and the Court were being assured by the parents of their vigilance.  Moreover, H actually told the mother that B was using her Twitter account at this time.  Despite everything that had happened the mother contended that she knew nothing of her daughter&#8217;s Twitter activities and had made no enquiry.  I reject her explanation, not least because it simply does not fit with H&#8217;s manifestly truthful evidence on this point.</p>

Accordingly, I find the mother too was party to a deception upon each of the safeguarding authorities involved.  They both colluded to create the impression that they were monitoring their daughter&#8217;s safety.  In reality, they were doing nothing of the kind.  There is in both parents a deep vein of resistance to authority.  I have seen flickers of it during the course of these proceedings, characterised by their combative attitude to the investigation and to those who have been motivated to help them.  Nor does either parent, in my view, really engage with the substance of the process.  I emphasise, B is not being &#8216;punished&#8217; for what she has done, the parents are not being &#8216;punished&#8217; either, rather the State is trying to protect their daughter from the damaging consequences of the vile images which she has repeatedly made access to and the corrosive ideology which has beguiled her.</p>

In retrospect it ought to have signalled rather more concern than it did at the time.  This resistance to authority coupled, as I find it to be, with a deep-seated capacity for deception has to be considered in the context of the fertile ground that existed within this family for radicalised ideas and extremist views to flourish.  In particular the father&#8217;s own insensitivity to death related images and the mother&#8217;s dedication to a heightened Islamic code of belief.  These I find are the predominant forces in this household which led to B becoming radicalised.  </p>

I am confident that I have characterised the mother&#8217;s belief system in a way which accurately reflects her own evidence.  Every faith has its spectrum of observance from those whose religion is peripheral to their lives to those for whom it is vocational.  I do not find that the mother held radicalised beliefs but I have found that on a spectrum of Islamic observance she is at the most committed end.  In this family those beliefs proved to be fertile ground for B&#8217;s journey to radicalisation.  </p>

The children of highly devout Muslims are neither more nor less likely to be attracted to Isis ideology. In so far as that may be a popular perception, it is entirely misconceived.  It runs counter to the research that I have set out above and contrary to my own experience in these cases.  In <span style="font-weight:bold">Re A v London Borough Enfield [2016] EWHC 567 (Admin) </span>where I was considering an application for Judicial Review, A appeared to have been attracted to extremist ideology, in part, by way of rebellion to her highly anxious parents whom she considered to be insufficiently Islamic in their lifestyle.  All this illustrates the complexity of the challenge to the Police, the Social Services and the Courts in understanding the process of radicalisation.  Every child is different, every radicalised child is different. </p>

She was relaxed in cross examination, alert to the objectives behind the questions and never remotely intimidated intellectually.  Some of the material she was discussing can only be described as profoundly disturbing.  As she described some of these images she became distant, withdrawn, flat and rather glazed in her expression.  She gave some of the most disturbing evidence I have ever heard from a child or, for that matter, an adult.  She told me how violent beheadings, point blank shootings through the brain and images of mass killings no longer had any impact upon her.  Whatever doubt I may have about any other aspect of her evidence I am entirely satisfied that she was telling the truth about this.  Her demeanour was entirely congruent with her verbal evidence.

I believed that this was the best way for me to be a good Muslim. I believed that the West were responsible for the suffering of Muslims, particularly in Gaza, where innocent people and especially children were being bombed and killed. The UK was implicated in supplying arms. I felt a traitor living in the West. In that sense, I was anti-West as I have already said in my previous statement. I believed that I might be able to study there, for free and that this would enable me to study to become a doctor, which, in turn, would enable me to help others. That was a very attractive promise that was made. However, I wasn&#8217;t sure I would be allowed to study, I think I was already questioning in my mind whether or not that would really happen although  of course I really hoped it would, but I was prepared to forego it as a sacrifice for my religion. I have already said that it was not my primary reason for going and I accept that when I was saying to others that </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">was</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt"> the reason, and the only reason, it was because it sounded better and gave me a &#8216;way out&#8217; of having to explain my support at that time for IS.</span></p>

An example is IS supporters on line used to be really against Shia Muslims. It was like a big argument between them on line and others who joined in the debates. Even though I agreed on Twitter with what they said about Shia&#8217;s, I didn&#8217;t really agree with it in real life as my Mum&#8217;s best friend is Shia, with whom  I have a very close relationship, and she was one of the people I suggested to live with. It was easy to maintain this divide between my real life and my online life as no-one knew me in real life.  So although I ended up trying to go to Syria and it doesn&#8217;t get more real than that, I also think that perhaps in my head there was also a distinction between things happening in the Islamic state and things happening here&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

I have noticed that whilst B is very mature intellectually she is conspicuously immature for her age emotionally.  The reasons for this are obvious, she has had very limited exposure to the world, no experience of socialising with boys.  She is not allowed out of the house unaccompanied.  As I watched her giggle innocently, as her sister gave video link evidence about references to boys in her diary, it reaffirmed my impression, which was foreshadowed in B statements, that something of the allure of Syria was rooted in her perception of its potential for a romantic encounter.  B would vigorously deny this and will not like my including it amongst my observations.  Nonetheless in trying to understand how she has become radicalised I feel constrained to observe that she, like any other teenager, was attracted to social opportunity.  B saw Syria as an opportunity for an adventure and a kind of social freedom.  </p>

The emotional damage she has sustained as a direct consequence of seemingly unlimited access to and viewing of the images discussed above has left her inured to human suffering.  It seems to me therefore, that having damaged such a crucial part of her core humanity, she must be regarded as a significant risk of harm to herself and others.  In her evidence I asked her about some well publicised and notorious killings.  She responded to these questions in the same way that she had described the videos, which I can only relate as revealing a chilling lack of empathy to the victims.  I do not consider it appropriate or necessary for me to identify the particular incidents being considered.  It is this underlying and striking lack of empathy for ordinary human suffering that leads me to conclude that I must continue to regard her as presenting a risk.  To this extent she remains radicalised.  </p>

Most significantly they sought a finding that B was involved in what has been termed &#8216;attack planning&#8217;.  It is inevitably difficult to evaluate the reliability of a 16 year old young person who now, on her own account admits repeated deception to the Court, the Police and a variety of professionals.  All this, coupled with the disassociation with human suffering, leads me to be cautious about making findings generally but, having warned myself in this way, I am satisfied that there is not sufficient evidence to establish this finding to the requisite standard of proof and the Local Authority is correct to abandon it. </p>

Mr Sharpe was clear in his evidence that H revealed that B had tried to convince her to travel to Syria in the course of 2015.   As I have already commented whilst I found Mr Sharpe to be somewhat ponderous at times and lacking a pragmatic social work instinct, I was left in no doubt as to his honesty and integrity.  Where his evidence conflicts with H I unreservedly prefer his. </p>

Mr Sharpe&#8217;s record that H, in effect, played along with B to humour her, unifies these strands of evidence and provides a cogent history.  </p>

Ironically, whilst his integrity appears to be challenged, he is in fact providing real assistance to H, presenting her as resistant to B&#8217;s extremist overtures.  I formed a similar impression, having listened to her evidence.  Like her brothers and like them through her interest in sports, she engages with the world in a healthy and energetic way.  This has provided her, so far, with an immunisation to the radical agenda of her sister.  Similarly, it seems to me, it takes her away from her mother&#8217;s zealous Islamic beliefs.  Nor is she exercised by her father&#8217;s humanitarian interests and so not as likely to be exposed to the death related images that he shares with B.  I find the father though curious about radical Islam is not, himself, motivated by an extremist agenda and as such he is not driven to proselytise.  Accordingly, I think it unlikely that H would be shown the kind of images that B is shown by her father, at least not to anywhere near the same degree.</p>

I intend that a professional, independent of the family, will sit down and explain to the younger children something of what has happened here based on this judgment.  Most importantly I want them to know that B was not placed in care as a &#8216;punishment&#8217; but for her own protection, because her parents had been unable to provide her with a sufficiently safe and nurturing home.  I have an uneasy feeling, despite their protestation to the contrary, that B has been made a scapegoat within the family.  Whilst she undoubtedly bears responsibility for her actions, the greater responsibility lies with her parents, who have let her down badly. Her siblings should know this.</p>

It sounds like a bold ambition but I do not believe it was.  I have in the past seen women who have previously been subjugated in closed communities, flourish and grow with new confidence and self belief, even whilst confined to prison.  I make no apology for repeating that the Court&#8217;s objective was not to &#8216;de-radicalise&#8217; B, which rather repels me as a concept, but to offer her the space and the stimulation to open her mind to alternative possibilities.  </p>

I agree.  In doing so I do not condemn the Local Authority.  They encountered resistance from schools when trying to secure a placement for B.  Opportunities for foster care, always limited for teenagers, were non existent for B.  The consequence was that she has lived for 9 months in very isolated circumstances.  Her access to the internet has been limited and supervised for obvious reasons.  It has not been possible for her to be provided with the degree of tuition she requires to get the AS grades she needs to pursue her chosen career.   In the end she took the decision to abandon this academic year.  I have come to the conclusion that the present arrangements neither address the issues that B faces nor meet the range of her welfare needs to a degree that can be described as satisfactory.  </p>

I disagreed, there is a very limited window of opportunity to achieve anything at all within this process.  The luxury of extensive assessment and reflection is not available.  I asked Mr and Mrs J to attend and they gave evidence.  They are a delightful couple, they have full lives and they have brought up their own children, one of whom is practising as a doctor.  On the face of it they have much to offer.  B is polite and respectful to them and would clearly prefer to live there than in her present circumstances.  </p>

Though they have read my earlier judgment, which is expressed in plain and uncompromising language, I repeatedly sensed that they regarded this family as in some way victimised.  It is positive that their relationship with the family has not been weakened by the criminal investigations or the findings in the Family Court but it is, perhaps, a little surprising.  Both Mr &amp; Mrs J have a strong faith and are highly motivated to help.  </p>

This would be challenging enough even were it predicated on a clear understanding of the nature of the contemplated risk but absent that, it strikes me as a very tall order.  Thus, on careful analysis, whilst B maybe afforded protection from the fact of Mr &amp; Mrs J&#8217;s location, I do not think she will be effectively defended from parental influence.  Indeed, I consider it would be much harder, in this scenario, for the Local Authority effectively to monitor the situation.  </p>

For the duration of the Care Order i.e. until she is 18 (in just over 12 month&#8217;s time) I think it unlikely that B would do so.  To some extent, her experience of the Court system has been salutary.  After that I do not know.  She will be beyond my remit and able to exercise her own adult autonomy.  Should she return to her parents home at that point and there may be pressure for her to do so, she will once again interrupt her education and potentially damage her academic prospects.  Though it may not seem the obvious solution, in the light of my findings above, I have come to the conclusion that the plan most likely to meet B&#8217;s needs is to return her home.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The issue of community is certainly strongly felt with regard to online environments. Islamic State is a &#8216;young persons&#8217; movement and the use of technology is authentic to its members. Online material is highly gendered using particular motifs to exalt behaviours and traits. For women modesty, piety and complementarity with men is emphasised through images of a lion and lioness, or a &#8216;green bird&#8217;, images of romantic love do emerge, but these are presented as the &#8216;beginning&#8217; of a new life rather than an end in itself. Online recruitment frequently relies on existing &#8216;real-world&#8217; contacts, but not always. Increasingly non-public platforms are being used - such as telegram, and WhatsApp. Public forums are used for general propaganda and maintaining community and a sense of belonging - having your twitter account suspended is valued and seen as an achievement and celebrated.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="40">

	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Islamic State are increasingly suspicious of unsolicited requests, and some reports suggest they require a &#8216;recommendation&#8217; from a &#8216;known&#8217;/&#8216;trusted&#8217; individual. Peer-to-Peer recruiters also encourage young women to distrust friends and family or &#8216;traditional&#8217; authority figures, arguing &#8216;they don&#8217;t understand&#8217;. Moreover they argue that those in the West, follow an Islam that has been &#8216;perverted&#8217; by culture and traditions that are not Islamic, or that those in authority have become corrupted by working for European authorities. On line recruitment is now noticeably female-to-female - in the past some men were actively seeking to recruit women as future wives but this has been noticeably declined.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="41">

	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> There is however a significant body of unique material produced every day that is retweeted, posted on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and other platforms. The material focuses on life in Islamic State, presenting an idealised vision of &#8216;ordinary life&#8217;, the new rules and regulations of Islamic State, new areas of interest and promotional material. This material focuses on the failings of western states to allow Muslims to live according to their faith, it points to the violence of Western governments and state agencies against Muslims, it emphasises the faults of Muslims who adopt alternative understandings of Islamic history and way of life - particularly targeting Shia and Sufis. The material is replete with de-contextualised verses from the Quran and the Hadith (stories of the Prophet Mohammed&#8217;s life). The material offers a utopian vision  of itself - it identifies a problem with the world and living in the West, it presents an awe inspiring and grand solution (itself) and argues that young Muslims are responsible for its realisation and offers &#8216;hope&#8217; for a future. There is an underlying tension with this approach where it emphasises a new &#8216;good life&#8217; for potential recruits while simultaneously highlighting their belief in an imminent apocalypse. However this does not render IS a &#8216;death cult&#8217; rather death and violence is for a purpose - the protection of the new proto-state, and its &#8216;citizens&#8217;.  </span></p>

The range of factors involved is extensive, and the result is that the radicalisation process is complex and varied. Radicalisation itself is not a fixed state, but is dynamic, and changing events and factors can deepen radicalisation or bring about de-radicalisation.</span></p>
