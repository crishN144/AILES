	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.65in">This is an application for a reporting restriction order arising out of care proceedings conducted before the Bristol Family Proceedings Court. The proceedings themselves were relatively straightforward but, in the course of the hearing, information came to light which gave rise to concerns of an unusual nature. Journalists at the Sun newspaper became aware of these developments and in the light of their interest it became necessary to consider what restrictions, if any, should be imposed upon the publication of information relating to the proceedings over and above the prohibitions imposed by statute. The Family Proceedings Court referred this matter to the Designated Family Judge for Bristol who made a temporary order and referred the matter to me as Family Division Liaison Judge for the Western Circuit. At that point, the local authority filed an application for a reporting restriction order.</p>

Nevertheless, for reasons explained below, it was necessary to hold three hearings on the outstanding issues. I now set out my reasons for making the order in the terms recited at the end of this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.65in">The care proceedings concerned an application by Bristol City Council for a care order in respect of a five year old girl, hereafter referred to as &#8216;A&#8217;. The respondents to the proceedings were the child&#8217;s mother, (&#8216;C&#8217;), her father, (&#8216;B&#8217;) and A herself by her child&#8217;s guardian, hereafter referred to as &#8216;Mr N&#8217;. The application was heard by the Bristol Family Proceedings Court between 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> &#8211; 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.65in">For the purposes of this judgment, it is unnecessary to recite the factual history leading to the care proceedings in any detail. In short, the local authority asserted, and the Family Proceedings Court, found that (1) A&#8217;s father, B, has a propensity to acts of violence, in particular in a domestic setting; (2) A&#8217;s mother, C, is isolated and vulnerable, disempowered and prone to manipulation at the hands of B; (3) A has witnessed significant acts of aggression and violence by her father towards her mother and his former partner, and (4) this caused her significant emotional harm and placed her at risk of physical harm.</p>

Having considered the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 1</ref> of the Children Act, the Family Proceedings Court proceeded to make a care order in respect of A. The Justices then considered the application by the local authority for a placement order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> and, having dispensed with the parents&#8217; consent to such an order on the grounds that A&#8217;s welfare required an order to be made, and having considered the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, duly made a placement order in respect of A.</p>

As soon as A disclosed the assault and the contact worker noted the injuries, she should have informed A&#8217;s social worker, Ms Pritchard, or the emergency duty team. No such report was made and it was left to B, A&#8217;s father, to make the referral via the police. The bench does not consider that the local authority has been involved in a cover up which has been suggested by B.</p>

The foster mother denied the allegation on R&#8217;s behalf immediately. Having already been aware of the difficulties in the placement and of A&#8217;s fear of R, the authorities should not have allowed A to return to the foster home whilst the allegation was unresolved and it is reasonable to suppose that this increased the risk to A. We believe an immediate strategy meeting should have been called and A&#8217;s guardian should have been involved. It is a matter of very great concern that Mr N, A&#8217;s guardian, was not told by Miss Pritchard of the allegation at an earlier stage. </p>

In the event, the matter did not proceed on that date and I extended the order made by Judge Barclay until the adjourned hearing. Thereafter, there were extensive negotiations between the parties to the care proceedings and the Sun&#8217;s publishers, News Group Newspapers Ltd (&#8220;NGN&#8221;).  Initially, the local authority advanced a case for a complete prohibition on publishing not only any information likely to lead to the identification of A, her natural parents and carers, but also anything at all relating to the care proceedings or any information likely to identify the authority itself. An initial skeleton argument on behalf of the authority asserted inter alia that there was no public interest in the publication of the allegations about pornography in the foster home, nor the &#8220;unsubstantiated allegations of negligent social work practice made by the parents&#8221;. NGN responded in correspondence that the proposed order was far too wide and indicating that it wished to publish reports of the Family Proceedings Court hearing and sought a relaxation of the statutory prohibition on such publication to achieve that end, identifying a list of twelve items of information it wished to publish. Subsequently, following the instruction of Mr. Robin Tolson QC on its behalf, and senior managers becoming involved for the first time, the local authority changed its position, agreeing in principle that NGN should be free to publish some information about the case, including the identity of the local authority itself, whilst challenging some of the detailed information in the &#8220;twelve items&#8221;. Thus a measure of agreement was reached about many aspects of the scope of a reporting restriction order, although a number of issues remained in dispute. </p>

However, having reflected on the matter, I considered that there were several other issues that had not been addressed at the hearing, in particular the extent to which the human rights of the members of the foster household were engaged and whether there were any procedural steps which should be taken to address, and if necessary, protect those rights. In addition, other issues had been raised by some of the parties via email following the hearing.

Newspaper editors have the final decision on what is of interest to the public: judges have the final decision on what it is in the public interest to publish&#8221; (per Tugendhat J. in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodwin v NGN Ltd and VBN</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2011/1437" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 1437 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1437 (QB)</ref> at paragraph 2). On the other hand, it is for editors, not judges, to decide <span style="font-style:italic">how </span>a story should be reported. &#8220;Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European Court holds that Article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">News Verlags GmbH &amp; Co KG v Austria</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 31 EHRR 8" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 31 EHRR 8</ref> &#8230;.

The foster mother was not a party to the proceedings in the Family Proceedings Court and no member of the household was called to give oral evidence, yet the justices heard allegations about the conduct of members of the household and made some observations about that conduct. As these observations were made without an opportunity to either the foster mother or any other member of her household to comment on or make representations, it was by Miss Harris submitted that their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 has been infringed. In response, Mr. Wolanski on behalf of NGN pointed out that it was very common for individuals to be mentioned in passing in reports of court proceedings without being represented. Such reports did not amount to an infringement of Article 6 rights.</p>

In particular, it was agreed between the parties that a reporting restriction order should be made to protect the identification of A. The parties agreed that there is no public interest in the identification of A in any published report and indeed there would be a risk of further harm to the child were her name to be published. On behalf of her guardian, Mr Fuller rightly submits that A is vulnerable by reason of her age and in particular by reason of being in care. She is in urgent need of a secure permanent placement. Were her identity to become known through reporting of this case, she, and any persons involved in her care both now and in the future, would be at risk of becoming the object of media interest. Mr Fuller submits that a reporting restriction order that precluded any naming of A would be a proportionate interference in the Article 10 rights of the media since it would not prohibit the telling of the story, but only its telling in a way that revealed the identity of the child. In his submissions on behalf of NGN, Mr Wolanski indicated that his clients have no wish to identify A in the publication of any information relating to the proceedings that may be permitted by this court. </p>

Initially, the local authority firmly opposed this course. Ultimately, however, all parties have come to agree that the redacted version of the facts and reasons should be published. The argument advanced by the father&#8217;s team is that this case has demonstrated a systemic failure in the local authority&#8217;s children and young people&#8217;s services and that it is in the public interest, and indeed in A&#8217;s interests, for the relevant information to be published. Mr Marks on behalf of the father submitted that the Family Proceedings Court had set out many shortcomings on behalf of the local authority in the facts and reasons amounting to a failure by the local authority to follow its own child protection procedures. </p>

Nevertheless, they are an important record of findings made by the justices and an explanation for the reasons for making a care order. The magistrates have a vital role in the family justice system in this country, a role that will inevitably increase in importance under the modernisation reforms to be implemented shortly. Where, as here, a Family Proceedings Court identifies matters of general concern about the way in which the local authority has performed its statutory child protection duties, it is, to my mind, manifestly in the public interest for there to be wider dissemination of the justices&#8217; concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I am fortified by the views of the magistrates themselves who indicated to this court that they would welcome the publication of a properly redacted version of the facts and reasons given in this case.</p>

The information concerned is set out in a schedule which has been prepared by Mr Wolanski, to be exhibited to the order. In short, it includes the circumstances in which the journalist from the Sun attended the hearing at the magistrates&#8217; court, the making the order by Judge Barclay, the initial position adopted by the local authority in respect of the application for a reporting restriction order, and the subsequent course of the negotiations concerning the terms of the order. In my judgment, it is in the public interest for these matters to be published. It is axiomatic that, save in exceptional circumstances, any application for a reporting restriction order should be made on notice to the media. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S. 12 (2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> provides: &#8216;if the person against whom the application for relief is made (&#8216;the respondent&#8217;) is neither present nor represented, no such relief is to be granted unless the court is satisfied (a) that the applicant has taken all practicable steps to notify the respondent; or (b) that there are compelling reasons why the respondent should not be identified.&#8217; This statutory provision is reinforced by the President&#8217;s Direction and CAFCASS Practice Note of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2005 which provides for a system of service of applications for a reporting restriction order on the national media via the Press Association&#8217;s CopyDirect service. The President&#8217;s Direction further states: &#8216;the court will bear in mind that legal advisors to the media&#8230;are used to participating in hearings at very short notice where necessary&#8230;.service of applications via the CopyDirect service should hence forth be the norm. The court retains the power to make without notice orders, but such cases will be exceptional, and an order will always give persons affected the liberty to apply at short notice.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">I can see no justification for the failure in this case to give notice to the media prior to the hearing before Judge Barclay. A representative of the Sun newspaper was actually present in the Family Proceedings Court in Bristol at the point when the parties&#8217; representatives were appearing before Judge Barclay in the Civil Justice Centre. At the very least, that reporter should have been informed of the proposed application to Judge Barclay so that he could have attended the hearing to make representations. In truth, however, I can see no good reason why proper notice of the hearing was not given in accordance with the President&#8217;s Direction. I have observed elsewhere that there is a danger that those who practice in the family justice system fail to give proper consideration to the Article 10 rights of the media. It is not the first time that an ex parte order has been made without notice to the media in circumstances which could not be described as exceptional. This must now cease. The media are undoubtedly and rightly aggrieved by this practice. In my judgment it is in the public interest for NGN to be entitled to publish its account of the failure to give proper notice in this case.</p>

Subsequently, the local authority has sensibly modified its position and adopted a constructive and conciliatory approach. In his initial skeleton argument for the hearings before me, Mr Tolson accepted that there is a legitimate public interest in the reporting of the actions of the local authority in response to the crisis in the foster home. Furthermore, the local authority no longer seeks to conceal its own identify from such publications.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The major issue is the extent to which the members of the foster household should be mentioned or identified in any publication or information relating to these proceedings. This issue emerged gradually over the course of the hearings before me. At first, all parties were agreed that, whilst all individuals in the foster home should be anonymised, their status and relationship to each other should continue to be described as set out in the unredacted facts and reasons of the Justices. After the conclusion of the hearing on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, however, I formed the view that insufficient attention had been paid to this issue. Specifically, there had been in inadequate focus on the human rights of members of the foster household and the extent to which those rights were infringed by the proposed publications. I therefore invited the parties to consider whether there were any further procedural steps that should have been taken to address and, if necessary, protect the human rights of all other persons in the foster household in May 2012. I further directed to the parties to consider a range of options as to the extent to which the other individuals should be identified, ranging from identifying them by reference to their status and relationships through to omitting any reference to them at all. Subsequently, as described above, solicitor and counsel were instructed on behalf of the foster mother and participated at the telephone hearing on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">On behalf of the foster mother, Miss Harris made no application for permission to file any evidence in support of her position but instead simply relied on the arguments set out in her clear and thorough written skeleton supplemented by oral submissions. She identified two particular pieces of information in relation to which publication was sought and which caused concern to her client, namely what she described as &#8216;the alleged assault&#8217; and &#8216;the alleged cuddle&#8217;. She submitted that the greatest concern in respect of both pieces of information was that they were recorded in the facts and reasons following a hearing in which neither the foster mother nor any other member of the household played any part. They had no knowledge that any other allegation against them was going to be explored and had no opportunity to answer them or put a contrary case.  Miss Harris submitted that the justices should not have reached any conclusions, even provisional conclusions, when the evidence was presented in such an unbalanced and such an evidentially unsafe way. She further submitted that there can be no public interest in publishing unproved allegations in respect of individuals in circumstances where the way in which the allegations were considered was flawed. The publication of mere allegations did not present an accurate picture where no balancing information was provided. In addition, Miss Harris asserted on behalf of her client, that A&#8217;s truthfulness was questionable so that to publish an allegation that comes from an unreliable source would make the intrusion into the private lives of the members of the household even less justifiable. Furthermore, she submitted that, insofar as there is an ongoing investigation conducted by the local authority, that process could be prejudiced by publication of the facts and reasons. Miss Harris asserted that the real public interest lay in the failings of the local authority. The details of the allegations concerning individuals in the household did not significantly add to the public interest in publication. Miss Harris accordingly submitted that the reporting should be restricted so as to omit all reference to the other individuals in the household. </p>

In other respects, however, Mr Fuller endorsed the submissions made on behalf of the foster mother that there was a public interest in concealing the relationship of the other individuals in the house since, given the likely press interest in the inquest, such a publication was likely in due course to lead to the identification of the individuals and a degree of intrusion in their lives which would inevitably add to their distress. Mr Fuller submitted that the reporting of the existence of these other individuals was neither proportionate nor important. He submitted that the real story in this case was not about the way in which the alleged assault was investigated but, rather, the concerns over pornography. As a result there was no need for any other individual in the household to be exposed in connection with such a story.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The foster mother&#8217;s position was opposed by A&#8217;s parents and by NGN. On behalf of A&#8217;s father, it was submitted that the issues raised by the justices in their facts and reasons are serious; that the status of the person alleged to have assaulted A within the household was a key aspect of the public interest in the case since it may have influenced the local authority&#8217;s approach to the investigation; and the allegations made against individuals in a position of trust should be looked at with the same rigour as the allegations against the parents that formed the basis of the care proceedings. The substance of the case against the local authority was that this matter has not been properly investigated, and in order to explain the seriousness of that matter it was necessary to identify the position of the alleged assailant within the household. On behalf of the mother, Mrs Wiltshire submitted that, there was a significant public interest in extending the extent of the information to be published to include details of the status of the relevant individuals within the foster household. She submitted that the danger of identification of the individuals was not significantly increased by publishing details of their status within the household. Not to publish that information would be to conceal relevant and important information from the public when there was no real or increased danger of their being identified as a result. In oral submissions, Mrs Wiltshire emphasised that the magistrates&#8217; facts and reasons referred to the allegation of assault as an allegation and did not purport to make any findings as to the truth thereof.</p>

He submitted that it was potentially misleading for any report to recount the allegations concerned individuals in the foster home without reference to their status or position in that household. He endorsed the submission made on behalf of the father that the fact the allegations concerned persons with a particular position and status in the household may have affected the manner in which the local authority dealt with the allegation to the detriment of A. In oral submissions, he pointed out that the justices considered all the circumstances were concerning and should be the subject of further investigation. To exclude any of those concerns from published reports of the facts and reasons would be wrong. He did not accept that there was any potential prejudice to the investigation to be carried out by the local authority. He acknowledged that there is a risk that, if the published reports refer to the status and relationship of members of the foster household, and subsequent reports of the inquest identify the foster father by name, it was possible that the names of the members of the household might be identified by what is sometimes called &#8220;jigsaw&#8221; identification (that is to say by someone piecing together the different published reports). However, this risk could be dealt with by a subsequent order in respect of reports of the inquest.</p>

That infringement is compounded by the fact that those individuals were given no opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them in the course of the hearing before the Family Proceedings Court. I accept that it is, of course, very common for third parties to be mentioned in the course of court proceedings, but in my experience it is unusual for a court to make findings, even provisional findings, on allegations against persons who were neither present nor represented. The publication of information which identified the status and relationships of those individuals would, in all the circumstances, be an infringement of their rights under Article 8. Furthermore, given the very strong likelihood that the foster father will be identified in published reports of the forthcoming inquest, I consider it probable that, were this court to permit publication of the status and relationship of the other individuals allegedly involved in the &#8216;alleged assault&#8217; and &#8216;alleged cuddle&#8217; incidents, albeit on an anonymised basis, the identity of those individuals would become known in due course, as a result of a process of &#8216;jigsaw&#8217; identification after the publication of reports of the inquest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Of course, the Article 8 rights of those individuals must be balanced against the Article 10 rights to freedom of expression. I accept it is in the public interest for the media to report the concerns expressed by the justices in their facts and reasons at the conclusion of the care proceedings. But applying the necessary intense focus to that right of freedom of expression, and looking carefully at the concerns set out in the Justices&#8217; facts and reasons, it seems to me that the status and relationship of the individuals allegedly involved in the alleged &#8216;assault&#8217; and alleged &#8216;cuddle&#8217; are not key aspects of the account. The gravamen of the concerns set out in the facts and reasons can be summarised as follows. (1) A alleged that she had been assaulted by an individual in her foster home. (2) She alleged that the assault took place at 2 am when the foster mother was downstairs and another foster child was being cuddled by another individual in the bedroom upstairs. (3) At that stage, it was already suspected by the authorities that pornography was present on a computer in the foster home. (4) Despite knowing of these concerns, the local authority failed to carry out a proper investigation and failed to remove the foster children from the foster home for over a week. (5) Following the seizure of the computer and the removal of the foster children from the home, the foster father died suddenly, apparently by his own hand. In my judgment, the status and relationship of the individuals involved in the alleged &#8216;assault&#8217; and alleged &#8216;cuddle&#8217; incident are of marginal importance. </p>

The grounds advanced for concealing the names are significantly limited. On behalf of the local authority, Mr Tolson simply submits that there is no public interest in the identification of the social workers and that the publication of their names would increase the risk that A&#8217;s identity will become known more widely. It is notable that the local authority does not put forward a range of arguments that have been advanced in other cases in support of applications to prevent publication of the names of social workers &#8211; see in particular <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">BBC v Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and X and Y</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2862" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2862 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2862 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 101" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 101</ref>, per Ryder J, and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v Ward</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/16" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 16 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 16 (Fam)</ref>, a decision of Munby J, as he then was. Thus, in this case the local authority does not argue that publication of the names of the social workers would increase the difficulty in recruiting and retaining social work staff, or increase the risk of harassment and vilification of the social workers and their families so that their Article 8 rights would be infringed. Such arguments have generally not found favour with the courts, as the judgments of Ryder J in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Rochdale</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>case and Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v Ward</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>demonstrate, and are not advanced in this case.

They submit that it would be in the public interest for as much information as possible to be known about how, and by whom, the child protection decisions in this case were made.

There is no evidence to support Mr. Tolson&#8217;s assertion that there is an increased risk of A being identified if the social worker&#8217;s names are published. Mr Fuller&#8217;s submission is more precise, but in my judgment the risk of any significant extension of the identification of A as a result of the naming of the social workers is minimal. I accept the importance of maintaining A&#8217;s privacy, in particular having regard to her very acute needs, but I do not consider that publication of the social workers&#8217; names would lead to any significant infringement of her rights to private life. On the other hand, I agree with the submission that there is a clear public interest in facilitating an open discussion of the issues relating to child protection and fostering that arise in this case. In all the circumstances, I find no evidence of any pressing social need for a restricting exercise of the right to freedom of expression on that issue. </p>

He told the court that his clients struggled with the concept that two reports, neither which identified A, would lead to her identification to anyone who did not already know who she was. Mr Wolanski further submitted that there was no suggestion that the inquest would be prejudiced by the publication of the fact, or assertion, that the foster carer had committed suicide.

In negotiations, the parents&#8217; representatives had indicated that their clients wished to be entitled to use that word in talking about the case. In a letter in the course of negotiations, the local authority asserts: &#8220;the local authority is very concerned about the use of the word &#8216;strangled&#8217;. There is no credible evidence that anyone tried to strangle the child. We believe it is the child&#8217;s father and his representatives who have used the term. It was not the local authority&#8221;.
