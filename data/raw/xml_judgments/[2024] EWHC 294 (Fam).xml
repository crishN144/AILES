The power to make an order of the court's own initiative without hearing the parties or giving them an opportunity to make representations does not extend as was done here to engagement in that procedure at the outset of a hearing in which the parties were in attendance all the more so in expectation of procedural and no other steps.  It is plainly a power to be exercised as an alternative to a hearing and in the proper case such as an emergency or where there is little or no apparent contest anticipated to the exercise of the court's powers. It is not likely to be an appropriate power to be exercised where the outcome is a deprivation of liberty in circumstances where there is a serious issue or potential issue whether that is appropriate and so where Articles 5 and 6 are potentially both engaged.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The Court of Protection has extensive case management powers. The Court of Protection Rules do not include an express power to strike out a statement of case or to give summary judgment, but such powers are provided for in the Civil Procedure Rules, which apply in any case not provided for so far as necessary to further the overriding objective. The overriding objective is to deal with a case justly having regard to the principles contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (Court of Protection Rules 2007, rule 3(1)). Dealing with a case justly includes dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues and allocating to it an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources (rule 3(3)(c) and (f)). The Court will further the overriding objective by actively managing cases (rule 5(1)). This includes encouraging the parties to co-operate with one another in the conduct of the proceedings, identifying the issues at an early stage, deciding promptly which issues need a full investigation and hearing and which do not, and encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if appropriate (rule 5(2)(a), (b)(i), (c)(i), and (e)). The court&#8217;s general powers of case management include a power to exclude any issue from consideration and to take any step or give any direction for the purpose of managing the case and furthering the overriding objective (rule 25(j) and (m)). It was held in KD and LD v Havering London Borough Council <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1393" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1393</ref> that the court may determine a case summarily of its own motion, but their power &#8220;must be exercised appropriately and with a modicum of restraint&#8221;.</p>

The language of the Judgment itself, to my mind, answers this question in phrases such as &#8220;I very much doubt&#8230;. I am very sceptical&#8230;. The practicalities are&#8230;. likely to be extremely difficult&#8230;.&#8221; I share the Judge&#8217;s scepticism and I also very much doubt that even with an extensive package of support a return home will be in CB&#8217;s best interest. I note too that Dr Ajiteru expressed himself in cautious terms (see para 10 above). However, scepticism and &#8220;doubt&#8221; is not sufficient to discount a proper enquiry in to such a fundamental issue of individual liberty.</p>

She will have recognised, as do I, that the effluxion of time has had its own impact on the viability of the options in this case.  However, what is involved here is nothing less than CB&#8217;s liberty. Curtailing, restricting or depriving any adult of such a fundamental freedom will always require cogent evidence and proper enquiry. I cannot envisage any circumstances where it would be right to determine such issues on the basis of speculation and general experience in other cases&#8221;.</p>
