	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>AB, the Applicant in these proceedings, is the brother of CD.  CD died two years ago.  AB is the personal representative of his deceased brother&#8217;s estate.  AB understands that, some five or more years prior to his death, CD made arrangements for the Respondent fertility clinic (&#8220;BC&#8221;) in England for the freezing and storage of his sperm.  Following CD&#8217;s death, AB, as his personal representative, has requested the fertility clinic to provide him with a copy of all records relating to the arrangements for the storage and use of CD&#8217;s sperm and/or any embryos created using his sperm.  The clinic, conscious of the need to maintain confidentiality unless there is a clear duty of disclosure, has declined that request.  AB has therefore applied to this court for a declaration as to the lawfulness of the request and an order requiring the clinic to disclose the relevant records. </p>

AB&#8217;s application was made to the High Court, Family Division by a &#8220;Application Notice&#8221; under Part 18 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8220;FPR 2010&#8221;).  At the commencement of the hearing of the application, it was necessary to consider the jurisdictional and procedural context, in part in order to determine whether the application was &#8220;family proceedings&#8221; to which, therefore, FPR 2010 applied or &#8220;civil proceedings&#8221; to which the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (&#8220;CPR 1998&#8221;) applied. </p>

Ms Richards has told the court that under the CPR 1998 it may be possible to issue an application for the required relief under Part 7 or Part 8.  Alternatively, outside the FPR 2010 an application might be made to the Family Court by an Originating Summons and, certainly with respect to the application to engage the inherent jurisdiction, an Originating Summons would be the appropriate procedural channel to commence proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Respondent&#8217;s subsidiary argument is to the effect that a grant of probate does not, of itself, entitle a personal representative to stand in the shoes of a deceased and request disclosure of medical records under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref>A(5) as the grant of probate does not vest the estate in the personal representative. This argument, which was not advanced in detail in oral submissions, does not, with respect, have any relevance to the present application which is made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref>A(2)(r) and not under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref>A(5). By <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref>A(2)(r), the prohibition on disclosure in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref>A(1) is disapplied with respect to disclosure that &#8216;is made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/23/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/23" uk:canonical="1990 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AHRA 1990</ref>&#8217;. This application is one that is made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/23" uk:canonical="1990 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AHRA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/23/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3</ref> where, by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/23/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref>(f), for the reasons that I have given, a &#8216;personal representative&#8217; may make an application for access to the health record of a patient who has died. A personal representative is expressly identified as a category of applicant. There is no requirement for that individual to prove that the deceased&#8217;s estate has vested in them. All that is required is for that individual to establish that they are deceased patient&#8217;s &#8216;personal representative&#8217; and there is no dispute in the present case that AB does, indeed, have that status. </p>

He has made a valid application for disclosure of the deceased&#8217;s medical records held by the Respondent clinic, subject to the agreement that information relating to, or provided by, third parties should, at least at this stage, be redacted. Under the terms of the legislation the clinic was obliged to provide the disclosure that was sought. </p>
