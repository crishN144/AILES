On 25 January 2019 Roberts J ordered the mother to file and serve copies of her asylum application, all evidence in support of her asylum claim, her asylum interview and all of the decisions of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.  On that date, no objection was raised by the mother to such disclosure and the documents were provided to the father&#8217;s solicitors in accordance with the order of Roberts J.  However, subsequently the mother <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> raise objection to the disclosure of documents from the asylum process.  This appears to have been based on the mother&#8217;s concern that the documentation contained names and pictures of people who had provided information which could compromise the safety of themselves and their families.  At a hearing on 9 April 2019, and in light of her objection, the mother&#8217;s asylum documentation was returned to her and the issue of disclosure of the asylum documentation was listed for determination before HHJ Corbett. </p>

Within this context, Mr Payne submitted that it is vital for the effective functioning of the asylum system that such persons are able to engage fully with the authorities in this jurisdiction and to provide all the information necessary to ensure their international protection in an appropriate case. In the circumstances, Mr Payne submits that the confidentiality of the asylum process is the bedrock on which the trust that that process must engender in order to be effective firmly rests. </p>

Within this context, Mr Payne highlights the fact that asylum seekers are informed when they claim asylum that the information they provide will be kept confidential and will only be disclosed where there is a requirement in law to do so.  Mr Payne further contends that, in circumstances where asylum examinations are conducted in private, the asylum seeker has a reasonable expectation of privacy.   </p>

He further accepts on behalf of the Secretary of State that the duty of fairness is not only applicable to immigration decisions but to proceedings within the family court.  In this context, Mr Payne submits that in determining whether disclosure and inspection should be ordered, the court must balance competing rights of the father under Arts 6 and 8, and of the mother under Arts 2, 3 and 8, of the ECHR together with what Mr Payne submits is the overwhelming public interest in not providing documents from the asylum process.  In this context, Mr Payne relies on the decision of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M </span>as representing the proper approach to the balancing exercise, Mr Payne submitting that Hayden J appropriately identified the need to protect the asylum process generally and the need for care going behind any decision of the Secretary of State or the First Tier Tribunal that a person is at risk of persecution and entitled to international protection.  </p>

Mr Payne submits that to conclude otherwise would undermine the certainty of the assurance of confidentiality given to asylum seekers and thereby fundamentally undermine the central foundation of the asylum process.  Within this context, Mr Payne submits that any exception to the principle that information is not provided to the alleged persecutor created for the purpose of domestic proceedings relating to children would have a fundamental impact on the asylum process more widely, not least because it would require the promulgation of publicly available guidance alerting asylum seekers to the possibility of information being given to the alleged persecutor if required for the purpose of proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>

Further, even if, exceptionally, such disclosure and inspection were ordered, Mr Payne submits that the court should only (a) itself see the material and adopt an approach which ensures no evidence, question or submissions are made which are misleading or based on a premise known (from the asylum material) to be false (by analogy with <span style="font-style:italic">R (Secretary of State for the Home Department) v Inner West London Assistant Coroner </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 WLR 2564" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 WLR 2564</ref>), (b) invite the Children&#8217;s Guardian to consider the material or (c) use a closed material procedure and appoint a Special Advocate.   </p>

He submitted that the court has before it the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (which included a finding that the mother had given a consistent account of the abuse she alleges), the asylum refusal letter and a medical report, resulting in the parties being aware of &#8220;key aspects&#8221; of the account provided in the asylum claim, which can be compared to the assertions made by the mother in these proceedings.  Within this context, Mr Payne submits that it cannot be said that non-disclosure would give rise to a grave risk of harm to the child.  Further, Mr Payne argues that the father has not identified any <span style="font-style:italic">particular</span> factor in this case that justifies disclosure and inspection beyond the argument that he faces serious allegations in respect of which credibility is central. </p>

Whilst Mr Hames confirmed that the mother now has, it is believed, the totality of the documents but submits that in circumstances where they remain documents from the asylum process they must also remain subject to the principles that govern the disclosure and inspection of such documents, notwithstanding that the mother is under a duty of &#8216;full and frank disclosure&#8217; in the Children Act proceedings. Mr Hames submits that in these circumstances the mother is entitled to object to their disclosure and inspection even in circumstances where the documents are <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie </span>relevant based on the fact that confidentiality is at the heart of the asylum system.   </p>

In this respect, Mr Hames again emphasises Hayden J&#8217;s observation that the asylum process is a system fretted with confidentiality and that confidentiality is intrinsic to the operation of the entire system.  As did Mr Payne, Mr Hames likewise relies on Arts 22 and 41 of the EU Directive as reinforcing the principle that no disclosure should be made to an alleged persecutor.  Indeed, at times Mr Hames appeared to argue that in such circumstances confidentiality should be upheld even if that means evidence that impacts on the welfare of the child is not disclosed, such is the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the asylum system.   </p>

He further submits that ordinarily, again relying on the decision of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>the question of disclosure and inspection should be determined by the Secretary of State.  </p>

Mr Hames submits however, that the father already has sufficient evidence with respect to the mother&#8217;s position in the asylum process, in particular in the form of the First Tier Tribunal judgment and the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision.  Within this context, Mr Hames relies on the conclusion of HHJ Corbett that the father has the benefit of far more than just the &#8220;gist&#8221; of the mother&#8217;s account in the asylum process.  In the circumstances, and given the weight to be attached to the confidentiality of the asylum process, Mr Hames contends that no further disclosure is justified or should take place. </p>

Obviously, such information should not be disclosed to those who have persecuted the applicant and this consideration under lies article 22 of the Procedures Directive. It provides: </p>

On the contrary, the stipulation is that it should not be disclosed to alleged actors of persecution and the injunction against its disclosure is specifically related to the process of examination of individual cases. The defendant&#8217;s case had been examined and his application had been refused. The trigger for such confidentiality as article 22 provides for was simply not present.  </p>

But neither article 22 nor article 41 provides support for that claim. Article 22 is framed for a specific purpose and in a deliberately precise way. To imply into its provisions a general duty to keep confidential all material supplied in support of an asylum application would unwarrantably enlarge its scope beyond its obvious intended purpose.  </p>

Art 6 requires that each party must be afforded an equal opportunity to present their case, including their evidence, under conditions that do not place them at a substantial disadvantage. This includes the right to the disclosure of relevant documents (see <span style="font-style:italic">Feldbrugge v The Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1986) 8 EHRR 425" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">(1986) 8 EHRR 425</ref>). The right to a fair trial thus demands that, ordinarily, all relevant documents and information be before the court (<span style="font-style:italic">Re D (Adoption Reports: Confidentiality)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 687" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 687</ref>).  By reason of their central importance within a democratic society, the rights enshrined in Art 6 as a whole must be given a broad and purposive interpretation (<span style="font-style:italic">Delcourt v Belgium</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1970) 1 EHRR 355" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">(1970) 1 EHRR 355</ref> at [25]).

Within this context, Art 8 may be the subject of interreference if a parent is not able fairly to advance a case before a court for the effective implementation of that right.  In the circumstances, the rights under Art 8 also include the right to disclosure of information relevant to issues before the court that engage Art 8 (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (P) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R (Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1122" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1122</ref>), subject to the usual principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.

Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the outset of the proceedings, Mr Devereux and Ms Chaudhry argued strongly that the appropriate procedural framework for consideration of disclosure and inspection was through the Secretary of State asserting public interest immunity over the documents in issue and the court determining a public interest immunity application.  Latterly however, Mr Devereux and Ms Chaudhry were prepared to accept on behalf of the father the process proposed by Mr Edwards founded on the provisions of FPR 2010 r 21.3 provided that this resulted in a structured, clear and fair process. This was a sensible concession in circumstances where not all cases in which a public authority seeks exemption from disclosure and inspection on public interest grounds will be cases of public interest immunity in the strict sense (see <span style="font-style:italic">Durham County Council v Dunn</span> at [22]) and where, in my judgment, FPR r 21.3 provides the appropriate procedural framework for disputes concerning disclosure and inspection in private law proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> of documents from the asylum process that are in the possession of a party to those proceedings. </p>

Within this context, FPR r 21.3 is in my judgment particularly suited to dealing with asylum documents in the possession of a party to private law proceedings who asserts that those documents are confidential or private, but where the disclosure and inspection of those documents will also likely raise issues of public interest.   </p>

The mother has filed in these proceedings a schedule of those allegations and it is clear from the documentation that is before the court with respect to the asylum process that those allegations are the same as those made by the mother during the course of her claim for asylum, namely that the father was a perpetrator of serial domestic violence and sexually abused H in [country given].  In addition, the position at present is that the previous bodies that have been required to consider these allegations (the Secretary of State and then the First Tier Tribunal) did not make specific findings with respect to the allegations of domestic abuse, the conclusions that were drawn were not determined to the standard of proof that applies in these proceedings, the father strongly disputes the allegations made by the mother (and positively asserts they are fabricated) and the nature of the allegations is such that if found proved they will have an impact on the future determination of the child&#8217;s welfare, in respect of which the court is seised.

I am satisfied that in this case the court cannot simply conclude, without seeing the disputed material, that the availability of information in an alternative format, namely the decision of the Secretary of State and the decision of the First Tier Tribunal, negates the need for any further disclosure because that material details, and assesses the validity of the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">[56] The Secretary of State&#8217;s submission is not supported by any authority. In fact, as the helpful observations from Black LJ (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> (see paragraph 32 above) demonstrate, the approach to risk assessment in a family case is a different exercise from that undertaken in the context of immigration and asylum. The family court has a duty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref>, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to &#8216;have regard to all the circumstances&#8217; and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving on to assess the risk and the need for an FGM protection order. Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction.&#8221; </p>

Such an abstract exercise, divorced from the disputed material itself and undertaken in circumstances where there is concession by the Secretary of State regarding the material&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> relevance to the issues before the court, would not allow the court to meet the imperative need to ensure that any non-disclosure is limited to what the situation imperatively demands and to properly satisfy itself whether the case for non-disclosure is compelling or strictly necessary. </p>
