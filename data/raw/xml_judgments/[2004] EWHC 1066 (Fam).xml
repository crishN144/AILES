	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">This has been a hard fought and expensive piece of litigation. The relationship between the parties has been acrimonious and this has affected the manner in which they have conducted their lives since separation and this case. The Wife has, at times, felt beleaguered, alone and without much assistance with the parties&#8217; very demanding son. The Husband has felt that he is expected to provide substantial sums of money in respect of a relationship which he perceives as short-lived and unhappy. [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">I have been informed that as late as March 2004, no revised offers of settlement had been made]</span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#FF0000">.</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> Indeed, the Husband&#8217;s open offer is dated Sunday 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">th </span><span style="font-size:10pt"> April &#8211; this case commenced on the 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">th</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> April. The consequences of all this are not surprising &#8211; a substantial bill of legal costs on each side. The Wife&#8217;s costs total &#163;241,000 (and that is before any appearance as result of Judgment and the inevitable costs of implementation). The bulk of those costs remain unpaid &#8211; the Wife&#8217;s solicitors having a Sears Tooth type charge on any monies which she recovers. The Husband&#8217;s bill is &#163;166,000 &#8211; the bulk of which has been paid by his father. He was not represented at the Hearing because &#8211; as he told me - his father refused to continue to cover the bills. If he had been represented, I have little doubt that his bill would have been similar to that of the Wife. Thus, to date, some &#163;400,000 has been spent on legal fees. In the context of the sums at issue this is an enormous sum, but (unless there are offers about which I know nothing) it seems that the expenditure has been necessary, in order to enable the Wife to achieve a proper home and future for herself and Lewis.  At the outset of this case Mr Blair QC (on behalf of the Wife) was seeking an outright lump sum of &#163;650,000. However, as a result of my tentative suggestions during the course of the Hearing, he accepted (given the origin of and manner in which the funds at issue are held) that it would be appropriate for his client&#8217;s housing fund to be held in a form of life interest settlement.  I consider that concession to be well made.    </span></p>

Her parents divorced when she was 7 years old. Her father now lives in High Wycombe. Her mother runs a bed and breakfast in the Cotswolds. Neither of her parents is well off &#8211; although it is fair to say that her mother (and grandmother) have lent monies to enable the Wife to fund about &#163;58,000 of her costs. She went to school locally and left at 16 years old with a couple of O Levels. Her working life was spent in promotions and sales. She had one serious relationship before her marriage. She was never a career girl and during the marriage she did not work outside the home because she cared for the family. It is accepted that she has no real earning capacity because she will continue to make a full and proper contribution by caring for Lewis. Although it is too early to predict, his problems are such that she may have to care for him for the remainder of his life.</span></p>

He was underweight and had a bilateral inguinal hernia which required immediate surgical repair. As early as 8 months he was considered to have mild motor delay. At the age of 12 months he was thought to have possible fits.  At the age of 22 months he was not yet walking and was vocalising without saying real words.  Even at this early age, his behaviour was difficult to control with aggressive outbursts and general developmental delay in all aspects of behaviour and learning. At 31 months, he was only able to say 3 words with meaning. He was then placed with a speech and language therapist. At the age of 4 years he was referred to the Learning Assessment Centre in Horsham to try to ameliorate his angry outbursts, screaming episodes, sudden mood changes and very demanding, attention-seeking behaviour. He was seen by a psychiatrist for learning difficulties and the initial diagnosis was that that he had global retardation with poor language development and some obsessional features (which his mother told me included continually throwing objects), but not autism. </span></p>

Her findings, in brief, were that Lewis is probably working at the level of a 3-4 year old, while his emotional and social development is possibly further delayed. In the longer term the gap between Lewis and his peers is likely to grow, even with good educational support, as he is learning at a slower rate. Ms Hood anticipated that it would be increasingly difficult to meet Lewis&#8217;s educational needs in a mainstream classroom. Fortunately, this particular problem has not arisen to date. Both parents are agreed that Lewis should now attend Chiltern Gate School &#8211; which is a State School which copes with mild to moderate learning difficulties. Ms Hood&#8217;s conclusions are</span></p>

He responds best to copying good models of acceptable behaviour. Thus, his mother needs to acquire special skills if she is to manage him. The same applies to his father &#8211; although, to date, he has not had to bear the brunt of the difficulties because his contact has been somewhat patchy.  I have not been asked to make any decisions about contact, but I was shown a schedule prepared on behalf of the Mother which showed that the Father had not seen Lewis as often as he might. I believe that the causes of this are basically twofold. First, I think that handovers have been painful experiences because the parties&#8217; unresolved relationship has allowed them to indulge in inappropriate behaviour in front of their child. Secondly, I suspect, that the Father finds it difficult to handle Lewis &#8211; who is not as responsive or enjoyable as most young children. </span></p>

He has lived with them on a full-time basis and they have paid all his outgoings.  Indeed, until recently, Mr Derek H paid legal fees totalling some &#163;150,000. It is the Husband&#8217;s case that he owes this money to his father. That may well be correct, but I am clear that it is a very soft loan. Until 4 working days before the trial, the Husband was represented by Mr Richard Sax of Messrs Manches and by experienced Leading Counsel. He informed the Court that in recent weeks he had had a major dispute with his father, which led to the latter withdrawing financial support &#8211; hence his appearance before the Court in person. The other side consider this to be a tactical ploy. I am not in a position to make a fully informed decision about the state of the Husband&#8217;s relationship with his father arising from this litigation. However, on balance, I consider it likely that Mr Derek H still has a good overall relationship with his son and will continue to offer support to him (in the widest sense).  The Husband had the benefit of a Mr Buckley as his Mackenzie friend. This gentleman is a good friend of Mr Derek H and I do not think that he would have attended this Court unless Mr H senior had been anxious to make sure that his son had an experienced man of affairs to help him and, more importantly, had a person through whom he (Mr H Senior) could keep a full watching brief over these proceedings. Mr Buckley is a man with great commercial experience and is a skilled negotiator &#8211; in fact, he is the company broker who, inter alia, was responsible for the sale of Bison Holdings to a group of investors in the late 1980s. Thus, although the Husband has appeared in person, I am of the clear view that he has been able to present his case well and he has made all the points which were relevant to the merits.  Moreover, I am sure that his father has been fully aware of events as they have unfolded.</span></p>

Thereafter, he would be able to earn some &#163;70,000 per annum gross (say &#163;49,500 net &#8211; assuming his tax allowances are used against this income). </span></p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in"><span style="font-size:10pt">His parents have been very supportive of his wish to become a pilot. In March 2002 (some months prior to the separation) Mr Derek H advanced the Husband &#163;20,000, which the Husband says was &#8220;a loan&#8221; to enable him to fund a course of flying lessons. Some &#163;17,000 of these monies were placed in a savings account and remaining &#163;3,000 was paid to the Wycombe Air Centre.  Over the ensuing months the Husband invested a further &#163;1,000 (possibly &#163;2,000) in flying lessons but, after the separation, repaid &#163;16,000 to his father. Mr Blair QC tasked the Husband as to the reasons why this money (which Mr Blair said was a gift) was removed from his savings account. The Husband denied any ulterior motive: however, I consider it likely that the Husband thought it was wise to return the funds before the divorce proceedings began in earnest. In June 2003 Mrs Evelyn H (his mother) wrote a letter to confirm that she had loaned monies to her son for flying lessons. The loan (about &#163;10,000) is said to be interest free and repayable from future income. I consider that Mr and Mrs H Senior have been anxious to ensure that their son has a proper and fulfilling career as soon as possible. Accordingly, they have been and will continue to fund him during his course. The monies may well be termed &#8220;a loan&#8221;, but of the very softest kind. Thus, I do not propose to regard any such loan as a real liability in this case. In fact, on the balance of probabilities, I consider it likely that his parents will do all in their power to ensure that their son qualifies quickly &#8211; even if this means that they have to cover all his living expenses for a period and they will not expect any immediate repayment of monies advanced.</span></p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in"><span style="font-size:10pt">Since the separation, the Husband has not worked in any meaningful way. It is his case that he has had insufficient funds to buy a van or the necessary equipment to work as a heating engineer. Furthermore, he says that he has not had sufficient monies to afford to undertake such course(s) as would enable him to become a commercial pilot. I do not consider his evidence in either respect to be credible. I believe that he has been very distressed and angry by the breakdown of this relationship. This has led him to feel that it would serve no useful purpose &#8211; indeed, it might even increase his liability to the Wife - if he worked. Consequently, he has made a deliberate decision to stay at home with his parents. He has assisted them from time to time &#8211; for example, when he travelled to Barbados and prepared a report on the defective heating system in that property. The report was necessary in connection with litigation which had been commenced against a local contractor. The report sets out a list of charges including some </span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#FF0000">&#163;1,400</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> for his services.  Of course, that fee was not paid. This small piece of evidence is another indication of the close working relationship between the Husband and his parents. </span></p>

Thus, by way of example, if the trustees were to lend &#163;1 million to the Husband free of any interest. The Inland Revenue would assess the capital benefit by assuming a commercial rate of interest &#8211; say 5% - and then charging capital gains tax at highest marginal rate on that amount (i.e. in the given example tax at the rate of 64% on &#163;50,000 being some &#163;32,000). Thus, it can be seen that the effective tax charge on this basis is 3.2%.  In reality, this is lowest tax charge for &#8220;importing&#8221; funds into the jurisdiction. </span></p>

All this took place about the same time that Mr Cuttiford was seeing Robert Ham QC (his expert) in relation to the preparation of his statement in these proceedings. Despite this, Mr Cuttiford, failed to make any of the relevant information available to his Counsel (who settled his statement) or the Court. Mr Cuttiford said this was just an oversight. I do not accept this evidence. All in all this lack of candour is most regrettable.</span></p>

Mr Blair considers that the trust income is about &#163;100,000 net.

I consider that a future income stream of some &#163;67,000 is a fair reflection of this factor. In the recent past, the Husband&#8217;s income account has been overdrawn, but the trustees have been fairly flexible about this situation. Indeed the amount &#8220;overdrawn&#8221; has fluctuated as figures have been shifted to the capital account. I consider that the Trustees will continue to adopt an adaptable approach, should income needs be greater in the short term. </span></p>

She said to me that she would rather have a two bedroomed bungalow with a large garden than a large house on a small plot. In the final analysis that will be a matter for her. She produced housing particulars which showed properties costing some &#163;600,000 to &#163;650,000. The Wife said that she needed this amount and had found a house costing &#163;650,000 which would have been &#8220;perfect&#8221; but had been sold. As the Husband was in person, I did not have the usual raft of particulars showing alternative houses. His case was simple &#8211; that the Wife only needed 60% of the net value of the former matrimonial home - that is &#163;436,500. Accordingly, I will have to use my overall knowledge as to the proper sum for housing.   </span></p>

		<p class="Heading3" style="margin-left:1.48in"><span style="font-size:10pt">Mr Lawrence is a respected professional with many years of experience in this field. His evidence was measured and, as I find, accurate. The Husband was concerned about Mr Lawrence&#8217;s involvement in this case because he perceived that there was a personal element. Mr Lawrence lives in the locality and his daughter had gone to school with the Wife. Accordingly, he was acquainted with her as his daughter&#8217;s one time friend. Apparently, Mr Lawrence&#8217;s wife had met the Wife in the hairdressers &#8211; whereupon she had heard of the difficult divorce. The result of the conversation was that Mr Lawrence recommended a new solicitor with more experience in this type of work (Miss Wait &#8211; then of Messrs Charles Russell) and offered his services on a pro bono basis.  I do not consider that this connection has tainted his evidence. The contents of his reports and letters were not challenged in any material way and I accept their contents. With my permission, he was asked questions by Mr Buckley who was concerned that Mr Lawrence did not know the industry p/e ratios and comparables. He was challenged as to the possible value of Bison.  I did not find Mr Lawrence&#8217;s lack of knowledge surprising &#8211; given that he was not valuing Bison.  Mr Buckley suggested that the current value of Bison (and he said he was trying to sell company for a group of investors) was such that the income from the preference share dividends and the mezzanine loan interest would not be repaid. Although the above assertions were made by Mr Buckley, they were not supported by any written material and I do not accept them. Consequently, I accept the evidence of Mr Lawrence. As set out above, I find that on the balance of probabilities the Husband will receive the additional income from these sources &#8211; probably in 2012, but possibly before. Consequently, I accept Mr Lawrence&#8217;s amended calculations on the monies which will become due.</span></p>

He had been a professional trustee operating from Jersey for in excess of 20 years. As such, he was steeped in the culture of his job &#8211; this means that he was protective of his trust assets and of his beneficiaries&#8217; apparent requirements. The lapses in his evidence, his failure to give details of the future income payments and the subsequent delay in payment date to 2012 is, quite frankly, inexplicable. He met with the Husband and Mr Derek H, when these proceedings began. I suspect that his actions were a combination of lack of precision and his perception that the family wanted the trust cards played very close to their chest. I am clear in the past that he has essentially complied with the family&#8217;s wishes in relation to the Husband&#8217;s Fund. I expect that this attitude will continue. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:10pt">By the end of the trial the Wife put her income needs at &#163;50,000 exclusive of the costs of the nanny but inclusive of Lewis&#8217;s general maintenance requirements. The Husband accepted that he or the grandchildren&#8217;s trust would continue to provide for the cost of the nanny and additional tuition. He placed her other needs at &#163;36,000 per annum. He did not cross examine the Wife about specific expenditure, but at my request pointed to a number of items which he regarded as inflated. I have come to the conclusion that the Wife and Lewis should (in addition to child benefit) have a total of &#163;40,000 net spendable for their general expenditure. I will listen to submissions as to how this should be divided between mother and son. If the Wife is successful in her application for disability allowance, then this will provide her with extra monies and I do not consider that payment of this allowance should reduce the maintenance which she will receive under my order. By my calculation, this will leave the Husband with some &#163;47,750 (perhaps more if the Grandchildren&#8217;s trust meet part of the general maintenance due to Lewis &#8211; hence my suggestion that further submissions are made on that aspect). Accordingly the Husband will have a degree of flexibility if some tax has to be paid in respect of any loan from the Trust. Obviously, to escape a large tax bill it will be necessary to avoid a substantial benefit. I have no doubt that the trustees will need specific advice on this aspect.</span></p>

However, she decided &#8211; wisely - that a move was appropriate. The competing positions for the Wife&#8217;s housing needs are (in the round) per the Husband &#163;440,000 and per the Wife some &#163;650,000. I have decided that the appropriate sum is &#163;525,000 &#8211; inclusive of the costs of cosmetic and initial structural works (if any). In addition, there will be the costs of purchase which I consider will be no more than &#163;25,000 (inclusive of stamp duty). As the house is to be held in trust, all these monies will be placed in a new life interest settlement.  In addition, the trust will need an administration / emergency fund &#8211; so that, inter alia, the costs of running the trust can be covered. I consider that &#163;25,000 is necessary for that purpose (to which will be added any funds not used for the costs of purchase). Thus, the trust will be funded with a total of &#163;575,000.</span></p>

She also needs a new car and I consider that &#163;20,000 will buy her a good family vehicle.  As her main asset will be held in Trust, I consider that it is essential and fair that she has some free capital to enable her to have a degree of flexibility and I consider that &#163;25,000 is fair.

The police have investigated and pressed charges. I make no findings about the situation. The Wife had to pay for the damage, but I regard this sum as having been subsumed by the lump sum that I have ordered. I hope that criminal proceedings will lapse but I do not know if that is possible.

The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse's expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets.  Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party.  Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse.  This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others.  There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court's view of the justice of the case.  There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8221;</span></p>
