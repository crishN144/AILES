By arrangement, they married in Pakistan on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2011. The father stayed for some time in Pakistan, during which time the mother became pregnant.

He gave up his home in L and acquired a new two-bedroom house in P, to which the family travelled on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012. Up until that point, the mother had been staying with her sister and brother-in-law and the father had visited her after taking a few days paternity leave.</p>

There was an argument at Lahore airport upon their arrival, as a result of which the mother and son went to stay with her family in Lahore and the father went to stay with his family in O, about three hours&#8217; drive away. It is this argument, which I have to concentrate on, and consider whether during the course of the row the father retained the mother and child&#8217;s passports, thereby preventing them from returning to this country.</p>

She says that she accidentally came across information on his email on his computer and telephoned the father at work to ask who the woman was who was talking about a child. She says the father was upset that she had read his emails and upset that he was being challenged. From then on, the mother says that she lost trust in the father and made a practice of scanning such documents belonging to the father that she found in the home and sending them to her sister.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father takes the view that the marriage was alright until they got to Lahore and the row took place. What is known now is that he did marry Miss A on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2007 in L. They had a daughter born on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2010. There was a <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2011, with a <span style="font-style:italic">decree absolute</span> on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011. The father maintains that, during the negotiations for the marriage between himself and the mother, he (or his family on his behalf) made it clear to the mother&#8217;s father and brother that he had been previously married, the divorce was proceeding and there was a little girl as a consequence of that marriage.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was through his marriage to Miss A, who is of Pakistani origin but a British citizen, that the father acquired his British citizenship in early 2010. He told me that the mother (his wife) of his daughter and he separated at the end of 2010, when the little girl was three or four months old. He says the mother&#8217;s family (in this case) knew about his previous marriage and daughter before the marriage took place. The mother is determined that she did not know about the previous marriage and did not know about the child until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. It may be that the father&#8217;s family told her own father what had happened. However, unfortunately there is no evidence what her father knew, because he died before the marriage actually took place.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also a further so-called marriage that took place earlier than that to Miss A, and this was to Miss R. It took place on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005 in Pakistan, when the father and Miss R went through a Nikah ceremony. The father maintains (and I do not think that it is challenged) that this marriage was never consummated and that there was never the second ceremony that often takes place the same day or sometime later, when the bride leaves her home to go and live with the husband. It seems, from what I have heard, that this second part of the marriage never took place and the marriage was not consummated.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father accepts that he did not tell the mother about this Nikah to Miss R. He did indicate that he and his maternal uncle, the father of Miss R, were not on good terms. Those sides of the family are not speaking. He told the mother that he had refused to go through with the marriage and he said that he was only informally engaged. That is not what I understand a Nikah to be. It is a formal ceremony, yet he was somewhat dismissive of it to the mother, saying it was informal and saying that he only told her about it after she and he were married, when he was explaining to her why he and his uncle were not speaking.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother only came to know of the Nikah with Miss R in December 2013 or January 2014, but what it shows is that there was a history about which the father had not been clear to the mother before they married. The issue that has been raised against the father is that he did not tell the mother and that she did not know about the marriage to Miss A and the presence of his daughter until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to know precisely how much the mother knew. It may be that her family knew more than she. What does appear to me from the evidence is that something happened on or about 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. The mother says the discovery of this marriage and child upset her. My view is that if she had known something by then it had not impacted upon her. If she had known and understood, she would not have become so upset and distrusting of the father. She believes, and I accept, that in some way he deceived her about Miss A.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already referred to the Nikah with Miss R and that it was covered up and then glossed over. Even in evidence to me, the father was maintaining it was not a marriage. However, the reality is that he went through a formal ceremony, which linked him together with Miss R. What exactly his status was, I am not going to go into. I am not an expert in Sharia law, but it was a formal ceremony linking the two together. I accept the evidence that that link went no further; it was not consummated.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has also been held against the father that, on her arrival to this country, he took the mother immediately to G. The mother says the journey to G took place immediately upon her arrival and the father says he took her overnight to L, where he lived, and then on to G, where she stayed with her sister. It is a criticism of the father. The reality is that the father was a man who went out to work at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning and came back at five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. The mother was a stranger to this country and a stranger to L. Although she speaks English, this was the mother&#8217;s first time in the United Kingdom and she was very heavily pregnant.</p>

	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, whether it was at her wish or his, it seems to have been a rather sensible conclusion to take her to S where she had supporters; her own sister who could keep an eye on her, look after her and give her a roof over her head whilst she waited for the baby, recovered from the birth and got used to looking after a new born infant. I do not feel the father should be criticised in having taken her to G.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What may be a criticism is that she may not have been fully consulted. However, I am not making any findings, one way or the other, because I view it as a practical arrangement that sounds sensible in the circumstances; they were a young couple who did not really know each other well, the mother was heavily pregnant and totally new to this country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The trip to Pakistan over Christmas 2012 is a different matter and goes to the heart of what has happened. They left this country on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December. They were due to fly back on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January, possibly arriving on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January. The trip was always going to be a short trip, because the father could only take advantage of the Christmas period and he had only earned two days leave from his new employment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and father tell diametrically opposed stories as to how and why the trip was arranged. The mother says that the father told her that his own grandmother, who was very old, was critically ill and that he wanted H to meet her before she died. The mother says that she was not willing to go because H was only about three months old and the health visitor and doctor advised her not to go as he had not been fully vaccinated. Moreover, by this stage she was suspicious of the father&#8217;s motives. The mother says she had learned about the father&#8217;s marriage to Miss A and his commitment to his daughter. The marriage was in some difficulties as a result, she having lost her trust in him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother says that she agreed to go to Pakistan after she had persuaded the father to swear on the Quran that she would have in her possession her own and H&#8217;s passports while in Pakistan and that the father would bring them back to the United Kingdom. She also said in evidence that she copied all three passports and sent the copies to her sister. As she told King J in February, that was &#8220;to be on the safe side&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father tells a somewhat different story. He says that, in early December, the mother told him that her own mother was very ill in hospital, that she wanted to see her mother and that it was he who was reluctant to go, because he had very little time off from work, the tickets for the flight would be more expensive at that time of year and he was worried that H was so very young.</p>

The father maintains that throughout the journey the mother held in her handbag the family tickets and the family passports. He says that they were in her handbag throughout. However, at Lahore the passports had to be produced. The mother says that going through Passport Control the father had the three passports and retained them following Passport Control. The mother maintains that she had H in the pushchair and he was crying at Passport Control, making it necessary for her to pick him up out of the pushchair and hold him up to be photographed. She says at this point the father had all three passports and they went through together as a family. The father also had some hand luggage with him. She says he did not give back her passport or H&#8217;s passport to her, either after Passport Control, in the baggage hall or at any time afterwards.</p>

The mother says that she recorded this, along with other phone calls, because immediately after the parties had separated there had been a telephone call later that day, in which the father was extremely abusive to her. She thought it would be appropriate, if he telephoned her again, to record any conversation. She says it occurred on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December. If she is wrong about that, it is very soon after the separation. The father says that the telephone call took place sometime at the end of March or early April; he accepts it was a call that he made. There is very little in the content of the recording to determine the date, but the contents are most of all important as it shows what each party was saying and how each party was reacting.</p>

Again, that call is of relevance because it refers to the row about passports at the airport, in that it indicates that there was a demand that the mother&#8217;s brother had asked for &#8220;our passports&#8221;.  The father replied &#8220;Why should I leave my wife&#8217;s and my child&#8217;s passports there?&#8221;, but this becomes much more apparent in the longer recording that took place between mother and father, probably, as mother says, before the shorter one.</p>

It was he who invented the story and the need to go to Pakistan, with a view of keeping the passports when he got there. The plan was that the child would go to the paternal family and the father, having the passports and the ability to change tickets, would return to this country with his son. The mother would not be able to return to the United Kingdom if the father held the passports and sought to ensure she would not be able to enter this country because he had sought to cancel her visa.

In effect, that would mean that the mother would have no role in the child&#8217;s life. That is callous to say the least.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am also concerned about the Pakistani litigation, instituted a week after the first hearing in this court. The paternal grandmother seeks custody of her grandson. She seeks interim contact. I have already referred to her statement, where she makes the comment that the relationship between the parents had turned &#8220;sour&#8221; whilst they were in the United Kingdom. She has made use of H&#8217;s ID card, or made a copy of it, that was sent to her or the grandfather by the father after he returned to this country and he received it. </p>

He knows that the grandmother, his own mother, is seeking to remove H from his mother. It is very clear on the face of the papers, that she is seeking custody of her grandson from the mother. She has made it clear in her second statement, which might be a petition under section 25. It is setting out her case:</p>

I am not a Pakistani lawyer, but I am surprised that the father is not able to become a party or an intervenor in those proceedings, bearing in mind that he is the father of this child. </p>
