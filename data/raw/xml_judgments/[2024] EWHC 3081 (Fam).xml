	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A removal will only be wrongful for the purposes of Art 3 of the Convention if, immediately prior to the removal or retention of the child, that child was habitually resident in the State from which the removal or retention took place. It is therefore necessary to start any analysis of habitual residence by determining the date on which the retention or removal took place. In this case, both parties agree that the father consented to the mother taking the child to the UK. What is in dispute is whether the father was consenting to a two-week holiday or a more permanent relocation. Ms Logan Green submits that the unlawful retention occurred on either 25 November &#8211; the date the mother confirmed in a message to the paternal grandmother that she was remaining in the UK indefinitely - or 27 November, the expiry of the two-week period. Ms Courtney did not disagree with those dates. I agree that habitual residence falls to be determined on either 25 or 27 November &#8211; the precise date makes no difference to the analysis.</p>

The burden of proof is therefore on the mother as the person asserting that a change in habitual residence has taken place. The mother&#8217;s case is that AB acquired habitual residence in the UK within the 11 day / two-week period between arriving in the UK and the mother deciding to stay in the UK / failing to return to the US. Ms Courtney relied on the fact that habitual residence can be obtained instantaneously, and that i<span style="color:#000000">t is possible for a parent unilaterally to cause a child to change habitual residence by removing the child to another jurisdiction without the consent of the other parent</span>. Ms Courtney argued that in this case AB obtained habitual residence on the date he landed from the USA as it was clear that the mother did not intend to return. She relied on the fact that the mother is British and the child is dual British / US national, that at the date of retention, AB had no awareness of his life in America and on arrival in the UK was embedded in his English family and way of life. She also relied on the mother&#8217;s wishes that the proceedings remain in this jurisdiction for further assessments given a potential diagnosis of autism in the future and the mother's fears that she will not be able to participate in court proceedings in the US as she has previously been refused permission by the USA court to attend remotely. She further submitted that AB is currently integrated into his British family and has spent over half his life in the UK.</p>

However, in the same statement she goes on to talk about the father&#8217;s mother (AB&#8217;s grandmother) ensuring that the father would be out of the home whenever the mother wanted to return, suggesting that in her mind a return was not out of the question. In her statement, ZJ describes her understanding as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">there was no suggestion that it would only be for two weeks that the mother would be in the UK, and my understanding was that until there were changes in the father&#8217;s attitudes that she would remain in the UK</span>&#8217;.

Once it is established that the question of acquiescence depends upon the subjective intentions of the wronged parent, it is clear that the question is a pure question of fact to be determined by the trial judge on the, perhaps limited, material before him.</span>&#8221;</p>

Ms Logan Green suggested that the separation of an 18 month old child from his mother, while distressing for the child, does not amount to an intolerable situation in the way that may be argued for an older child who has known the mother as prime carer for a substantial period of time. I disagree. An 18 month old child will have developed a strong attachment to his primary carer, and in my view it would be intolerable to return AB without his mother and separate them for an indeterminate period of time.

The mother&#8217;s statement specifies one instance of violence towards her where she alleges he hit her with a vape. In addition some of the text messages from the mother to the father exhibited to the mother&#8217;s statement appear to be her showing marks on her body and suggesting that the father caused them, although the mother has not provided any explanation in her statement of this. The mother also alleges that the father exercised financial control over her, not providing her with sufficient or appropriate food or buying necessary items for the baby, including nappies, and that the father exercised control over the mother's socialising and clothing. The mother describes an episode where the father became angry with her for socialising with friends at a pumpkin patch party and describes the father being so angry about her wearing a vest top that he closed the boot so aggressively it smashed. She alleges the father showed no interest in the baby, not being present during most of the birth or subsequently caring for the baby. The mother&#8217;s second statement (but not her first) makes reference to the father shaking AB on two occasions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father disputes all of these allegations and gives a cogent alternative version of events in his statement. Without conducting a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the mother&#8217;s allegations, there are some points that can be made on the basis of the evidence as presented in the bundle. The statement from ZJ supports the mother&#8217;s allegations in relation to the father not providing sufficient food for the mother and AB and the father&#8217;s lack of interest in caring for AB. However, ZJ&#8217; knowledge is limited to what the mother told her contemporaneously and the fact of the father&#8217;s absence at the times ZJ was with the mother and AB (which may be explainable by the father having been at work). I also note the photographic evidence of the father spending time with his son exhibited to the father&#8217;s statement, albeit these are only snapshots in time. The text messages between the parents reveal an unhappy relationship including instances of the father being verbally abusive to the mother. The videos &#8211; while also only snapshots in time - also indicate high levels of anger and discord between the parents (on both sides) and an element of oppressive and controlling behavior by the father in seeking to film the mother. On the face of it the allegation that the father shook the child is an extremely concerning allegation, however it is not one in respect of which the mother has provided any detail at all (when or where the incidents took place, how it occurred, or what the impact was on the child) or supporting medical evidence.</p>

The intention is not for the mother and AB to live with the father. The proposal is for the mother and AB to live in separate accommodation to which the father is willing to contribute $800 a month; that the father not attend at the mother's address nor seek to separate her from AB pending the first inter partes hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning first to the risk of arrest. The case law is clear that the abducting parent being arrested and prosecuted for child abduction is not sufficient <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">by itself</span> to satisfy Article 13(b). In <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Abduction: Pending</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Criminal Proceedings) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 433" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 433</ref> the possibility of criminal proceedings being brought and even the possibility of the mother being arrested at the airport on her return was not enough to establish a grave risk of harm to the children. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Psychological Harm) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 1145" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 1145</ref> the possibility that the father would change his mind and bring criminal proceedings against the mother if she returned to the United States was likewise not sufficient to establish the exception under Article 13(b). As I understand it, Ms Courtney&#8217;s submission is that in the event of the mother being arrested AB would either be taken into the care of the state authorities, or looked after by his father who was never his primary carer, and whom AB has not seen for several months and will have no memory of and that this would amount to an intolerable situation for AB.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s Counsel describes the issue of arrest as a &#8216;red herring&#8217; given that there is no indication the FBI has pursued the case following the one conversation the father had with them. She also refers to the voluntary undertaking the father has given not to institute or voluntarily support any proceedings whether criminal or civil for the punishment of the mother. Nevertheless, I do not consider the risk of prosecution can be entirely discounted given the view of the expert that the mother could face criminal prosecution for parental child abduction, which is a crime at both the federal and state level. The question is whether that risk amounts to a &#8216;grave risk of harm&#8217; or &#8216;otherwise intolerable situation&#8217;. While the authorities are clear that the risk of arrest and prosecution <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">of itself </span>is insufficient, I still need to consider whether the risk of the mother being separated from AB (albeit it within the same jurisdiction, with access to the US judicial system, and with some level of direct contact) would put AB at grave risk of harm or otherwise intolerable situation. This is a situation in which the father has expressed himself willing to look after AB, no doubt with the support of the paternal grandmother with whom the father lives. I take the allegations made by the mother about AB&#8217;s parenting of, and interest in AB, as discussed above into account, but on the balance of probabilities do not consider that the risk of arrest (which given the voluntary undertaking by the father not to initiate or otherwise voluntarily support any proceedings is relatively low) and consequence that AB may end up living with the father for a period of time to reach the Article 13(b) threshold.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Beyond the risk of arrest I turn to look at whether returning the mother to the USA on the basis proposed would lead to a grave risk of harm to AB or putting AB into an intolerable situation.  In addition to paying for the mother and AB&#8217;s flights back to the USA, the father has offered to: pay $800 per month towards separate accommodation for the mother, until the first inter-partes hearing in court proceedings, which I am told is the most he can afford; not to attend the airport on the mother&#8217;s arrival if she objects; not to attend the mother's home; and not to seek to separate AB from his mother until the first inter-partes hearing in any court proceedings.</p>

I raised during the hearing with Ms Logan Green my concern as to how the undertaking not to seek to separate AB from his mother until the first inter-partes hearing in any court proceedings could be squared with the order that is currently in place giving the father custody. I subsequently received confirmation &#8211; by way of an email exchange between Counsel for the father and the father&#8217;s attorney in the US - that the issue of custody can be dealt with in the current proceedings in the US by the parties filing a consent order.</p>

Ms Courtney submits that this would leave very little for utilities or food for AB and the mother and, in the absence of any means of enforcing the payment, the mother could become homeless at any point. It seems to me that it will be essential for the father to have secured accommodation for the mother prior to her returning to the USA in order to ensure the mother&#8217;s return with AB is, in practice, on the basis proposed.</p>
