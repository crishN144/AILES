	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">I am dealing this afternoon with an application by Hertfordshire County Council (&#8216;HCC&#8217;) for a reporting restriction order (&#8216;RRO&#8217;) in relation to the circumstances of 3 children whose case is before the Family Court, Q, R, and S (&#8216;the children&#8217;). </p>

The only paragraph that is now opposed by Mr Barnes representing the maternal grandmother (&#8216;MGM&#8217;), and two accredited members of the press, Lee Agnew and Louise Tickle, is paragraph &#8216;d&#8217; of the proposed RRO.  Paragraph (d) of the proposed reporting restriction would prohibit publication of information that: </p>

It is now 4.20pm on a Friday afternoon, and the parties will excuse me for not summarising the background within this judgment. The hearing takes place in the absence of the children&#8217;s father, Alex Staines. He has pleaded guilty to the murder of his former partner, the children&#8217;s mother, Christie Frewin. Sentencing is to take place in the Crown Court on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2021. As has already been noted, critically, HCC, having indicated a wish to make an application for an RRO in February, delayed issuing until Wednesday of this week. As a result, this important application comes before the court on two days&#8217; notice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The concern of HCC is these three young children have experienced significant trauma having been present in the house when their mother was murdered and having been left alone in their home with her body. They have been assessed by Dr B as recently as 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021 when she met with the children and reported. She has provided an opinion and describes the presentation of the two older children suffering severe PTSD as a result of witnessing the murder of their mother and as a result Q and R are highly traumatised children. Her opinion is set out in the letter of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021. Her concern, echoed by the local authority and Ms Downes on behalf of the guardian, is that if the children were identified in the press, it risks heightening their trauma and worsening their mental health </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The children&#8217;s social worker has prepared a statement highlighting that all three children are demonstrating behaviours that can be difficult to manage and therefore the foster carer is receiving a high level of support and is still requesting more.  Her concern is that press intrusion will hinder progress the children are make things much more difficult and negatively impact the children </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The documents in the bundle in support of the application also include the local authority&#8217;s skeleton argument, and a draft order, together with an authorities bundle setting out the six key cases in relation to this area of law. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Burgess, having taken time this afternoon, has reconfigured the local authority&#8217;s application and made clear they were no longer seeking paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) of the draft order (concerning the circumstances in which the mother&#8217;s body was discovered, and information relating to the children&#8217;s home life and the parents&#8217; relationship in so far as it affects the children) and were continuing to pursue paragraph 3(d). The basis of her application relates to what she described as the exceptional circumstances of this case. Whilst she conceded it is locally well known that Ms Frewin has died and that Mr Staines has pleaded guilty to her murder the involvement and presence of the children remains unknown at this time. Her concern, if these details are known, was that conversations around, or about, the children would cause them significant harm and this is likely to have a significant impact on them and, potentially, the therapeutic work that will be done with them. Whilst in her skeleton argument, and in her submissions, she conceded the need for the court to undertake a close and careful analysis of the respective Article 8 and 10 rights engaged, in her submission the balance fell strongly and clearly in favour of the additional restriction of paragraph 3(d) as proposed by the local authority. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Downes on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian effectively supported those submissions and this left Mr Barnes on behalf of MGM, together with the BBC and Ms Tickle to argue strongly against it. Mr Bain, on behalf of the PGPs, did not align himself with the local authority, although his clients are clearly concerned about the welfare of the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Staines was not present today. Mr Keyworth was unable to speak to his client.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Barnes supplemented his detailed skeleton argument with submissions in relation to paragraph 3(d) which the local authority continues to seek. He was very clearly critical of the local authority&#8217;s approach, and that of the representative for the children, and commented on the way in which the application, and order sought, was significantly changed only as a result of judicial indication. I have already said paragraphs 3(a) &#8211; (c), concerning not identifying the children, not publishing photographs, or naming the older children&#8217;s school, are agreed. Paragraphs 3(e) and (f) are no longer pursued by the local authority. This leaves only the terms of paragraph 3(d) in dispute. </p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The concerns of the press were helpfully and succinctly put in writing. Mr Agnew from BBC Three Counties Radio emailed the court on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021 and Ms Tickle also sent an email shortly before this hearing. Their objection to the proposed paragraph related to the ability of not just they themselves to report on this, but the wider media because there are matters which, first of all, if the criminal case had gone to trial, would have been reportable and, notwithstanding concerns regarding the children&#8217;s welfare, they both powerfully submit there is a public interest in the media fully reporting on the circumstances of the offence. The presence of the children is likely to be an aggravating factor. Both journalists emphasise the public interest in understanding and knowing about sentencing and the importance of the detail in this case in enabling the public&#8217;s understanding  of any sentence given. This relates not only to transparency but also confidence in the justice system more widely. Ms Tickle points out that the ages of the children mean the reality is that the impact of any reporting is not likely to be felt directly by children at the age they are at the moment. When older, it is hoped that will have been provided with therapeutic support to help them to process their experiences. </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">An additional point made by Ms Downes in support of the local authority argument is that local people may not come to the sentencing, and may not be aware of the detail and there was a need to prevent the media reporting details that would therefore be presented next week. Ms Tickle comments that everyone in the vicinity will know the information anyway so it makes no difference. Ms Tickle emphasised at the end of submissions that it only takes one or two people to attend the trial and that the detail and information at trial will then very quickly be communicated via social media. For those reason the press, and Mr Barnes, on behalf of MGM, oppose the additional restriction. </p>

He makes the point that the restrictions sought by the local authority in this case have no equivalent in any reported decision. He submits that Dr B&#8217;s letter cannot and should not be taken as support for the terms of paragraph the local authority asks me to include. He submits Dr B&#8217;s concern was about the identity of the children being reported and paragraphs (a) &#8211; (c) cover that ground fully. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The welfare of the children and their Article 8 rights are highly significant in this case. Ms Burgess in her written submission at paragraph 46 articulated those but a close analysis of the Article 10 rights in this case and the submissions made by Mr Barnes and two members of the accredited press lead me to the clear conclusion, in balancing the respective rights, that para (d) is a disproportionate restriction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The children are of an age where media reporting will not be seen directly by them. The most likely impact on them is going to come from their peer group and other adults with whom they come into contact. The local authority and the foster carer are acutely aware of this, and can, and I am sure will, take every precaution possible to protect the children as much as possible. </p>

Any hope of entirely insulating these children from the potential consequences of media interest is not possible. The interest of the press in properly reporting the sentencing and scrutinising the actions of public authorities, including the local authority and the police, are important in my judgment. The protections for the children, reflected in the concerns of Dr B, are set out and protected by paragraphs 3(a), (b), and (c). </p>
