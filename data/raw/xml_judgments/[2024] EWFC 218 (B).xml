The court should also take into account whether it is proportionate to permit the allegation to proceed, for a pleaded conduct claim usually has the effect of increasing costs and diminishing the prospects of settlement. Finally, the court should take into account whether the allegation, even if proved, would be material to the outcome.&#160;</span></p>

The authorities clearly indicate that such conduct would only be reflected where there is a financial consequence to its impact. In one case the husband had stabbed the wife and the wound had impaired her earning capacity. The impact of such conduct was properly reflected in the discretionary disposition made in the wife's favour. Mrs Miller alleged that Mr Miller had unjustifiably ended the marriage discarding her in favour of another woman. Therefore, she argued that Mr Miller should not be permitted to argue that their marriage was short. This argument was rejected by the House of Lords which held that the conduct in question, although greatly distressing to Mrs Miller, should not find independent reflection in the court's decision.</span></p>

I confess to being unclear why the fact of fraudulent non-disclosure seems to have fallen into the category of personal misconduct. It seems to me to sit far more easily in litigation misconduct, one of the other categories listed by Mostyn J in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">OG v AG (supra)</span><span style="color:#000000">. Furthermore, although it was argued that there had been no direct financial consequence on the wife, the original order was set aside because the wife had lost the opportunity of seeking a higher award which does seem to me of itself to have been at the very least a potential financial consequence; otherwise, why would the order have been set aside?</span></p>

The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> criteria (and their equivalent in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Partnership Act 2004</ref>) are listed as signposts for the court in considering what financial remedy orders to make. In other words, they are taken into account by the court to the extent that they affect the distributive process under s23 and s24. It would be highly unusual to include a factor which has no financial consequence under the terms of an Act which is directed to reordering the finances of the parties.</span></p>

It seems to me that in the great majority of cases, the impact on the alleged victim can and ordinarily will be taken into account by reference to the conventional criteria regardless of whether domestic abuse has in fact taken place. One example is behaviour which affects somebody's earning capacity. Courts routinely weigh in the balance diminished earning capacity (and of course earning capacity is a specific consideration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>). It is hard to see why there would be any need to embark upon a lengthy and conflicted dispute about the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">cause</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> of the diminished earning capacity. What matters is reflecting the limited earning capacity in the overall award. Another example might be behaviour which leads to additional needs such as medical costs. Again, it is hard to see how a court will be assisted by detailed inquiry into the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">cause</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> of the need; what matters is the individual's requirements and the extent to which they should be met going forward. In other words, I doubt very much that domestic abuse would have a material impact on the vast majority of cases, such that it needs to be litigated.</span></p>

Whilst that may be understandable at a personal and human level, it is not the function of the court to make findings for the sake of it and simply to assuage one or other party's sense of grievance and injustice. I repeat, misconduct must be directly relevant to the distribution of finances to be entertained.</span></p>

Domestic abuse allegations are almost always disputed, and frequently met with cross allegations. Cases would need more hearings and longer time estimates. The need for Qualified Legal Representatives where the parties are litigants in person would expand dramatically. Applications for additional evidence (police, medical, psychiatric and so on) would ensue. Costs would increase markedly. It is hard to see how cases involving allegations of domestic abuse would settle before final hearing, given the charged nature of the subject matter. The implications for the system of financial remedies are profound.</span></p>

To do so will significantly extend the length of any final hearing. When I suggested it would need three days to litigate the issue neither counsel demurred from that estimate. It has already generated a considerable amount of costs and generated lengthy written and oral submissions. The fact that there are more assets in the matrimonial pot than in many cases does not give a party a free licence to litigate any issue that they choose to do so; the court is under a duty to manage cases so that they take up a proper proportion of scarce court time.</span></p>
