Indeed the contrary is the case, namely the expert evidence is that, although a finding of factitious illness behaviour does not exclude a finding that a parent has physically abused a child, it is, at least, an unusual presentation. Dr Mecrow went so far as to describe the co-existence of factitious or induced illness (&#8216;FII&#8217;) and physical abuse to be exceptionally rare [E56].</p>

For the reasons just given above I am not surprised by his difficulty and I do not conclude that the same resulted from a desire to avoid blame for LS&#8217; fractures. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I regret that the mother&#8217;s evidence was in so many respects wholly unsatisfactory. The mother&#8217;s capacity and willingness to lie remains undiminished. During this hearing the mother invited the court to listen to a recording of a  conversation that she had with the maternal grandmother. She asserted that during the recorded conversation the maternal grandmother admitted being with the family in the park on 8 May 2013. </p>

Her failure to give a truthful account of past events and her failure to be honest and that she continues to lie, complicates an assessment of the degree of risk she poses, but in my judgment it is a high risk. </p>
