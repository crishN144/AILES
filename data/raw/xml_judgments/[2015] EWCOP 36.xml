	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings are concerned with X, a young man of 25 who currently lives in a care home. They began as an application by his mother, AY (who is his appointed welfare deputy and has acted throughout without the benefit of legal representation), in respect of his prescribed medication.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the course of proceedings, X has been discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act and the parties have been able to agree a community placement for him, where he is now settled. The issues which remain for the determination of the Court relate to his best interests in relation to diet and whether the welfare deputyship (which is currently suspended) should be restored or discharged. In determining those issues, the Court is asked to reach a series of findings of fact.</p>

For the first time (D48 para 29), there was a suggestion of X having food intolerances, in particular to milk and sugar. AY says that she was advised to remove gluten and yeast from X&#8217;s diet and that, within a week of doing so, X showed much improvement. Dr Cox subsequently also suggested the introduction of vitamin C, magnesium and zinc.

There was a significant decrease in the incidence of hostility and violence (D244). The explanation for this, however, is not agreed. The view of the treating clinicians is that the new medication regime brought about the improvement. The view of AY is that a range of factors contributed, including improvements to X&#8217;s diet and bowel movements attributable to fish oils and probiotics.</p>

Nonetheless, the broad thrust of her case is clear. She believes that X&#8217;s behavioural challenges are reflective of a bowel condition which leaves him often &#8220;impacted&#8221; and in pain which he cannot otherwise express. She further believes that this bowel condition can and should be treated by means of excluding certain food types (notably gluten, casein and lactose) from his diet, and giving him nutritional supplements in accordance with a protocol devised by Juliet Hayward.  (The protocol devised for X in July 2012 is included in the third hearing bundle at page 22. It specifies 11 supplements for breakfast, 3 mid-morning, 2 at lunchtime, 3 mid-afternoon, 9 with evening meal and 2 more before bed.) </p>

In the words of Juliet Hayward (D292),  AY &#8220;has left no stone unturned&#8221; in pursuit of her dietary goals for X whereas, AY considers, no other carers have the time or the will to research his condition as she has done to ensure that his individual needs are most appropriately met. Accordingly, she contends that her authority as welfare deputy should be reinstated.</p>

The Local Authority seeks a series of findings of fact, as set out in a schedule, to confirm its view that AY takes an unconventional approach to X&#8217;s care and treatment, and seeks to impose her views to the detriment of X&#8217;s wellbeing. It maintains that X should be allowed an unrestricted diet and medical treatment as advised by the responsible clinicians. It seeks revocation of the welfare deputyship order on the basis that AY&#8217;s use of such authority jeopardises X&#8217;s stability and placement because of the strains it places on those responsible for day to day care.</p>

However, I was struck by the rigidity of her position. In particular, when matters were put to her which were suggestive at least of a need to question the credentials of the nutritionist in whom she places so much faith, her response was to be offended by the questioning. It was apparent that she had not asked any such questions herself before adopting wholesale that person&#8217;s advice.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">AY has denied that X has a psychiatric disorder in various documents (including her COP9 application dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2012 at C16, and her statement at D43). Her response to the schedule of facts sought suggests that these denials may in part have been because of a semantic misunderstanding of the term &#8220;psychiatric disorder&#8221; in the context of historical changes to ICD classifications. However, more broadly it is clear from the approaches that she took to X&#8217;s diet and bowel activities for many years, both when she was the principle carer for X and since he has been in residential care, that AY believes that his behaviour is &#8220;intrinsically linked with his intestinal dysfunction and inflammation&#8221; (her words, F3). There is no similar indication of any acceptance by AY that autism itself accounts for X&#8217;s presentation. Her unwillingness to accept such a conclusion is manifest in her repeated requests for permission to adduce further expert evidence.</p>

In contrast, the combined view of care staff and clinicians represents a more comprehensive overview. AY does not offer any alternative explanation for the noted improvements in X&#8217;s presentation, and indeed she does not dispute that there was improvement after olanzapine was administered. In oral evidence, she expressed the view that olanzapine had &#8220;the same benefit&#8221; as 5HTP (but with different side-effects.)</p>
