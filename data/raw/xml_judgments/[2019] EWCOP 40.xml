	      </authorialNote>, the Public Guardian apparently suggested that the absence of specific provision in respect of using the donor&#8217;s funds to benefit others indicated Parliament&#8217;s intention that attorneys should no longer have such power.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in">So, what are the &#8220;appropriate cases&#8221; in which an attorney under a lasting power of attorney may use the donor&#8217;s funds to benefit someone other than the donor? It is notable that, even whilst referring to requirements to consider &#8220;the wishes and feelings of the donor and the factors he or she would have taken into account&#8221;, the extract from <span style="font-style:italic">Mental Incapacity</span> only concludes that &#8220;meet[ing] another person&#8217;s needs (including the attorney&#8217;s own needs)&#8221; would be within the parameters of the best interests duty. Is there to be inferred any limitation of the parameters of &#8216;best interests&#8217; to &#8216;meeting needs&#8217; of others? The decisions of Senior Judge Lush referred to in paragraphs 35 and 36 above suggest that this has been the approach previously taken.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0in">The &#8220;purpose&#8221; of the best interests requirement is to consider the matter from the protected persons point of view. The notion of limiting an attorney&#8217;s authority to benefit others only to the extent that the donor &#8220;might be expected to meet their needs&#8221; is wholly at odds with that understanding of &#8216;best interests.&#8217; Instead of considering matters from the protected person&#8217;s point of view, it would mean considering matters from the point of view &#8211; the &#8216;expectation&#8217;-  of an unidentified other. The point of individuality is that it permits deviation from standard expectations. An individual may choose to live their life according to a sense of responsibility which is not the expectation of the law or the general populace. If, to accommodate this, it is suggested that the &#8216;needs&#8217; could be understood as meaning &#8216;needs as the donor sees them&#8217;, then the stipulation of &#8216;needs&#8217; at all is effectively meaningless &#8211; we may as well simply say, &#8216;as the donor sees fit.&#8217;  A capacitous principal can authorise a common law attorney to apply his funds for the benefit of someone else; and it is entirely in keeping with the concept of &#8216;best interests&#8217; - with a requirement to consider wishes, feelings, beliefs and values inbuilt by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s4(6)</ref> - that the donor of a lasting power of attorney should be able to authorise their attorney in the same way.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> I agree with Senior Judge Lush that the reference in the Article to measures being &#8220;free of conflict of interest&#8221; must be understood in the context of the rest of the Article, including &#8220;respect for the rights, wills and preferences of the person&#8221; and the reference to proportionality. An absolute prohibition against conflicts of interest on the part of an attorney may indeed constitute a safeguard to prevent abuse of the incapacitated person, but only at the cost of restricting the options available to his former capacitous self. Donors commonly choose their attorneys from those persons closest to them, and therefore attorneys are often in the particular group of persons other than himself whom a donor would be most likely to want to benefit. An absolute prohibition on conflict of interest would render impermissible the very arrangement for management of their affairs after loss of capacity which many people would like to make whilst they retain capacity. </p>

Moreover after appointment, a deputy is subject to supervision by the Public Guardian, being required to submit reports as and when requested. The opportunity for that degree of management and oversight is not ordinarily part of the attorneyship scheme (and, as already noted, that is for many people one of its chief attractions.)  </p>

In the course of these proceedings I asked if the Public Guardian would be able and willing to receive regular reports from attorneys if the court were to make such an order, with a view to importing into attorneyship in appropriate cases (for example, where there is potential for conflict of interest) a degree of supervision or scrutiny akin to deputyship.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0in">So how is the potential for conflict of interest on the part of the attorney to be managed? In my view there is already one aspect of lasting powers of attorney scheme which addresses this &#8211; the requirement for a certificate provider, who certifies that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA, the scope of the authority conferred under it and that no fraud or pressure is being used to induce the donor to create the LPA<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="28">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.1in"> There is a long and complicated history to the decision to incorporate this requirement in the lasting powers of attorney scheme. (See Cretney &amp; Lush on Lasting &amp; Enduring Powers of Attorney, chapter 6.)  </p>
	      </authorialNote>. There is no equivalent in the enduring power of attorney scheme. Providing this certificate is an important role, and the provider may be called to account for his opinion. Particularly where provisions in the instrument include expression of a wish that the donor&#8217;s funds be used to benefit others (including the attorney), both donor and attorney should consider carefully who is asked to be the certificate provider, and how the certificate provider formed his opinion.     </p>

In my judgment, where the donor whilst he had capacity used his own funds to benefit another (including the attorney) in the way contemplated, or where there is an express statement in the instrument of the donor&#8217;s wish that his funds be used in the way contemplated, there should be no requirement for the attorney to seek prior authority from the court to use the donor&#8217;s funds to benefit another, even if the attorney is in a position of conflict of interest. However, in the absence of either capacitous demonstration of such beliefs and values, or express statement of wishes in the instrument, where the use of funds under contemplation gives rise to a conflict of interest on the part of the attorney, the attorney should make an application to the court for prior authority pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.    </p>
