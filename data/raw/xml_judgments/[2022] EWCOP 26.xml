She was tearful every day, unable to go to school and did not see the point in living.

She was deeply distressed to be able to find a reference to her case in a tweet that was published.  There was nothing in the tweet that would have identified to BG or anyone else that the matter referred to her except the case number.  I make it clear that I am not criticising the author of the tweet.  </p>

Regardless of the wording and the restrictions that I might impose on it, they argued that BG would be likely to find any report about herself and that would cause only greater anxiety and distress.  No formulation of words would stop that distress.</p>

I was persuaded by Mr Farmer that it would not be proper for a decision of this gravity to be made in secrecy, particularly in circumstances when the duration of BG&#8217;s life was uncertain.  Accordingly, on 23 May when announcing my decision I authorised publication in these terms:</p>

		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The court today has been dealing with an application by a Mental Health Trust seeking orders permitting the ceasing of artificial nutrition and hydration to a young person suffering from a very complex condition including a severe eating disorder. The inevitable result will be that the young person will die unless he/she chooses otherwise. The application is supported by the young person and the immediate family and the independent expert instructed by the Official Solicitor. I have allowed the application and will, in a reserved judgment, give my reasons in this very difficult case. I will reconsider the issue of further publication after I have handed down my reserved judgment. In the meantime, there is to be no additional reporting or identification of the Mental Health Trust, the Acute Trust, the young person, their family or the treating doctors or the geographical location in which any of the above are situated.&#8221;</p>
