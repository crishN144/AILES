	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 March 2014 the Supreme Court gave judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey County Council v P and others (Equality and Human Rights Commission and others intervening), Cheshire West and Chester Council v P and another (Same intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/19" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 19" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 19</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] PTSR 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] PTSR 460</ref>, [2014] COPLR 313. I am not here concerned to analyse the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, nor to explore its implications as a matter of substantive law. I am concerned solely with a narrower but more pressing issue: the practical and procedural implications for the Court of Protection of what all informed opinion agrees is the large increase in its case-load which will follow in consequence of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Just how large that increase will turn out to be is not yet clear. In part it may depend upon the extent to which otherwise purely private care arrangements &#8211; for example, the care at home by the family of an elderly relative or spouse suffering from dementia &#8211; come within the ambit of Article 5 because of some involvement by the State, whether a local authority or the court. That raises potentially complex issues which, I emphasise, I am not here concerned with. I mention it only because on one possible outcome there could be a large number of such cases adding even further to the Court of Protection&#8217;s case-load. Be that as it may, and even if that turns out not to be the case, it is clear that there is going to be a very significant increase in the number of cases in the Court of Protection relating to deprivation of liberty (&#8220;DoL&#8221;).</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to address this increase, I arranged for a number of DoL cases to be listed before me for initial directions on 8 May 2014. With the assistance of counsel appearing before me on that occasion, in particular Mr Alexander Ruck Keene who appeared for the Official Solicitor as advocate to the court, I was able to formulate the 25 questions, set out in the Annex to the order I made at the conclusion of that hearing, to be considered at a further hearing I fixed for 5 June 2014. For ease of reference those questions are set out in the Annex to this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing on 5 June 2014 I had the assistance of a large number of advocates, representing between them, in addition to the Official Solicitor as advocate to the court, the Secretary of State for Health and the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, the Law Society of England and Wales, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, Mind, eight local authorities, two NHS clinical commissioning groups, a NHS trust and four individuals. Their submissions were invaluable in illuminating the forensic landscape and pointing the way to the correct answers to the various questions. I am immensely grateful to all of them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The immediate objective, in my judgment, is to devise, if this is feasible, a standardised, and so far as possible &#8216;streamlined&#8217;, process, compatible with all the requirements of Article 5, which will enable the Court of Protection to deal with all DoL cases in a timely but just and fair way. The process needs, if this is feasible, to distinguish between those DoL cases that can properly be dealt with on the papers, and without an oral hearing, and those that require an oral hearing. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In contrast to the Family Court, which has a statutory rules committee, the Family Procedure Rules Committee, the Court of Protection has no statutory rules committee. The rule making power for the Court of Protection is vested (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>) in the President of the Court of Protection, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor. An ad hoc, non-statutory, committee (&#8220;the Committee&#8221;) has recently been set up to review the Court of Protection Rules 2007 (&#8220;the Rules&#8221;) and associated practice directions and forms. At its first meeting on 14 July 2014, the Committee identified as a major issue for consideration  the question of whether Rule 73(4), which provides that &#8220;Unless the court otherwise orders, P shall not be named as a respondent to any proceedings&#8221;, requires amendment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a preliminary judgment, setting out briefly my answers to those of the 25 questions which require an early decision if the objective I have identified is to be carried forward. It concentrates on the issues directly relevant to what I will call the &#8216;streamlined&#8217; process. It sets out no more than the broad framework of what, in my judgment, is required to ensure that the &#8216;streamlined&#8217; process is Article 5 compliant. Additional, detailed, work needs to be carried out as soon as possible by the Court of Protection in conjunction, where appropriate, with the Committee. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Article 5(1) does not itself require a judicial determination, but anyone lawfully deprived of their liberty in accordance with article 5(1) is entitled to a &#8220;speedy&#8221; decision &#8220;by a court&#8221; of the lawfulness of the detention. The decision must be judicial, so the &#8220;court&#8221; for this purpose must be a judge and not an official. There is therefore no purpose in creating a procedure (which in any event would require amendment to PD3A) involving initial decision in a DoL case by a court officer. Even if otherwise appropriate (which it is not) it would simply create additional, duplicated and unnecessary work for the Court of Protection.</p>
