	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter has been remitted by the Court of Appeal for re-hearing on the question of habitual residence (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A Child) (Habitual Residence: 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention)</span> [2023] EWCA Civ 659).  At this hearing, the court has also received evidence and submissions on the question of forum should this court determine that it has jurisdiction based on habitual residence and on the question of welfare, insofar as it relates to the issue of return, should this court conclude that this jurisdiction is the more appropriate forum.  Whilst the answer to the question of habitual residence is in my judgment clear, for the reasons explained below, this is a case in which the questions of forum and return have no wholly satisfactory solutions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns A, a girl born in March 2021 and now aged 2 years and 10 months old.  A holds British citizenship. In circumstances I shall come to, A is currently in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Zambia in the care of the mother, E (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;).  The mother is represented by Ms Marisa Allman of counsel.  The mother was born in Zambia.  A&#8217;s father, J (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;), is a British Citizen.  The father is represented by Mr Devereux of King&#8217;s Counsel and Professor Rob George of counsel.    The applications before the court are an application by the father dated 23 June 2022, and issued on 6 July 2022, seeking a return of A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales (the Court of Appeal subsequently concluding that the father also sought by that application orders relating to care and contact within the scope of section 1(1)(d) of the Family Law Act 1986 and, very probably, section 1(1)(a) of the 1986 Act) and an application issued on 3 April 2023 for a return order under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction of the High Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s application dated 23 June 2022 was heard by Arbuthnot J in November 2022.  Arbuthnot J handed down judgement on 23 December 2022 by which she dismissed the father&#8217;s application for want of jurisdiction, having determined that as at the date of the father&#8217;s application A was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of Zambia.  The father appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal.  On 12 June 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed the father&#8217;s appeal and, as I have noted, remitted the question of habitual residence to the High Court for re-hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The primary reason for the Court of Appeal remitting this matter was the likely need, in the Court of Appeal&#8217;s assessment, for further oral evidence on the question of habitual residence and this court heard further evidence from the mother and the father.  The father presented as a largely straightforward, although at times na&#239;ve, witness who had sought to accommodate the mother&#8217;s changing plans and proposals during what was a difficult relationship.  The mother presented as a somewhat immature and self-absorbed individual.  In particular, the mother demonstrated virtually no insight into the emotional impact of having separated A from her father and thereafter denying A contact with her father for an extended period.  On any given issue the mother was apt to respond almost entirely from the point of view of her own needs, with little understanding of the impact of her decisions on A or the need for the father to be involved in decisions concerning A&#8217;s welfare in circumstances where he shares parental responsibility.  The mother&#8217;s answers were often evasive and she had a tendency to dissemble.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The handing down of this judgment has, regrettably, been significantly delayed by further developments in the case occurring after the conclusion of evidence and submissions.  On 17 November 2023 the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (hereafter &#8216;the FCDO&#8217;) provided the court with further information.  Upon the court informing the FCDO that the material was relevant to the court&#8217;s decision, and would need to be disclosed to the parties, the FCDO gave notice that it may seek to assert that public interest immunity attached to the material in question.  After several weeks of deliberation, it was only on 19 January 2024 that the FCDO informed that court that the Minister had declined to sign a PII certificate and that therefore no application would be made. In the circumstances, the additional information was disclosed to the parties and each party made short additional submissions in writing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father was born in 1984 and is 39 years old. He has always lived in England.  The extended paternal family all reside in this jurisdiction.  The mother was born in Zambia in 1989 and is 34 years old. Members of the extended maternal family reside in Zambia and the mother has a sister who resides in Europe.  The mother moved to England in 2001 when aged 12, after the maternal grandmother married a British citizen. The maternal grandmother has dual Zambian and British citizenship.  The mother lived with the maternal grandmother in a council property and went to school until 2016.  Thereafter, she moved to London to study accounting before moving back to the county in which had lived with her mother.  She had employment in that area and then in London until 2017.  The mother has not been in employment since 2017. In her statement, the mother contends that she has visited Zambia at least once a year since 2002 and that she has always considered that country to be her home.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents met in England in 2016 and commenced co-habituation in 2017. Both parties accept that their relationship was a volatile one.  The father alleges significant domestic abuse against him by the mother during the relationship, contending that the mother was arrested twice and that he twice received medical treatment for injuries depicted in photographs contained in the bundle.  Those injuries included a black eye and scratches to his face, a laceration to the hand, a further black eye, grazes to the face and, on another occasion, a bloody nose.  At the outset of the hearing the court made clear that it was not equipped to conduct a fact finding hearing with respect to the allegations of domestic abuse levelled against the mother, which would need to be determined should the court decide it had jurisdiction and that England was the appropriate forum.  However, during her evidence, the mother conceded that she had caused the injuries to the father.  The mother told the court that &#8220;I did cause injuries to [him], I am completely shameful of those&#8221;, before confirming that the photographs of the injuries contained in the bundle are accurate.  In this context, I pause to note that, contrary to her admission under oath in these proceedings, in a sworn affidavit dated 20 January 2023 filed in civil proceedings issued by the mother in Zambia for a protection order, the mother denied the father&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse.  </p>

In her chronology prepared for these proceedings, the mother describes the parties as having decided to purchase a property in England as their family home.  The mother and father renovated the property to a high standard.  During cross-examination by Mr Devereux, the mother stated that she had identified the property and had been responsible for the renovations.  The mother stated that her aim was to create a comfortable home for the family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the parents&#8217; relationship the mother travelled regularly to Zambia between October 2018 and November 2021, having developed plans for commencing a business in that jurisdiction.  The mother rented a flat in Zambia in October 2019. In November 2019 she registered a business in Zambia in the joint ownership of herself and the father, with her being the majority shareholder, and purchased a six acre plot of land.  The mother later purchased an additional 1.5 acres of land and bought a car in Zambia.  Whilst the bundle contains plans for a salon and spa on the land, no building has yet taken place and the business has not traded to date.  The father has had considerable success in business in this jurisdiction and the mother&#8217;s business plans in Zambia were financed by &#163;850,000 from the father, he says on the understanding that the business would &#8220;benefit our household income&#8221;.  The evidence suggests that at this time the parents planned for the mother to travel back and forth between England and Zambia, running the business partly from the United Kingdom and partly when visiting Zambia, allowing the father to maintain his business interests in this jurisdiction.</p>

The mother travelled back to England in December 2020 and the parents visited Europe in December 2020 for a &#8220;babymoon&#8221;.  From January 2021, the mother rented a property in Zambia, comprising a four bedroomed house.  The mother states she rented that property on a 12 month lease. </p>

The father rented a flat following her birth before the parties returned to the family home.  During her evidence, the mother stated that the flat was rented as it was in close in proximity to the hospital at which she wished to given birth to A.  Following the birth of A, the father added the mother&#8217;s name to the title of the family home in April 2021.  Having returned to Zambia, the maternal grandmother came back to England in the summer of 2021.  The mother confirmed in cross-examination that the parents had organised a christening for A in England attended by a number of guests, including the maternal grandmother.</p>

Following an argument in Autumn 2021, the mother travelled to Spain with A for a week without informing the father or seeking his consent to remove A from the jurisdiction.  The mother and A later travelled to Zambia for a three week visit between October and November 2021.  This was the only period that A spent in Zambia prior to March 2022.  In her second statement, the mother states that she &#8220;registered&#8221; A with a GP in Zambia, who started to receive medical care in that jurisdiction.  However, in cross-examination the mother described the visit to the GP in Zambia as simply a routine check-up.  The mother conceded during cross-examination that she did not consult the father before taking this course of action and told the court &#8220;I did not think I needed to mention it&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2021, the mother suffered an adverse reaction to a booster vaccination for Covid-19, leading her to develop what is said to be an auto-immune disease (on 15 August 2022 the mother travelled to Switzerland where she was diagnosed her with post COVID-19 vaccine Syndrome and a number of other conditions).  The mother&#8217;s mental health was adversely affected by this development and she became depressed and paranoid.  The father alleges that the mother threatened to harm herself.  During this period, which lasted until February 2022, the father asserts that he undertook the majority of care for A, assisted by the maternal grandmother.  Whilst the mother has described the care provided by the father to A during this period as &#8220;hands on&#8221;, in her third statement the mother contends that the father was &#8220;reluctant to provide the full support I and our daughter needed&#8221; and that the father &#8220;stated he no longer wished to provide physical and emotional support for me and my daughter on any level&#8221;.

The father contends that the primary reason for the trip in March 2022 was to attend a memorial event for the maternal grandfather and to advance the mother&#8217;s business plans.  The father asserts that the family was due to return to England.  The mother contends that at the point of departure the father understood that the mother would be remaining in Zambia with A.  In so far as it is alleged that the father consented to the mother moving to Zambia with A prior to the family&#8217;s departure the father denies this and, on the mother&#8217;s own case, there is no evidence to support that contention.  </p>

The mother states that a return flight was booked because it was cheaper.  However, in subsequent communications with the father, the mother told the father the date of her return flight was booked, namely 31 March 2022.  The mother likewise concedes that most of A&#8217;s belongings and most of the mother&#8217;s belongings remained at the family home in England, as did the mother&#8217;s car, worth some &#163;150,000 and not declared SORN until August 2022, and the family dog, which was placed in a kennel.  Before Arbuthnot J, the mother accepted that she had made no arrangements to ship her extensive belongings in England to Zambia. The mother contends that the belongings were left in England because she had already accumulated sufficient items in Zambia.  </p>

She conceded that the parents took enough food for A to Zambia to last 3 to 4 weeks (a period that corresponded roughly with the date for her return flight given to the father in later communications).  In her third statement, the mother alleged that the father &#8220;clearly wasn&#8217;t expecting me to come back to England with him at the end of this trip.&#8221;  Whilst the father departed before the mother, he states that expected the mother would return shortly after he had done.

Again, the father denies that he consented to the mother removing A to Zambia permanently. The mother contends the parents interviewed a nanny in Zambia in March 2022.  The father says that the parties discussed hiring a nanny, the intention being that someone known to the family would be available for when A was visiting and the mother needed to work on her business, but did not do so.  In her written evidence, the mother states that in April 2022 she hired two housekeepers, two day and night guards and a gardener and enrolled A into baby development classes in Zambia.  The mother further relies on food deliveries sent to her by the father from England as supporting her contention that a decision had been made that she and A would be remaining in Zambia.  </p>

Within this context, in her oral evidence the mother accepted, as she had done before Arbuthnot J, that certain discussions that took place between the parents whilst she and A were in Zambia did not demonstrate a settled intention on her part to remain in that jurisdiction with A.  The mother accepted that during this period she had raised the possibility of relocating (to use the mother&#8217;s word in evidence) to South Africa.  The mother further conceded that, subsequent to the father departing Zambia, she took A to South Africa and that whilst there viewed potential properties.  As had been the case in relation to her trip to Spain with A in Autumn 2021 and taking A to the GP in Zambia in October 2021, the mother conceded that she did not inform the father in advance of her intention to take A to South Africa nor seek his consent as a holder of parental responsibility for A.   During the course of cross-examination of the mother, Mr Devereux unearthed a further incident of the mother taking A to another jurisdiction, this time the United States, without notifying or obtaining the consent of the father.</p>

On this point, the Court of Appeal concluded at [75] that the order sought by the father was within the scope of the Family Law Act 1986.  Following the father&#8217;s application, the mother took further steps in respect of A&#8217;s welfare without informing the father.

Thereafter, the mother asserts that she noticed injuries to A&#8217;s genitalia when changing A&#8217;s nappy.  At an urgent visit to what is described as a private children&#8217;s clinic, A was seen by a Dr M. A was referred to Dr G at what the mother contends is a &#8220;specialist child abuse centre&#8221; at the University Teaching Hospital.

In addition to their being no indication of the location from which the sample or samples were taken, the letter from the National Food Laboratory gives no details of the technique applied to determine that the swab taken was positive for spermatozoa.  The father&#8217;s lawyers in Zambia have raised in the Zambian civil proceedings commenced by the mother for a protection order that the mother is in possession of a medical report that they contend should be confidential to the police.

However, on 15 November 2022, the mother applied to the Zambian court for a civil protection order against the father under the Anti-Gender Based Violence Act 2011, relying on the allegation that the father had &#8220;defiled&#8221; A.  The written submissions on behalf of the mother in the Zambian civil proceedings state that she is certain that the father abused A in circumstances where A did not spend time with anyone else on the day in question and there was no explanation for the positive findings of spermatozoa.  In evidence in the Zambian proceedings the mother alleged the father had failed to show concern for A&#8217;s wellbeing following the incident.  </p>

The protection order obtained by the mother in Zambia expired at the end of October 2023.  During her oral evidence, the mother claimed to have signed an application for a further protection order.

On 16 May 2023 the father applied to the Zambian court to for permission to apply to commit the mother for failing to comply with the Zambian contact order, which permission was granted on 14 July 2023.

It is not necessary for me to descend to detail. The legal structure for these issues in an international private family case is plain. The court first determines whether or not the court in England and Wales has jurisdiction. It does so, depending on the countries involved, with or without reference to various international provisions. In a case such as this, which is not one between Member States of the EU, the approach is straightforward. The court decides jurisdiction and decides it with regard to the habitual residence of the child at the relevant time. That determination in this case has been made and is not open to review or challenge and was not open to review or challenge at the hearing before Newton J.</p>

The burden is upon the applicant for such a stay to persuade the court, on the principles of <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada</span> and related cases, that the stay should be granted and that, despite having jurisdiction, England and Wales should cede to another court which is the more convenient forum.</p>

As at the date the Supreme Court gave judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 was directly applicable in English law.  In considering the concept of habitual residence in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, Baroness Hale did so in the context of the question of whether jurisdiction in that case was established under Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003.

Further noting at [45] that, at that time, in the vast majority of cases jurisdiction would be governed by the Regulation, which the courts in the United Kingdom would have to construe in accordance with the guidance given by the Court of Justice of the European Union, Baroness Hale concluded as follows by reference to the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Proceedings brought by A&#160;</span>(Case&#160;C-523/07)&#160;[2010] Fam 42:</p>

This was where she had lived and worked before her short-lived marriage to the father. This was where she intended to stay. This was where she had a child by another relationship, KWA, now aged two, who lives with her and K. So neither she nor K will have perceived the return here as in any way temporary. From K's point of view, this was where he had lived for some 20 months before his return to the United States in March 2010. This is where he became integrated into a social and family environment during the eleven and a half months in which he lived here before the US Court of Appeals' judgment of 31 July 2012. Against all those powerful factors in favour of the child's integration or acclimatisation, there is only his father's fervent desire, of which K may very well have been aware, that he should return to live in the United States.&#8221;</p>

Some of these are objective: how long were they there, what were their living conditions while there, were they at school or at work, and so on? But subjective factors are also relevant: what was the reason for their being there, and what were their perceptions about being there? I agree with Lord Wilson JSC (para 37) that &#8220;wishes&#8221;, &#8220;views&#8221;, &#8220;intentions&#8221; and &#8220;decisions&#8221; are not the right words, whether we are considering the habitual residence of a child or indeed an adult. It is better to think in terms of the reasons why a person is in a particular place and his or her perception of the situation while there&#8212;their state of mind. All of these factors feed into the essential question, which is whether the child has achieved a sufficient degree of integration into a social and family environment in the country in question for his or her residence there to be termed &#8220;habitual&#8221;.</p>

It is clear that in certain circumstances the requisite degree of integration can occur quickly. For example article 9 of Regulation B2R, the detail of which is irrelevant, expressly envisages a child's acquisition of a fresh habitual residence within three months of his move. In the <span style="font-style:italic">J</span> case, cited above, Lord Brandon suggested that the passage of an &#8220;appreciable&#8221; period of the time was required before a fresh habitual residence could be acquired. In <span style="font-style:italic">Marinos v Marinos</span> [2007] 2 FLR 1018, para 31, Munby J doubted whether Lord Brandon's suggestion was consonant with the modern European law; and it must now be regarded as too absolute.

This is why, as referred to in my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G-E (Children) (Hague Convention 1980: Repudiatory Retention and Habitual Residence)</span> [2019] 2 FLR 17 (&#8220;Re G-E&#8221;), at [59], the &#8220;comparative nature of the exercise&#8221; requires the court to consider the factors which connect the child to each State where they are alleged to be habitually resident.  This is reflected in Mr Tyler&#8217;s written submissions when he referred to the relevance of a child&#8217;s &#8220;degree of connection&#8221; with the State in which he/she resided before they arrived in the new State.&#8221;</p>

Mr Devereux and Professor George submit that the definition of relevant date provided by s.7(c) of the Act, namely &#8220;the date of the application (or first application, if two or more are determined together)&#8221;, plainly refers to the date entered on the application form and not the date of issue.  The point is said to be of some relevance in this case as, whilst the father&#8217;s application bears the date 23 June 2022 and was lodged with the court office on that date, due to an administrative oversight in the court office the application was not issued until 6 July 2022.

He argued that this would not mean the application of the Hague Convention principles by analogy, but the results in most cases would be the same.</p>

It would come so close to applying the Hague Convention principles by analogy that it would be indistinguishable from it in practice. It relies upon the Hague Convention concepts of 'habitual residence', 'unauthorised removal', and 'retention'; it then gives no indication of the sort of circumstances in which this 'strong presumption' might be rebutted; but at times Mr Setright appeared to be arguing for the same sort of serious risk to the child which might qualify as a defence under article 13(b) of the Convention. All of these concepts have their difficulties, even in Convention cases&#8230;There is no warrant for introducing similar technicalities into the 'swift, realistic and unsentimental assessment of the best interests of the child' in non-Convention cases. Nor is such a presumption capable of taking into account the huge variety of circumstances in which these cases can arise, many of them very far removed from the public perception of kidnapping or abduction.</p>

A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run. It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">[49]  The mother refers to the list of seven specific aspects of a child's welfare, known as the welfare check-list, to which a court is required by section 1(3) of the 1989 Act to have particular regard. She points out, however, that, by subsections (3) and (4), the check-list expressly applies only to the making of certain orders under the 1989 Act, including a specific issue order, as is confirmed by the seventh specific aspect, namely the range of powers under that Act . The first six specified aspects of a child's welfare are therefore not expressly applicable to the making of an order under the inherent jurisdiction. But their utility in any analysis of a child's welfare has been recognised for nearly 30 years. In its determination of an application under the inherent jurisdiction governed by consideration of a child's welfare, the court is likely to find it appropriate to consider the first six aspects of welfare specified in section 1(3) (see <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (A Child) (Abduction: Hearing the Child)</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1557, [2015] Fam 263, at para 22 (iv), Ryder LJ); and, if it is considering whether to make a summary order, it will initially examine whether, in order sufficiently to identify what the child's welfare requires, it should conduct an inquiry into any or all of those aspects and, if so, how extensive that inquiry should be.&#8221;</p>

In the context of the present case, that is, in fact, shorthand for a return order made after a summary welfare determination. This is relevant because a summary return order more accurately defines an order made under the provisions of the 1980 Convention. It is also important because the exercise in which the court is engaged when the court is determining an application for a return order under the inherent jurisdiction or the Children Act 1989 ("the CA 1989 ") is not the same as when the court is determining an application for the return of a child under the 1980 Convention. However, in this judgment, I will continue to use the expressions "summary return" and "summary return order" but I do so in the terms explained above.&#8221;</p>

It is a welfare determination in respect of which an array of factors will be relevant and which the court must balance when determining what order to make. As Lord Wilson said in Re NY , part of that exercise will include the court determining, in respect of all relevant matters, but in particular in respect of the matters set out in section 1(3) of the CA 1989 and any allegations of domestic abuse, whether, in order sufficiently to identify what the child's welfare requires, the court should conduct an inquiry into any or all of those matters and, if so, how extensive that inquiry should be.&#8221;</p>

However, such a situation does not necessarily prevent the proper determination of the application for a return order.  For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Child)(Abduction: Inherent Jurisdiction) </span>[2022] 1 FLR 737 at [45] the Court of Appeal declined to criticise the court for proceeding to determine the application for return order in the absence of knowledge of the outcome of pending extradition proceedings, in circumstances where that case had already been subject to considerable delay.</p>

As I made clear at the outset, in the circumstances of this case the questions of forum and return have no wholly satisfactory solutions.

In the circumstances, and having regard to the exposition of the law set out above, the question for the court is whether, having regard to all the relevant circumstances and as a matter of fact, A had achieved by 23 June 2022 a degree of integration in a social and family environment in Zambia sufficient for her to be habitually resident there. When the matter was before the Court of Appeal, Moylan LJ observed at [73] as follows with respect to the question of habitual residence in this case:</p>

[A] had been retained by the mother in Zambia at or about the end of March 2022, with no pre-planning at all and with all her paternal family and her primary home throughout her life remaining in England.  The mother&#8217;s intentions as to where she planned to live were, at least, open to question.  However, I consider Mr Devereux was right to accept that the issue of habitual residence should be reheard.  The parties had given oral evidence on that issue at the hearing before the judge and it would difficult to exclude the prospect of a judge at a rehearing deciding to hear short, focused, evidence again.&#8221;</p>

The parties, helpfully, agreed a schedule of findings made by Arbuthnot J, which findings were not the subject of the appeal.  In respect of the Schedule, four findings were the subject of dispute between the parties as to their status at this hearing in circumstances where Mr Devereux and Professor George submitted that those findings were based on what the Court of Appeal found was the erroneous approach of Arbuthnot J to the test for habitual residence.  In any event, and for the avoidance of doubt, in circumstances where this matter was remitted for re-hearing of the issue of habitual residence I make clear that I have reached my own conclusions on the facts that inform that question.</p>

It is A&#8217;s habitual residence that is in question and A&#8217;s degree of integration that is under consideration.

Both her mother and her father had substantial connections with this jurisdiction. The father is a British citizen and has always lived in this jurisdiction.  Whilst the mother sought to portray otherwise, I am satisfied that the mother also had very substantial connections with this jurisdiction, having lived here for some 20 years, first with her mother, who is a British citizen, and then as an adult.  Whilst Ms Allman attempted to present the mother as a vulnerable young woman who lived a peripatetic existence in a foreign country both before and after she met the father, I am satisfied that the evidence does not support that characterisation. </p>

As at 8 March 2022 all of A&#8217;s paternal family, and her maternal grandmother, resided in this jurisdiction.

A was not of an age where, for example, she was able to conceptualise what the mother&#8217;s, property, business links or friendships in Zambia meant for her own relationship to that jurisdiction.  Whilst I also accept that the mother had property in Zambia, it was almost entirely unknown to A and had never been her home.  There is no evidence that it was equipped prior to her arrival to accommodate A&#8217;s arrival.

The family travelled on return tickets booked by the mother; this included the maternal grandmother, who was involved in caring for A in England and also travelled on a return ticket.  The mother informed the father of her proposed return date and the maternal grandmother had a return date of 31 March 2022.  Prior to departure the mother told no one that she was moving, or intended to move, permanently to Zambia with A.  All of the mother&#8217;s and A&#8217;s belongings in England remained in this jurisdiction.  No attempt was made by the mother to extricate herself or A from their practical arrangements in England.  There is no evidence before the court that, prior to the family&#8217;s departure, the mother made arrangements in Zambia to indicate she intended to remain there permanently with A.  The text messages between the parents denote a clear expectation on the part of the father that the mother would return to the jurisdiction with A.  I am satisfied that on departing from England, the mother intended to return to the jurisdiction with A.  </p>

Again, the text messages between the parents denote a continiuing expectation on the part of the father that he expected the mother to return with A.  Whilst the evidence does demonstrate that the father submitted to extensions to the mother&#8217;s stay in Zambia with A, in the context of the fact that the duration of the mother&#8217;s previous trips to Zambia had been flexible, and where she had previously returned A, I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s conduct does not evidence an intention to submit to A remaining in Zambia.  In the context of the mother&#8217;s prior conduct, the father cannot be criticised for taking time to realise that, contrary to what I am satisfied was her intention at the date of departure, the mother did not intend to return.  Likewise, the fact that the father was required to discuss contact with A is not evidence an intention to submit to A remaining in Zambia.</p>

I acknowledge that the <span style="font-style:italic">mother </span>had established arrangements in Zambia borne of her regular trips to that jurisdiction.  However, in the context of what I am satisfied was the mother&#8217;s intention to return with A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales within three weeks, the mother made no prior arrangements for A&#8217;s medical care or education in Zambia or the transport of her belongings to that jurisdiction.

The mother&#8217;s evidence before Arbuthnot J, and confirmed to this court, demonstrates that even when it became apparent that the mother did not intend to return with A to this jurisdiction, the mother did not have a settled intention to remain in the jurisdiction of Zambia with A.  Ms Allman rightly reminds the court that, in determining habitual residence, there is no requirement that there be an intention to reside in the country in question permanently or indefinitely.  However, there is a difference between intending to be in a place and then spending time away from that place, and not being certain as to in which place you intend to be.  Within this context, I am satisfied that in the months leading up to father&#8217;s application, there was a lack of clarity as to what the future held for the mother and A in terms of <span style="font-style:italic">which </span>jurisdiction they would settle in and, therefore, whether their presence in Zambia would be short or long term.  </p>

As I have already referred to, during her oral evidence the mother appeared to have given almost no thought to the impact this course of action would have had on A, who went from living with her father to having no contact with him in the space of a little over two weeks.  The mother presented as having almost no insight into A&#8217;s emotional needs in this context.  Given A&#8217;s age at the time, even had the mother thought to explain to A the position, it would have been difficult to assist A to understand the sudden and, from her perspective, almost complete absence of her father from her life.   I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that A was having no meaningful contact with her father for nine weeks following a single online contact on 8 April 2022, the mother having prevented all contact following the father&#8217;s return to England.  </p>

Within this context, it is plain that the mother was well integrated into her social and family environment in Zambia. She had strong links to that jurisdiction, a property in the jurisdiction and an, albeit non-trading, business.  She also had extended family in the jurisdiction, in which her own mother was then present.  Within this context, I accept that the mother&#8217;s integration in Zambia would have assisted A in integrating in a social and family environment.

During the course of oral submissions on the point, Ms Allman made clear that the mother has &#8220;conflicted feelings&#8221; on the issue of forum and would have &#8220;more confidence&#8221; in the process in this jurisdiction.  Ultimately, however, Ms Allman argued that the court should find that Zambia is the more appropriate forum and grant a stay.  The burden lies on the mother to demonstrate that Zambia is clearly and distinctly the more convenient forum for the determination of question of A&#8217;s welfare, being the jurisdiction where the question can be more suitably tried for the interests of all parties and the ends of justice.  I am not satisfied that the mother has discharged that burden.</p>

A is a British citizen and prior to 8 March 2022 she had lived her whole life in this jurisdiction.  As I have found, it was not intended that A would remain in the jurisdiction of Zambia following the short trip planned in March 2022.  That position only changed in the circumstances I have set out above.  </p>

However, whilst unsatisfactory, I am satisfied that the fact this court retains jurisdiction in respect of A nonetheless acts to reinforce the conclusion that the jurisdiction of England and Wales is the natural forum in this case.  The parent seeking relief with respect to the question of A&#8217;s welfare brought proceedings in this jurisdiction only a month after he concluded that the mother would not be returning A.  Those proceedings have continued in this jurisdiction since that date, and have resulted in extensive evidence being assembled in this jurisdiction.  </p>

Further, the mother confirmed in evidence that she intends to issue <span style="font-style:italic">further</span> proceedings in this jurisdiction under Schedule 1 of the Children Act 1989, for financial relief in respect of A, and the Trust of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, for relief in relation to the family home.

Whilst the allegation arose in Zambia, the alleged event was unwitnessed.  A is too young to give her own account. In the circumstances, in addition to the father&#8217;s evidence, the primary evidence with respect to the allegation will comprise the medical report, which is already in mother&#8217;s possession and which the father has indicated he does not dispute the authenticity of, the swab results (in the form of the letter from the Zambian Ministry of Health National Food Laboratory dated 20 September 2022), which again are already in the possession of the court, and any relevant police disclosure, including the DNA test results, any medical photography and the interview(s) of the father.  I accept that that latter evidence <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>be more challenging to secure, although requests can be made of the Zambian authorities and this court can reasonably anticipate that the Zambian authorities will co-operate in assisting with provision of documentary evidence.  This court in any event has a record of the father&#8217;s evidence in respect of the allegation given to the Zambian court in the civil protection order proceedings.  Whilst I accept that the father could give evidence on these issues by video-link were they to be the subject of determination in family proceedings brought in Zambia, if the issue was dealt with by this court the father could give evidence in person and on an equal footing with the mother.  </p>

With respect to those assessments, I am satisfied that any comprehensive welfare assessment of A&#8217;s best interests, including any assessment of contact, would be more easily conducted in a jurisdiction which both parents can access in order to be fully involved in such an assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am likewise not satisfied that the additional information provided by the FCDO on 17 November 2023 renders Zambia clearly and distinctly the more convenient forum for the determination of question of A&#8217;s welfare.  First, it is not entirely clear from the information provided by the FCDO what stage any extradition request has reached.  The letter of 17 November 2021 speaks of &#8220;an extradition request for the father's arrest&#8221; having been submitted via INTERPOL.  In the circumstances, no timescales are available to the court with respect to the commencement of any extradition application.  Second, whilst a matter for the court considering any extradition application and not a matter on which this court makes any findings, having regard to the evidence this court heard regarding the conduct of the police investigation in Zambia, it is to be anticipated that the extradition proceedings are likely to be contested, either on the basis of that information or on other grounds.  In the circumstances, it is unlikely that this court will know the outcome of any extradition proceedings for a number of months, even assuming the request made by Zambia is acted on immediately.  Further, any criminal proceedings that may proceed in Zambia consequent on a successful extradition of the father will not be considering the welfare of A, but will be concerned with dealing with the offence for which the father has been charged.  </p>

As I have noted, during the course of her evidence the mother confirmed that she will comply with an order for return were the court to conclude that such an order is in A&#8217;s best interests.</p>

In examining the question of whether a return order is in A&#8217;s best interests, it is important to recall that the step the court is considering is a return to this jurisdiction for the dispute concerning her welfare to be decided.  An order requiring the mother to return A to this jurisdiction does not inevitably means she will remain here permanently.  That is a question that will fall for determination in due course.  At this stage, this court is determining whether A&#8217;s welfare requires her to be returned to this jurisdiction whilst the court with jurisdiction with respect to A determines the welfare dispute between the parties.  </p>

In the circumstances, whilst the father points to the apparently precarious position of the mother in respect of her accommodation, with the mother and A residing in a property on a month to month lease, a lack of consistent income, with the mother&#8217;s business providing no income and her being reliant on family and the father for funds, the limitations imposed on the mother consequent on her diagnoses and to what he contends are difficulties with the provision of schooling and health care services and with disparities in gender equality in Zambia, those are matters that will fall to be considered in greater detail when determining the final outcome of any continuing welfare dispute between the parents as to where A should live.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances of this case, the weight to be given to the starting point that it is likely to be better for A to return to her home country for disputes about her future to be decided here is again somewhat reduced by the level of delay that has occurred in this case.  As a result of that delay, A has now been in Zambia for nearly two years.  She is enrolled in education in that jurisdiction, has contact with her extended maternal family in that jurisdiction and has made friends.  In those circumstances, the impact on A of the change of circumstances which an order compelling her return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales whilst her future welfare is determined will not be insignificant and will result in a degree of disruption, at least in the short term.  However, against the effect on A of a change of circumstances, and again whilst unsatisfactory, I am satisfied that there are factors that weigh in favour of return to enable the resolution of the welfare dispute in respect of A.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The impact on A of a change of circumstances whilst her future welfare is determined will, I am satisfied, be mitigated by a number of factors.  A is a British citizen.  A remains registered with a GP in this jurisdiction.  Subject to the father&#8217;s undertaking to vacate the property, A would be returning to the family home, in which her belongings remain and would be able to reside in her family home whilst the court determines the welfare dispute between the parties.  In the circumstances, I am not able to accept Ms Allman&#8217;s submission that A would be returning to an environment that is unfamiliar to her.  Subject to suitable safeguards, the father is willing to fund flights for A to visit her extended maternal family in Zambia. The maternal grandmother, with whom A has a close relationship, spends extended periods in England and is at the present time in England residing with her English boyfriend.  A would also be in a position to have contact with her extended paternal family.</p>

The retention of A outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales by the mother has had a serious impact on her relationship with her father and her wider paternal family and hence on her emotional welfare, an impact that has been substantially aggravated by the mother&#8217;s approach to contact.  Within this context, there is an urgent need to determine the welfare disputes between the parties to ensure, to the extent that it is safe to do so, A&#8217;s relationship with her father is restored and promoted.  There are no family proceedings ongoing in Zambia in which that determination could be made.</p>

Thereafter, welfare assessments will be required to assist the court in determining what arrangements are in A&#8217;s best interests moving forward, having regard to any findings made with respect to harm.  I am satisfied that an order requiring the mother to return A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales whilst the court determines the welfare dispute between the parties is necessary to ensure that A&#8217;s welfare needs can be properly assessed and met.  </p>

On the evidence before the court, I am further satisfied that the mother has continued to obstruct and delay contact during the course of these proceedings.  Whilst it would appear that, latterly, the mother has permitted some supervised contact in South Africa, having regard to the evidence before the court, whilst A remains outside the jurisdiction I am not satisfied that the mother can be relied on to continue to promote the regular supervised contact that will be required to complete the welfare assessments necessary to determine the welfare dispute in respect of A.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining that dispute, it will be vital that the court has a reliable assessment of A&#8217;s relationship with and interactions with her father.  As I have noted, during her oral evidence the mother displayed almost no insight into the emotional impact on A of her approach to contact.  During that evidence, she variously stated that &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the impact on A has been of not being able to see her father&#8221; and &#8220;I have not thought about how it would affect her&#8221;.  Given the mother&#8217;s obstructive approach to contact to date, and the impact on welfare assessments should she once again decide to take that approach, I am satisfied that the most effective way of ensuring that the court has such assessments available to it, and of meeting A&#8217;s emotional need for a relationship with her father in the interim, is to order A&#8217;s return to the jurisdiction.  Contact with her father for the purpose of assessment and promoting A&#8217;s relationship with him in the interim, subject to suitable safeguarding measures being put in place pending the determination of the allegation of sexual abuse, will be more readily policed by the court if she is returned to this jurisdiction.  Given the complexities of this case, and the mother&#8217;s past obstructive conduct, I am not able to accept Ms Alman&#8217;s submission that assessments required by Cafcass or other agencies could successfully be undertaken by mother visiting England with A.</p>

In addition, the father has made clear that he will ensure that the mother and A are able to return to the family home.
