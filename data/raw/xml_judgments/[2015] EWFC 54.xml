	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the bundle lodged by the local authority in this case failed completely to comply with the requirements of PD27A.  In particular, it failed to contain <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> of the documents specified at paragraph 4.3 of the Practice Direction, the so called &#8216;Practice Direction documents&#8217;.  Thus, until 9.00am on the morning on which the hearing commenced the Court was without an adequate Case Summary, a Chronology, any Position Statements and, most significantly given the Court was being asked to make findings regarding alleged inflicted injury to an 11 month old child, no Schedule of Findings.  Further, in addition to the absence of these documents, JL, as a then litigant in person, had not been provided with any<span style="font-style:italic"/>of the other documents contained in the bundle (save for some very limited documentation received from the mother&#8217;s solicitor at an earlier date).</p>

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the failure to comply with PD27A was a plain breach of that Practice Direction, it is also the case that the failure of the local authority was of particular detriment to JL and placed his right to a fair trial in significant jeopardy.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The absence of a schedule of findings meant that the respondents to this application did not have proper notice of the particulars of the allegations made against the mother and JL.  In the mother&#8217;s case this difficulty was in part, but only in part, mitigated by the fact that she had lawyers to advise her.  However, as a litigant in person, JL arrived at court on the first day of the hearing without any notice of the allegations made against him or of the totality of the evidence on which the local authority relied to make good those allegations, and with no real idea that the local authority was that very day intending to invite a judge of the High Court to find that he had injured deliberately an 11 month old child.  It was the most remarkable and unsatisfactory state of affairs.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the Court expressed its extreme displeasure at the approach of the local authority towards JL, and to avoid the need for an extended adjournment while he got to grips with the issues and, from a layman&#8217;s perspective, the relatively complex evidence in this case, the local authority agreed to fund representation for JL.  The Court is grateful to Mr Jamieson of counsel and to those who agreed to come on the record to instruct him for stepping into the breach.  The court is further grateful to Mr Jamieson for discharging his professional duties with evident skill notwithstanding the short notice given to him.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the local authority is to be commended for agreeing to fund representation for JL, I must observe that such a step, whilst of course desirable, would not have been necessary had the local authority complied with the requirements of PD27A and provided JL with a properly constituted bundle.  </p>

The local authority is under a heavy obligation to ensure that the procedure at all stages is both transparent and fair, both in and out of court.  The fact that a party or intervener in public law proceedings may appear in person does not relieve a local authority of its responsibilities in this regard.  Indeed, it requires the local authority to be even more diligent to ensure that those responsibilities are fully and properly discharged.</p>

The mother had, prior to the commencement of this final hearing and by way of a statement dated 26 January 2015, given an explanation for the bruising sustained by A on the back of his thighs.  Namely that I, who is significantly larger and heavier than a child of a comparable age, had fallen back and sat down heavily on plastic toys in his cot.  When pressed in cross examination to agree that this mechanism provided an explanation for the injuries seen on the back of A&#8217;s thighs the consultant paediatrician called to give evidence in this case initially expressed the view that, in the absence of a witnessed incident of that nature, it was unlikely that such an incident could result in the bruising seen.</p>

The consultant had not been asked about the photograph during her evidence in chief.  The photograph, which was undated and not exhibited to any statement describing the circumstances in which it was taken nor what it purported to show, appeared to show a bruise to the back of A&#8217;s thigh sustained, it was said by Ms Howe, when he sat down heavily on a toy whilst in his kinship placement with the maternal grandmother.  </p>

As will become apparent, when giving evidence Mr Morris confirmed that whilst the mark had not developed into a bruise by the time he left the house, the bruise shown on the photograph corresponded to the location of the red mark that he had witnessed following A&#8217;s impact on the toy.

The mother is in no way socially isolated and benefits from an extremely supportive family, as evidenced by her own mother&#8217;s willingness to care for A during the currency of these proceedings.  There is no evidence of the mother having acute mental health difficulties and no evidence of drug or alcohol misuse on the part of the mother.

Whilst it is the case that the mother missed a number of medical appointments for A prior to November 2014 this must, in my judgment, be placed in the context of the mother having lost a daughter prior to birth two years ago in circumstances where she holds health professionals responsible in failing adequately to detect her pre-eclampsia.  Whilst there have been some concerns about J being late for school again, in my judgment, this must be placed in the context of the mother living a considerable distance from that school and having to walk a long way with two small children in order to ensure J&#8217;s attendance.  This issue has been completely ameliorated since J started at a school closer to home. </p>

The mother lived with the children in secure accommodation maintained to a good standard.  The mother&#8217;s wider family, who have been assessed as supportive and a protective factor by the local authority live a short distance away, as do the fathers of the two children. The social workers in the case are clear that during their involvement with the children the mother has fully engaged with social services, has always spoken in a positive manner regarding the children and has a good attachment with them.  The social workers are of the view that the mother has always responded to the children&#8217;s needs and they have responded to her.

Indeed, the medical records in this case demonstrate that thirteen days after A&#8217;s birth his weight was on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile, at eight weeks he was on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile and at sixteen weeks he was on 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile.  The photograph produced by the mother in court shows a little boy with significant rolls of &#8216;baby fat&#8217;.

This was observed and reported not only by the family but also allocated social workers in the case.  Mr Morris gave oral evidence that I was quite mobile for a child of his age and a bit more advanced than a child of a similar age in pulling himself up on the furniture.  Accordingly, this is not a case of bruising to an immobile infant but to a little boy who was already trying, and sometimes failing, to stand.  Indeed it is of note that Dr Thompson records a number of bruises to A&#8217;s shins that she is entirely content are consistent with accidental injury to a mobile child.  </p>

During this conversation, Ms O&#8217;Shaughnessy saw that A kept getting his legs stuck between the bars of the cot and that at one stage he fell backwards in the cot and banged his head.  As a result of this, A started crying and had to be comforted by the mother.</p>

For the first time the mother related in detail an incident in which she had had to grab A firmly to prevent him falling when he kicked out with his feet and pushed away with his hands as she picked him up.  The mother described how A is a large child who moves around a great deal and that, as a relatively small woman, she sometimes struggles to hold on to him.  In this instance she asserted that she had been worried she was going to drop him so &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">really grabbed him tight</span>.&#8221;  The mother suggested this happened on more than one occasion.  It will be recalled that at the hospital, JL had related that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that a month ago he noted some fainter bruising around ribs from being picked up</span>&#8221;.  I also note that Mr Morris is clear in his parenting assessment of the mother that he has witnessed A having a number of age related tantrums where he will throw himself back and kick out.</p>

Dr Thompson qualified as a doctor in 1996 and became a consultant paediatrician in December 2009.  She undertakes ward rounds, clinic duties and Emergency Department rotations.  She has the level of training of a consultant paediatrician and also has Level 3 Safeguarding training.  Within the context of her professional role she gives medical opinions on alleged non-accidental injury and neglect, attends strategy meetings as the medical lead and participates in peer discussion of alleged cases of abuse.  Dr Thompson told me that the evaluation of bruising is a large part of the work a general paediatrician will see.  She is trained to recognise patterns of bruising that may be suspicious of non-accidental injury and sees, on average, one case per month of bruising requiring evaluation for suspected non-accidental injury.</p>

In her oral evidence Dr Thompson addressed the possibility that the injuries to the neck had been caused by the incident on 1 November when J grabbed A around the neck.  Dr Thompson considered this explanation an unlikely cause for such bruising.  No opinion is expressed by Dr Thompson in her report concerning the bruising to I&#8217;s chest although in her oral evidence she noted that the Cardiff Study would suggest that bruising to the chest in a child of A&#8217;s age is highly suspicious for non-accidental injury.  </p>

This understandable pre-occupation is in my judgment the most likely explanation for why the mother and JL did not give a comprehensive account of all the possible mechanisms of accidental injuries whilst at hospital. I also note that by the time they saw Dr Thompson it was 3.20am and they had been at the hospital for seven hours.
