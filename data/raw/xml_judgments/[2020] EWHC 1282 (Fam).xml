	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following a contested hearing in this matter, I circulated to the parties a draft judgment in which I had named the Local Authority, whose application it was, and the social workers who had conduct of the case. Neither the children nor the parents were named, in order to protect the children&#8217;s privacy. The Local Authority, the mother and the children&#8217;s Guardian, each submitted that the historical profile of this case was such as to permit easy identification of the children by the piecing together of simple pieces of jigsaw information. Notwithstanding the gravity of my findings against the Local Authority and the manifest desirability of those findings being in the public domain, it was contended that the impact on the children and most particularly on child B would be so potentially damaging as to require the anonymisation of both the Local Authority and the social workers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">During the course of the remote hearing I enquired whether the press was present. I had assumed that given the nature of the application and the abundant guidance now available concerning remote hearings in the Family Court and the Court of Protection, the press would have been in attendance. Unfortunately, on the particular video platform which we were using that day (considered to be the most secure), it is not possible to see more than six people at one time. When I enquired, Mr Perkins, who had much to attend to, apologised and told me that he had omitted to notify the press. I was extremely conscious of the stress within this family and most particularly in respect of child B. This would have been inevitable in any circumstances but the privations of &#8216;lockdown&#8217; had greatly added to it. Accordingly, I proceeded with the hearing but indicated that the judgment would be notified to the press in order that they could make any application they considered necessary and appropriate.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having heard argument I concluded that child B&#8217;s vulnerability and the fragility of his situation ultimately tipped the balance in favour of prioritising the children&#8217;s family life and emotional well-being over the legitimate public interest in identifying the Local Authority and the relevant professionals.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The press has taken the opportunity, extended by my judgment, to make representations inviting me to revisit that balance. Today, I have heard argument and received thoughtful written submissions from Mr Brian Farmer of the Press Association and Ms Louise Tickle, a freelance journalist.  Both Ms Tickle and Mr Farmer seek to persuade me that the public interest in this Local Authority being named outweighs the countervailing interests of the children whose identity may be detectable if the Local Authority were named. It is important to record that neither seeks to persuade me to identify the individual social workers, recognising that, for the reasons set out in my earlier judgment, this would, in the circumstances of this case, greatly increase the potential for the children being identified. Mr Farmer and Ms Tickle submit and I agree, that if the Local Authority is to be named the identity of the Director of Social Services is in the public domain and may, of course, be referred to in any published article.   </p>

All agree that the relevant law is accurately stated there. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to repeat it. Mr Farmer and Ms Tickle contend that the Court did not have sufficient material before it, at the earlier hearing, accurately to balance the competing rights and interests in focus.  </p>

There appears to have been a collective professional amnesia in respect of the good practice established in evaluating the risk of child sexual abuse, gathered over the last 30 years. Mr Perkins asserts that the deficiencies identified in this team are not representative of practice in this local authority&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Services more generally. I profoundly hope that is correct.

The nature and extent of the failings, as well as their persistence, can only give real cause for public concern. There is an undoubted public interest in the Local Authority being named, in order that they might be subject to the kind of public scrutiny that many would regard as necessary. Mr Perkins has told me that, at the highest level within the Social Services Department for this Local Authority, there is real concern as to what has happened and a determination that there should be a full investigation. I am told and accept that there will be. Mr Perkins submits that there are &#8220;lessons to be learned&#8221;.  It has to be said that this phrase is deployed so regularly when public bodies fail that it is in danger of becoming platitudinous. It is easy to see how lessons might be learned more thoroughly in the spot light of media scrutiny.&#8221; </span></p>

It is clear from Ms Tickle and Mr Farmer&#8217;s research that Mr Perkins&#8217;s assertion, to the effect that the deficiencies identified in the work of this team, were an isolated aberration and not indicative of a wider systemic failure, was entirely inaccurate. I make it plain that I do not criticise Mr Perkins for this. It will undoubtedly have been a submission advanced on instruction but Mr Perkins would not have had the opportunity to review the Ofsted reports, which Ms Tickle has harvested and placed before me.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The importance of this finding cannot be understated. To my mind any social worker who elevates the needs of the parent beyond those of a vulnerable child has disconnected with the fundamental precepts of child protection and lost their professional compass. That is precisely what I found had occurred in this case. The observations, in the Ofsted report, could easily be folded, entirely seamlessly, into my own judgment. They also undermine Mr Perkins&#8217;s contention that this case was an isolated example of bad practice. What emerges from the Ofsted report, are unambiguous criticisms of Haringey&#8217;s entire Disabled Children&#8217;s Team. The particulars of the identified failings resonate, strikingly, with what the children&#8217;s Guardian identified in this case i.e. a distortion of professional focus, a preoccupation with and empathy for the mother, which eclipsed the needs of the children; a failure to evaluate risk and a planning vacuum. To this requires to be added my own repeatedly expressed concerns, articulated at a number of interim hearings, fulsomely endorsed by the children&#8217;s Guardian, that the Local Authority was consistently failing to address the serious Child Protection issue which had become central to the case. All this went unheeded. As Mr Farmer highlighted, I described the Local Authority&#8217;s response as &#8220;supine&#8221; and expressed my conclusion that these failures, both in isolation and cumulatively were profoundly troubling. I signalled that they indicated a need for &#8220;significant retraining&#8221;. I also emphasised the incomprehensibility of the Local Authority&#8217;s repeated failure to inform the father what was happening. </p>

The Ofsted report states that this focus <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;on the needs of parents rather than the child&#8221; </span>occurs <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in the majority of cases&#8221;</span>. Thus, it now requires to be stated that this case cannot be seen as an isolated example of strikingly poor practice but is reflective of a much broader and deeper malaise within Haringey&#8217;s Children with Disabilities Team. This material has been unearthed by the independent press and strikes me as a graphic illustration of the importance of scrutiny of public bodies and the Family Court system by lively and forensically curious journalism.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There are, as Ms Wilson identifies and all agree, three central considerations here. Firstly, and it is common ground, these vulnerable children require and are entitled to protection. As the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), Editors&#8217; Code of Practice emphasises, it is important that journalists are able to report about children and the issues they are facing <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;as long as the children&#8217;s rights are protected&#8221;</span>. It is also recognised that information should not generally be published where <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it might cause unnecessary intrusion in to a child&#8217;s time at school&#8221;. </span>Importantly, where publication is sought, as an exception to the code, relating to information about a child, the identified public interest has to be greater than if the contemplated article concerned an adult. This accords entirely with the case law referred to in my earlier judgment (concerning publication) and at paragraph 6 above. </p>

Ms Wilson speculates that the crowd funding scheme, organised by the mother with great effect, most probably involved a significant number of small donations rather than a few particularly generous individual benefactors. Ms Wilson reasons from this that many donors might be alerted by the judgment to investigate, by search engine, whether this was the family they gave financial support to. This, it is hypothesised, might lead to a plethora of social media posts which would be difficult to monitor. Ms Wilson also states, that whilst Ms Tickle focuses on the risk to child B by way of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;playground taunts&#8221;</span> the greater risk probably arises on line and insidiously.  </p>

He considers that the public interest in scrutinising the Local Authority, should prevail and that the concerns relating to potential distress to his children are overstated and can, if they arise, be managed. A reading of my substantive welfare judgment will reveal that I found him to be an impressive and intuitive father.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is against these identified risks that the Court has to consider the question of the public interest in identifying the Local Authority. On this issue and for the reasons I have set out above, the landscape has changed considerably since the earlier hearing. I have already analysed the significance of the conclusions in the Ofsted report. Ms Wilson, in what I consider to be an ambitious submission, suggests that this document can be viewed from an entirely different perspective. The existence of the report means, Ms Wilson argues, that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the same sort of criticisms of the Local Authority which feature in this case are already in the public domain&#8221;</span>. Ms Wilson develops this point by highlighting that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the public in general and local residents, in particular have, via the publication of the Ofsted report,</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">already been told of the failings of their council in this area of children services&#8221;. </span>Thus, she concludes, it is unnecessary to name the Local Authority because their failings are already known. Ms Wilson describes the Ofsted report as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;recent&#8221; </span>but given that report relates to an overview conducted in autumn of 2018, it strikes me as stretching the concept, at least in the </p>

The report, like my own warnings at the interim hearings, went entirely unheeded. There is no other reasonable conclusion to draw.</p>

See also Mr Farmer at para 3.D and Ms Tickle at para 13. Such matters could be addressed, if necessary, by the Court giving permission for the Judgment together with the name of the Local Authority to be shared with a wider group of the Local Authority&#8217;s councillors or professionals working for it. This could extend, as necessary, so that the social work teams learn the lessons which Mr Farmer speaks to in para 3G.  </span></p>

It is, in my judgment, unhelpful to evaluate the rights conferred under Article 10 ECHR only by reference to the worst-case scenario i.e. publications in the latter category above. Equally, it is unlikely to be helpful, in analysing the rights guaranteed by Article 8 ECHR to emphasise the most serious manifestation of harm without rooting that in what is most likely or probable.

The Editors&#8217; Code of Practice affords these children continuing protection, as do my orders preventing publication of their identity. In addition, they have the important support of a father and a mother (notwithstanding my findings against her) who are sensitive to their children&#8217;s needs and personalities. The father, now the primary carer for child B, is well placed and well equipped to shield him from the consequences of publicity. Moreover, having supported the application of the press to name the Local Authority, the father strikes me as being in a strong position to explain to his son the reasoning underpinning this judgment. For all these reasons the Local Authority, the London Borough of Haringey, will be named as the applicants in this case in respect of whom I have made the significant criticisms in my substantive judgment.    </p>
