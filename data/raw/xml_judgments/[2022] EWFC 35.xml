Mr Todd has sought permission to appeal my joinder order dated 21 March 2022, which permission I have at first instance refused. I also refused his application to extend time to seek permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal. I have made no substantive alteration to the joinder judgment which I handed down on that day.</span></p>

Those circumstances included the fact that, soon after the draft consent order was sent to me, those instructing him were informed that Level had made an application to be joined which had been allowed by Mr Justice Newton on a without notice basis. Level was expressly seeking to be heard on the question of whether an order in the terms of the agreement reached between the husband and the wife should be made. </span></p>

Had I known of it, the intervention would undoubtedly have been a relevant factor, on any view, in the decision which they were asking me to make about approval of the consent order. I am aware that they sought a stay of the initial order joining Level, pending a return date which at the time they expressed no urgency to have listed. Until I have seen their explanation, I shall express no concluded view about what lay behind their actions then, but I must remind myself of those actions now in order to deal with Mr Todd&#8217;s application that I now reseal the same order which they placed in front of me in February 2021.</span></p>

Mr Todd QC argues vociferously that these proceedings are a completely different animal from the financial remedy proceedings, and that as such they should be dealt with separately, and in a different court, at a time inevitably when all of the wife&#8217;s claims in the financial remedy proceedings have been dealt with.  He cites the Family Division judges&#8217; comparative inexperience in dealing with such claims, and suggests that dealing with the multiplicity of issues raised in those civil proceedings will cause unnecessary delay in the financial remedy proceedings.  He suggests that a listing of all of the claims to be heard at the same time will cause the required time to be greatly extended and the issues before the court to be complicated. He also asks what remedy Level can possibly seek in the financial remedy claim, as opposed to within those civil proceedings.</span></p>

The claims (i) between the husband and wife, and (ii) between Level and the wife and the husband are evidently interwoven, given that the debt which the wife owes to Level was incurred to enable her to fund the children and financial litigation consequent upon her separation from the husband, and her ability to repay that debt is a central element in the financial circumstances before the court in the financial remedy proceedings. Until a court has considered what order to make in the financial remedy proceedings, Level cannot know to what extent their civil claims are either valuable or useful to them.</span></p>

However, I consider that the set aside application has been disposed of by his client&#8217;s consent to such an order being made, and the wife&#8217;s lack of substantive opposition. Going forward, the further disclosure which will be required must be within the financial remedy proceedings which remain to be determined now that the consent order has been set aside. This means that FPR PD21A paragraph 2.2, which prescribes the service of Forms E, followed by the exchange of questionnaires, should apply.</span></p>

Mr Southgate QC does not oppose the provision of such a list of documents, as the husband is surely entitled to know what Level has got in its possession. As those documents will also already be in the husband&#8217;s possession, there is no need to go further at this stage, but the production of such a list is both appropriate and proportionate, and is directed. </span></p>

It may well be correspondence to which the wife is entitled in any event. Mr Todd QC argues that his client should be entitled to understand how the wife came to discharge her previous solicitors, Laytons LLP, with whom she had a Sears Tooth agreement, and take on their successors, McAllister Family Law, who were funded by the loan from Level. Such information may become relevant to any attempt by Level to enforce its loan against the wife, and also possibly to the enforceability of the loan within the financial remedy proceedings. In the first place, appropriate information should be produced by the wife in the context of her Form E. I do not therefore consider it necessary or proportionate to order its disclosure at this stage against Level, but it is an application which may be renewed at the later directions hearing which I propose to list, if there then remains any issue after the responses to questionnaires have been received.</span></p>

Whatever the circumstances of Level&#8217;s original involvement, an order for its joinder had been made by Mr Justice Newton, that order had not been stayed or set aside, and yet decisions were evidently taken that it was not necessary or appropriate either to inform me of the intervention, or to inform Level that the draft order had been submitted to me for sealing, without the court office having been copied.

Plainly, as parties to the financial remedy proceedings, Level is within the &#8216;ring&#8217; for disclosure purposes and is bound by the implied undertaking that it will not use the documents which it has, or which it comes to have, for any collateral purpose beyond those proceedings. In those circumstances, the fact that the husband&#8217;s disclosure is made under compulsion in these proceedings is not a defence to the production of any relevant documents to which the implied undertaking applies. In the first instance, those documents can be employed only in the disposal of the financial remedy proceedings, which, as I have indicated, will be first determined. I determine that Level must also, as a party, be entitled to any other disclosure within the proceedings to which it has not yet  had access.</span></p>

If the court determines that her case, as advanced before Mrs Justice Parker, ascribing to the husband valuable trust interests, was wrong, and that her needs can only properly be met within the confines of the sort of provision in trust that she has subsequently agreed, then Level will be left with a claim against her that may prove valueless. That remains a possible outcome at the conclusion of this case. On the other hand, if the court determines, on the basis of the available evidence, that notwithstanding the successful appeal proceedings in 2019 she does have an entitlement to a transfer of valuable assets into her own name, then the court&#8217;s order may appropriately reflect that. If so, then Level&#8217;s claim against the wife may become capable of some enforcement, at least in part. Whether that is the case must await the determination of the financial remedy application.</span></p>
