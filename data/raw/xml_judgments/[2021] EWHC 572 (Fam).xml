M and all three children are presently living in England.  By direction of the court, M has applied under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for leave to remove C from this jurisdiction to Ireland. The purpose, of course, is to enable her to travel with all 3 children to Ireland in the event that I make a return order in respect of A and B. M&#8217;s Children Act application has been consolidated with the Hague Convention application and TU has been joined to these proceedings. </p>

It was made plain to me during the hearing that he considers C should primarily live with M, but he wishes that to be in England; hence his application, although there does seem to me to be some tension between advocating M as the primary carer of C, and applying for a residence order in respect of C. </p>

There was considerable debate in the submissions before this court as to whether the concept of living together as a couple for the purposes of s.172 required both adults to live physically in the same shared residence at all times. Examples were given of persons in an intimate and committed relationship living together as a couple and holding themselves out as a couple but where either work demands of one or other or ill health and hospitalisation required the couples to physically live in difference places or even different countries for periods of time. I conclude that the legal concept of living together as a couple for the purposes of s.172 does not require two persons to live physically at all times in the same shared premises. Hence, notwithstanding that a couple may not be physically living day by day in the same residence, during the two-year period immediately prior to the end of the relationship s.172 envisages that a court may decide on all the relevant facts that they nonetheless continued to live together as a couple during that period. </span></p>

From what Geoghegan J said, it appears that what a court must decide is whether it can consider &#8220;the relationship to have ceased such that the parties are not cohabitants&#8221;, or whether for some reason such as work demands, or ill health &#8220;require the couples to live physically in different places&#8221;.  </span></p>

Here, it is related to what might be termed an issue external to the relationship. In my judgment it is clearly unrelated to the partnership of M and F.

There is a particular risk that an expansive application of article 13b, which focuses on the situation of the child, could lead to this result. Nevertheless, there must be circumstances in which a summary return would be so inimical to the interests of the particular child that it would also be contrary to the object of the Convention to require it.

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination. </span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm. </span></p>

As was said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:10pt">, at para 52, "'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'". Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g., where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child. </span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home.  </span></p>

Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221; </span></p>

The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned. It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned.&#8221; </span></p>

"Intolerable" is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean "a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate". It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13(b) "if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return". Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. No one intended that an instrument decided to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm&#8221;. </span></p>

In some cases, for example where the issue is whether the location for a 'handover' under a Child Arrangements Order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> is to take place at MacDonalds or Starbucks, the evaluation will be short and very straight forward. In other cases, for example a case of international relocation, the factors that must be given due consideration and appropriate weight on either side of the scales of the welfare balance may be such as to require an analysis of some sophistication and complexity. However, whatever the issue before the court, the task is the same; the court must weigh up all of the relevant factors, look at the case as a whole, and determine the course that best meets the need to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare.

Plainly, for example, as McFarlane LJ pointed out, a dispute between two parents about the contact handover venue can be determined by the court in very short order.  At the other end of the scale, although very rare, it is clear that even in public law proceedings, where children are at risk of being taken into care, the court can make an early, and summary decision. As another example, inward return orders, for a child to be brought back from overseas, are regularly made on a summary basis. Courts every day, up and down the land, make judgment decisions about how best to proceed in any given case.  It all depends on the circumstances; there is not a one size fits all prescribed approach. </p>
