	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall call the person the subject of these proceedings &#8220;Alan&#8221;.  The primary issue in this case is this: what is the legal test to be applied in determining whether Alan has the mental capacity to consent to sexual relations? Counsel are divided on what that test should be. The secondary issue is, if I determine that Alan does not presently have the requisite capacity (whatever it is), whether I should make final declarations to that effect, as contended for by the local authority; or, as contended for by the Official Solicitor, interim declarations coupled with an order that the local authority do provide Alan with sex education in the hope that he thereby gains that capacity. On that footing the matter would be returned to Court after a period for a review in order to see what progress the education is making, with a view to making final declarations at that point.</p>

The local authority has been represented by Mr Joseph O&#8217;Brien. Both are counsel of high experience in this field. I heard oral evidence from a distinguished psychiatrist Dr Ian Hall. His evidence was clear and forceful. Both counsel made compelling, economical and clear submissions. The issue is highly complex - legally, intellectually and morally. The excellence of the representation and the quality of the evidence has not made my task any easier.</p>

In terms of classification an IQ in the range 50-70 is a &#8220;mild&#8221; learning disability. 35 &#8211; 50 is &#8220;moderate&#8221;. 20 &#8211; 35 is &#8220;severe&#8221;. Under 20 is &#8220;profound&#8221;. The percentage of the population that is IQ 50 or fewer is under &#189; %. That said, it is a sizeable number. </p>

Alan received a care package that included constant supervision within placement and in the community. Alan was sociable and presented as an able man. He had, and has, a vigorous sex drive. This has led to sexual relations with persons of both genders, although it is not suggested that Alan has ever had heterosexual coitus.</p>

The police were notified. On 4 October 2008 these two girls were travelling on the bus once again, as was Alan. The girls notified the bus driver who also notified the police. Alan was then taken to the police station and questioned. However, the police decided that no further action should be taken against him.</p>

They sought a declaration that Alan lacked capacity to consent to sexual relations and an order authorising a restriction of  contact between Alan and Kieron (and between Alan and another person) so as to prevent further sexual relations taking place. On 1 July 2009 District Judge Mainwaring Taylor made interim declarations and orders to this effect. Since then Alan has been subjected to close supervision to prevent any further sexual activity on his part, other than private masturbation, which he is allowed to perform in the bathroom or in his bedroom.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Alan now has his own accommodation, where he is closely supervised. His relationship with Kieron has ended. The evidence of the local authority is that he has thrived in his new placement and has not expressed any wish to resume sexual activity. On the other hand, he has asked a representative of the Official Solicitor to ask me, the judge, to allow him to have sex again. When asked how he would feel if the judge would allow him to do &#8220;these things&#8221; once again, he said &#8220;it would make me feel happy&#8221;. He said, as regards the persons under discussion, &#8220;say I want to kiss them again&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Hall describes sex as one of the most basic human functions. In its origin it is coeval with the search for sustenance. Without these two functions human (or any) life would not exist. Thus the Court must tread especially carefully where an organ of the state proposes that a citizen&#8217;s ability to perform, in a non-abusive way, the sex function should be abrogated or curtailed. It involves very profound aspects of civil liberties and personal autonomy.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I may say this much in the outset, that it appears to me that the contract of marriage is a very simple one, which does not require a high degree of intelligence to comprehend. It is an engagement between a man and woman to live together, and love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others. This is expanded in the promises of the marriage ceremony by words having reference to the natural relations which spring from that engagement, such as protection on the part of the man, and submission on the part of the woman.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason that this test for this particular contract is relevant is that it was used by analogy by Munby J in the latter two cases of his trio, which were concerned with the very question I have before me, namely the level of mental capacity required to consent to sexual relations. The reason for this is that a sexual component or dimension is, generally speaking, an intrinsic part of marriage. Thus sexual fidelity is part of the marriage agreement, so that adultery is and always has been a ground for divorce in almost every society in almost every era. Equally, in English law incapacity, and wilful refusal, to consummate are grounds for annulling a marriage. They do not make a marriage void ab initio; rather they render a marriage voidable<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> In Canon Law failure to consummate, of itself, is not a ground for nullity, as the principle established at least since the Council of Tribur in the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century is that <span style="font-style:italic">c</span><span style="font-style:italic">onsensus </span><span style="font-style:italic">non concubitus facit matrimonium</span>. Failure to consummate is however one of the (very few) grounds available for a papal dissolution of the bond: see Code of Canon Law (1983), canon 1142. That said, a marriage entered into by a party with an intention <span style="font-style:italic">contra bonum proles</span> has long been avoidable on the ground of defective consent.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. True, as Munby J reminded us in <span style="font-style:italic">X City Council v MB, NB and MAB (by his Litigation Friend the Official Solicitor) </span>at para 62, the law has always recognised that a man may take a woman as his wife <span style="font-style:italic">tanquam soror vel tanquam frater</span>. But such a marriage would, for as long as it remained unconsummated, be potentially voidable. Therefore, I wholly agree with Munby J that while a sexual relationship is not a vital ingredient of marriage it is, generally speaking, implicit in the marriage agreement.</p>

And it would be a very strange thing if the latter were set higher than the former, for it would be an absurd state of affairs if a person had just sufficient intelligence to consent to marriage but insufficient capacity to consent to its (generally speaking) intrinsic component of consummation. </p>

The question of whether someone has capacity to marry is not the same as the question whether that person has capacity to consent to sexual relations. The two questions have to be considered separately. That said, since a sexual relationship is, generally speaking, implicit in any marriage, it must follow that, generally speaking, someone who lacks the capacity to consent to sexual relations will for that very reason necessarily lack the capacity to marry. The converse, of course, is not necessarily true. Someone may have the capacity to consent to sexual relations whilst lacking the capacity to marry.</p>

The question is issue specific, both in the general sense and, as I have already pointed out, in the sense that capacity has to be assessed in relation to the particular kind of sexual activity in question.

It is difficult to see how it can sensibly be said that she has capacity to consent to a particular sexual act with Y whilst at the same time lacking capacity to consent to precisely the same sexual act with Z. So capacity to consent to sexual intercourse depends upon a person having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the sexual nature and character &#8211; of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse: see <span class="italic1">X City Council v MB, NB and MAB (by his Litigation Friend the Official Solicitor)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/168" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 968" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 968</ref>, at para [84].

The Court of Appeal acknowledged that this was a difficult area and they were, in my view, unduly influenced by the views of Munby J in another context. I am far from persuaded that those views were correct, because the case law on capacity has for some time recognised that, to be able to make a decision, the person concerned must not only be able to understand the information relevant to making it but also be able to &#8220;weigh [that information] in the balance to arrive at [a] choice": see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 290</ref>, 295, approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB (Medical Treatment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 426" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 426</ref>.

She knew that if she refused a blood transfusion she might die; nevertheless she believed that her blood was evil and that the healthy blood given her in a transfusion became contaminated and thus increased the volume of evil blood in her body and &#8220;likewise the danger of my committing acts of evil". Charles J concluded that she was unable to use and weigh the relevant information, and thus the competing factors, in the process of arriving at her decision to refuse a transfusion (para 63). In the same way, a person&#8217;s delusions that she was being commanded by God to have sexual intercourse, an act which she was perfectly capable of understanding, might make her incapable of exercising an autonomous choice in the matter.</p>

A person is unable to refuse if he lacks the capacity to choose whether to agree to the touching &#8220;whether because he lacks sufficient understanding of the nature or reasonably foreseeable consequences of what is being done, or for any other reason&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 30(2)</ref>(a)).

The words &#8220;for any other reason&#8221; are clearly capable of encompassing a wide range of circumstances in which a person&#8217;s mental disorder may rob them of the ability to make an autonomous choice, even though they may have sufficient understanding of the information relevant to making it. These could include the kind of compulsion which drives a person with anorexia to refuse food, the delusions which drive a person with schizophrenia to believe that she must do something, or the phobia (or irrational fear) which drives a person to refuse a life-saving injection (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB</span>) or a blood transfusion (as in <span style="font-style:italic">NHS Trust v T</span>).</p>

It is, perhaps, easier to understand how the test of capacity might be &#8220;act specific&#8221; but not &#8220;person specific&#8221; or &#8220;situation specific&#8221; if intellectual understanding were all that was required. The complainant here did know what a &#8220;blow job&#8221; was. Even then, it is well accepted that capacity can fluctuate, so that a person may have the required degree of understanding one day but not another. But that is because of a fluctuation in the mental disorder rather than a fluctuation in the circumstances. Once it is accepted that choice is an exercise of free will, and that mental disorder may rob a person of free will in a number of different ways and in a number of different situations, then a mentally disordered person may be quite capable of exercising choice in one situation but not in another. The complainant here, even in her agitated and aroused state, might have been quite capable of deciding whether or not to have sexual intercourse with a person who had not put her in the vulnerable and terrifying situation in which she found herself on 27 June 2007. The question is whether, in the state that she was in that day, she was capable of choosing whether to agree to the touching demanded of her by the defendant.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">My Lords, it is difficult to think of an activity which is more person and situation specific than sexual relations. One does not consent to sex in general. One consents to this act of sex with this person at this time and in this place. Autonomy entails the freedom and the capacity to make a choice of whether or not to do so. This is entirely consistent with the respect for autonomy in matters of private life which is guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The object of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref> was to get away from the previous &#8220;status&#8221; based approach which assumed that all &#8220;defectives&#8221; lacked capacity, and thus denied them the possibility of making autonomous choices, while failing to protect those whose mental disorder deprived them of autonomy in other ways.</p>

What is necessary is that the particular sexual partner (to continue this illustration) impedes or undermines or has the effect of impeding or undermining the mental functioning of a person when that person makes their decisions, so as to render them incapacitous.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The kernel of this compromise approach is of course the penultimate sentence of para 40. Mr O&#8217;Brien praises this reasoning as perfect. By contrast, Mr Sachdeva bravely criticises it as &#8220;incoherent&#8221;. Mr Sachdeva also criticises the reasoning of Lady Hale as conflating the capacity to consent to sex with the exercise of capacity to consent to sex.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With a considerable degree of trepidation I have concluded that Mr Sachdeva&#8217;s arguments have force, although I would not for a moment go along with his criticism of Roderic Wood J&#8217;s reasoning. That reasoning is perfectly coherent if it is accepted that the test contains a partner-specific ingredient. In my view the analogy drawn by Munby J with capacity to marry is faultless and is impossible to challenge successfully. Of course Lady Hale is right to say that &#8220;it is difficult to think of an activity which is more person and situation specific than sexual relations&#8221;, but the same is true (if not truer) of marriage. But it does not follow that capacity to marry is spouse as opposed to status specific. Far from it. I do think, with the greatest possible respect, that there has been a conflation of capacity to consent to sex and the exercise of that capacity. There is also a very considerable practical problem in allowing a partner-specific dimension into the test. Consider this case. Is the local authority supposed to vet every proposed sexual partner of Alan to gauge if Alan has the capacity to consent to sex with him or her?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next question is to decide whether the six criteria of Dr Hall do indeed accurately particularise the simple test of Munby J. It is fair to say that neither counsel supports the inclusion of the sixth criterion as an essential ingredient of capacity to consent to sex (viz &#8220;an awareness that sex is part of having relationships with people and may have emotional consequences&#8221;). I agree. This criterion is much too sophisticated to be included in the low level of understanding and intelligence needed to be able to consent to sex. Apart from anything else, I would have thought that a deal of sex takes place where one or other party is wholly oblivious to this supposed necessity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel are agreed that an awareness and understanding of the first, fourth and fifth criteria are indeed essential ingredients of the capacity to consent to sex. They are divided as to the inclusion of the second (age) and third (consent). Mr O&#8217;Brien strongly argues that the law requires their inclusion; Mr Sachdeva states that &#8220;they go beyond the factors which have been expressly stated as being necessary elements of capacity to consent to sex in previous case law&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So the question that I have to answer is this: in order to be able to consent to sex does a person need to have a proper and full(ish) awareness and understanding that sex should only be done by people over 16, and that it should be consensual? It is not an answer to the question to observe that sex with minors, and non-consensual sex, are horrible perversions. There are plenty of paedophiles out there who through warped ideology actually believe that it is morally acceptable to have sex with children. Equally, the prisons have numerous rapists within their walls. But paedophiles and rapists have the capacity to consent to sex.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien says that this argument is over-intellectual. We are dealing here, he says, with mentally incapacitated people, who in the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> are suffering impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. We are not talking about perverts who obviously have the capacity to consent to sex. This is true enough, but I believe that to import these knowledge requirements into the capacity test elevates it to a level considerably above the very simple and low level test propounded by Munby J namely &#8220;sufficient rudimentary knowledge of what the act comprises and of its sexual character&#8221;.</p>

Nothing I say is intended to diminish that obviously vital message. There is a difference, however, between the teaching of what is right and wrong in the pursuit of sex, and what level of understanding and intelligence is needed to be capable of consenting to it. </p>

I am sure that the first and second of these criteria is needed to be able to consent to penetrative anal sex and oral sex. I doubt if the third is. And I doubt if either the second or third is needed to be able to consent to sexual activity such as mutual masturbation. This leads to potentially serious management problems where different kinds of sexual activities are practised at different times. </p>

Dr Hall told me that Alan had little or no idea what female genitalia were, or what they were for. He had no concept of sex being the reproductive function. Although he had not asked him he thought it likely that Alan believed that babies were delivered by a stork or found under a bush. He had no understanding at all of heterosexual coitus. He understood the mechanics of mutual masturbation and anal sex, with persons of either gender.  His knowledge as to health risks was very limited and faulty &#8211; he thought that sex could give you spots or measles. Although he knew what a condom was he was not able to put one on properly on a prosthetic penis &#8211; he put it on inside out so it could not be rolled down. </p>
