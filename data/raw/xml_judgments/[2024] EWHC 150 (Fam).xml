	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns a fact finding hearing within care proceedings issued by the local authority in December 2023 relating to two children C, age 4 and D, 9 months.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The other parties are the children&#8217;s mother. C&#8217;s father has taken no part in C&#8217;s life and is not a party. D&#8217;s father, X, remains a party but has taken no active part in the proceedings or been involved with the children since September 2023. His solicitors made an application to come off the record, which was granted on 24 May 2024, as he had not kept in touch with them and when he did make contact stated he wanted to take no part in the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21 November 2023 D, then aged 11 weeks, was taken to hospital by her mother as she had been unwell for about 24 hours, had not been able to retain her milk and was regularly vomiting. At hospital she was pale and unsettled, had a temperature, sunken eyes but a flat fontanelle, a raised pulse and respiratory rate but her oxygen saturation was 100%. The initial diagnosis was a chest infection, although it was considered important to exclude sepsis. Tests were taken and she commenced intravenous antibiotics. Initial tests found D had severe hypernatremia, with a plasma sodium concentration of 180mmol/L. Plans were put in place to measure and record her fluid balance. Management plans concerning this were discussed with the regional paediatric nephrology consultant.</p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The main issue in the case is what caused that high sodium level. The local authority sought findings that the mother had administered salt as D was in her care at the relevant time and was wholly reliant on her. In the alternative, the local authority state the mother failed to protect D and failed to seek prompt medical attention. The mother accepts she failed to protect the children in that she failed to adequately supervise C within the home (who she accepts is likely to have mixed the salt in with the milk powder), she used contaminated milk to feed D and failed to seek medical attention promptly when it was obvious, or ought to have been obvious that D was or was becoming seriously unwell.  It is accepted that these concessions meet the threshold criteria under section 31 Children Act 1989.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of the oral evidence the local authority took stock of their position and came to the conclusion they no longer sought a finding that the mother deliberately contaminated D&#8217;s milk with salt. They set out in their closing submissions the reasons for doing so, which no other party disagrees with. The local authority produced a revised schedule of findings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In further discussions between the parties they were able to agree a number of facts that could be recited in the order to reflect the local authority wider concerns regarding the mother&#8217;s mental health difficulties, the history of abusive relationships, and her lack of openness (including regarding her use of cannabis and cocaine) when working with professionals. It is agreed these are not threshold matters but are recorded in the order so as to inform anyone providing support for the mother and the children in the future.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matters that remained in issue between the parties can be summarised as follows: the local authority seek findings, as part of the failure to protect, that the mother <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;failed to appreciate an obvious risk of contamination&#8217;</span> at the time she found C playing with the milk powder with the salt nearby and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;continued to feed or attempted to feed D with contaminated formula milk when it was obvious or ought to have been obvious that she shouldn&#8217;t&#8217;.</span> Mr Stonor K.C. and Mr McDermott, on behalf of the mother, submitted this is not necessary bearing in mind the concessions the mother had already made and Mr Rowlands, on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, saw the force in the local authority position regarding the first but not the second issue.</p>

She had separated from C&#8217;s father in the early stages of her pregnancy, as he didn&#8217;t want to  be a father. The mother kept in contact with her health visitor, seeking advice about the feeding difficulties she experienced with C who was then a few weeks old. There were some reports of the mother re-kindling her relationship with C&#8217;s father, but that was short lived.</p>

She sought support from the maternal grandmother. D&#8217;s six week check did not record any significant concerns and the mother reported to her health visitor shortly afterwards that she had no feeding concerns with D.

That afternoon, following making up a bottle for D in the kitchen in the prep machine, the mother reports clothes were ready to come out of the tumble drier, she took them upstairs leaving the top off the milk powder on the kitchen worktop and was upstairs for about 5 &#8211; 10 minutes. The children were in the living room. When she came back down stairs C had pulled a chair up to the kitchen worktop and had been playing with the milk powder. The mother took him off the chair, took him into the living room and returned to clear up the milk powder from the worktop, chair and the floor. She noticed the salt container was next to the milk powder with the top open.</p>

At about 10pm, when D woke for a feed the mother describes making up another bottle using milk powder from the tub of milk powder C had earlier been playing with. She describes giving D about 2oz, then winding her before continuing, which was her practice to manage D&#8217;s colic. The mother described D being immediately sick all over her when she went to wind her. D was crying, was reluctant to take more milk and when she did was sick again.

The mother took C to nursery and spoke to her friend three times during the day, two were by way of video call, when she asked for her friend&#8217;s advice about D. According to the mother, her friend suggested she should get D checked out. As there was no change during the day in D&#8217;s position the mother rang 111 at 3.20pm. The advice was that D should be taken to A&amp;E. After the mother had made arrangements for C&#8217;s care on return for nursery a taxi collected her and D and they arrived at hospital at just after 7pm.

He said he was aware the two milk bottles that had been brought in by the mother the night before had been taken from the room for testing. When he spoke to the mother the second time she had been upset. He agreed with Mr Stonor that in his notes the reference to the tub on the floor may be formula as he said it was difficult to get a picture and milk and formula were used interchangeably. Also, when asked about his reference to the mother sweeping the milk powder up he said that is a general term, a reference to it being tidied up. Dr S also agreed with Mr Stonor that other references in the notes to the tub of milk powder being next to the salt was his recollection too  as they had discussed that the salt was not usually kept there. Dr S agreed with Mr Rowlands that he had been the first person to discuss sodium levels with the mother.

She did not consider C listened to the call as he was distracted as they were going to the shops. She said she did not inform C she was going to taste the milk powder, she decided to do that herself, it tasted of salt and C did not see her doing it. When she asked C if he had put salt in the milk powder he replied yes, she did not explore that any further with him. She was pressed by Mr McKee about differences in her statements, for example whether she described being told that C was at the kitchen bench rather than on it. In her police statement she said C had emptied bottles before and described an occasion when he had emptied talcum powder into the toy box. When the police arrived she described C as concentrating on playing on his ipad. When the police spoke to C, she did not consider her presence compelled him to answer in a particular way and the police evidence confirms when they spoke to C he was facing away from his grandmother.

Dr Coulthard&#8217;s opinion was D&#8217;s hypernatremia was due to being fed with milk that had been contaminated with salt. It could not have been caused by either severe dehydration or an inherent abnormality. He ruled out the possibility that D&#8217;s condition was caused by one large quantity of salt and was more likely to be due to D being serially fed with a number of bottles that had been made-up from a tub of milk formula that had been contaminated with salt over a 22 hour period. He estimates that D ingested a total of approximately 11 grams of salt over a day. In his view it is overwhelmingly likely that the contaminated milk was made up from a partially used tub that had been accidentally contaminated with salt as described with what took place with C. Mr Coulthard described the management of D in hospital had been very effective and it was unlikely D would suffer long term effects from her episode of hypernatremia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McKee submits that in relation to the matters that remain in dispute relating to the failure to protect the children the evidence establishes that the tub of milk powder was left with its lid open next to the salt. The mother knew that C had previously moved the furniture to access the kitchen counter and had recent experience of the incident with the talcum powder being tipped into the toy box by C. There was an almost immediate change in D&#8217;s presentation and feeding and those changes continued during the evening of 20 November into 21 November 2023. Whilst the mother did start to question why she did not take the next step of seeking professional health advice. Mr McKee submits <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The reasonable carer, faced with the same circumstances, would have linked the mess in the kitchen, to the significant changes in the child&#8217;s behaviour, to the vomiting brought on by feeding (the milk formula having previously been the subject of play), there is a consistency, then, between the admitted failures to supervise and seek medical attention and the thought process of the reasonable carer&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Stonor submits the court can and should find that the sodium levels found in D when she was admitted to hospital was caused by the accidental contamination of the milk powder by C. He supports this submission by stating this would properly reflect the evidence, provide clarity for anyone working with the family in the future and for the mother, C and D. For the children this would provide clarity as to why they spent time in foster care and their mother was struggling at the time, did not supervise them properly and salt accidentally went into D&#8217;s milk.</p>

This is supported by the mother&#8217;s evidence which has provided a largely consistent account, the evidence from Drs Coulthard and Ward, the police evidence and the evidence from the maternal grandmother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards failure to protect he invites the court to consider the acceptance by the mother of this aspect, the evidence of both Drs Coulthard and Ward that if salt had been put into the milk powder it could easily have been missed as it would not have been visible. Also, the mother&#8217;s experience of both children suffering from colic and the advice she sought from her friend on three occasions on 21 November 2023 and, if the court accepts the mother&#8217;s evidence, as soon as she realised the connection between the sodium levels and salt she informed Dr S what had happened.</p>

Also, it is not accepted that the mother could reasonably have been expected to know that she was feeding contaminated milk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian Mr Rowlands supports the change in position by the local authority. In relation to the matters that remain in issue regarding the failure to protect he submits that the mother, when confronted with the situation that faced her when she came back downstairs of C on the chair in the kitchen playing with the milk powder with an open container of salt next to it, bearing in mind the mother&#8217;s previous experience of C&#8217;s behaviour, could support a finding that she should have done more than she did to ensure the powder had not been contaminated. However, he does not support any finding that a reasonable carer in the circumstances of this case would have made the connection between D&#8217;s subsequent symptoms and the events of the previous evening due to her previous experience of C&#8217;s colic, her change in the milk bottle during the night and the advice she sought from her friend the next day.</p>

Their final position I have no hesitation in accepting is the right course for them to have taken. It was important, bearing in mind the seriousness of the issues and the complexity of the situation that the evidence was tested. D had extremely high levels of sodium on admission to hospital and it is only through the careful management of her condition on admission that there are, fortunately, no long term consequences for her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence was an important part of the evidential canvas in what she was reported to say by others, as well as in her own written and oral evidence. Mr McKee&#8217;s thorough, careful and perceptive cross examination explored all those matters, including the differences in accounts she had given. There was, as Mr Stonor submits, a considerable amount of evidence before the court about the mother as a parent. She gave a frank and reflective account of the difficulties she has experienced with her own mental health, her poor choice of partners, her drug use and how these have, on occasion, had a negative impact on her children. Dr Cooper summarised this in her report when she stated the mother can <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;take responsibility for her mistakes and understands the need to change for her own benefit, and the benefit of her children&#8217;.</span> It is right the mother has, on occasion, not been entirely frank with professionals but I accept her evidence that she did that at the time as she wanted to give the impression that there were no difficulties in her care of the children. Since then she has shown considerable insight, particularly in her detailed sessions with Dr Cooper, that seeking support in such a situation is necessary for the children&#8217;s welfare and this increased insight came across in her oral evidence. The mother&#8217;s evidence was frank and credible in relation to the key issues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence, when looked at as a whole, for the reasons outlined by Mr McKee supports the conclusion that there is no evidence to suggest the mother might be capable of poisoning her child, on the contrary I agree the evidence more likely established a mother who dearly loves her children and would benefit from therapeutic intervention and support.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the evidence it is more likely than not that the salt contamination of D&#8217;s milk powder was caused by the accidental contamination of it by C playing with the milk powder and the salt container on the afternoon of 20 November 2023 when he was left unsupervised whilst the mother went upstairs to put the clothes away. That is supported by the timing of the way D responded to the milk bottle that had been made up prior to the mother going upstairs and those made up after she came down. It is also supported by the wider evidence of C&#8217;s reported previous behaviour involving the talcum powder, the realisation by the mother when she made the connection when sodium was first discussed with her by Dr S on the morning of 22 November 2023, the grandmother&#8217;s tasting of the milk powder and what is reported to have been said by C both to his grandmother and the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother accepts she failed to protect both children in that she failed to appropriately supervise C within the home, used contaminated milk to feed D and failed to seek medical attention promptly when it was obvious or ought to have been obvious that D was or was becoming seriously unwell. They amount to a serious failure to protect both children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to whether the mother failed to appreciate an obvious risk of contamination when she came back down stairs and was confronted with the situation she described I consider that is established on the evidence. In her own evidence she describes the salt container being open next to the open milk powder tub that C had been playing with. With the knowledge of her previous experience of C&#8217;s behaviour of pouring things and enjoying messy play it would have been reasonable for her to have appreciated that risk and taken steps accordingly. Her failure to do that is probably explained by her poor mental state and exhaustion at the time. However, I accept the evidence that short of tasting the milk powder it would not have been obvious from the appearance of the milk powder that it may have had salt in it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the finding that she continued to feed D with contaminated formula milk when it was obvious or ought to have been obvious that she shouldn&#8217;t, I do not consider that is established to the required standard. D fed relatively well with the bottle that had been made up prior to the mother going upstairs. When the mother encountered difficulties with later bottles she changed the bottle, she had previous experience of C having colic and vomiting and then sought the advice of her friend. Her focus was, understandably, on the issue being with D rather than the milk. The mother has already accepted she should have sought medical attention earlier. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority have readily indicated in their closing submissions that the remaining safeguarding issues are capable of being tackled with ongoing intensive support. They have the benefit of the detailed second report by Dr Cooper, who has seen the mother on five further occasions during April 2024. They accept the mother has co-operated well and the report acknowledges the mother&#8217;s improved insight and ability to take on board advice. That was supported by the mother&#8217;s oral evidence when she volunteered the good working relationship she has established with the foster carer. Her oral evidence was insightful and reflective, she wants the support that is proposed and the evidence indicates she will benefit from it, which provides a promising foundation for her to work well with those who can support her secure the return of the children to her care in a way that meets their welfare needs.</p>
