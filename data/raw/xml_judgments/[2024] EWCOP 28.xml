AB&#8217;s appointee was authorised to enter into a tenancy on behalf of AB. The London Borough of Southwark was discharged as a party from the date of commencement of the tenancy.

Each attempt has taken up a significant amount of time and resources.  It is reasonable that public bodies who bear the resource burden of such trials have clarity as to expectations going forwards. Having been her choice to end the second attempt to trial home care, it is also reasonable that M understands that she cannot expect unlimited, repeated exertions. The Court does not expect from the public bodies any further attempt to trial AB&#8217;s return to living with M.</span></p>
