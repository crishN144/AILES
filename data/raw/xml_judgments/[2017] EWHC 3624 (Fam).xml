Her birth was registered showing TN&#8217;s husband, BN, as her father and the secret was kept, it is said, by TN for some ten years.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsidiary and essentially procedural issues revolve around whether EB and LB were validly served with the application; if not, whether the court should make an order under FPR 6.19 directing that steps already taken are effectively good service.  Another issue was whether an extension of time should be granted to file a statement.  Another was whether the third, fourth, sixth and seventh respondents should be de-joined from the proceedings.  Finally, there are issues as to costs which will obviously follow on from the determination of the principal issues.</p>

So on that basis I concluded that fairness required me to dismiss that application.  </p>

A challenge to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction was raised by two of the sons - ZB and TB - who doubted whether the court had jurisdiction and asserted that the English court was not the appropriate forum.  The matter was transferred to the High Court and came before Mr Justice Peter Jackson in an urgent applications list on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017.  At that hearing, Mr Justice Peter Jackson gave directions to take the matter forward to a contested essentially jurisdictional hearing.  </p>

Directions were given in respect of I, ZB, LB, TB and EBM because they were plainly potentially interested parties and so they were to be given notice and, if they wished to become parties, they were to file an application to do so.  </p>

It was directed to be listed for one full day with no other cases to be listed before the court that day.  Regrettably, Mr Justice Peter Jackson&#8217;s intentions were not fulfilled because when it was listed it was unallocated and it came before Mrs Justice Parker towards the end of the day and she made directions which listed the matter for a two day hearing to determine the stay or dismissal application.  Some further directions were given in relation to the preparation for that hearing.  </p>

E was represented by Miss Jacklin.  The estate was represented by Ms Haren of counsel.  Following a day&#8217;s argument, Mr Justice Holman reserved judgment overnight and delivered a judgment on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October (B33).  I have read that judgment and, in conclusion, Mr Justice Holman determined that the case should proceed on the basis that it was not an abuse of process to proceed with the paternity application in this country alongside the paternity application in Turkey and that, on forum grounds, the UK was the more appropriate forum for determining the paternity issue.  He gave directions to prepare the matter for a final hearing before me.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">For E, it is getting certainty as to her heritage and recognition of her being L&#8217;s daughter; however, there is undoubtedly a financial motive in play too.  Aspects of her accounts were not convincing and I am satisfied that in some respects she has not been truthful.  The application form and her non-disclosure of other proceedings being perhaps the most obvious example. What she said about domicile causes me to doubt whether she was being completely frank about that.  Some of her evidence about the extent of her relationship with L, I am not satisfied was the complete truth.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">However for EBM, she clearly carries a huge burden of anger and frustration at E.  I suspect she is transferring some of the anger that she perhaps ought to feel at her dead father to E and she clearly feels a huge responsibility to the estate and to her mother and her siblings in many ways in respect of family pride and the family finances.  She is an intelligent and articulate woman.  She was at times open and honest and at other times she was argumentative, she sought excuses for unpalatable aspects of the conduct of the litigation.  She blamed her lawyers on occasions for flaws. She blames E for the situation rather than her father.  She was unable to accept that, if what she wants to know is really the truth, there are ways of doing it which would avoid exhuming her father. That both she and E are prepared to exhume L shows the extent to which hostility and the protection of family and money has obscured the ability of both E and EBM to be really objective is not a surprise given the nature of the case.  </p>

She came across as a rather passive individual, someone who events occur to rather than who influences events.  She was, I thought, visibly emotional in respect of L and I believed her when she talked about their relationship and how she felt about him.  I thought her generally to be reliable as to the overall background.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said inconsistency is a central theme of the estate&#8217;s case; that I should not rely on evidence because of inconsistency in particular in E&#8217;s account. Of course inconsistency can be an indication of a lie being told.  However, that is far from the only inference that can properly be drawn from an inconsistency.  EBM would say that inconsistency in this case equals a lie, but it is well recognised that memory is imperfect.  The brain is not an instrument that recalls everything as it was and maintains that record in perfect condition over time.  Even within minutes of an event different people will recall it slightly differently and, as time passes, memory fades and events are reassembled.  People can quite genuinely and honestly recall something which is different to objective reality; that does not mean they are lying.  It does not necessarily mean they are exaggerating or deliberately filling gaps.  It may mean either or both.  But in determining what is behind an inconsistency, one has to consider the bigger picture.  It may simply mean that with the passage of time and events the memory has created an imperfect picture.   </p>

In a civil matter where the test is more probable than not, the position is even less binary.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have little doubt that E&#8217;s motives are mixed as EBM says. I think the originating application when it stated that it was to resolve issues to do with her heritage was far from the whole picture, but I do believe her impassioned statement from the witness box - almost a plea to her siblings - to understand her need to make sense of her past and to create some certainty for her going forward personally but also for any family she might have.  However, if that were the only motive then there would be no need to claim against the estate in Turkey and so I believe there is also a financial motive.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps in that regard E feels that it is her birth right and so there is a moral element to that financial claim. She has no claim on BN&#8217;s estate and if L is her father, given the raw deal he served her up in fathering her and then in not acknowledging her and providing her with fathering, perhaps she feels morally entitled to claim as well as there being some element of personal gain.  The reality is though that her claim form was disingenuous in stating why she wants this declaration. The reality is far more multifaceted and nuanced.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I believe the family&#8217;s motives in opposing the claim are also more mixed; it is certainly not just a position of the estate and the children and widow of L trying to protect their father&#8217;s accumulated wealth.  I think for them the refusal of a declaration would represent a vindication of the man they had believed their father to be, a faithful and trustworthy husband and father.  In particular for I, but I think also the children, a refusal of the declaration would stabilise the foundations on which their worlds have been built.  It would give them that clarity and remove the problem both of them having to reappraise their past and their father in particular, but also remove the issue of how they deal with a new sister if that is the fact.  How do they deal with her emotionally, but how do they deal with her also practically in terms of litigation of the estate.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">That being said, there is of course a financial motive in tandem with that.  The children&#8217;s shares in the estate would be reduced from a quarter each to a fifth, but I think there is perhaps also a reflexive defence of the father&#8217;s estate which they may see as an interloper with little claim on their father other than perhaps biological, making a claim which they consider unjustified.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">To fully understand all that has happened in the past and to fully test all of the evidence which has been or could be placed before the court  a host of witnesses dating back some forty years would be needed.  A raft of experts could be instructed to reanalyse DNA to assess the processes which were undertaken to analyse handwriting samples.  That would, I think, be unproductive.  It would take a disproportionate amount of time and would be hugely expensive.  But in reality I do not think it would add very much to the overall picture which does emerge.  It feels like looking through an old family album with pictures missing here and there, pages torn out, photographs removed or lost or never taken.  But ultimately, for me, a clear enough picture has emerged from what I read and heard.  Some areas are blank or smudged, but I think the overall story of this family can ultimately be discerned,  sometimes with startling clarity.  </p>

Whether there was any element connected with that related to behaviour or misbehaviour by the mother, I simply do not know.  But the net result was that BN was granted custody of a child who was not his biological daughter.  </p>

What they raise is how robust the chain of custody process is; can we be sure that the persons giving the samples were who they claimed to be?  They note that Cellmark is accredited and so works to high standards.  Dr Walker says there is a strong reassurance that their processes are robust enough to have the highest confidence in the findings and that there is no obvious reason to disbelieve the findings.

Within that, very quickly, the dispute emerged with the estate filing a document with the Turkish Court (F9) in which it said the claimant must file the paternity suit in the UK to obtain a paternity ruling under English law and if she is able to establish affiliation then bring an action in Turkey for recognition and enforcement of the English ruling.  E obviously opposed this on the basis that the paternity suit provided the locus for her to bring an action against the estate, but then within five days proceedings were issued in England and so thus a twin process of litigation has been in train in Turkey and England ever since.  </p>

The individuals involved in her life at that time being her mother, the man married to her mother and who took the role of her father and L - who is said to be her biological father - were at that time all largely based in the UK.  TN, the one who has been her primary carer in her early life, was based here and so I am satisfied that at her birth her domicile would have been the UK.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not consider that her history over her life has established a change in the domicile.  She has lived in England for significant periods.  She has lived in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, she has lived in Australia, she has lived in New York, she has lived in the Lebanon and all of those have been to some extent temporary and indefinite.  What she has done is to purchase property in England, she has maintained a strong connection with England in terms of property, bank accounts and family and so I do not think that her domicile has changed from the date of her birth.  </p>

I observe that the document is a Turkish translation obtained by the family, but there is no particular reason to suspect that it is an inaccurate translation and Mr Calhaem and EBM both say that that document uses particular terms to identify particular issues and so it probably is right that that document does use the word &#8220;domicile&#8221; in respect of E.  Whether the use of the word &#8220;domicile&#8221; in Turkey is the same as it is in England I do not know, and so it may not be terribly relevant.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reality is that she has had residences in a number of countries and residence is an entirely separate concept, both legally and factually, to domicile.  A person can have residences in many places and in some countries one has to register a residence, but that does not dictate a domicile nor does citizenship dictate a domicile.  So overall, although in one document it does say that she was domiciled in Cyprus, I actually cannot see that there would be anything about her life to date which would fix her domicile there either in terms of her having a residence there still less it being a permanent or indefinite residence in Cyprus.  </p>

That is why her base is identified with her employers as England, that is why she owns property here, that is why her mother is here.  They are all features of a centre of interests which is in the UK, notwithstanding that she may at times be resident in other countries.  So the jurisdictional foundations for the declaration are established.  </p>

They all point to the certainty that E was the product of an affair between L and TN which was kept hidden from their families for perhaps obvious reasons.  This is not a determination just on the balance of probabilities, but, in my view, it is a determination beyond any reasonable doubt that L is E&#8217;s father.  </p>

No doubt he kept it well hidden, what man would not? It takes probably an extraordinary individual to admit to an affair with one of his workers whilst his wife is pregnant with one of his other children and, despite what EBM said about her father being a brave and strong man - which I am sure he was in many ways - he obviously was not strong enough.  </p>

Perhaps it was a mix of fear as to the consequences and not wanting to hurt his wife and other children by visiting upon them the consequences that would inevitably have followed that disclosure in the way that TN and BN split up and that undoubtedly had consequences for the children.  So of course the risk for L and his family would have been separation with all the heartache that that brings.  </p>

The samplers would have been sufficiently robust to satisfy themselves that it was L.

I think the answer to that must be that L did not want this disclosed and who was E to go against that and to impose herself on his family and to blow his world apart -  in particular from 2000 onwards - certainly 2004 onwards - when his health was self-evidently deteriorating.  Perhaps it would have been difficult for her to contemplate anyway and to reveal one&#8217;s self as a sibling to an established family unit is inevitably going to be difficult and would have consequences which are very difficult to predict.  </p>

If necessary, indeed irrespective of whether the parties consider it necessary, I think judicial liaison with the court in Turkey ought to be initiated.  I think every step possible should be taken to minimise the possibility of friendly courts reaching competing decisions.  Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, a signatory to Hague Conventions, and I would very much hope that through the office of the Head of International Family Justice that some process can be set up to initiate liaison to the extent that is permitted so that we can try to dovetail the proceedings in both jurisdictions.  </p>

For one sister to be saying to another sister across my court that she has burnt her bridges when really they have never spoken to each other and when EBM herself said that, when she was a little girl, what she wanted was a sister, is a tragedy.  The pain and anger that has been revealed in court over the last two days is undoubtedly only the tip of a huge iceberg of the emotional cost that L and TN&#8217;s infidelity has led to.  That cost has been paid by all concerned.  As to the wider family, I hate to think of the impact it has had on I and L&#8217;s children.

Sometimes that creates a momentum which builds until it is way beyond anything they could have contemplated and way beyond their ability to control.  We are now forty years down the line from mistakes made by L and TN.
