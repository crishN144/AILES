The consequence of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment was that the orders of Her Honour Judge Finnerty, dated 8 July 2015 and the Order of HHJ Bromilow, dated 26 February 2016 were set aside and the proceedings were remitted to a High Court Judge for fresh consideration, in particular for consideration of the interplay between the wardship and immigration jurisdictions in light of the fact that M and A had both been granted asylum by SSHD.  </p>

Various case management directions were given to facilitate two hearings: a preliminary legal issues hearing, and a final hearing.  The SSHD was invited to intervene in the proceedings, and further disclosure was requested from the SSHD in respect of M&#8217;s and A&#8217;s asylum claims. The questions for the court to focus on in respect of the preliminary legal issues hearing were also made clear and attached to the order.  The Cafcass High Court Team was ordered to ensure that Mr McGavin was not the author of any further Cafcass report if so directed (a report not being ordered at this stage.)

It needs to be recognised that the position may go further in that, if some of the submissions made to us are correct, it might not even be permissible for the family court to order A's return unless and until his refugee status is revoked. The questions that will need to be addressed include at least the following: </span></p>

By virtue of paragraphs 338A and 339AB of the Immigration Rules, a grant of refugee status shall be revoked where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person's misrepresentation was decisive for the grant. The question arises as to how the determination is made that there has been a misrepresentation. Normally this would be a matter for the Secretary of State alone, but where the family court needs the issue resolved in order to decide what is in a child's best interests, can the family court determine it itself? Is it necessary for the Secretary of State to be joined in the proceedings, in those circumstances, not least with the intent that the family court's determination should be binding upon her too? Is it necessary for the grant of refugee status to be formally revoked by the Secretary of State prior to a return order being made or is some lesser process sufficient? </span></p>

The Secretary of State instructed leading counsel, specialising in family law, Mr Andrew Norton QC, and very experienced immigration counsel, Mr Alan Payne.  They produced a carefully analysed and impressively researched written argument which has been of great help not only to me but to all the parties in the case.  On the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2017 I also granted permission for the <span style="font-weight:bold">Joint Counsel for the Welfare of Immigrants</span> (JCWI) to intervene to make representations.  JCWI is an independent National harity established in 1967.  It provides direct legal advice in the sphere of UK immigration policies and undertakes research, policy and campaigning work, including on the impact on children of immigration laws.  Amongst its wider work I note that JCWI participated, on behalf of the Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner, in a co-authored report entitled &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">The Impact on Children of the Family Migration Rules: A Review of the Financial Requirements (2015)</span>&#8217;.

As such, it is the SSHD who has sole responsibility for investigating and determining claims for international protection.  Paragraph 334 of the <span style="font-weight:bold">Immigration Rules</span> (HC395) confers the status of &#8216;refugee&#8217; on a child.

Accordingly and given that these powers are rooted within this statutory framework, the SSHD submits, and I agree, that the grant of asylum is not made pursuant to Royal Prerogative but reflects an exercise of statutory authority.

It is plain from these authorities that the British regime for handling applications for asylum has been closely assimilated to the Convention model. But it is also plain (as I think) that the Convention as a whole has never been formally incorporated or given effect in domestic law. While, therefore, one would expect any government intending to legislate inconsistently with an obligation binding on the UK to make its intention very clear, there can on well known authority be no ground in domestic law for failing to give effect to anenactment in terms unambiguously inconsistent with such an obligation.

If Parliament in an area of concern defined by statute (the area in this case being the care of children in need or trouble) prefers power to be exercised administratively instead of judicially, so be it. The courts must be careful in that area to avoid assuming a supervisory role or reviewing power over the merits of decisions taken administratively by the selected public authority.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Fottrell QC, on behalf of F, has been reluctant to yield to this unambivalent statement of principle, at least expressed in such stark terms. She contends that the options for the child within the family court are not neutralised by the supremacy of the SSHD&#8217;s authority.  By this she means that there are a range of alternatives which might encourage or indeed require the SSHD to reconsider her decision in the light of findings made in the Family Court on the basis of evidence to which she has not had access.   This however, whilst a valid point, is not the same one.  Determination of refugee status itself and therefore its consequences is the SSHD's sole responsibility.   </p>

It is not necessary for me further to burden this judgment with the detailed history of the disclosure which took place in this case.  Suffice it to say that, following a number of politely phrased requests, prefacing orders made by Hogg J, disclosure was forthcoming.  That is not, however, the route the SSHD proposes should be followed in future.  I suspect that the response in this case, now asserted by Mr Norton to have been erroneous, came about in consequence of the Department&#8217;s lawyers conflating requests for information in relation to immigration, visa and passport applications, in family proceedings with requests relating to the grant of asylum.   The two are very different.  In the case of the former, request is made by standardised form, EX660.

Passport and visa applications relating to children will often need to be resolved before the Court can make decisions in their best interest.  An application for Asylum however, has an entirely different complexion to it.  It will invariably involve material of a highly distressing and personal nature.  Asylum seekers are informed, precisely because of these often exquisitely sensitive issues, that the information they provide will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed where there is a requirement in law to do so.  As Mr Norton emphasised, this is made plain to those seeking asylum in very clear terms at the start of the asylum process.  </p>

Both a refusal to take account of objections to the return capable of falling within the scope of Articles 12, 13 and 20 of the Hague Convention and insufficient reasoning in the ruling dismissing or accepting such objections would be contrary to the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention and also to the aim and purpose of the Hague Convention. Due consideration of such allegations, demonstrated by reasoning of the domestic courts that is not automatic and stereotyped, but sufficiently detailed in the light of the exceptions set out in the Hague Convention, which must be interpreted strictly (see Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, &#167; 73), is necessary. &#8221;</span></p>

In addition, in considering proportionality under Article 8 the Court will need to attach particular weight to the wider powerful public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the asylum process. This is particularly so where the applicant for disclosure is the alleged persecutor. Against these considerations the Court will need to weigh, in the case of an application made by a family member, any adverse Article 6 and/or 8 impact of disclosure not being provided to the person making the application. The SSHD&#8217;s position is that only where an exceptional case is established by an applicant will disclosure be necessary.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Fottrell has neither conceded this point nor actively resisted it.  I am bound to say that I consider that contact is the realistic issue in this case and ought properly to be identified as such.  However, this important question will still involve consideration of whether false representations have been made to the SSHD in respect of both asylum claims and I do not propose to circumscribe F&#8217;s case in any way that might inhibit the argument on this point. </p>
