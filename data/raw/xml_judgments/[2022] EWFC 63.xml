At a home visit in February 2006, the mother said when she was pregnant that the father of her unborn child (A) was a 20-year-old man named W who she had met at college.  That putative father was never located during those proceedings.  In January 2010, the mother told a social worker that A&#8217;s father had lied to her about his name and identity.  The mother&#8217;s explanation for A&#8217;s surname is that she chose this at random.  </span></p>

Ground rules were established to assist the mother.  These were set out in an agreed document which identified the sort of linguistic measures with which the court and advocates are now very familiar.  The presence of the mother&#8217;s trainee solicitor and junior Counsel was an important part of the support for the mother.  Regular breaks were maintained throughout the trial.  When the mother requested additional time, it was given, and long periods of sitting were avoided.  The trial was set up so that it did not sit during the middle Wednesday of each week so as to minimise the impact of cumulative tiredness.  The mother&#8217;s legal team were careful to point out any overly complex or inappropriate questions.  When it came to the mother&#8217;s own evidence, questions were drafted in advance and shown to me for approval, and it was agreed that she would only be questioned by Ms Langdale and Ms Roberts.</span></p>

I was told that she had spent a long time on the phone to her solicitor that morning and was feeling quite overwhelmed and pressured by the process.  Although sympathetic to the mother&#8217;s difficulties, I was concerned about the impact on the timetable of simply adjourning until the mother felt able to re-join the process with no indication as to when that would be.  I was concerned that the delay would be harmful for the children and that extending the trial process may be more stressful and difficult for the mother than proceeding.  I invited enquiries to be made as to whether the mother would be able to join the hearing from her home by video or possibly to just to listen by telephone.  Ultimately, I decided to proceed in the mother&#8217;s absence with a much-delayed start at 12.30pm with the assurance that her representatives would take a note and would inform her about the evidence.  I indicated that if the mother obtained medical evidence, I would be willing to reconsider the application to adjourn.  The mother did not take up any of the options to re-join the hearing on day 8, but I am glad to say that when the trial resumed the following week, the mother attended, and she was able to do so on all the other days of the hearing.</span></p>

The mother reportedly gave a history that A has shown significant developmental delay from an early age and that there had not been a recent drastic change in his condition: &#8220;These problems have been ongoing since childhood and there has not been a recent drastic change in his condition, rather he never seems to have acquired a stable, independent gait&#8230;&#8221;  She reportedly said, &#8220;He has never babbled or produced words.

Dr. Magid&#8217;s opinion in his report is that in this assessment, &#8220;Mother was exaggerating and fabricating, saying he never babbled or produced words is a fabrication&#8230;.

The mother said that he was not receiving any education, that he now has an EHCP and that she was receiving DLA for him.  Following the clinic, the consultant paediatrician spoke to the Safeguarding Lead at T School.  She indicated she had made four MASH referrals on A.  The Safeguarding Lead indicated that prior to his removal from school, A was verbally able, could read and write, had good peer relationships and otherwise was a normal child.  The school felt strongly he has regressed.  The consultant paediatrician made a referral to social services and indicated that either A has a disorder causing regression and the mother is in denial, or that A has suffered abuse in the form of factitious or induced illness which had led to mutism and significant physical disability.  He considered the latter to be more likely.  Dr. Magid&#8217;s opinion is that this is objective evidence that the mother was fabricating the symptoms and he &#8220;fully agrees&#8221; with the consultant paediatrician&#8217;s conclusions.</span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.24in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">FII is a clinical situation in which a child is, or is very likely to be, harmed due to parent(s) behaviour and action, carried out in order to convince doctors that the child&#8217;s state of physical and/or mental health and neurodevelopment is impaired (or more impaired than is actually the case). FII results in physical and emotional abuse and neglect, as a result of parental actions, behaviours or beliefs and from doctors&#8217; responses to these. The parent does not necessarily intend to deceive, and their motivations may not be initially evident. </span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.24in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is important to distinguish the relationship between FII and physical abuse / non-accidental injury (NAI). In practice, illness induction is a form of physical abuse (and in Working Together to Safeguard Children, fabrication of symptoms or deliberate induction of illness in a child is included under Physical Abuse). In order for this physical abuse to be considered under FII, evidence will be required that the parent&#8217;s motivation for harming the child is to convince doctors about the purported illness in the child and whether or not there are recurrent presentations to health and other professionals. This particularly applies in cases of suffocation or poisoning. </span></p>

The caregiver may be a single parent, or may be acting alone, unbeknown to the father. The involvement of fathers is variable. The father may be unaware, be suspicious but side-lined or may be actively involved. Rarely, fathers are solely involved. The parent may be actively supported by grandparents and there may be an intergenerational pattern. Rarely, foster carers have been known to be involved in FII. There is currently no data on same sex parental couples. </span></p>

FII may involve physical, and/or psychological health, neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive disabilities. There are two possible, and very different, motivations underpinning the parent&#8217;s need: the parent experiencing a gain and the parent&#8217;s erroneous beliefs. It is also recognised that a parent themselves may not be conscious of the motivation behind their behaviour. Both motivations may be present although usually one predominates. </span></p>

The parent is thus using the child to fulfil their needs, disregarding the effects on the child. There are a number of different gains - some psychosocial and some material. Some parents benefit from the sympathetic attention which they receive; they may fulfil their dependency needs for support, which might include the continued physical closeness of their child. Parents who struggle with the management of their child may seek an inappropriate mental health diagnostic justification in the child such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Material gain includes financial support for care of the child, improved housing, holidays, assisted mobility and preferential car parking. </span></p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.74in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The second motivation is based on the parent&#8217;s erroneous beliefs, extreme concern and anxiety about their child&#8217;s health (e.g. nutrition, allergies, treatments). This can include a mistaken belief that their child needs additional support at school and an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP). The parent may be misinterpreting or misconstruing aspects of their child&#8217;s presentation and behaviour. In pursuit of an explanation, and increasingly aided by the internet, the parent develops a belief about what is wrong with their child. In contrast to typical parental concern, the parent exhibiting such behaviour cannot be reassured by health professionals or negative investigations. More rarely, parents may develop fixed or delusional psychotic beliefs about their child&#8217;s state of health. The parent&#8217;s need here is to have their beliefs confirmed and acted upon, but to the detriment of the child. </span></p>

To be clear, and as I indicate above, a &#8216;Lucas direction&#8217; will not be called for in every family case in which a party or intervenor is challenging the factual case alleged against them and, in my opinion, should not be included in the judgment as a tick box exercise. If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe A or B on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness&#8217;s reliability of recall on a particular issue. </span></p>

Whilst inevitably her reasons for wanting to have a solicitor and appeal will be mixed, arising at least in part from the fact that her solicitor and Guardian did not achieve the outcome she desired I consider that it is also likely that her position has been influenced by her mother and maternal family either directly or indirectly. Although every child is of course different the fact that this child has not been in direct contact with Mr Burrows or Ms Hopkin pushing for information, seeking answers or otherwise proactively pressing her case indicates to me that her desire to have her own solicitor in Ms Hopkin and to pursue the appeal is not particularly strong. Her acceptance of the possible withdrawal of proceedings in summer 2018 is further evidence of this.</span></p>

The child's wish to live with her mother was accepted by the Guardian and HHJ Meston QC as a genuine one. Inevitably it is in part a product of influence (whether direct or indirect and see HHJ Pearl's conclusion) but all our views are in part a product of influence of others views. The child's wishes in this case are closer to the authentic end of the spectrum than the parroting end although they probably fall closer to the middle.</span></p>

Further involvement in litigation in this appeal or otherwise will likely be contrary to her welfare interests. Exposure to sensitive information to a child of this age and with this history will be harmful. Although her actual involvement in this appeal might be limited the process of challenging the judgment would inevitably involve detailed discussions with the child about the evidence. On the other hand, she has expressed a desire to have Ms Hopkin act for her and to appeal. This has endured since HHJ Meston QC's adverse judgment. However it is not pressed proactively and the Guardian and Ms Coyle did not detect any real desire to appeal in any event. Thus preventing the child from engaging directly in this litigation with the effect that it would very probably bring the appeal to a juddering halt is not likely in my view to be perceived by the child as a significant insult to her autonomy as an individual.&#8221;</span></p>

The Court had relied on assessment by the child&#8217;s solicitor that he was not competent to give instructions. That assessment was conducted in private law proceedings in July 2020 and relied upon in public law proceedings in November. No party challenged that course during the hearing. The primary issue in the public law proceedings involved intrusion into the child&#8217;s family life and an interference with Article 8 rights.  Baker LJ observed: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">If, as this Court observed in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re S (Re S (A Minor)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> (Independent Representation) (1993)2 FLR 437, the level of understanding has to be assessed relatively to the issue in the proceedings, Z&#8217;s understanding of the issues surrounding the proposal that he be removed from the family home may be materially different to his understanding of the issues relating to contact with his mother&#8221;. Baker LJ referred to the fact that a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder meant that Z fell within the protection of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006. Under Article 13 (1) of the Convention: &#8220;State parties shall ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others, in order to facilitate their effective role as direct and indirect participants, including as witnesses, in all legal proceedings, including at investigative and other preliminary stages</span>&#8221;. The Court of Appeal held that where a 15-year-old boy without disabilities would be able to participate directly in court proceedings, it is incumbent on the Court and professionals working with a disabled 15-year-old boy to take such steps as may be necessary to facilitate his participation in the proceedings, particularly where the proceedings involve a fundamental question such as removal from his home.</p>

It is of note that when the Attorney General undertook a review of 297 cases over a 10 year period following the case of R v Cannings [2004] 2 Criminal Appeal Reports 63, 97 were cases of what is known as &#8220;shaken baby syndrome&#8221;. The controversy to which such cases gives rise should come as no surprise. A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or child-minder.&#160; That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened.&#160; Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct, as best they can, what has happened.&#160; There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child.&#160; Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case.&#160; Such a temptation must be resisted.&#160; In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude beyond reasonable doubt an unknown cause.&#160; As Cannings (177) teaches, even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown". </span></p>

It follows inexorably from that, that society must be willing to tolerate very diverse standards of parenting, including the eccentric, the barely adequate and the inconsistent. It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, whilst others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the State to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

The test is not to be construed in a vacuum nor applied judgementally by reference to some gold standard of parenting which few (if any) could achieve. On the contrary, it contemplates a range of behaviour, incorporating inevitable human frailty. The reasonableness of the care given requires to be evaluated strictly by reference to the particular circumstances and the individual child.&#8221;</span></p>

Different professionals often had different concepts of parenting against which parents were assessed. Parents' disengagement with services, because they felt that staff had a negative view of them and 'wanted to take their children away' was also an issue, as were referrals to support services which were too late to be of optimum use to the family &#8211; often because workers lacked awareness of parents' learning difficulties or because parents had not previously been known to services".</span></p>

The concept of "parenting with support" must underpin the way in which the courts and professionals approach wherever possible parents with learning difficulties. The extended family can be a valuable source of support to parents and their children and the courts must anxiously scrutinize the possibilities of assistance from the extended family. Moreover the court must also view multi-agency working as critical if parents are to be supported effectively. Courts should carefully examine the approach of Trusts to ensure this is being done in appropriate cases. In particular judges must make absolutely certain that parents with learning difficulties are not at risk of having their parental responsibilities terminated on the basis of evidence that would not hold up against normal parents. Their competences must not be judged against stricter criteria or harsher standards than other parents. Courts must be acutely aware of the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination and how this might be relevant to the treatment of parents with learning difficulties in care proceedings. In particular careful consideration must be given to the assessment phase by a Trust and in the application of the threshold test.&#160;</span></p>

More regularly the prevailing concerns centre on a perceived risk of neglect, both as the result of the parents' intellectual impairments, and the impact of the social and economic deprivation commonly faced by adults with learning difficulties. It is in this context that a shift must be made from the old assumption that adults with learning difficulties could not parent to a process of questioning why appropriate levels of support are not provided to them so that they can parent successfully and why their children should often be taken into care. At its simplest, this means a court carefully inquiring as to what support is needed to enable parents to show whether or not they can become good enough parents rather than automatically assuming that they are destined to fail. The concept of "parenting with support" must move from the margins to the mainstream in court determinations.</span></p>

			<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.74in;text-indent:0.26in"><span style="font-style:italic">The Akin case reminds us that article 8 imposes both negative and positive obligations - not to interfere in family life without justification and to take positive steps to maintain and develop family ties. In both cases, the case law under article 8 emphasises the authorities&#8217; obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child (see Maslov v Austria [GC] [2009] INLR 47 (Application No 1638/03) 23 June 2008, para 82). And the decision-making process must be such as to show that the authorities had a sufficient evidentiary basis for their decisions and that the interested parties, including the children themselves, were able to express their views (see, e.g., Havelka v Czech Republic (Application No 23499/06) (unreported) 21 June 2007). However, the role of a parent, involving, in the absence of intervention by public authorities, the right to decide how a child is to be brought up, is qualitatively different from the role of most siblings. As noted above, a sibling&#8217;s role can be very important to the well-being and development of a child. But where a child is being cared for away from the family, what matters is the maintenance and development of the relationship between the siblings, whether through placing them together or through staying in regular contact with one another.</span></p>

			<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.74in;text-indent:0.26in"><span style="font-style:italic">It is important to recognise that there are differences between the relationship of a parent and a child and the relationship between a sibling and a child. People who have parental responsibilities are treated as relevant persons because of those responsibilities and people who have a significant role in the upbringing of a child also have the right to be deemed a relevant person. As the European Court of Human Rights stated in Haase v Germany <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2005) 40 EHRR 19" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">(2005) 40 EHRR 19</ref>, para 82, &#8220;the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other&#8217;s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life&#8221;. The parents and other people who have a significant involvement in the upbringing of the child are those who make decisions for the child. It is those decisions which are now being made by the public authorities through the CSO. The interference with the article 8 rights of such people is qualitatively different from the interference with the article 8 rights of siblings, which normally will be concerned with maintaining their relationship with the referred child, whether through contact or (if they are both the subject of CSOs) through being placed together. The conferment of the status of relevant person is an acknowledgement of the gravity of the interference with the family life of the child and the parents and others with that significant involvement in the child&#8217;s upbringing.</span></p>

			<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.74in;text-indent:0.26in"><span style="font-style:italic">We nonetheless acknowledge that the initiation of these challenges has served to uncover a gap in the children&#8217;s hearings system which has had to be adapted to meet the requirements of article 8 in relation to siblings and other family members. There is now a clear recognition of the interest of both the child and the sibling in maintaining a sibling relationship through contact (or through placement if both are subject to CSOs) in most cases. The nature of the sibling relationship will vary from family to family and there needs to be a nuanced approach which addresses the extent of family life in that relationship, the home circumstances, how far the interests of the parents, the sibling and the child coincide and the possibility that the child, the parents and other siblings may have article 8 rights which are in conflict with those of the sibling. There needs, in short, to be a bespoke enquiry about the child&#8217;s relationship with his or her siblings when the children&#8217;s hearing is addressing the possibility of making a CSO.</span>&#8221;</p>

Some may find it impossible ever to contemplate siblings needing to be placed separately, while others may find it impossible to believe that any new family could parent a group of four or five siblings, all of whom are needy in their own right. This can be the case for those who have worked with or, indeed, been part of a large, chaotic, dysfunctional birth family and who have found the experience overwhelming&#8230;Training and supervision are both important in enabling people to air and discuss their views and to consider possible alternatives. Clear policies and procedures and group working and decision-making are important checks and balances on personal beliefs.</span></p>

For example, the mother claimed he had sensitivity to sound such that she wanted him to have ear defenders, but in foster care he would turn the sound up on the Xbox and was not bothered by peripheral sound.  She expressed the hope that D would show similar improvements to B in foster care but that he would need a lot of attention and C&#8217;s needs could be overshadowed as a result.  She accepted that there was a risk if placing D and C together of the placement breaking down or of the experience being suboptimal for C.

If therapy were undertaken while the children were in the mother&#8217;s care, Dr. Garrett expected it to be highly distressing for someone with the mother&#8217;s background, so she would generally recommend it only if there was another protective adult in the household or available to be with the children.  She said she would not hesitate to recommend strongly for therapy if she thought the person was likely to engage well, but she did not think that was the case for the mother.</span></p>

He explained that evidence is necessarily patchy, that during proceedings there is a lot of observation and a lot of data to work from, but between proceedings the evidence is relatively lacking, relying on self-reporting and other data such as the medical records.

I accept the positive accounts of Ms N and the family support worker of the interactions that they observed of the mother being considerably challenged in particular by D&#8217;s behaviour but maintaining a calm and patient parenting approach.  I heard about the parenting strategies that the mother used.  I accept all that evidence.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.28in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">However, I have also heard a considerable amount of evidence relating to the mother struggling to engage in a positive or constructive way at times with some of the professionals.  There was a clear disparity in the way the mother worked with some but not with others.  It was suggested that the difference was whether they were challenging to the mother, however I am not persuaded that was the decisive factor.  It was put on the mother&#8217;s behalf that this was a reasonable response by the mother to professionals who had acted in some ways below the standards to be expected or whose decisions had led to negative consequences for the children.  However, in my judgment it was the way in which the mother viewed the professional that was determinative.  For example, she was able to work constructively with Dr. Lyall and Dr. Garrett despite being challenged; whereas she struggled with the Communicourt assessments which would not have been challenging.  The mother&#8217;s attitude also shifted with certain professionals at different times.  Thus, the consultant paediatrician was worked with positively until he raised with professionals his concerns about FII, at which point the mother considered that &#8220;he changed&#8221; and she withdrew from engaging and sought a different paediatrician.  I note that when the consultant paediatrician gave his evidence, the mother removed herself from camera view so he could not see her and presumably she could not see him.  A similar approach was also seen in the mother&#8217;s attitude towards the children&#8217;s guardian &#8211; there was significant level of non-engagement with the guardian after she had supported the removal of A and B at an early stage in the proceedings; however this was followed by a thaw and the mother being willing to engage towards the end of proceedings after the children&#8217;s guardian at subsequent hearings urged the local authority against seeking removal of the younger four children and then opposed the removal of D when they sought an ICO with removal into foster care.</span></p>

No doubt it was intended to be a means of calming him down and keeping him at school, but with hindsight it is easy to understand why D may have become very upset with his mother.  There is a dispute about the mother&#8217;s reaction.  I heard evidence from a teaching assistant at R school staff who had never had any direct role with any of the children in the family.  She heard what she described as shouting and screaming and saw the mother grab D out of the back of the care and shout, &#8220;You&#8217;re fucking doing my head in&#8221; and the pastoral care and safeguarding lead &#8220;is a fucking liar&#8221;.

The mother had concerns about bullying and the safety of the children at school.  The Covid-19 pandemic must have played a role with concerns about risk of infection in schools being commonplace amongst parents at the time.  The children at different times would have had to cope with transitions at school and nursery and these can be a struggle for lots of children and parents.</span></p>

It may be that was an element of it, but I am not in a position to be able to determine that.  However, on the evidence before me I am satisfied that the various decisions to remove the children from education were in part a response to the mother&#8217;s pronounced sense of needing to keep the children safe.  As the art therapist described it, &#8220;we felt the mother might be over-identifying from her own experiences and felt she wanted to protect her children from the awkwardness and experiences she had growing up.&#8221;  In my judgment, the mother&#8217;s approach was excessive and disproportionate and caused harm to the children.</span></p>

Firstly, it points out that the mother previously had a preoccupation with her skin and had concerns about A&#8217;s skin.  Dr. Lyall&#8217;s 2010 report establishes that the mother was preoccupied with her skin, indeed he diagnosed her with dysmorphophobia, specifically a preoccupation with the pigmentation of her skin.  A social worker in the first set of proceedings, wrote in her statement dated August 2010 that the mother was making continuing assertions that there was a problem not only with her own skin but also with A&#8217;s.  It is important to record that the mother&#8217;s preoccupation with skin appeared to have subsided at least by the time Dr. Lyall saw her again in April 2020. </span></p>

When challenged that this was no more than a warm and affectionate nature, the guardian&#8217;s reply was striking, &#8220;I am very accustomed to seeing children in their homes.  I am a stranger.

I appreciate that the pandemic struck in February 2020, but the concerns about mutism arose well before then.  I also cannot ignore that since A and B were removed from their mother&#8217;s care, they have shown a very considerable improvement.  The mother&#8217;s case is that the A&#8217;s difficulties arose out of problems at school, particularly with bullying and that the improvement came about with the education provision at School Q.  However, I am not persuaded by that analysis.  If the problem was at the school, firstly, I would have expected the mutism and functional motor symptoms to arise when A was still at school and to have improved when he stopped attending school and stayed at home.  </span></p>

It is clear that D&#8217;s presentation was one that needed investigation and initially on the basis of information from a range of sources a diagnosis was made.  The fact that diagnosis has been called into question after a more in-depth assessment by GOSH does not mean that the medics involved initially were in error based on the information available at the time.  Nor does it mean that the mother must have been responsible for any misdiagnosis.  On the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that I should make this finding.  </span></p>

Initially A started off silent and very slow but before he could make a good start his mother started prompting him to reply in a not so calm/patient manner, and when she did not get an immediate response, she would become more panicky and prompt him again or ask another question.  Unclear to the mother she was making it very uncomfortable for A to voice anything which made him extremely upset and brought him to tears.  At this point I decided to take A into another room to calm him down and not only did he calm down very quickly but he was able to communicate effectively.  We spoke and he explained that he doesn&#8217;t get much time to explain because it is unusually very busy at home with his other siblings.  I think took A back to the meeting room and explained to the mother that A would like to talk and that it would be best if he&#8217;s not rushed as he may take some time to get his words out.  A was able to communicate and was more honest about his behaviour however mum was still adamant that something was still wrong.&#8221;</span></p>

However, I am mindful that marked levels of improvement were seen rapidly after removal.  There have been some clear incidents that demonstrate A&#8217;s levels of ability &#8211; his walking and then running away in July 2021 is a very clear indicator of his improvement.

The possibility of his mobility issues being as a result of hypermobility does not appear to be realistic in the light of Dr. Magid&#8217;s evidence about the mildness of that condition.  I have also considered the inconsistency in his physical presentation at different appointments with the consultant paediatrician which neither he nor the neurologist could explain.  I have borne in mind that medical science has limits and advances in knowledge continue to be made, including marked advances that significantly shift the mainstream beliefs about a particular condition.  The potential exists for an innocent explanation for A&#8217;s presentation to lie in the &#8220;dark corners&#8221; of medical science.  However, while I acknowledge that possibility, I do not think it is likely for two reasons, (i) if it was the case, then A&#8217;s condition drastically deteriorated then spontaneously improved without treatment which seems even more unlikely; and (ii) while it is not said that the other children have suffered FII, there are clear similarities between A and some of his younger siblings, in particular in relation to mutism.  Again, it is possible that this is some form of extremely rare and unknown condition that they share, but also in the case of B, his mutism resolved at the same time as A&#8217;s when they were removed into foster care.  I consider these possibilities to be so remote that I should discount as an explanation the possibility of there being some unknown cause for A&#8217;s condition.</span></p>

Ms Langdale submits that there is evidence of the mother taking pride in her children and delighting in their success, which I accept.  However, I can identify in this case a number of potential gains that may have been applicable.  Firstly, there were a number of financial and practical additional supports that were sought or derived as a result of A&#8217;s condition &#8211; Disability Living Allowance was secured; the provision of the school bus for wheelchair users was obtained; A&#8217;s attendance at special needs school was secured; a mobility scooter was requested.  Secondly, the mother had been subject to criticism from social services about the care she was providing to the children, this first arose when A was a baby.  By identifying disability in A, it also provided a justification for the mother struggling to meet his needs.  Thirdly, the mother has significant emotional needs of her own.  Her experiences during her childhood have had a profound impact on her functioning to the extent that Dr. Garrett and Dr. Lyall formed the view that she has an Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder which impacts her parenting.  By A adopting the sick role and remaining mute he would have provided an unproblematic means by which the mother&#8217;s unresolved emotional needs could be better fulfilled.</span></p>

There are a number of instances documented where after a medical appointment or investigation, the mother has afterwards recounted a more serious outcome than was actually identified.  The mother&#8217;s cognitive functioning and her personality disorder are likely to have played into these sorts of misunderstandings.  In particular, the mother has very high levels of anxiety.  This has been seen throughout the proceedings themselves both in her interactions with professionals and the court.  The mother&#8217;s fears and anxieties have a substantial impact on her thinking and her behaviour.  An example of this was seen in her reaction to A&#8217;s drawings when she believed they were evidence of sexual abuse and reported the foster carers to the police.  </span></p>

I note that although the mother has cognitive issues, she has not been diagnosed with a learning disability.  I note that the cognitive assessment of Dr. Garrett was not received until a relatively late stage and many of the professionals were unaware of its contents at the time they worked with the mother.   However, I was reassured when I heard the evidence of the consultant paediatrician about the way he described working with the mother which appeared to be sensitively done and in a way that would have been appropriate had he known about the mother&#8217;s cognitive functioning and personality disorder.  It is significant that the mother described being able to work with the consultant paediatrician until &#8220;he changed&#8221; &#8211; which was at the point that he raised the alarm about factitious or induced illness.</span></p>

However, in this case I cannot ignore the simple fact that for the mother, as a single carer for 6 children with cognitive issues, the day-to-day tasks of getting the children to school and meeting their needs was a considerable enterprise and the potential for appointments to be missed or forgotten would have been quite high.  In the context of the demands on the mother and her own vulnerabilities, I am not persuaded that I should read too much into missed appointments.  However, the local authority also seeks to rely on the mother refusing to take A to appointments with the consultant paediatrician and then cancelling the first appointment with his replacement.  This approach is of a very different type because it reflects the mother rejecting professionals who she considers are against her and withdrawing her co-operation.  In the context of FII, absenting herself from the professionals who are raising FII as an explanation for A&#8217;s presentation is a factor that is consistent with FII rather than a factor against it.</span></p>

I have thought about whether the mother simply misled the professionals as a result of hazy memory or poor recollection.  I have considered whether she exaggerated A&#8217;s symptoms to the professionals because that is what at the time she genuinely believed &#8211; given her high levels of anxiety, it is not difficult to reach such a conclusion.  I have considered whether it was a knowing lie, with the intention of misleading professionals in the hope of garnering medical treatment and attention for her vicariously.  On balance, I consider it is likeliest that the mother&#8217;s main driver when she misled the professionals was her anxiety in the context of her cognitive issues.

I am satisfied that this was seen when A attended at appointments and his physical symptoms were observed.  The consultant paediatrician described it as very surprising that when he saw A in November 2018, A exhibited choreoathetoid &#8220;writhing&#8221; movements.  He explained that they are a very specific neurological symptom in children arising from inadequate treatment of jaundice which is &#8220;very, very rare&#8221; in the UK and not associated with any other form of movement disorder.  Those movements had not been seen before in A and did not fit with any clinical scenario that the consultant paediatrician could understand.  They were not seen at his other appointments with the consultant paediatrician.  In my judgment this is evidence of A colluding with the mother&#8217;s exaggeration of his symptoms by adopting the sick role and presenting that role to the consultant paediatrician.

The same reasoning applies as to the presentation of A&#8217;s difficulties.  The evidence of his behaviour at T School before he was withdrawn does not support this hypothesis as the cause of A&#8217;s mutism and mobility issues &#8211; he had transitioned to secondary school and was talking, even obtaining detentions as a result, and was interacting with peers and partaking in activities properly.  It does not make sense that if the secondary school transition was the cause of his difficulties that the severe symptoms would arise only after he had been removed from school.  In my judgment, the crucial factor was A being isolated in the care of his mother in the absence of school interactions.</span></p>

I find that the mother did fail to bring the children to those appointments I have listed.  However, I should put this finding into context.  The children have had a multitude of appointments over the years and the mother has maintained engagement with the vast majority of these appointments.  The missing of the podiatry and ophthalmology appointments was problematic but not of sufficient seriousness in the context of how many appointments had been attended overall to meet the threshold criteria test.  The missed appointment with the consultant paediatrician and the initial appointment with his replacement is of a different sort because this was driven by the mother&#8217;s antipathy towards the consultant paediatrician after he had raised the concerns about FII and amounted to an attempt to distance herself and the children from those enquiries being pursued.</span></p>

In June 2020, it states that she again refused a home visit and stated that A, B and she suffer from hay fever.  In July 2020, it records a virtual visit but notes that the mother&#8217;s friend had been allowed to visit the home.  In September 2020, it records the mother declined a face-to-face visit, claiming the infection rate was climbing again.  In September 2020, the mother is recorded to have declined a social worker visit and states that A has Covid-19 symptoms.  In December 2020, a home visit by a duty social worker was successfully completed.</span></p>

The mother in her response document points to her cognitive issues and asserts she has never intentionally misled professionals.  I am not asked in relation to this finding to determine the mother&#8217;s motivation or her intention.  In my judgment it is the impact on the children that is the significant point in relation to this behaviour.  I am not persuaded that misunderstandings or professional failures to adapt their communication appropriately to suit the mother&#8217;s needs adequately explains the inaccurate or inconsistent information the mother gave to professionals.  For example, the consultant paediatrician was able in his initial sessions to build an effective relationship with the mother which only changed after he made a social services referral.  He impressed me as an experienced and sympathetic paediatrician who would take appropriate care in his consultations.  Notwithstanding that I accept Dr. Garrett&#8217;s analysis of the mother&#8217;s communication difficulties, it is difficult for me to see how they caused her to misstate matters or be misunderstood by so many professionals.  It is not immaterial that Dr. Garrett, who was fully aware of the mother&#8217;s limitations and highly skilled in adapting her communication style to meet the mother&#8217;s needs, also received a similar account about A&#8217;s limitations &#8211; for example she also was told that A has &#8220;never attended PE lessons at school, and that he could not run or kick a ball&#8221;.  </span></p>

The impact was that she did not receive that additional layer of support to assist her in these proceedings.  I have considered whether she did not appreciate the purpose of the assessment, however when she experienced that sort of problem with other assessments, they were overcome by explanations being given.  It is unlikely that three different Communicourt workers would have not been able to explain their role sufficiently.  I consider it is more likely that the mother realised that the recommendation came from Dr. Garrett and by the time the intermediary assessment was arranged the mother would have received Dr. Garrett&#8217;s main report (dated June 2021) which was critical of her on a number of levels.

I have also considered the exhibits to the mother&#8217;s fourth statement.  This was a document produced, without leave, during the final hearing.  The mother explained that she had been passed three notebooks by A during contact in January 2022 and she exhibited their contents.  She explained that she thought that A had been given the notebooks and identified some of the handwriting in the first few pages as the maternal grandfather&#8217;s.  The notebooks continue a similar theme as A&#8217;s email to the MP &#8211; expressing his dissatisfaction with the children&#8217;s guardian and his solicitor.  They also deal with complaints about the social worker and the foster carers.  They also contain some pages which appear to log A&#8217;s responses from the MP as well as conversations with the foster carers.  On one page, it sets out that, &#8220;You can show all this to your solicitor&#8221; and is signed twice, once with &#8220;2021 signature (old)&#8221; and another with &#8220;2022 signature (new)&#8221;.  The notes are mostly dated and a large number of them are dated in August 2021 &#8211; around the time when A and B changed foster placements and when A ran away.  The handwriting in the notebooks is not consistent, with some pages of very careful, neat handwriting, and others of more loose joined up handwriting.  The spelling, grammar, punctuation is all of a very good standard and the contents are articulate.  Overall, they are highly critical although I note that the current foster carer receives praise, &#8220;This is to certify that [the foster carer] is an honorable lady with a scholar.&#8221;  There are also some poems copied out in praise of mother.  There are two letters to the Judge, one appears to be an early draft and stops abruptly.  They express clearly A&#8217;s sense of feeling trapped, or hopelessness and wanting to die as a result of being in foster care.  A is praising of his mother and his family and reiterates his wish to return home.</span></p>

They report that while he shows some ability to have independent views from his mother&#8217;s, his competence to weigh up and communicate these decisions is doubtful.  A separate issue has arisen about A&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  The guardian and the solicitor for the child have indicated that when they have seen A, he has not communicated in the way reflected in the letter to the MP and the documents handed over to his mother.  Mr. Woodward-Carlton submitted that it is unclear who the author of all the documents was and points to the handwriting being markedly different in different places.  Unfortunately, there is also the fact that A was secretly provided with a mobile phone without the knowledge of the local authority or the foster carer which he later said he had been given by the maternal grandmother in contact.  I have no information about the contents of the phone, or how long it was in his possession.  The information contained within the bundle of documents provided by A to his mother just before the final hearing raises more issues about its bona fides.  It was plainly written with the court in mind.  </span></p>

GOSH reported that he likes to be with his mother and seems withdrawn in relation to outsiders.  When GOSH first saw F, he appeared completely withdrawn and later he presented as dull and distant to what was happening around him; he shows no pleasure playing by himself and had a flat expression; he communicated solely non-verbally and in a regressed way, akin to a child of 8-12 months old.  GOSH&#8217;s opinion is that the extent to which F&#8217;s developmental delay and reduced social interaction can be attributed to his environment or to any underlying neurodevelopmental or cognitive needs is unclear and will require monitoring and further assessment.</span></p>

In addition, the FSW, Ms N was playing a role in supporting the mother from November 2019 onwards.  These were supports that the mother found to be very positive and helpful.  In addition, she was receiving family support from the maternal grandfather who was assisting with getting the children to and from school.  There were other supports from universal services &#8211; the NHS and the schools which were more mixed in the way the mother worked with them.  In the course of proceedings there has been social worker involvement as well as increased family support presence from the family support worker.  I recognise that during that time, the tension and stress for the mother would have been increased dramatically by the proceedings, although also the demands of meeting the children&#8217;s needs would have been considerably decreased when A and B were placed into care.  Unfortunately, despite that support and assistance, D&#8217;s behaviour has continued to deteriorate to unmanageable levels.  I recognise that since he commenced nursery F&#8217;s developmental delay has improved considerably, although that may be a reflection on the benefit of nursery attendance rather than the care received from the mother. Ultimately however, the mother&#8217;s lack of insight and the poor prospects of therapeutic intervention to assist with her personality disorder mean that the environment which has led to the children suffering significant harm is likely to prevail and I am not satisfied that even with the very high levels of support being continued, that would be sufficient to ameliorate the risks to the children.  Nor am I satisfied that the children will be able to receive the good quality care that they need and for A, B and D, the reparative care that they need.</span></p>

They are quite old and have a real sense of belonging to their family.  This is likely to be something that they find quite difficult.  That difficulty may increase the chances of an adoptive placement breaking down which would be really harmful for the children.  They will have letterbox contact, so they will continue to remember their family, but it is unlikely they will see anyone else face-to-face.  They will grow up without experiencing directly the love that their mother and the extended family have for them.  There is a real risk they will not be adopted together, and they may have separate adoptive homes, or one child may be adopted and the other end up in foster care.</span></p>

I realise that there are considerable uncertainties about whether an adoptive family will be found and whether they will be placed together.  However, I consider that the advantages of being adopted outweigh the disadvantages of this uncertainty.  The care plan for time-limited searches for a placement for children together is sensible so that the balance is struck between searching for a joint placement and not missing out on the chance for a single placement.  There is a disagreement between the local authority and the guardian as to how long the search for an adoptive placement should continue for &#8211; the guardian proposed 9 months, the local authority proposed a year.  At the time the parties were planning for judgment to be given in early February.  The children&#8217;s ages have continued to rise during the intervening period, and I consider their ages to be a key consideration when considering how long a search for an adoptive placement should be undertaken.  In the circumstances, I prefer the guardian&#8217;s approach of a search for 9 months for an adoptive placement and I invite the local authority to amend its care plans accordingly.  That time limit strikes the right balance between giving the search a proper chance to succeed while also making sure that the children do not have to wait for too long in the hope of a search may never be successful and recognising that as they get older the prospects of successfully identifying an adoptive family will diminish significantly.</span></p>

I have considered the questions that Peter Jackson LJ set out that the court should ask itself.  The type of harm that may arise for E and F is set out already in this judgment.  They are at risk of physical and emotional harm arising from their exposure to the mother&#8217;s parenting, including a risk of FII.  In the context of the mother&#8217;s lack of insight into her own difficulties, notwithstanding her willingness to do whatever she is asked, I am satisfied that there is a very limited prospect of her overcoming the deficits in her parenting and not within the children&#8217;s timescales.  Thus, I am satisfied that there is a high likelihood of harm arising to E and F if they remain in her care, even with support from family and professionals.  The consequences of that harm could be profound.  There is a pattern of significant behaviour problems with B and D and there are indications that F is already showing some difficulties with his behaviour.  There are issues with E&#8217;s over-familiarity with strangers.  There is a risk of physical and emotional harm arising from FII.  I am not satisfied that there are steps that could be taken to mitigate sufficiently the effects on the children.  Although there has been family support in particular from the maternal grandfather and the uncle and seemingly some support from the father as well, it was insufficient to protect the children from the harm they suffered.  In the context of the proceedings, with extremely high levels of professional involvement, initially with CAMHS support, and with a high level of family support worker presence as well as social worker involvement; that has been insufficient to prevent D&#8217;s behaviour deteriorating significantly.  The prospects of therapy being successfully engaged with and bringing about effective and sustained change are limited given the difficulties with obtaining therapy as more importantly the mother&#8217;s lack of insight and lack of appreciation of what needs to be changed.</span></p>
