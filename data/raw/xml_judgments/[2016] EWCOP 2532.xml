This was executed to receive interim payments of damages and to preserve ABC&#8217;s entitlement to DWP benefits (it is no longer needed for the latter purpose). I am not clear how much of the interim payments totalling &#163;142,000 were paid to respectively that trust and to ABC&#8217;s deputy, who was appointed later. </p>

[The solicitor advising] confirmed that there had been mention of ending the trust after settlement of the claim if Court of Protection is in place as this would have the same effect however this very much depends on whether there is a Court of Protection order and the medical evidence at the time. ABC said he would prefer the trust framework as this allows more flexibility but allows him to manage his own affairs outside the personal injury compensation.----------------</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">That evidence also included an Assessment of Capacity made in October 2013 by a psychiatrist.  This was prepared because it was then anticipated that the deputy would make an application for appointment as ABCs deputy. No such application was made at that time and that assessment contains passages to the effect that in the view of that psychiatrist it is possible that with support and rehabilitation ABC may regain capacity to manage his own affairs, that his mental capacity needs to be kept under regular review and he would recommend formally reviewing ABC&#8217;s capacity in two years (i.e. in 2015).  A June 2014 report from the same psychiatrist was also exhibited to that evidence and that report is correctly described therein as a report that ABC lacks capacity to manage his property and affairs and is unlikely to regain capacity to do so in the future.   That report contains the following passages: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I did not investigate why, in the circumstances that existed in 2015 and were set out in the evidence in support of the application to appoint the deputy, either she or the authorised officer of the Court of Protection, who made the order, thought it was appropriate for that order to be made by an authorised officer.  In my view, the difficulties and issues relating to capacity set out in the supporting evidence (and in the evidence in the QB proceedings) mean that it is troubling that an authorised officer made that order and the application should have been put before a judge of the COP.  The COP should look at what happened to see what, if any, lessons can be learned to avoid a repetition in similar cases in the future.  </p>

I worry that ABC will realise all too late that it is the accident/brain injury that has changed his life and that the legal case was/has been processed to try to rebuild his life for the future. However, as he is, ABC&#8217;s mindset is that the legal case is responsible for the situation he is in. He thinks the case holds him back. I know that this perception is completely wrong. I know that ABC </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:10pt">really</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> needs support and I know there are times when he does appreciate support (such as when I take him to appointments) and I think he can see the benefit of [ E ] going through his paperwork with him dealing with debts, fines, reminders etc -----------------------</span></p>

As I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, he has thought that he is already under the Court of Protection, but I know from what he says he doesn&#8217;t want outside management of his money or property. I hope that we will come to accept it, given time, but in the short term I suspect that he will oppose any application or continuation of Court of Protection/appointment of the Deputy. As with everything else, I just hope that ABC will have a dawning realisation when the case is over and learn to accept things as positives, and learn to recognise friends from enemies. It worries me that he is so vulnerable and that he could so easily be &#8220;taken for a ride&#8221;.</span></p>

I suspect that he may sometimes believe that he needs help, but if something is presented as a &#8220;support buddy&#8221; I suspect this would always be resented. I suspect that this is linked in with ABCs perception of need and also of &#8220;value for money&#8221;. He clearly resents what he thinks his lawyer and case manager and others are paid.

In the long term, I cannot see ABC &#8220;sticking with&#8221; a trust fund if it is a voluntary thing i.e. I see him sacking the trustees and trying to take control of the money himself or property development, if he is not within the ambit of the Court of Protection. Without this protection, were ABC to have a cheque for say &#163;1.5 million in his hand, I have to say that I&#8217;m not convinced that he would seek professional advice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also explained that, leaving aside issues of capacity, the lay and professional evidence showed that it was almost inevitable that ABC would <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">always</span> be vulnerable to influence from others who may well not have his best interests at heart and so may cause him to waste the award.  To my mind, as I explained, this means that another factor that needs consideration is the effective inevitability that in the unlikely event that ABC does have capacity in the future to manage large sums of capital and so, for example, engage in property development relating to &#8220;buy to let&#8221; schemes ABC will be vulnerable and there will be a real risk that cannot sensibly be ignored (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">the Vulnerability Risk</span>) that he will (alone or under inappropriate influence) make disastrous or bad decisions that deprive him of the use of the damages awarded to meet his needs caused by his brain injury.</p>

I say &#8220;possibly&#8221; because the question whether such a power in favour of a limited class (e.g. children) would create a different vulnerability risk would need consideration.</p>

Both are revocable and both contain the trusts set out in the schedule hereto.  As can be seen therefrom those trusts give an absolute interest in capital to ABC and HM respectively (and so to the relevant P) who is defined therein as the Beneficiary.   Also, under both P is absolutely entitled to the income (the use of the word &#8220;may&#8221; in the trust of income does not alter this and effectively introduces a power to apply income in ways that do not involve paying it to P directly or to retain income for P).

However, in my view this is not the case and all that this sub-section does is to add factors that the COP is to take into account and weigh in reaching its decision.  So those particularised factors have to be weighed against factors that would favour the appointment of a deputy rather than the COP making a series of orders.  To my mind this applies whether or not the deputy is appointed to make decisions relating to property and affairs or welfare or both.  In both property and affairs cases and welfare cases there will be important one off decisions and in such cases the principles and so factors set out in s. 16(4) would be likely to point in favour of the COP making the decisions.  But in both a need to make a number of decisions on a single matter (e.g. selling a house or a course of treatment), or on a number of day to day matters over a long period (e.g. management of a person&#8217;s day to day affairs relating to expenditure and/or their care and support plan) will often arise that will clearly outweigh the principles identified in s. 16(4).  In many such cases regular return to the COP would be unnecessarily time consuming, emotionally stressful and expensive and so contrary to P&#8217;s best interests.  I add that it seems to me that a refusal or reluctance based on s. 16(4), or a general approach, to appoint a deputy in welfare cases simply because they are welfare cases and s. 5 applies is not justified.</p>
