The mother cross-applied on 20 February 2020 for an order permitting her retrospectively to relocate B to Sierra Leone until the summer of 2022 to enable him to conclude his GCSEs at a school in Freetown. In addition, I am asked to make child arrangements orders regulating contact between the father and all three children. That last application was commenced as long ago as 2017 in the Family Court at Bromley and has been ordered to be heard at High Court judge level alongside the wardship application. </p>

At the time that the High Court proceedings were commenced by the father on 6 February 2020 B had become habitually resident in Sierra Leone. However, as his removal and retention were plainly wrongful, this court has jurisdiction over him pursuant to article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003. Moreover, by making her own application on 20 February 2020 the mother clearly accepted the jurisdiction of this court pursuant to article 12(3) of that regulation. </p>

They were married in 2005. As stated above, their children were born in 2006, 2010 and 2011. They separated in 2014. As mentioned, in 2017 private law proceedings were commenced by the mother seeking a child arrangements order and a non-molestation order. The mother alleged that the father had meted out to her domestic abuse and that therefore any contact should be supervised. The father refused to accept supervision of contact. A stand-off developed. As a result, the father has not seen any of the children for three years. A fact-finding hearing was ordered. This was held in November 2018. In a judgment dated 24 January 2019 District Judge Prevatt found the father guilty of domestic abuse, but not to the extent alleged by the mother. </p>

At that meeting it was acknowledged that B had said he wished to move to another school. In the bundle there is a record of numerous instances of unpleasant disruptive conduct by B covering 6&#189; pages from September 2017 to February 2019. These had led to a three-day exclusion in May 2018 and a five-day exclusion from 1 February 2019. </p>

The consequence was that he would have to complete his education at what is known as a PRU school (&#8220;pupil referral unit&#8221;) where children are placed who have been expelled from their schools or who have otherwise not been placed for mainstream education. Unsurprisingly the mother viewed this prospect with dismay and feared that B&#8217;s education would be irretrievably impaired. </p>

I also know that B was a member of a gang and I had become extremely concerned for his life had he remained in London due to the high level of knife crime in South London which is gang related.&#8221;  </p>

It is true, as Ms Chaudhry submitted, that it was surprising that this was not mentioned in her written evidence. However, although I am satisfied that the mother is generally an unreliable narrator in writing I am satisfied, in this respect, that she held authentic and well-based fears for her son&#8217;s welfare. </p>

Although B&#8217;s British passport had been impounded in the private law proceedings in Bromley, she managed to obtain a passport for him from the Sierra Leonean High Commission. She booked return flights for herself to leave on 7 July 2019. There is some controversy as to whether she took the younger two children with her. A recital to an order made in Bromley on 20 December 2019, where the mother was represented by counsel, says that she did. </p>

However, the mother is emphatic that she did not take the younger two children with her and that they were placed for the entire summer holiday with her niece and nephew. It is unnecessary for me to decide this issue, other than to observe that if the mother is now correct then the recital that was agreed on her behalf is another example of her unreliable narration. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.61in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;I have thought very long and hard about whether an order for return is in Q's best interests. I have concluded that it is in his best interest's overall to return but that still begs the question of whether an order is appropriate or not given his age. I have thought more than twice about what the right outcome and order should be in respect of Q. I have considered whether given his age I should decline the application for the order for return but rather to operate on the belief that he will return with V in any event as I believe that he wishes to remain with her and a large part of him wishes to return to Poland anyway. If I leave the choice to him I feel reasonably sure that he will come under significant pressure from his mother and her partner to remain and I do not consider that to be in his best interest. I conclude that there may be some merit in Miss Papazian's point that although he describes his contact with his father as being undertaken in order to comply with the court order that may in fact be a mask for an underlying and genuine desire to have a relationship with his father. I have also obviously considered whether in making an order for return it will set up struggle between the court system seeking to enforce the return and Q resisting. From all I have read and heard about Q I do not conclude that this is a likely outcome. I conclude that it is more likely that Q will cooperate in the process of return. In respect of Q I'm also satisfied that an order for his return should be made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding he is 17 and has expressed a desire to remain in the UK and not to return to Poland, I'm satisfied on a summary assessment of his welfare that a return is in his best interests notwithstanding his age and his expressed views. The summary welfare assessment comprises many elements and save in respect of his expressed views they point to his welfare being promoted by a return to Poland and the resumption of a full life there. I am fully alive to the unusual nature of making a return order in respect of a 17year-old who says he does not wish to return. However I am particularly alive to the issue of the impact that the chronic parental conflict is having on the ability of Q and V to truly understand their own positions and to be able to express views which are not tainted by the backdrop to their lives that the conflict has given. I consider that making an order in respect of Q may in fact free him from responsibility which would otherwise be placed on him to seek to remain in England in support of the mother's ongoing campaign to remedy what occurred in Poland in 2014.&#8221; </p>

Further, given that the 12-year-old was going anyway the decision of Q can easily be categorised as objectively unreasonable. I very much doubt that Williams J would have reached the same decision had he been concerned with the 17-year-old alone. </p>

In his principal witness statement, the father argued that the status of wardship was needed in order to secure the continued impounding of the children&#8217;s passports. This is not so. The Family Court unquestionably has the power to order the continuing impounding of the passports.  He also argued that the status of wardship was needed to obtain the assistance of the British High Commission in Freetown. Again, this is not so. Ms Chaudhry argued that the status of wardship might help in any enforcement litigation that might have to be taken in Sierra Leone, but the impressive single joint expert on Sierra Leonean law, Ms Amy Betts-Priddy, did not agree: it would make no difference to any proceedings that might have to be taken in the court in Freetown. </p>

There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where the private law proceedings in the Family Court can continue perfectly satisfactorily notwithstanding that the High Court is supplying additional powers to those available in the Family Court. </p>

In particular, the court should in every case consider any harm which the child and the parent with whom the child is living has suffered as a consequence of that domestic abuse, and any harm which the child and the parent with whom the child is living is at risk of suffering, if a child arrangements order is made. The court should make an order for contact only if it is satisfied that the physical and emotional safety of the child and the parent with whom the child is living can, as far as possible, be secured before during and after contact, and that the parent with whom the child is living will not be subjected to further domestic abuse by the other parent.&#8221; </p>

An order for supervised contact provides such safety. Contact between the father and his children gives effect to the right to family life to all participants and facilitates one of the two most vital relationships in a child&#8217;s life. However, unrestricted normal contact has to yield to safety measures where there have been findings of domestic abuse. That said, I just do not understand the logic underpinning the Cafcass officer&#8217;s recommendation. Findings of domestic abuse would only in the rarest of cases mean no contact all; what they mean is that careful safety measures need to be implemented, perhaps for a prolonged period, while analysis is undertaken of the feasibility of moving to unrestricted contact. The mother plainly recognised this when, on legal advice, she made her agreement as recorded in the order of 28 February 2020. </p>

I direct that it takes place by Zoom once each week for at least 40 minutes. Each session should be recorded. The mother will be at liberty to stop a session if the children are becoming distressed. The recording will reveal, if the mother does stop a session, whether she had justification to do so. This regime will continue until the contact centres reopen when direct supervised contact will take place fortnightly with each session lasting at least one hour. This will be in addition to the Zoom contact I have ordered. After four months of direct supervised contact, when at least eight sessions will have taken place, the matter is to be reviewed in the Family Court at Bromley to see how father&#8217;s relationship with his children can be taken further forward.

The purpose clearly is so that somebody in the position of Mr Chaudhry can see prominently and at once, the moment a lengthy order of this kind is given to him, what the gravity of the situation is and that he is at risk not merely being arrested at the time, but of being committed to prison as a punishment for contempt of court.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Yet, notwithstanding the simplicity of the scheme of the rules numerous paragraphs of each order on subsequent pages have endorsed next to them: <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;Penal notice attached&#8221;</span>. I have seen this in many other orders, and it is a seemingly ineradicable practice. What does it mean? Is this a different penal notice to the one on the front? Is it a reminder to the person served with the order in case they might already have forgotten what was on the front page? Is it therefore no more than a shorthand duplication? If so, why is it there? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I can see that something of this nature might be needed where a specific order of the court is needed to endorse a penal notice. That is the case for those orders made under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> referred to in FPR rule 37.9(3). But these were not such orders. There was no reason at all for these words to be endorsed next to the paragraphs in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is of the essence of any order that it should explain in clear English what the obligation of the person being served with the order is. The penal notice on the front could not be clearer. These additional words attached to certain paragraphs of the order only serve to confuse. They do not form part of the standard orders which are in force. In my judgment, it is time for this practice now to receive its quietus. </p>
