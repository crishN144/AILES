Compensation is not raised as relevant to the distribution. The evidence placed before me reflected this focus. I am asked to order a clean break by both parties.</span></p>

Distinctions can be taken as to situations of passive growth and the ultimate source of the resource which may have grown post-separation. In the case of income accrued after separation (and this might be by bonuses or conventional income or returns) consideration has been given as to whether there is a point which can be fixed after which income is judged to be no longer matrimonial in character. All cases of course turn on their facts. In one case a period of 12 months at least was said to be required before income became non-matrimonial. However, I have to caution myself against fixing an arbitrary point.</span></p>

They are a mix of residential, commercial, and agricultural land. At the heart of this dispute has been a disagreement as to: (a) the extent to which these properties are assets owned by the Respondent; (b) their respective values, and; (c) the extent to which they should be subject to any part of the ultimate distribution given the inherited nature of some of these. I will provide greater detail below. The Respondent&#8217;s aunt died in 2022 and left her estate to the Respondent. It is agreed this comprised a property in India (this is one of the nine properties above) and a sum of about &#163;60,000. The Respondent agrees he transferred the &#163;60,000 to his sister, along with &#163;15,000 of his own funds in 2023. He claims this was in pursuit of wishes expressed by his aunt.

My essential conclusion was that both parties have allowed their viewpoint to impact on the shaping of their evidence. To an extent this has caused their evidence to have elements of unreliability. But this is not a case in which their presentation of evidence fundamentally undermines the credibility of that evidence.</span></p>

		  <p class="ParaLevel1">The Applicant relies upon values derived from reports commissioned from single joint experts. The Respondent disputes these valuations generally and for a number of discrete reasons. I have reached the conclusion I should proceed on the basis of the valuations for the reasons set out below. I note this has less relevance with regard to some of the properties given my ultimate conclusions in such regard. My reasons are as follows:</p>

		    <num style="margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:-0.25in">1)</num>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.3in">The valuation process was set by the Court at the First Directions Appointment. A conventional approach was taken under which the Applicant supplied three valuers and the Respondent was to select from the same. This fell into disrepute and the Applicant was required to apply for the resolution of the dispute. At a hearing on 10 October 2023 the Court determined this issue approving the valuer appointed. The Respondent was present at the hearing. The decision was not appealed. The upshot was two identified valuers.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.3in">The Respondent complains the valuer is not geographically proximate to all properties, although he is close to some. I note this point but consider it has limited merit. It is clear the valuation process has a degree of formula within it and I can see no reason to believe the valuer was in any way hindered in his valuation due to the fact he was based over 100 miles from a given property. In any event these were issues for the hearing noted above.</p>

		    <num style="margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:-0.25in">3)</num>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.3in">The Respondent loosely throws around allegations of collusion and improper conduct on the behalf of the valuer. He (or his mother) has quite improperly placed pressure on the valuer to withdraw his valuation outside of the Court process. Such behaviour is regrettable and wholly outside good practice. I made the same clear at the hearing. It has not caused the valuer to act as sought. For the avoidance of doubt there is no evidence of such collusion or improper behaviour. The foundation for collusion was that the valuer is based in the same city from which the Applicant derives. This is the most tenuous of basis on which to allege collusion. I appreciate the Respondent disagrees with the valuation but that will often be the case and does not justify the actions of the Respondent. I will give permission for this part of my judgment to be shared with the valuers to allow them to defend the spurious claims brought against them in India.</p>

The difficulty with this approach is that it was the very fact of disagreement at the Form E / 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Appointment stage which led to the single expert direction. The Respondent reserves the right to challenge the valuation but I am not persuaded I should rely on the valuation previously adopted by the Respondent over that ordered independently.</p>

He references available resources which make this very clear. I accept this distinction which makes clear the &#8216;Circle Rate&#8217; is a baseline valuation and does not assist me.</p>

It is agreed there is a current litigation dispute arising out of the fact the developer has discontinued their involvement with the project (I do not need to detail the niceties of this dispute which is extraneous to this family and involves multiple investors in units within the developments). There is a difference of view between the parties as to the likelihood of this impasse being resolved. The Respondent considers the investment is lost and the value is therefore &#163;0. The Applicant is more optimistic and would rely on the valuation reports.</p>

It is not in dispute he co-owns 925 with his mother although I accept, he made no material contribution to the purchase. Allowing for a half share in 925 the global value reduces to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">&#163;104,793.</span></p>
		  <p class="ParaLevel1">The parties reached a sensible compromise in this regard under which the Respondent will transfer Noida to the Applicant subject to which the assets will not form part of the calculation. I congratulate them for this agreement which removes any requirement on my part to assess the risk associated with the project.

It further raises problematic issues as to the fact other interested parties are not intervenors in this case and have not put their own independent case before the Court. I appreciate in submissions the point was made that this established the general contributions of the Applicant into the marriage. However, this is a case in which it is clear to me the applicant made equal if different contributions and there is no need to establish this point in order to make this case good.</p>

This is a matter for the Applicant to prove and on balance I am not satisfied she has done so. In any event I am far from clear this materially impacts on the outcome.</p>
		  </blockContainer>
		  <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.3in">I am troubled by argument as the intestacy principles said to apply in India. I acknowledge elsewhere the Respondent accepts this to be the case (see below) but there is no documentary evidence to assist me as to the ownership rights with regard to this property at the date of the father&#8217;s decease (subject to point below). If at that time the property were in the joint name of the Respondent&#8217;s parents then these rules may not apply. However, there is evidence that the property was never transferred after the death of the grandmother. It seems she may remain the leasee on the documentation albeit the Respondent&#8217;s parents went on to occupy following her death. The issue I have with this possibility (which seems likely) is that on her death the interest would likely follow the same intestacy rules leading to the asset being shared between the Respondent&#8217;s father and his 7 siblings (as to 1/8 each). On his death his 1/8 would then be shared in 1/32 interests between his wife and children. If this is correct the Respondent&#8217;s interest would be <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">&#163;19,602</span>.

I also bear in mind the fact there is ongoing litigation in this regard. However, it is far from clear this will materially impact this interest given the length of time the land has been occupied by the family; the reality that this dispute involves a large number of &#8216;tenants&#8217; and the fact the current litigation seems to involve the railway seeking to recover the licence fees paid by the family from the federal State to which the monies were paid. If these funds are successfully recovered from the State, then it would appear the claim for eviction based on non-payment would fade away. If not recovered then it would seem the licence fees were in fact paid.</p>

In the light of the global assets in this case I am not willing to criticise the Respondent for supporting his sister in this manner. I reflect on the fact he has preserved very considerable savings at the same time which are available for distribution.

These have arisen in a period not very long after separation. I consider the date of separation in this case was in mid-2021. I accept the Applicant&#8217;s evidence that physical separation in the home was at first something which had occurred on a number of occasions and there remained prospects of full reconciliation. I accept matrimonial life did not end at that point. I accept it was in 2021 that the marriage finally ended. Viewed in this way this fund has accrued over a period of less than 3 years after separation. This was during a period when the Applicant continued to meet the principle needs of the children. No reference to these funds was made when child support was calculated. Finally in accepting a clean break the Applicant is in reality accepting the possibility (which cannot be discounted) of the Respondent continuing to work and earn at similar levels. In my judgment all of these factors taken together warrant the funds being brought into the assessment.</span></p>

Given this is a variable sum it is better to exclude this from payment scheme altogether and simply state it will be closed and the balance paid to each party in equal shares. I therefore deduct it from the global sum with the effect this further reduces the sum payable by half of the difference being &#163;3,042 as claimed by the Respondent. Instead the order will now provide for her to recover half of the balance which currently stands at this level.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Finally I deal with the Applicant&#8217;s indebtedness. The purpose of the order is to deduct this from the assets to be shared before the distribution takes place. Given the identified assets are to be shared equally (this is after the deductions otherwise set out within the order) the effect is for the deduction to be shared between the parties equally. This was my intention. I can see no arithmetic difference between deducting the full sum off before distribution (so each share 50%) and the Respondent paying a sum equal to half to the Applicant after distribution. Given this is the Applicant&#8217;s indebtedness she should have the full amount in order to settle the debt. I do not amend in this regard.</span></p>

It will be immediately noted this differs from the sum proposed by the Respondent by half the indebtedness of the Applicant which reinforces my point above. In addition the parties separately share the joint balance. I will make the amendment on the second lump sum tranche.</span></p>
