What Mr Borrett also did was to take me through the decision of Mr Justice Poole in Sunderland City Council v Macpherson [2023] EWCOP3 and refer me to paragraph 51. This set out that the basis of any penalty being proportionate, imprisonment not being the starting point, and not an automatic response. Roman numeral 4 of that paragraph emphasises proportionality, that is any sentence is to be proportionate to the seriousness of contempt, and where an  immediate sentence is ordered it should be as short as possible and bear some reasonable relationship to the maximum of 2 years.</span></p>

It was issued with a Penal Notice. It is clear as to what was ordered and what the consequences of breach could be. There are also the persistent &#8220;other&#8221; serious breaches of Court Orders which I have been addressed upon by Miss Haines.</span></p>

Factors which increase seriousness include that there is a protected vulnerable party who has been made a victim of Mr Adamou as of the 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of September, immediately after the first hearing on that date. The Court has been provided with a witness statement of the Manger of the Care Home where the protected party currently lives. The Court is told that Mr Adamou intimidated staff to allow him access to that place. They felt threatened by him. They told him he could not remove her from those premises as there was a Court Order forbidding him from doing so. He dared anyone in the place to stop him. He removed the protected party for about 90 minutes. Staff at the placement Mr Adamou had removed the protected party from called the Police.  The protected party was returned &#8220;not seeming herself&#8221;.  The witness statement of the care home manager reports that the protected party said, &#8220;her home is a mess&#8221;. Mr Adamou would appear to have taken her to &#8220;the Property&#8221;.  I am told that she was fine throughout night, but when she got up she was crying and very upset. She told a member of staff that her house smells, and &#8220;my palace is broken&#8221;, that she wanted to go home and Mr Adamou was living In her house.</span></p>

She has declining cognition, with her predominant wish being to return home. Solicitors for the parties, in accordance with their duties as officers of the Court have been candid and thorough in bringing the court up to date on the prospect of any return home. That is to say, it may well be that she may not be able to return home because of her financial position and the condition of property. The cost of works to the property to make it habitable for her may simply render any return financially unviable. But she cannot even get into her home for her to visit. Also, Mr Adamou has had works done to &#8220;the Property&#8221; the extent of which are unknown.</span></p>
