They have been very distressed by the FMA proceedings, regarding them as intrusive, insulting and unnecessary.  Nevertheless after some initial reluctance which persisted until the first Court of Protection hearing, they have engaged positively with care and support including intensive sex and marriage education, which has been helpful for KA.  In law it is now a criminal offence to force marriage on anyone, and the definition of forced marriage includes the making of arrangements to marry in respect of a boy/girl, man/woman who is unable to consent not because of duress but because of incapacity.</p>

A marriage performed with people who do lack capacity amounts to a gross intrusion of their personal autonomy and may lead to serious sexual offences being committed. </p>

I am satisfied that family members have not described the extent of his needs entirely accurately.  On all the evidence his ability to function outside the home is less than presented by them.  Nevertheless he has a number of valuable life skills.  He can read and write, although not at a sophisticated level, and understand simple documents, care for his cat, and help out in a relative&#8217;s local restaurant.  His verbal presentation although not at a sophisticated level is relatively good.</p>

She saw KA on five occasions, each lasting 30 &#8211; 45 minutes, between April and June 2015.  She also interviewed family members.  After her assessment Dr Alim concluded that KA lacked the capacity to have sexual relations and to marry.  It was asserted that she had applied too high a test. In consequence she was asked a number of questions, by letter.  She answered some of the questions but said that she would ideally need to see KA on two further occasions, it was not clear entirely why. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the PTR, before me, Dr Alim had not provided a further capacity report. She was in the process of leaving her post to go to another post elsewhere, with a holiday intervening.  The OS sought to instruct another expert.  I refused.  I had the earlier assessments and Dr Alim&#8217;s report and her answers to questions. Her factual and professional observations were of great assistance and I took the view that I was unlikely to need anything more.  I thought then and now am clear that she did overstate the test in respect of KA&#8217;s understanding of immigration considerations and the financial consequences of divorce but this does not undermine her opinion.  She is a doctor not a lawyer.   Assessment of capacity was for me.  KA&#8217;s parents did not want there to be another expert.  I decided to retain the final hearing myself and that no more paper investigation should be attempted, but that Dr Alim should be cross-examined, in the expectation that that would give the court sufficient information.  If it did not, KA might have to be seen again, and/or another expert instructed. </p>

He will struggle to manage his affairs most of the time, would need a good level of support, but has good cognitive skills.  His learning difficulties amount to an impairment and/or disturbance of mind and brain.  They are the cause of his functional inability to use, retain, understand and communicate. </p>

He was trying to find the words for illnesses but could not name one apart from AIDS, a word which he seemed to have learned by rote.  Dr Alim was satisfied that he understood that there was a health risk from sex, and was not just parroting it.  He &#8220;understood the link between illness and sex&#8221;.  She showed him photographs of male and female genitals with sores and lesions and he understood what she was showing him.  She said &#8220;he understands the health risk, but wouldn&#8217;t know how to protect himself from it, and couldn&#8217;t judge the different types of health risk&#8221;.  &#8220;He knew sex could make you ill&#8221;.  He understood the need for protection but &#8220;struggled to retain knowledge of how he could protect himself and his partner&#8221;.  Dr Alim is clear that KA understands &#8216;on a very rudimentary level&#8217; and is able to weigh up that the consequences of sex are or may be pregnancy and ill-health.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McKendrick submits that overall the case law is divergent on whether pregnancy needs to be considered at all.  However it is nowhere suggested in the case law that it need not be considered, save in the cases concerning persons of homosexual orientation, where it can be argued that it is not a necessary element to be considered since capacity in this context is act-specific.  I take the view that KA, a young man, needs to have an understanding, if not a sophisticated one, that pregnancy is a foreseeable consequence of heterosexual relations. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to decide whether pregnancy is a foreseeable consequence, and therefore needs to be understood, by other individuals, for instance by reason of sexual orientation, age, or particular physical characteristics. </p>

That approaches and applies the test in the wrong way.  Something is a foreseeable consequence if it will happen or may happen. </p>

The consideration of contraception in general, which must include specific methods, since these questions cannot be considered in the abstract, is far too detailed and complex to form part of the capacity test.</p>
