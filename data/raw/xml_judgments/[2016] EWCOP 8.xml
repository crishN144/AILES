		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The remit of our review extends to considering whether young people (not children aged 15 or younger) should fall within our proposed protective care scheme. This would enable deprivations of liberty to be authorised for such people, as well as provide oversight arrangements for their care and treatment. Arguably, the present law introduces unjustifiable inequalities amongst age groups, and potentially places young people at a distinct disadvantage compared to those over 18. The development of human rights law has contributed to the increasing recognition of the need to give greater weight to the views of young people. This is beginning to be reflected in law in relation to the admission of young people under the Mental Health Act. We provisionally consider that the deprivation of liberty of those aged 16 and 17 should come under our scheme. We do not consider that the alternative provisions, such as section 25 of the Children Act, provide an adequate basis for dealing with 16 and 17 year olds who satisfy the &#8220;acid test&#8221;.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is also a matter of concern that judicial confidence is being placed in the &#8220;zone of parental control&#8221; which remains a poorly understood and ill-defined concept. It is a concept introduced in the 2008 version of the Mental Health Act Code of Practice and was renamed the &#8220;scope of parental responsibility&#8221; in the current version. It is emphasised that whether a particular intervention can be undertaken on the basis of parental consent will need to be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, and practitioners will need to consider a range of factors. These include the age, maturity and understanding of the child or young person. The implication of the case law is that a young person who lacks capacity may be left without the protections guaranteed by article 5 as a result of this concept. We would welcome further views on the appropriateness of the concept of parental control in relation to young people, and evidence of how it is being used.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It should be observed at the outset that family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorize others to impose, various restrictions on the child&#8217;s liberty. Thus the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognized and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (art. 8). Indeed the exercise of parental rights constitutes a fundamental element of family life (see the R v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121-C, p. 117, para. 64).</p>

Having reflected further on the matter, we do not think it would be sensible to base recommendations on this isolated passage from the European Court. In practice, it would have no real effect on guardians, since guardianship would probably require to include an appropriate power (perhaps &#8216;to consent to residence in conditions which would otherwise amount to a deprivation of liberty&#8217;). Little would be gained by such a provision, and confusion would be likely. In the longer term, if models of supported decision-making become more established in the domestic laws of the Member States of the Council of Europe, it may be that the European Court of Human Rights will explore the extent, if any, to which the subjective element of deprivation of liberty (consent by the person) can fit with these other models, but that will take time to address and develop.&#8221;</p>

Obviously parents have a right and a responsibility to restrict the liberty of their children, not only for protective and corrective purposes, but also sometimes for a punitive purpose. So acting they only risk breaching a child&#8217;s article 5(1) rights if they exceed reasonable bounds. Equally parents may delegate that right and responsibility to others. Every parent who sends a child to a boarding school delegates to the head teacher and his staff. A local authority may even send a child to a school that provides 52-week boarding facilities. Then restrictions on liberty imposed by the school do not amount to a breach of the pupils rights under article 5(1) unless the school betrays its responsibilities to the family. </p>

The local authority had simply exercised parental responsibility for him in his own best interests. There was some interesting discussion about the way in which parents restrict the movements of their children from time to time by, for example, putting young children to bed when they would rather be up or &#8220;grounding&#8221; teenagers when they would prefer to be partying with their friends, or sending children to boarding schools, entrusting the schools with authority to restrict their movements. All this reflects the normal working of family life in which parents are responsible for bringing up, teaching, enlightening and disciplining their children as necessary and appropriate, and into whish the law and local authorities should only intervene when the parents&#8217; behaviour can fairly be stigmatised as cruel or abusive. </p>

Restriction or deprivation of liberty is not solely dependent on the reaction or acquiescence of the person whose liberty has been curtailed. Her or his contentment with the conditions in which she finds herself does not determine whether she is restricted in her liberty. Liberty means the state or condition of being free from external constraint. It is predominantly an objective state. It does not depend on one&#8217;s disposition to exploit one&#8217;s freedom.

A comparator for a young child is not a fully matured adult, or even a partly mature adolescent. While they were very young, therefore, MIG and MEG&#8217;s liberty was not restricted. It is because they can- and must &#8211; now be compared to children of their own age and relative maturity who are free from disability and who have access (whether they have recourse to that or not) to a range of freedoms which MIG and MEG cannot have resort to that MIG and MEG are deprived of liberty.&#8221; </p>

And as Baroness Hale DPSC has pointed out (in para 24 of her judgment) the court also said in para 119 that the right to liberty was too important to be lost simply because a person had given himself up to detention, especially where he is legally incapable of consenting to or disagreeing with it. &#8221;</p>

This, however, would leave an undesirable one (or two, if married) year gap during which public intervention to protect an incapacitated minor would only be available under the surviving inherent jurisdiction. One solution is to differentiate between the ages for public and private intervention under the new jurisdiction. The other is to have one age, namely <span style="font-size:13pt">16, </span>as the qualifying age for the new jurisdiction but accept some overlap between it and child law. The difficulty with this is the existing parental responsibility (and the courts' powers) to make at least some decisions <span style="font-size:13pt">on </span>behalf of at least some children up to the age of 18.7 Can it then be acceptable to have two jurisdictions applicable in the same case which may employ different definitions <span style="font-size:13.5pt">of </span>capacity, different procedures, and different principles of intervention?

We explained that a number of the statutory provisions in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> do not apply to those in the 16-18 age group, or only apply in &#8220;exceptional&#8221; <span style="font-size:13pt">circumstance. </span>For some purposes <span style="font-size:11pt">in </span>the health care field, patients aged 16 and 17 are treated as if they were of full age.&#8217; On a practical level, respondents confirmed that both statutory and voluntary sector service agencies tend to have special arrangements for those aged 16 and over, <span style="font-size:12.5pt">with </span>an emphasis on preparations for independent adult life, making suitable long-term provision if necessary. It is often not at all appropriate simply to continue to offer services designed to support younger children within their families. If continuing substitute decision-making arrangements are needed by someone aged 16 or 17 it may well be because that young person lacks mental capacity and not because he or she is under the age of legal majority. In cases where legal proceedings are required, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">so </span>that disputes can be resolved or legally effective arrangements made, it would be wasteful to require two sets of legal proceedings to be conducted within a short time period where <span style="font-size:11pt">it </span>is obvious that the problem which has to be resolved will not disappear when the person concerned reaches 18. Respondents, including those who specialise in work with young adults with mental disabilities, supported our proposal to bring those aged 16 and over who lack mental capacity within the new statutory scheme. Most agreed that the resultant overlap with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court would pose no great problems in practice.</p>

It owes them a clear and important duty of care. Were it not to do so it would be liable to be sued for negligence. But as a matter of principle the discharge of that duty of care is not going to give rise to a deprivation of liberty if the child&#8217;s parents can remove the child from the accommodation at any time under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20(8)</ref>. If the child&#8217;s parents decide not to remove him and the safeguarding of the child involves an actual confinement then it would be hard to say that the third element is satisfied, namely imputation to the State.

The principle has been subjected to certain age limits set by statute for certain purposes: and in some cases the courts have declared an age of discretion at which a child acquires before the age of majority the right to make his (or her) own decision.

Consequently, the Court cannot accept that the applicant validly consented either directly or indirectly to her hospitalisation or treatment. The prosecutor&#8217;s order of 27 September 2005 is not sufficient to persuade the Court to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

The court held, by a majority of nine to seven, that he had not been deprived of his liberty. The restrictions to which he was subject were &#8220;no more than the normal requirements for the care of a child of 12 years of age receiving treatment in hospital. The conditions . . . did not, in principle, differ from those obtaining in many hospital wards where children with physical disorders are treated&#8221; (para 72). Hence his hospitalisation &#8220;did not amount to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5, but was a responsible exercise by his mother of her custodial rights in the interest of the child&#8221; (para 73). The seven dissenting judges considered that placing a 12 year old boy who was not mentally ill in a psychiatric ward for several months against his will was indeed a deprivation of liberty. It would appear, therefore, that the case turns on the proper limits of parental authority in relation to a child. As already mentioned (para 4 above) there is no equivalent in English law to parental authority over a mentally incapacitated adult. In any event, the Strasbourg court was not deterred from finding a deprivation of liberty in the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Stanov</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">DD</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Kedzior </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Mihailovs </span>by the fact that the placements were arranged by the person who had been appointed legal guardian of the applicant.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Shtukaturov v Russia </span>54 EHRR 962, decided in 2008, the applicant had been placed in a psychiatric hospital at the request of his legal guardian, which in Russian law was regarded as a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; admission. Although he lacked the <span style="font-style:italic">de jure </span>legal capacity to decide for himself, this did not necessarily mean that he was <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>unable to understand his situation (para 108). Indeed, he had evinced his objections. The subjective element of lack of consent was made out (para 109). The court took the same view in <span style="font-style:italic">DD </span>(para 150) and in <span style="font-style:italic">Kedzior </span>(para 58). Thus it appeared to give some weight to the objections of a person who lacked legal capacity when deciding that the subjective element was made out despite the consent of the person&#8217;s legal guardian. But in <span style="font-style:italic">Mihailovs</span>, the court seems to have gone further. In relation to one of the care home placements, the court held that there was a deprivation of liberty, because although the applicant lacked legal capacity he subjectively perceived his compulsory admission there as such a deprivation (para 134). In relation to a later placement, however, he did not raise any objections or attempt to leave and the court concluded that he had &#8220;tacitly agreed&#8221; to stay there and thus had not been deprived of his liberty (paras 139, 140). In contrast, of course, in <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom</span>, the patient was deprived of his liberty in the hospital despite his apparent compliance.&#8221;</p>

But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities. If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage.&#8221;</p>

It is very easy to focus upon the positive features of these placements for all three of the appellants. The local authorities who are responsible for them have no doubt done the best they could to make their lives as happy and fulfilled, as well as safe, as they possibly could be. But the purpose of article 5 is to ensure that people are not deprived of their liberty without proper safeguards, safeguards which will secure that the legal justifications for the constraints which they are under are made out: in these cases, the law requires that they do indeed lack the capacity to decide for themselves where they should live and that the arrangements made for them are in their best interests. It is to set the cart before the horse to decide that because they do indeed lack capacity and the best possible arrangements have been made, they are not in need of those safeguards. If P, MIG and MEG were under the same constraints in the sort of institution in which Mr Stanev was confined, we would have no difficulty in deciding that they had been deprived of their liberty. In the end, it is the constraints that matter.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Because of the extreme vulnerability of people like P, MIG and MEG, I believe that we should err on the side of caution in deciding what constitutes a deprivation of liberty in their case. They need a periodic independent check on whether the arrangements made for them are in their best interests. Such checks need not be as elaborate as those currently provided for in the Court of Protection or in the Deprivation of Liberty safeguards (which could in due course be simplified and extended to placements outside hospitals and care homes). Nor should we regard the need for such checks as in any way stigmatising of them or of their carers. Rather, they are a recognition of their equal dignity and status as human beings like the rest of us.&#8221;</p>

A further important factor is the extent to which, if at all, a child or young person has the ability and capacity to make decisions for themselves; thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Trust A v X  </span>I observed at paragraph 57 that:</p>

Thus a decision to keep such a 15  year old boy under constant supervision and control would undoubtedly be considered an inappropriate exercise of parental responsibility and would probably amount to ill treatment. The decision to keep an autistic 15 year old boy who has erratic, challenging and potentially harmful behaviours under constant supervision and control is a quite different matter; to do otherwise would be neglectful. In such a case I consider the decision to keep this young person under constant supervision and control is the proper exercise of parental responsibility. &#8221;</p>

Where the State &#8211; here, a local authority &#8211; knows or ought to know that a vulnerable child or adult is subject to restrictions on their liberty by a private individual that arguably give rise to a deprivation of liberty, then its positive obligations under Art 5 will be triggered. </p>

What is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances will, of course, depend upon the context, but it might for example, Mr Bowen suggests, require the local authority to exercise its statutory powers and duties so as to provide support services for the carers that will enable inappropriate restrictions to be ended, or at least minimised; </p>

The circumstances of D&#8217;s confinement are necessary and in his welfare best interests but that does not prevent them amounting to a deprivation of liberty. Accordingly the local authority must make an application to the court to determine whether D is deprived of his liberty and if so, to obtain authorisation for its continuance; as I find it must do in all cases where 16 or 17 year old young people are objectively confined in satisfaction of Limb 1 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Storck</span> test and, of course, where Limb 2 is satisfied and either Limb 3 is satisfied because the local authority is directly responsible for the confinement or the local authority knows or ought to know of a private confinement and is under the positive obligation identified by Munby LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A and C</span>.</p>
