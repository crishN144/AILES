However, the judge, in a lengthy, detailed, well-considered and well-structured judgment explained her reasons for declining that order.  Instead, she made an order for indirect contact between A and the paternal family.  </span></p>

The father does not accept the information contained within the Cafcass safeguarding, nor does he accept His Honour Judge Mitchell&#8217;s related findings.&#8221;</span></p>

In February 2014 he was acquitted of another matter not related to allegations of violence.  In November 2014 no further action was taken following an allegation of sexual assault by a young woman.  Arising from the same incident, no action was taken on an allegation of battery which was also said to have involved an incident within his family, not involving the mother. </span></p>
