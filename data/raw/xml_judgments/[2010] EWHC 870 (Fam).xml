Since then there has been almost incessant litigation, both in the courts of Guernsey and in the English courts.

Despite the considerable assistance given to the Official Solicitor by various official agencies in Israel, and despite the various orders that I subsequently made, PM remained in Israel with HM and it was necessary to commence proceedings there.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 January 2010 the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors instructed lawyers in Israel to advise in relation to possible civil proceedings against PM in Israel. Their advice was contained in a &#8216;Legal Advice/Opinion&#8217; dated 27 January 2010. At the hearing on 5 February 2010 it became apparent (see below) that the Crown Prosecution Service was not proposing to commence criminal proceedings against PM with a view to seeking his extradition from Israel, so in accordance with that advice KH began proceedings in Israel on 14 February 2010. An ex parte order was made the same day in the Family Court by Judge Paul Stark for HM to be placed in KH&#8217;s care with the assistance of social services and the police. The order was successfully executed the following day. An inter partes hearing followed on 17 February 2010, directing a further hearing on 21 February 2010 and permitting PM to have supervised contact, but only if he handed over his passport. (KH was also required to surrender her and HM&#8217;s passports to prevent them leaving Israel in the meantime.) On 21 February 2010 the Judge appointed a guardian for HM and directed a further hearing on 17 and 23 March 2010. On 24 March 2010 Judge Stark gave judgment, granting KH&#8217;s application and directing that HM be returned to this country immediately. But he stayed his order until 29 March 2010 so as to give PM the opportunity to apply for a further stay from the District Court, to which PM had, as I understand it, an automatic right of appeal. On 29 March 2010 the District Court extended the stay until 7 April 2010. On the latter day the District Court made an order permitting KH to return with HM to this jurisdiction unless by 3pm the next day, 8 April 2010, the Supreme Court had made an order extending the stay. On 8 April 2010 the Supreme Court refused PM&#8217;s application for a further stay and on the same day KH and HM returned to this country. I do not know whether PM has yet returned to this country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has long been recognised that, quite apart from any statutory jurisdiction (for example under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/50" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 50</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>), the Family Division has an inherent jurisdiction to make orders directed to third parties who there is reason to believe may be able to provide information which may lead to the location of a missing child. Thus orders can be made against public authorities (for example, Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, the Benefits Agency, the DVLA, local authorities or local education authorities, etc, etc) requiring them to search their records with a view to informing the court whether they have any record of the child or the child&#8217;s parent or other carer. Similar orders can be directed to telephone and other IT service providers, to banks and other financial institutions, to airline and other travel service providers &#8211; the latter with a view to finding out whether the missing child has in fact left the jurisdiction and, if so, for what destination &#8211; and to relatives, friends and associates of the abducting parent. In appropriate cases, though this is usually confined to relatives, friends and associates, the court can require the attendance at court to give oral evidence of anyone who there is reason to believe may be able to provide relevant information. Compliance with such orders can, where appropriate, be enforced by endorsing the order with a penal notice and then, in the event of non-compliance, issuing a bench warrant for the arrest and compulsory production in court of the defaulter.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_37">
	  <num>37.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since, for obvious reasons, it is important that the abducting parent is neither alerted to the investigations being carried out by the court nor informed of the identities of those from whom information is being sought nor informed of their answers, such orders are almost invariably made, and oral evidence taken, at hearings held in private from which the abducting parent&#8217;s representatives are excluded and of which, typically, they will be wholly unaware, the applications being made ex parte and without notice. Moreover, and for the same reason, the orders themselves typically provide that they are not to be served on the abducting parent, just as they typically forbid those to whom the order is directed from informing the abducting parent of the existence of the order. Accordingly, and for reasons which in the nature of things are compelling, this small, discrete and necessarily discreet part of the Family Division&#8217;s jurisdiction is, in distinction to the vast bulk of the Division&#8217;s work, carried on not merely in private but typically in secret. The justification is that explained by Sir John Donaldson MR in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies ex p New Cross Building Society </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] QB 227" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] QB 227</ref> at 235, namely that unless it adopts this particular procedure in this particular type of case the court will be unable to achieve its paramount object of doing justice according to law; for abjuring secrecy in such circumstances is likely to lead, directly or indirectly, to a denial of justice and, not least, justice for the innocent child. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are three further aspects of this jurisdiction which it is convenient also to mention. First, that legal professional privilege is no answer to such an order: <span style="font-style:italic">Burton v Earl of Darnley </span>(1869) LR 8 Eq 576n, <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsbotham v Senior </span>(1869) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="LR 8 Eq 575" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">LR 8 Eq 575</ref>. Second, that the court&#8217;s powers in this kind of case &#8211; where it is seeking to locate a missing child &#8211; are <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>subject to the limiting principles of the <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>jurisdiction: see <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1974] AC 133" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1974">[1974] AC 133</ref>. Thus there is no need to establish that the person against whom disclosure is sought has, albeit innocently, been involved in the abducting parent&#8217;s wrongdoing. The jurisdiction can be exercised against someone who is not merely wholly innocent but also a &#8216;mere witness&#8217;. It is enough for the court to exercise jurisdiction that the person from whom information is being sought may have information (however acquired) which may lead to the location of the missing child. &#8220;Possibility&#8221; is enough; there need not be probability: <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsbotham v Senior </span>(1869) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="LR 8 Eq 575" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">LR 8 Eq 575</ref> (where the order was made to produce certain documents which, as Sir Richard Malins VC put it at page 578, &#8220;it was just possible (I did not think it all probable) &#8230; might lead to the discovery of &#8230; her residence, or where she is absconding with the wards.&#8221;). Third, that in aid of this jurisdiction the court can make a variety of orders directed to the Tipstaff, including, in addition to location, collection and passport orders, an order authorising the Tipstaff to enter private residential property, if need be using force to open doors, with a view to searching for, removing and taking into custody anything (for example, a computer or a mobile phone, blackberry or other similar device) which there is reason to believe may contain information throwing light on the missing child&#8217;s whereabouts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Ex Parte Orders) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 308</ref> at page 320.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other aspect of the matter which requires some elaboration relates to the court&#8217;s powers to seize or block an abducting parent&#8217;s (access to) funds. The court can make a freezing order to restrain the abducting parent&#8217;s recourse to his assets and, where the parent has acted in breach of the court&#8217;s order or breach of undertaking and is thus in contempt, the court can also make a sequestration order: see the decisions of Scott Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Richardson v Richardson </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] Fam 95" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] Fam 95</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mir v Mir </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] Fam 79" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] Fam 79</ref>. Moreover, the court has power to direct that the sequestered funds be used to fund litigation brought in a foreign court with a view to securing the return to this jurisdiction of the abducted child: see <span style="font-style:italic">Richardson v Richardson </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] Fam 95" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] Fam 95</ref> at 102-103. </p>

There is little, if any, practical difference between the types of orders that can be made in exercise of the two jurisdictions. The main difference is that the court cannot make an adult a ward of court. So the particular status which wardship automatically confers on a child who is a ward of court &#8211; for example, the fact that a ward of court cannot marry or leave the jurisdiction without the consent of the court &#8211; has no parallel in the case of the adult jurisdiction. In the absence of express orders, the attributes or incidents of wardship do not attach to an adult. But this apart, the court&#8217;s powers to make orders under the inherent jurisdiction in relation to adults would seem to be as wide as its powers when exercising its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction in relation to children. Just as there are, in theory, no limits to the court&#8217;s powers when exercising the wardship jurisdiction I suspect that there are, in theory, few if any limits to the court&#8217;s powers when exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to adults.&#8221;</p>

These orders were bitterly and repeatedly opposed by PM in a succession of emails, some sent to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors and some to me. Thus in an email dated 1 April 2010 PM complained that his &#8220;entire asset base&#8221; was being &#8220;depleted&#8221; in a manner which he said was &#8220;unlawful, unreasonable and beyond the wildest realms of natural justice.&#8221; To that my response was and is that:</p>

Those proceedings were, as I have already said, essential if there was to be any chance of securing HM&#8217;s repatriation. I was not prepared to tolerate the possibility of KH&#8217;s lack of resources &#8211; and she was being reduced to trying to borrow from friends and relatives &#8211; proving either an obstacle or even an occasion for delay. The essential need was to get the proceedings under way and to ensure appropriate funding both for KH, as the applicant, and for HM&#8217;s court appointed guardian.</p>

My reasons for doing so were simple. It was evident that, despite having received no payments from this source since then, PM had nonetheless managed to cope financially in terms of his day to day living expenses. His emails did not suggest the contrary, though he did complain that he had been unable to pay his mortgage for 5 months. Nor was there any suggestion that he needed the arrears, for example, to repay others who had lent him money for the purpose. So, on the face of it, payment of the arrears would simply have put PM in control of a capital sum of &#163;3,500 &#8211; the sum as he had calculated it &#8211; for which there was, so far as I was aware, no need. Moreover, the payment of such a sum to him would have been quite inconsistent with the court&#8217;s wider purpose as I described it in paragraph [33] above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first and most obvious example is the freezing order, last extended on 16 March 2010 and due to expire on 14 April 2010. The Official Solicitor appropriately did not seek any further extension of the order in its previous all-embracing terms but indicated, in a letter from his solicitors dated 14 April 2010, that he had it in mind to make an application for HM&#8217;s costs against PM. (I note that HM has public funding in these proceedings.) He accordingly invited me to extend the freezing order but limited in scope to the funds held by X. KH plainly did not require any similar protection in relation to any application for costs she might wish to make, given that, as I have already described, those costs have in fact been paid as matters proceeded. And I assumed (correctly, as I was subsequently informed) that the States of Guernsey, whatever its stance in relation to costs might be, did not seek any protective relief. Accordingly, on 14 April 2010 I made an order extending the freezing order, but only to this limited extent, the order being expressed to expire on 14 May 2010. I make clear that this is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> because I have formed any view as to the merits or otherwise of any application in relation to costs that the Official Solicitor may make. But the Official Solicitor is, in the circumstances, and not least given all the evidence I have heard and in the light of PM&#8217;s own actions and expressed attitude towards the court, entitled to be protected against what I am satisfied is the very real risk that, unless injuncted in this way, PM would seek to put his assets beyond the reach of the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time when I made that order, and indeed at the time when I sent this judgment to the parties in draft on 20 April 2010, I had not considered the independently continuing effect of the order I had made following the hearing on 17 December 2009 in relation to the funds held by DP; the effect of that order is to require the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors to deal with those funds only in accordance with the directions of the court. Having made an order on 14 April 2010 in the terms referred to above, and believing that most of his assets were accordingly now unfrozen, there seemed to me to be no need to make the order sought by PM in emails he sent me on 19 and 20 April 2010 asking for immediate payment of the sum of &#163;15,000 to solicitors. Following receipt of the draft judgment, PM brought to my attention the order relating to the funds held by DP and the fact, as he asserted, that his only liquid funds are the funds held by X (blocked by the order I made on 14 April 2010) and the funds previously held by DP (blocked by the order I made in December 2009). The reality therefore, he says, is that all his liquid funds are blocked, so the assumption upon which I had declined to make the order he sought was erroneous. I raised the matter with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors, who in a letter dated 29 April 2010 made it clear that the amounts they are seeking from PM by way of costs exceed the aggregate of the two remaining blocked funds &#8211; and that is quite apart from various claims that I understand KH and the States of Guernsey are considering making against PM. Therefore, although the assumption upon which I previously decided not to make the order sought by PM turns out to be wrong, I am not, in the circumstances as they are now presented to me, prepared to make the order he seeks here and now, absent unqualified agreement by the Official Solicitor, KH and the States of Guernsey which is not yet forthcoming. The matter can be further considered at an inter partes hearing at which all the interested parties can express their views as to what should happen to the two blocked funds. PM can of course renew his application, or make whatever other application he wishes in relation to the blocked funds.</p>

The problem here is that central to the offence as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1968/60/section/21/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21(1)</ref> is the requirement that the unwarranted demand with menaces must be &#8220;with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another&#8221; as those expressions are defined in section 34(2)(a), namely &#8220;as extending only to gain or loss in money or other property.&#8221; So, as it is put in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith and Hogan </span>at para 25.1.4, the offence is concerned only with invasions of economic interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 November 2009, and clothed with the authority of the order I had made on 2 November 2009, the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors contacted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with a view to ascertaining whether the CPS might be willing to commence criminal proceedings against PM for kidnapping HM. The CPS responded promptly and helpfully on 12 November 2009, giving as its preliminary view that there were &#8220;significant difficulties&#8221; in seeking to extradite PM on a charge of kidnapping because of its &#8220;grave reservations&#8221; as to how the Crown could prove the necessary ingredient of &#8216;force or fraud&#8217;. On 13 November 2009 the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors invited the CPS to consider whether there would be any prospect of convicting PM of the offence of hostage-taking under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/28" uk:canonical="1982 c. 28" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Taking of Hostages Act 1982</ref>. On 17 December 2009 the CPS indicated that it was &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; that it was going to be able to charge PM with blackmail, a view reiterated on 26 January 2010 when it said that there was an &#8220;arguable&#8221; case of blackmail, though &#8220;not a great case&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, on 5 February 2010 the CPS sent the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors an email indicating that, although &#8220;there is an arguable case of blackmail based on [PM&#8217;s] threat that unless the parties agreed to his demands, one of which related to financial arrangements, he would not return [HM] to this country&#8221;, a prosecution would be &#8220;difficult&#8221; because &#8220;the precise position of the parties in relation to the cost of [HM&#8217;s] care seems far from clear&#8221; and because of the fact that &#8220;the demand was copied to a Lord Justice of Appeal (which someone pursuing a course of criminal conduct would not normally do).&#8221; The email continued by saying that because it now seemed that civil proceedings could be taken in Israel and, indeed, would be taken even if PM were to be arrested on an extradition warrant, the CPS did not propose to commence criminal proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one final matter I should mention which, it might be thought, also calls for consideration by the appropriate authorities. The case initially came before me whilst I was still a puisne judge of the Family Division, an office which I vacated on 12 October 2009 upon my appointment as a Lord Justice of Appeal. I was, nonetheless, able to continue to deal with the case thereafter, as in the circumstances I was persuaded was appropriate if permissible, by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> (formerly the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supreme Court Act 1981</ref>), a provision which enables a judge of the Court of Appeal to &#8220;act as&#8221; a judge of the High Court. That was because the proceedings in the present case had been commenced and remained in the Family Division of the High Court, the jurisdiction invoked being, as I have indicated, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As will be appreciated, however, the proceedings might have been in the Court of Protection, the jurisdiction invoked being that under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. In that event, I would <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>have been able to deal with the matter after 12 October 2009. The Court of Protection is not part of the High Court, being, as provided by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/45/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 45(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, itself a superior court of record. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 46(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> provides that the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection is exercisable by &#8220;nominated&#8221; judges and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/46/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(2)</ref> provides, so far as material for present purposes, that to be nominated a judge &#8220;must be &#8230; a puisne judge of the High Court&#8221;. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 9(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref> has no application to the Court of Protection, because although it authorises a judge of the Court of Appeal to &#8220;act as&#8221; a Judge of the High Court, he is not, even when so acting, &#8220;a puisne judge of the High Court&#8221;. So far as I am aware, there is no equivalent to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(1)</ref> either in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> or anywhere else. </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The same point arises in relation to a retired High Court judge, who may &#8220;act as&#8221; a judge of the High Court by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(1)</ref> and exercise the inherent jurisdiction but who is likewise not able to act as a judge of the Court of Protection.</p>
