	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on costs, given in circumstances where the substantive dispute between the parties has been compromised by the giving of cross non-molestation undertakings which will expire on 20 May 2014.  Had the matter not been compromised, in conformity with the movement towards much greater transparency in family proceedings, I believe I would have given my judgment in open court on a non-anonymised basis.  However, in circumstances where the parties have wisely compromised the main dispute, I consider that it is in such circumstances appropriate that any report of this judgment should be anonymised.</p>

That order was made under Part IV of the Family&#160;Law Act 1996.  The jurisdictional basis for the application was that the parties were, in the words of sections 42 and 62, &#8220;associated persons&#8221; in that they are, in the words of section 62(3)(ea), people who have had &#8220;an intimate personal relationship with each other&#8230; of significant duration&#8221;.  </p>

I am troubled by these matters in particular.  First, accepting as I do that it was just and convenient to make an order without notice to the respondent, section 45(3) of the Family Law Act 1996 nevertheless requires the court to afford the respondent the opportunity to make representations relating to the order &#8216;as soon as just and convenient at a full hearing&#8217;.  It is disappointing to note that the half-hour appointment for that further hearing could not be fixed earlier than seven weeks after the matter first came before the court.  An important order with a power of arrest ordinarily deserves &#8211; indeed demands &#8211; earlier reconsideration than that, and I am surprised that the matter was not brought back to the court within no more than 14&#160;days.  If it could not be effective within that time (if, for example, the respondent had not had [the] opportunity to obtain proper legal representation) the matter might need to be adjourned again.  But to leave things in the air for seven weeks without notice to a respondent that he had the right to apply to vary or discharge the order seems to me to be wrong.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[6] The second concern is the fact that whereas the court is given the discretion to direct that the power of arrest may be attached to an order made without notice, and/or that the power of arrest may have effect for a shorter period than the initial order, those matters may not have been fully borne in mind by the district judge.  Given the ease with which a power of arrest may be invoked by an applicant, the court should normally be wary about making an order of this kind for longer than is necessary to give the applicant adequate and necessary protection, but also to give the respondent the opportunity to be heard to oppose it.  In this case, the order for the injunction and the effectiveness of the power of arrest were directed to endure for the whole year.  The application was, however, ordered to be returned to the court within the seven-week period.  A better practice, in my judgment, would be to limit the time for the injunction and the power of arrest so that they remained effective for no [more] than the conclusion of the return hearing.  Those dates ought ordinarily to coincide.&#8221;</p>

In my capacity as the head of the team drafting the body of standard orders for promulgation after the Family Court comes into being on 22&#160;April 2014, I have been provided with a comment made by His&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;Million on 25 November 2013 on the proposed new non-molestation order.  He has agreed that I may incorporate his comments into this judgment.  He said this:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Experience shows that respondents commonly do not attend on the return date.  As a result, the applicant (who has been abused by the respondent) then has to endure the inconvenience of attending at court twice to obtain the injunction, whereas the (abuser) respondent has to do nothing.  Also, the respondent has to be served with two&#160;orders, not just one.  This is expensive and time consuming and the two hearings are a waste of judicial resources.  Many courts have therefore developed the practice of making an initial order for, say, 12 months but with the respondent being able to ask for a hearing to vary or revoke the order.  The Court of Appeal has said that this is permissible.  </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;However, if the respondent has to apply to obtain a hearing, he or she may have to pay a fee whereas if a simple return date had been set, no fee would have been payable because the review date would have been automatic.  To avoid this potential financial prejudice, the order should contain a paragraph which merely requires the respondent to &#8216;request&#8217; (not &#8216;apply for&#8217;) a hearing to vary or revoke.  Experience in routine county court cases shows this method to be simple, effective and efficient.  People may write a letter with a request or sometimes just come to the court counter and ask for a hearing.&#8221;</p>

I do recognise that there is strong tension here between the allocation and use of the court&#8217;s most valuable resource, which is time, and the principle that justice should be fully afforded to a respondent against whom an <span style="font-style:italic">ex&#160;parte</span> order has been made.  With all due respect, I have to say that the practice referred to by Judge Million does not conform with the statutory provision, namely section&#160;45(3), or with the authority of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Horgan</span>, to which I have referred.  It seems to me that, here, there is a danger of a practice having arisen which sacrifices principle on the altar of expediency.  </p>

Mr&#160;Chamberlayne QC suggested that there should be a practice which met the concerns which provided as follows: namely, that the return date should be listed, say, 14 days after the initial <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> order had been made but that the respondent ought to confirm in writing, seven days before the return date, both to the applicant and to the court, whether he in fact wished to attend on the return date and to argue for variation or discharge of the order; and that if the respondent failed to write to the court within that period, it would be open to the applicant to notify the court that the return date should be vacated and to invite the court to extend the injunction as a matter of box work.  That proposal seems to me to meet and fairly balance the competing considerations.  Were that procedure to be adopted, the present practice of saving court resources would be preserved but at the same time a respondent who wished to have a full hearing &#8211; to which section 45(3) entitles him &#8211; would be able to have one.  </p>
