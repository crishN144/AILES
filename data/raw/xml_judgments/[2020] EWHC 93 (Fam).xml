The families of both MM and NA are of Somali origin.  MM is a Dutch national who was born in Holland and has lived in the United Kingdom since 2001. He works at a local hospital.  NA was born and raised in Somaliland and was living there prior to her marriage.  The couple met in Somaliland in 2012 when MM was visiting and, after a period of courtship, they agreed to marry.  On 7 March 2013 MM and NA attended a religious ceremony of marriage in Hargeisa.   Later that day they held what they have referred to as a &#8220;marriage wedding&#8221; which was attended by many family and friends.  Some ten days later they attended the local district court in Hargeisa where their marriage was validated and a formal marriage certificate issued.  They have lived together as husband and wife ever since and, on 20 January 2016, NA gave birth to their daughter who is now 4 years old. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Theirs is a very happy and settled relationship.  They regard themselves as husband and wife.  However, as a result of the need to complete various forms, an issue arose as to whether their marriage was entitled to formal recognition in this jurisdiction.  Whilst they were both happy to undergo a further civil ceremony of marriage in a local register office, this option was not open to them as the registrar took the view that they may already be married to one another<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The Home Office was prepared to issue an EEA Family Permit Visa on the basis that she was MM&#8217;s partner as opposed to his spouse. </p>

Whilst NA is the respondent to these proceedings, there is no issue between these parties.  They simply wish to secure declaratory relief for the purposes of clarifying their marital status in this jurisdiction where they have settled and made their family home.  Because the case raises issues which may be relevant to the wider Somali diaspora living in England &amp; Wales, this judgment will be published on an open (albeit anonymised) basis. </p>

He has appointed Mr Nagpal and Mr Habteslasie as Advocates to the Court and has undertaken the instruction of the single joint expert, Mr Guleid Jama, who has provided the court with his expert opinion on matters arising in relation to family law and practice in Somaliland.  Mr Nagpal and Mr Habteslasie have undertaken a significant amount of legal research for the purposes of their presentation to the court, a task which, with all their respective skills and abilities, these litigants in person could not have completed.  Mr Nagpal appeared alone to present the legal argument at the hearing.  Not only was his advocacy of great assistance to me; he presented a complex legal landscape in terms which MM and NA could follow and understand as their case was explored through a great deal of past legal authority emanating not only from English jurisprudence but also from international law.  I am most grateful to him for that endeavour, as I am to Mr Habteslasie. </p>

The question may often be whether the parties complied with the proper formalities for the celebration of the marriage, or whether each was able to marry because of age or a close family connection to one another. The rules about whether or not a marriage is valid fall to be considered in two different ways.  There are rules which concern <span style="font-style:italic">formal </span>validity and others which concern <span style="font-style:italic">essential </span>validity, or a party&#8217;s personal capacity to marry.  The former concern the manner in which a ceremony of marriage is undertaken (for example, ensuring the marriage itself is public and proof that it has taken place in accordance with local requirements).  The latter relates to whether or not the marriage can take place at all between the two individuals concerned.  Under English law formal validity is regulated by the domestic law of the country where the marriage is celebrated.  This is often referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci celebrationis</span>.  Essential validity, or capacity, has to be considered in the light of the domiciliary laws of the individual parties at the time of the marriage: see Rule 73 of <span style="font-style:italic">The Conflicts of Laws</span>, Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins (15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition) (<span style="font-style:italic">Dicey</span>). </p>

MM&#8217;s family travelled to Hargeisa in Somaliland some three weeks before the wedding.  The religious marriage ceremony was performed on 7 March 2013 followed by a &#8220;marriage wedding&#8221; on the same night attended and witnessed by his mother and sister (both nationals of the Netherlands), close family and friends.  The marriage was governed by Islamic law and the formalities were undertaken by a local religious leader who had given public notice of his intention to conduct the marriage some four days earlier.

They were asked to bring with them two witnesses who had to be citizens of Somaliland.  Two of NA&#8217;s cousins were chosen to fulfil this role.  Having formally sworn on the Quran that the marriage had taken place and was valid in terms of local requirements, the parties were issued with a formal marriage certificate, a copy of which has been filed with the court and sent to the single joint expert, Mr Jama.  It is a formal document which bears the seal of the Hargeisa District Court which records the details of the parties, their witnesses and the fact that the law regulating the marriage is Sharia law.  It has been signed by a judge who is identified on the face of the certificate.  It is accompanied by a declaration of authenticity and formal registration from the Director General of the Ministry of Justice and Judicial Affairs, counter-signed by the Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp; International Cooperation.  On 3 March 2015 the Imam who performed the marriage ceremony on 7 March 2013 attested before a public notary that he was the individual celebrant who had married this couple. </p>

Mr Jama has an array of impressive legal credentials. I am entirely satisfied that he is qualified to assist the court in relation to these matters in his capacity as an expert witness.  As he explains, Somaliland was a British Protectorate before it gained independence on 26 June 1960.  It swiftly entered into a union with the Italian colony of Somalia which achieved independence the following month in 1960.  The central government of Somalia collapsed in 1991 after a protracted civil war.  In that same year, Somaliland declared the restoration of independence from Somalia.  As yet, it has not been recognised by the United Kingdom as a State and the UK government has not entered into any formal treaties with Somaliland or the government of Somaliland.   </p>

As such he has responsibility for policy issues relating to Somaliland.  Despite the absence of formal recognition as a State in its own right, Mr Gould has confirmed that the United Kingdom has regular political contact with the government of Somaliland and has entered into signed memoranda of understanding with it.  As a result, the United Kingdom government has channels of engagement with the Somaliland judicial system in matters such as technical assistance and counter-terrorism.  Mr Gould concludes his written evidence in this way: </p>

Nor is it likely that the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office would object to the recognition of a Somaliland marriage in a UK civil law case on the basis that the United Kingdom does not recognise Somaliland as a State.&#8221; </p>

In 2001, a constitution was approved by the public in a referendum.  Article 130(5) of the Constitution allows the application of laws that predate the declaration of Somaliland as long as these laws do not infringe fundamental freedoms and human rights and Sharia Law.  Since the approval of the constitution, many laws were enacted by the Somaliland Parliament.  But many more, including the Somali Civil Code and the Somali Penal Code, are still applicable in Somaliland. </p>

The decision of the elders becomes the law of the parties similar to the precedence in the common law system.  If the same facts emerge between the same parties or members of the communities of the two parties involved in the earlier decisions, the latter judgment agrees with the previous verdict.  It is such precedence [through which] the Somali customary law grows.  Customary law is not written.  It is oral and kept in the memory of the community members. </p>

The order and importance of sources are a controversial matter in the different schools of thought in Sunni Islam.  But the Quran and the Sunna are seen as primary sources.  Sunna is narrations (Hadith) recounted from the Prophet by his companions. Hadith remained unwritten in the early stages of Islam. It also includes actions made by the Prophet as narrated by his companions.&#8221; </p>

In personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance, Sharia law is used to determine disputes.  In accordance with the Judiciary Organization Act (No 24/2003), the local district courts exercise jurisdiction in relation to matters of personal law.  District and regional courts are courts of first instance, and appeal lies to the regional appeal court located in the area where the lower court of first instance is situated.  Because of the absence of any recognised family law system, the requirements in relation to the formation of marriage are based on the religious beliefs of the two parties to a marriage.  Under Islamic (Sharia) law, marriage is a contractual agreement which makes the status of marriage binding on both contracting parties.  Most marriages in Somaliland are administered by religious leaders who conduct the marriage ceremony in the presence of family members, friends and clan elders.  The formalities can also be administered by a judge and it is not uncommon for the wedding celebration to take place after the marriage has been concluded.  There are formalities which must be complied with before a marriage will be considered binding.  Both parties must consent; there must be at least two witnesses; and consent must be obtained from the custodian (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">wali&#8217;</span>) of the bride.  </p>

For present purposes it is enough to say that the appellants had invited the House of Lords to refuse recognition to various decrees made by the German Democratic Republic (&#8216;the GDR&#8217;).  The British Government had certified through the (then) Foreign Secretary that it did not recognise the GDR as a state and that the USSR remained the <span style="font-style:italic">de jure </span>sovereign of the territory.

Because it was impossible for any <span style="font-style:italic">de jure </span>sovereign governing authority to disclaim responsibility for acts done by subordinate bodies which it has set up and which have not attempted to usurp its sovereignty, the courts in England could not treat as nullities acts done by or on behalf of the GDR. </p>

As Locke said: &#8220;A government without laws is, I suppose, a mystery in politics, inconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with human society&#8221;, and this must be true of a society &#8211; such as we know to exist in East Germany.  In the United States some glimmerings can be found of the idea that non-recognition cannot be pressed to its ultimate logical limit, and that where private rights, or acts of everyday occurrence, or perfunctory acts of administration are concerned (the scope of these exceptions has never been precisely defined) the courts may, in the interests of justice and common sense, where no consideration of public policy to the contrary has to prevail, give recognition to the actual facts or realities found to exist in the territory in question.  These ideas began to take shape on the termination of the Civil War (see <span style="font-style:italic">US v Insurance Companies </span>89 U.S. 99) and have been developed and reformulated, admittedly as no more than dicta, but dicta by judges of high authority, in later cases. &#8230;. No trace of any such doctrine is yet to be found in English law, but equally, in my opinion, there is nothing in those English decisions, in which recognition has been refused to particular acts of non-recognised governments, which would prevent its acceptance or which prescribes the absolute and total invalidity of all laws and acts flowing from unrecognised governments.  In view of the conclusion I have reached on the effect to be attributed to non-recognition in this case, it is not necessary here to resort to this doctrine but, for my part, I should wish to regard it as an open question, in English law, in any future case whether and to what extent it can be invoked.&#8221; </p>

In that case, two companies registered under the law of the Republic of Cyprus which owned hotels in Kyrenia issued proceedings in London when their hotels were occupied by troops from Turkey three years after they invaded the north of the island in 1974.  They claimed damages and an injunction to restrain the defendants (which included a London representative of the &#8220;Turkish Federated State of Cyprus&#8221;) from encouraging or assisting trespass to the hotels by circulating brochures and inviting tourists to book holidays in the hotels.  The British Government issued a certificate which stated that it did not recognise the administration established under the name &#8220;Turkish Federated State of Cyprus&#8221;.  The court admitted evidence which asserted that in that part of Cyprus which was under effective Turkish Cypriot control there was in operation a system of law under which the acts in relation to possession and use of the plaintiffs&#8217; hotels were lawful and thus not actionable in the English courts.   An injunction was granted at first instance but set aside on appeal by Roskill and Scarman LJJ and Lord Denning MR.   The Court of Appeal agreed that the claim could not proceed because of the principle that the English courts did not have jurisdiction to entertain an action for relief against trespass to immovable property situate outside the jurisdiction.

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Dogmatically the international problem is quite different from that so elegantly and liberally solved by the Supreme Court of the United States in a series of decisions which are one of the Court&#8217;s finest contributions.  As their reasoning makes clear, the basic fact was that the States continued in existence, though, through unrecognised governments, they denied their adherence to the Union.  In the international situation now under discussion there does not exist a State and the international community in general and Britain in particular does not wish the existing organism to exercise any internationally effective action; this is the very essence of non-recognition.  If one allows to the unrecognised State an undefined but strictly limited right of internationally effective legal activity, this runs counter to the policy of non-recognition, which, after all, merely means that marriages and divorces, for example, which take place during the period of nonrecognition will have retroactive international effectiveness only after recognition.  Moreover regard must be had to the attitude which the lawful, still recognised sovereign is likely to take.  Will he not legitimately take offence at the limited recognition which the application of the doctrine of necessity implies, when it is allowed to prevail during a period of non-recognition (as opposed to the period after the elimination of the problem, as in the United States)?  In answering this question English courts should not forget that they cannot very well require the lawful sovereign of a foreign country to accept concessions which the English sovereign himself is not prepared to make within his own realm.  This is not a field in which there is room for a double standard.  To remain consistent English courts should, in regard to unrecognised States, reject the doctrine of necessity both for their own constitutional law as well as internationally.  Hardship suffered by an individual is unlikely to occur very often and will only be temporary.&#8221; </p>

The legal basis for such recognition afforded to this and all decrees of divorce granted in that Republic was that the Republic of Cyprus was one country with two territories, each with its own system of law within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">That Act</ref> expressly recognised both countries under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(1)</ref> and territories under section 49(1).

In my judgment the fact that I am here dealing with a marriage as opposed to a divorce makes little substantive difference to that foundation.  If an English court in appropriate circumstances is entitled to recognise as valid the legal steps taken in a foreign court of an unrecognised State to dissolve a marriage, it must follow that it has a similar entitlement to recognise as valid the legal steps taken to create a valid marriage. </p>

The Governor declared the Declaration to be unconstitutional.  The Prime Minister and his colleagues disregarded their dismissal from office and adopted a new Constitution. The central issue in the case was the lawfulness or otherwise of the Emergency Powers Regulations made by the selfdeclared government of Southern Rhodesia including the detention without trial of several individuals by the acting Minister of Justice in the rebel regime including one, Mr Madzimbamuto.

The argument is that, when a usurper is in control of a territory, loyal subjects of the lawful Sovereign who reside in that territory should recognise, obey and give effects to the commands of the usurper in so far as that is necessary in order to preserve law and order and the fabric of civilised society.  Under pressure of necessity the lawful Sovereign and his forces may be justified in taking action which infringes the ordinary rights of his subjects but that is a different matter.  Here in question is whether or how far Her Majesty&#8217;s subjects and in particular Her Majesty&#8217;s judges in Southern Rhodesia are entitled to recognise or give effect to laws or executive acts or decisions made by the unlawful regime at present in control of Southern Rhodesia. </p>

Those authorities must be used with caution by reason of the very different constitutional position in the United States.  It was held that during the rebellion the seceding states continued to exist as states, but that, by reason of their having adhered to the Confederacy, members of their executives and legislatures had ceased to have any legislative authority.  But they had continued to make laws and carry out executive functions and the inhabitants of those states could not avoid carrying on their ordinary activities on the footing that these laws and executive acts were valid.  So after the end of the war a wide variety of questions arose as to the legal effect of transactions arising out of that state of affairs.&#8221; </p>

He found it unnecessary to answer that question because, even if such a principle was engaged, it could not override the legal right of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate in relation to territory which remained lawfully under the sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament.  Since Parliament had specifically passed the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1965/76" uk:canonical="1965 c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Southern Rhodesia Act 1965</ref> and had thereby authorised the Southern Rhodesia (Constitution) Order in Council the same year, there could not be said to be a legal vacuum in Southern Rhodesia.  The clear and unequivocal effect of the Order in Council was that no laws could be made by the legislative body set up following the Declaration of Independence and the United Kingdom Parliament retained exclusive power to legislate for Rhodesia and had removed from Rhodesia the power to legislate for itself. </p>

The President was also persuaded that the majority view was correct because of the manner in which the court was able to distinguish the line of authority concerning the doctrine of necessity emanating from the United States after the Civil War.  In particular, his Lordship emphasised that the decisions in that line of cases (where the doctrine of necessity was accepted) were concerned with the legal effect upon the civil rights and claims of individual citizens after the civil war of acts done during it.  None of them involved cases where courts were called upon, during the rebellion, to rule on the legality of the governments of the rebellious states.  By contrast, in <span style="font-style:italic">Madzimbamuto&#8217;s </span>case, the Parliament of the United Kingdom had passed primary and secondary legislation in 1965 to make specific provision as to what could and could not be undertaken as a legal and/or executive act.

He invokes the doctrine of recognition of the de facto, and the doctrine of implied mandate or necessity.  I agree with much of the thinking that lies behind his judgment.  I do think that in an appropriate case our courts will recognise the validity of judicial acts, even though they be the acts of a judge not lawfully appointed or derive their authority from an unlawful government.  But it is a fallacy to conclude that, because in certain circumstances our courts would recognise as valid the judicial acts of an unlawful court or a de facto judge, therefore the court thus recognised is a British court.  In my judgment these doctrines do not solve the question raised by this appeal.&#8221;  (page 70F to H) </p>

It has simply withheld formal recognition as an independent State to this self-declared territory in the Horn of Africa.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, there is a wealth of authority from the highest courts in this jurisdiction confirming the existence of an exception to the non-recognition principle in the case of private and family rights.  Over fifty years ago, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Reid confirmed its existence as an exception to the general rule in the <span style="font-style:italic">Carl Zeiss </span>case.  Just over ten years later, Lord Denning considered that marriages and divorces fell within the exception in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hesperides Hotels </span>case.  A decade later, Lord Donaldson said that he saw &#8220;great force&#8221; in the exception in <span style="font-style:italic">Gur Corporation</span>.  Some ten years later the Special Commissioners confirmed that the exception could apply in cases involving matters of private law including the registration of births, marriages and death.  In the field of English family law, Sumner J confirmed that recognition could be afforded to a foreign decree of divorce pronounced in an unrecognised State.  There has been no subsequent challenge to that decision nor any obiter statement in a subsequent case which suggests that his Lordship&#8217;s view was wrong and/or that he was not entitled to grant the declaratory relief which flowed from his decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Emin</span>.  The only historical challenge came some thirty years earlier in the <span style="font-style:italic">Adams </span>case.  Perhaps it is not without significance that <span style="font-style:italic">Adams </span>was decided in the same year that the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations of which the United Kingdom is a member, handed down its decision in the Namibia case which gave its name to the <span style="font-style:italic">Namibia </span>exception. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, I am satisfied that marriage and its creation as a legal status falls within the category of &#8216;private rights&#8217; which the exception has embraced in the authorities to which I have referred above.  Regardless of the fact that Mr Jama in his evidence has described the formalities required under Sharia law as a contractual agreement and the certificate issued by the Hargeisa District Court as valid proof from the administrative authority of an effective marriage, I take the view that these acts can properly be regarded as essentially private in character regulating, as they do, the day to day affairs of the people and individuals resident within the territory in question: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Kibris</span> case, above.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Fourthly, in my judgment a refusal to recognise the validity of this marriage would represent something of a legal anomaly.  Given the development of English jurisprudence on this issue over the last fifty years, the English courts would be significantly out of step with other jurisdictions in terms of private international law were recognition of this marriage to be refused.  In circumstances where I can see no good, far less compelling, reason to refuse recognition, I am quite satisfied that the applicant in this case is entitled to the declaratory relief which he seeks. </p>

That is an important safety valve to the exception to the non-recognition principle.  As far as issues of policy are concerned, in this case I have the reassurance of the FCO through Mr St John Gould (who has been specifically authorised to provide it), that the Government would be unlikely to object to the recognition of a </p>

Because I have decided that the considerable weight of domestic and international authority, coupled with the various citations in respect of the <span style="font-style:italic">Namibia</span> exception and the approval it has attracted from English appellate courts, is a sufficient foundation for granting the relief which has been sought, what follows is strictly obiter. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Convention rights are to be interpreted in harmony with general principles of international law.  That much is clear from the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Neulinger v Switzerland </span>[2012] 54 EHRR 31.  However, before any breach can be established, there must first be a finding that there has been a disproportionate interference with a relevant right.  Articles 8 (respect for private and family life) and 12 (the right to marry and found a family) are the likely contenders as the relevant rights which may be engaged were recognition to have been refused in this case.  Member States are entitled to prescribe the formalities required for marriage in individual States: see <span style="font-style:italic">X v Federal Republic of Germany </span>[No 6167/73] and <span style="font-style:italic">Hamer v United Kingdom </span>[7114/75], [1982] 4 EHRR 139 at pars 60 to 61.  Further, the ability to register a marriage falls within Article 8: see <span style="font-style:italic">Orlandi v Italy </span>[2018] 26431/12; 26742/12; 44057/12 and 60088/12.  These cases concerned same sex couples who had married outside Italy and who found themselves unable to register those marriages in Italy.  Whilst they succeeded in establishing a violation of Article 8, the critical point in the case was their inability to secure any form of legal recognition of their status in Italy. </p>

They could simply have presented themselves to a local Registrar together with the appropriate declaration of non-validity and married in a civil ceremony.  In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how their Article 8 rights would have been infringed. </p>
