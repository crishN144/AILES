At the conclusion of a three-day hearing on 14 February 2024, HHJ Furness KC handed down a written judgment which concluded with the terms of the order he made. He made a clean break order which divided the available assets between the parties. The total assets available for distribution were in the region of &#163;434,000. For the reasons he gave in his judgment, HHJ Furness KC awarded the Respondent &#163;210,000 made up of &#163;8,366 held by her solicitors on account; &#163;36,000 from the sale of a property known as Amyas Close (as offered by the Appellant in submissions in the lower court) and &#163;165,634 from the sale of Shamrock House after payment of a charge to SC, a third party who had secured judgment in a civil claim (referred to hereafter as &#8220;the civil claim/proceedings/judgment&#8221;). By the order, the Respondent was to transfer her interest in a property known as Laburnum Court and in a boat - </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Whatever </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">- to the Appellant.

That rolled-up hearing was initially listed for hearing on 23 May 2024. That hearing date was vacated on the Appellant&#8217;s application. The date given for the rolled-up hearing was thus altered to 21 June 2024 but that was vacated to allow the Appellant more time to obtain the transcripts he said he needed. The rolled-up hearing was re-listed 28 August 2024. The date was set to accommodate Counsel&#8217;s availability and because of the need to enable the parties to get on with their lives. The appeal was becoming pressing as Keehan J had granted a stay of the sale of property, albeit only to the extent that the proceeds should not be distributed as per the order of 14 February 2024 pending the appeal hearing.</span></p>

The transcript of the PTR on 11 January 2024 had only been received that morning and the Respondent had not yet had sight of it. In the circumstances, Counsel for the Appellant had explored with the Appellant whether he wished to seek an adjournment so that he could rely upon it when furthering his argument in relation to perceived bias. I was told by Dr Sidoli that his client had had the opportunity to give him informed instructions and that he did not seek an adjournment for that purpose or any other. Indeed, on instruction the Appellant now sought to withdraw the first ground of his appeal. Given that was the Appellant&#8217;s informed decision, I permitted the first ground of appeal to be withdrawn.</span></p>

I was told that the evidence the Appellant sought to admit was relevant to the general argument that the outcome was unfair. The Respondent&#8217;s submission was that, even if the documents were admitted, they would not make a difference to the outcome. I decided that I would admit the fresh evidence but made it very clear that, in argument on behalf of the Appellant, I expected to be taken to the fresh evidence and to hear submissions on the relevance of particular documents to the Appellant&#8217;s Grounds of Appeal. Thus, at the end of Counsel for the Appellant&#8217;s oral submissions, I queried why I had not been taken to any of the documents in question. I was concerned and so allowed a short adjournment to enable Counsel for the Appellant to take specific instructions on the fresh evidence and its asserted relevance. When he returned to court, Dr Sidoli duly made additional submission all of which were in relation to documents which were said to be relevant to HHJ Furness KC&#8217;s decision in relation to the civil claim. </span></p>

The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.

The Appellant was awarded a net sum of about &#163;155,000 and the Respondent &#163;210,000. From the award, the Respondent could purchase a home for herself outright; the Appellant could not. The learned Judge was wrong in using the agreed valuation of &#163;88,000 for the boat and ought to have taken judicial notice of depreciation given that agreement had been reached at an FDR two years previously.

He alleges the judge ignored a ringfence agreement in relation to the property Amyas Close and that this property was wrongly re-entered into the balance sheet. It is further alleged that during the sale process of that property, after the hearing before HHJ Furness KC, the Respondent&#8217;s conduct caused the Appellant to incur unreasonable costs. The court had before it at first instance details of properties which it was asserted would meet the Respondent&#8217;s housing needs but the court at first instance did not ask the Appellant for similar documents. Within this document, the Appellant also asserts that the way the learned judge treated the civil claim is contrary to how the Claimant&#8217;s (SC&#8217;s) litigation team are treating the claim. The Appellant makes the further point that, in his view, the overall award was unfair as he received three assets, all of which came with costs of maintenance and required expenditure, whereas the Respondent received a fixed lump sum.</span></p>

At paragraph 7 he sets out the substance of his grievances. Having read the document, I take the view that most of his arguments in this document repeat the arguments he has made in the original skeleton argument and the continuation document. However, I note from this document that the Appellant now seeks to bring to this court&#8217;s attention that the Respondent is cohabitating and that, he says, affects her needs for rehousing. The Respondent rejects the Appellant&#8217;s assertion. The Appellant also places before this court the continuing costs that are being incurred as a result of the civil claim, and that his legal costs for the financial remedy proceedings are in the region of &#163;45,000.</span></p>

The property at Amyas Close was entered into the balance sheet in accordance with the Appellant&#8217;s evidence given before HHJ Furness KC on the second day. </span></p>

It appears that, when the parties separated, SC became anxious about its repayment and issued civil proceedings. The Appellant intervened in that claim and opposed the application, asserting the loan was a gift to the Respondent alone. The judgment in relation to the civil claim was before the court at first instance as was the order made by the Recorder who heard the claim. The order arising from that claim stated that the Appellant agreed to vacate the former matrimonial home, Shamrock House, and market it for sale. Judgment was given in the sum of &#163;178,057.19 which was calculated as the original loan of &#8364;160,000/&#163;137,440; interest of &#163;34,917.19; a further loan of &#163;5,200 and administration charges of &#163;500.  The proceeds of sale of Shamrock House were to be applied as to the costs of sale and to redeem the mortgage, with the proceeds thereafter to be divided equally with the judgment sum paid from the Respondent&#8217;s share. </span></p>

He found it was a joint loan. He was not asked to determine responsibility for the other sums as W had agreed that judgment should be entered for those sums anyway.

The parties have had the benefit of the loan, if they had borrowed money from a Bank they would have had to pay interest, now the Court has determined based on the admission of the wife, that interest is payable on this loan. It was a joint loan and the interest is therefore a joint liability too. Both parties have benefitted from the loan in being able to make investments and the interest agreed by the wife was at a commercially appropriate rate for a private loan (bank rate plus 4%), particularly as it only began to run from a date in 2018 some 2 years after the original loan. I have no hesitation in coming to that determination. </span></p>

When looking at the income and earning capacity of the parties, the learned judge found that there was a disparity between the outgoings for which the Appellant sought recompense within the family finance application and his stated net profit and available income.  Later in his judgment, when considering the value of cherished number plates in the Appellant&#8217;s possession, he notes that the Appellant told the court he had sold them for &#163;15,000 and retains one worth &#163;750.

An equal share of the assets would result in each party receiving &#163;185,743 but that calculation had to be varied to take into account the May 2023 agreement in relation to the property Amyas Close. Once that was done a straightforward equal share would give the Appellant &#163;207,789 and the Respondent &#163;221,743.

I note that at that time the Appellant had objected to the inclusion of the civil judgment [paragraph 15 of the judgment]. HHJ Furness KC had the civil judgment before him when making his findings.

Those are the paragraphs in which he made his findings about the civil loan, the interest payable thereon and any additional sums incurred as a result of the debt. He correctly identified that the learned Recorder made no finding in relation to interest payable on the loan (see paragraph 28 of the civil judgment). He correctly set out the Appellant&#8217;s argument that the Respondent had agreed the interest albeit the Recorder had not made a finding on interest. He heard evidence on this point from the Appellant and the Respondent. Having done so, he came to his conclusion that the interest and charge must be joint for the reasons he gave at paragraphs 55-56 of his judgment set out above. In writing, it was argued on the Appellant&#8217;s behalf that the learned judge ignored a &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">clear finding</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">that the Appellant was jointly liable for the debt on the principal sum and that the interest of &#163;34,917.19 was the Respondent&#8217;s sole responsibility. In another document on behalf of the Appellant, it is asserted that the Recorder found that the contested loan was not interest bearing.  Having read the order and judgment of the learned Recorder in the civil claim, I consider that HHJ Furness KC&#8217;s understanding of the civil judgment was correct.</span></p>

HHJ Furness KC was simply explaining that, even if the Appellant&#8217;s argument was accepted in relation to the interest on the loan and the additional sums, then it would be unlikely to affect the overall outcome as the wife&#8217;s need for additional capital to meet her needs would be greater if the Appellant was correct in his assertions.

One of the items is a letter from his civil solicitors dated 25 January 2024. I have read it. That is the same letter HHJ Furness KC referred to in his judgment. He took it into account when making the findings that he did about the loan and the interest thereon. I have formed the view that, on the basis of all the evidence HHJ Furness KC had before him, which included that letter, he was entitled to make the findings of fact he did about the loan and the interest on it. However, it is part of my task to consider that conclusion in light of any fresh evidence. Within the fresh evidence to which I have been taken in argument, is an email exchange between the civil solicitors for the Appellant and the Respondent. The first in time contains the Appellant&#8217;s understanding that interest on the debt was the Respondent&#8217;s responsibility. The Respondent&#8217;s solicitors appear to accept that proposition. I have asked myself rhetorically what weight I should give to that correspondence and how should I treat that evidence? On behalf of the Appellant, it is argued that the email exchange evidences that there is a body of legal opinion that does not agree with the learned judge&#8217;s finding. If that is the purpose of submitting that email exchange, then I formally record that they are entitled to their view. However, their view is not binding on the lower court or this court. HHJ Furness KC had the benefit of considering not simply the civil judgment and order but the parties&#8217; evidence. He was entitled to make the findings he did on the evidence before him.

Thereafter, the Appellant and the Respondent were to be equally responsible (50:50) for the Claimant&#8217;s costs. That costs order still stands. It was rightly not disturbed or undermined by his judgment. The effect of the costs order was rightly factored into the decision-making of HHJ Furness KC.</span></p>

In that regard, it is self-evident from paragraph 113 of the judgment of HHJ Furness KC that he treated both parties equally. HHJ Furness KC accepted the Respondent&#8217;s evidence on income. It was modest, about &#163;1000 per month. Given her limited income, self-evidently her mortgage raising capacity was likely to be negligible and probably non-existent. The Appellant, however, was in a different position. In relation to the Appellant, the learned judge considered the Appellant&#8217;s assertion that he could not raise a mortgage, but it is clear from his judgment that he was not convinced that that which the Appellant asserted was true. Reading the judgment as a whole, HHJ Furness KC was far from convinced that he had the full picture of the Appellant&#8217;s income and capital. Paragraphs 31-32, 68-70 and 75-76 of the judgment at first instance set out the learned judge&#8217;s findings that the Appellant had not made full and frank disclosure of his income or his capital and the court&#8217;s view that that non-disclosure was deliberate. Based on those findings, the learned judge was entitled to infer that the Appellant was likely to have greater income than had been disclosed and to infer a modest mortgage raising capacity of about &#163;27,000.</span></p>

The allegation initially was non-specific. It is not supported by evidence. However, having read his position statement dated August 2024 it is apparent that the Appellant&#8217;s case has evolved. He now alleges that the Respondent is cohabitating. I have studied the Appellant&#8217;s position statement prepared in February 2024 for the hearing before HHJ Furness KC. I note that the Appellant did not raise cohabitation as an issue in that document and, accordingly, it appears not to have been raised before HHJ Furness KC. I note that Counsel on behalf of the Appellant has made no submission before me to suggest that it was, nor has he addressed me orally on the issue of cohabitation. I have reminded myself that this is an appeal hearing, not a re-hearing. I consider that the Appellant&#8217;s bald assertion about co-habitation does not take this appeal any further. It was not an issue before the lower court and there is no fresh evidence to be admitted in relation to that issue before me which would substantiate the Appellant&#8217;s assertion, let alone any consideration about how it would have impacted on the award.</span></p>

There can be no proper criticism of the way HHJ Furness KC calculated the &#8220;pot&#8221; for distribution. His findings in relation to the civil claim and the value of the boat were all within the ambit of findings that a reasonable judge could make on the evidence before him. There is no evidence before me that the learned judge treated the Appellant unfairly or unduly favoured the Respondent. The learned judge knew the task he had to perform and carried that task out properly. He correctly set out the law and he applied it to the facts as he found them to be. He specifically considered the effects of the equal sharing principle (see paragraphs 99-105) before standing back and looking at whether such an order would meet the needs of each party and whether it would constitute a fair distribution of the assets that were available for distribution. He then provided his reasoning for the order he made. The judgment of HHJ Furness KC should be read as a whole. Within that judgment he clearly considers all the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> factors. When doing so, he took into account the Appellant&#8217;s age and his ill health (see reference to the GP letter above). However, he also, as he was entitled to do, relied upon the Appellant&#8217;s own case that his anxiety and depression did not affect his earning capacity (see paragraph 96 of the judgment). He considered both parties&#8217; income and capital resources. The learned Judge was not convinced that the Appellant had disclosed his true income and assets and made findings of fact to that effect. HHJ Furness KC was entitled to make those findings and to factor them into his decision-making. However, fairly, HHJ Furness KC gave the Appellant credit when settling the balance sheet for certain payments he had made since separation to preserve the assets now available for distribution. He looked at both parties&#8217; needs, including their housing needs, fairly (see paragraph 89 of his judgment). He acknowledged that there was a discrepancy in relation to outcome for the parties and that that was largely due to the costs the Appellant had incurred in contesting the civil claim. It had been the Appellant&#8217;s choice to contest that claim. In the last two paragraphs of his judgment, HHJ Furness KC sets out correctly that the application of the sharing principle would provide a figure of &#163;209,695 each and that a needs-based approach to the Respondent&#8217;s case would result in a figure of &#163;210,270. In paragraph 113, the learned judge considered the net effect on the Appellant of the award he intended to make: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">On either basis he will end up with assets of between &#163;154,000 and &#163;155,000 which will not enable him to purchase a property of the same value as the wife unless he can raise a small mortgage of about &#163;27,000</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">For the reasons he gave, the learned judge considered that it would not be impossible for the Appellant to raise a sum of &#163;27,000 or thereabouts by way of small mortgage to supplement his capital. That sum together with the small mortgage would enable him to buy a similar home to that the Respondent would be able to purchase. </span></p>

In making this decision I have factored in that I permitted the Appellant to withdraw ground 1 for the reasons I have already given. I have also considered my conclusions in relation to grounds 2 and 3 as well as the fact that on the papers then before him, Keehan J set this appeal down for a rolled-up hearing.</span></p>
