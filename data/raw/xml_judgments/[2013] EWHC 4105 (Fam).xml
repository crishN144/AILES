To this end he directed that the parties engage in mediation to see if the matter could be resolved consensually and H agreed to bear the costs of the mediation in the first instance. In the event that the mediation was unsuccessful, Mostyn J directed that he would deal with an application by W for a legal costs order in relation to the appeal on paper. </p>

On 30 October 2013 Mostyn J refused her application, saying in his ruling that the W had been unreasonable in her approach to the mediation; first in her insistence on using <span style="font-style:italic">a top-drawer and top-price mediator </span>  and secondly that her insistence on attendance of legal representatives at mediation was <span style="font-style:italic">neither necessary nor reasonable; in my experience this would be unusual and arguably unhelpful</span>.  Mostyn J pointed out that there was still time for mediation to take place. Unfortunately it has not done so and out of this modest matrimonial pot H&#8217;s costs of the appeal are &#163;22,320 and W&#8217;s &#163;25,372.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment where the Learned District Judge fell into error was in failing to identify a figure which would represent the W&#8217;s maximum reasonable maintenance entitlement taking into account all the circumstances of the case, namely a cap. In my judgment, where the family income is routinely made up of salary and bonus and the bonus represents such a significant proportion of the total that the Judge is driven to making a conventional monthly order for a sum less than that which he would otherwise feel to be appropriate, (taking into account all the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> factors and in particular the standard of living and the totality of the income available in the foreseeable future,) he may well provide for a part of the W&#8217;s maintenance to be paid from the bonus. Such payment, given the intrinsic uncertainty of bonuses, can only be expressed in percentage terms. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proper approach would be for the District Judge to calculate a total figure for maintenance which covers what he finds to be her ordinary expenditure together with such sum as would provide for what as Moylan J described as <span style="font-style:italic">additional, discretionary, items which will vary from year to year and which are not reflected in her annual budget. </span>Having carried out this exercise the court will then make a monthly order to be paid for from salary at whatever rate the District Judge feels to be fair, and the balance to be expressed as a percentage, of the net bonus up to a stated maximum each year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It should be made clear that such orders cannot be calculated with arithmetical precision. In determining the appropriate percentage the court will do the best it can  looking at the historical pattern of bonuses to date and by factoring in such information as may be available in relation to the future prospects of H (or his company). The inherent uncertainty of bonus payments provides, in part, the reason why that the setting of a cap is essential in order to avoid the unintentional unfairness which may arise as a consequence of a wholly unanticipated substantial bonus paid to the H. Such a payment would result in W receiving a sum substantially in excess of that which the District Judge regarded as appropriate in order to maintain her maintenance at a fair level.</p>

W&#8217;s percentage will apply pro rata across the various elements &#8211; it would not be fair for her to be entitled to receive the entirety of her maintenance percentage from the cash element leaving the H to take the risk on stock movements and the cash flow consequences of deferred cash payments.</p>

He spoke of W being able to make <span style="font-style:italic">substantial savings</span> on it and commented on the fact that it simply presumed expenditure at the rate required to keep the former matrimonial home with its pool etc going. </p>

His salary is &#163;11,441 net pcm or &#163;137,292 pa.  The total anticipated maintenance for W would therefore be in the region of</p>

In considering whether this is a fair figure when looked at against all the factors I look at the budget produced by W of &#163;6,352 pcm which included a figure of &#163;800 pcm for a mortgage which she will not have to pay and of &#163;820 for The child. I note also that this does not take into account the income attributed to W by the District Judge of &#163;500 pcm. </p>

In those years when the H&#8217;s bonus is comparable to the present level, this would give the wife a total of &#163;65,000 pa maintenance, plus her own earnings. On any view this would provide W, living mortgage free, with a substantial income even though  part of the maintenance derived from H&#8217;s bonus payments will not be paid immediately but will be deferred under the terms of the bonus payment.</p>
