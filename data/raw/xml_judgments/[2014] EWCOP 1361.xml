	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are personal welfare proceedings in the Court of Protection. They relate to an elderly lady, G, who is 94 years old. She is represented by the Official Solicitor as her litigation friend. The proceedings were launched, in circumstances I describe below, by the London Borough of Redbridge. The two other parties to the proceedings are G&#8217;s two carers, C and F. I have before me an application by Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), publishers of the Daily Mail.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background is described in some detail by Russell J in a judgment handed down on 26 February 2014: <span style="font-style:italic">The London Borough of Redbridge v G and others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/485" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 485" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 485 (COP)</ref>. The judgment is in the public domain and available to all on the BAILII website. Russell J described (para 39) how the litigation had begun with an application by the local authority to the High Court under the inherent jurisdiction (FD13P02067), the local authority taking the view that, although G was a vulnerable adult, she did not lack capacity. That view was put in question when the matter came before His Honour Judge Clifford Bellamy (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) on 14 November 2013. The issue of capacity thereafter fell to be determined by Russell J at a hearing on 17-18 February 2014. In her judgment, Russell J found (para 82) that, on the balance of probabilities, G lacked capacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2</ref> and 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and accordingly that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection. She added that she did not consider it necessary to rule on any application under the inherent jurisdiction. It was in consequence of this that the local authority issued the application in the Court of Protection (124555450).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 February 2014 Russell J had made a reporting restriction order in the High Court. It was in fairly standard form. So far as still relevant for present purposes it prohibited the identification of G, C and F. In her judgment she explained why (paras 89-92). The order referred to by Russell J in para 91 was made on 18 February 2014.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is self-evident that the question of G&#8217;s capacity to engage with members of the press (with a view to sharing her story publicly) has to be assessed properly and expertly before the court could reach any informed view as to whether it is in G&#8217;s best interests that she should in fact do so.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">He therefore adjourned the local authority&#8217;s application for substantive relief in this respect, and re-listed it for hearing on 2 May 2014 before Russell J. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cobb J gave the local authority leave to instruct Dr Andrew Barker, a consultant in old age psychiatry who had previously given evidence as to G&#8217;s capacity, to undertake a capacity assessment &#8220;specifically directed to the question of whether or not G has the capacity to communicate, and engage, with members of the press, with all the implications of so doing.&#8221; He continued (para 27):</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I shall require Dr. Barker carefully, as he has in the past, to perform the functionality test in relation to this difficult question, inviting him to consider the implications for G&#8217;s decision-making, on the basis alternatively that (a) the Reporting Restriction Order remains in place, and/or (b) the Reporting Restriction Order is varied or discharged. Plainly, G is provided with not insubstantial protection from invasion into her private and family life for as long as the Reporting Restriction Order is in place. But that protection may be dismantled if the court, undertaking the competing Article 8 and 10 review, reaches the conclusion that the Reporting Restriction Order cannot or should not stand in its present form.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cobb J then turned to consider the question of interim relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

He then (paras 34-39) surveyed the evidence relevant to the question under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref>(c) &#8211; was it in G&#8217;s best interests to make an order &#8220;without delay&#8221; &#8211; before concluding as follows (para 40):</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It seems to me that, weighing these matters one against the other, it is not in G&#8217;s best interests for her to be able or permitted to communicate with the press at this stage; she has expressed at least ambivalent feelings, it appears, about the engagement of the media. I am further concerned that any private information which G vouchsafes to a journalist at this stage may, of course, be exposed to more public examination in the event that the Reporting Restriction Order is subsequently varied or discharged. Until the court can take a clearer view about G&#8217;s capacity to make such relationships with the press it is, in my judgment, clearly in G&#8217;s best interests that I should make an interim order that she should not make such communications. It follows that the injunctive order sought &#8230; shall be granted &#8230; until 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add this. In the course of his judgment, Cobb J referred (para 9) to the fact that he had read three press reports of the proceedings, two authored by Mr Christopher Booker and one written by Ms Sue Reid. He commented (para 20):</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Of note, but not specifically influential in my decision-making today, is the fact that some of the press reporting of these proceedings thus far, as is apparent from the three reports which I have read, does not provide a balanced account of this case, nor does it faithfully or accurately, in my judgment, reflect the substance of Russell J&#8217;s judgment or the evidence heard by the court. That is highly regrettable.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">He went on to record (para 34) that there was evidence that G indeed wishes to communicate with the press, that evidence being provided not only by G herself, but also by Ms Reid, the journalist, who had met with G on one occasion at her home. Furthermore, in a discussion with Miss Moore, the solicitor instructed on behalf of G by the Official Solicitor, G is reported to have said that she was &#8220;happy&#8221; that the article written by Ms Reid had indeed been written: &#8220;&#8230; it let them know what they do to the elderly.&#8221; On the other hand, he said (para 36) &#8220;it is clear from the attendance notes helpfully provided by Miss Moore that at other times G has expressed less than positive views about the involvement of the press in her life.&#8221; He added (para 37), &#8220;There is evidence, but I make no finding about it, that G is being used as the instrument of others to pursue publicity in relation to her particular situation, and that she is not exercising her free-will at all.&#8221;</p>

The complaints they contain are made by reference to Cobb J&#8217;s judgment. But nothing that Ms Reid was alleged to have done amounted to a breach of anything contained in Cobb J&#8217;s order. If the basis of complaint was that Ms Reid&#8217;s conduct was somehow rendered improper by the terms of the declarations which Cobb J had made, there is in law no foundation for any such contention: see <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority, In re J (A Child), R (S) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2002] EWHC 18 (Fam/Admin), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] Fam 213" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] Fam 213</ref>, paras 118-122.

ANL wish to make representations about this. It is concerned that, unless it is permitted to do so, the court will not have the benefit of full argument on this point. From what ANL knows of the proceedings, neither the Local Authority nor the Official Solicitor are likely to explore these matters, or to explore them adequately. Neither the Local Authority nor the Official Solicitor have to date made submissions about the importance of these core rights in assessing whether the court should grant an injunction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Mr Millar puts it, and I agree, the reason for this is simple: before J&#8217;s right to receive information from S arises, S must, to use the language of <span style="font-style:italic">Leander</span>, &#8220;wish or be willing&#8221; to impart the information to J. Where S lacks capacity, what the court is doing when deciding whether or not it is in S&#8217;s best interests for the information to be imparted to J (or, if already imparted to J, whether or not it is in S&#8217;s best interests for it to be imparted by J to others), is doing what, if S had capacity, S would be doing in deciding whether or not to impart the information to J (or, as the case may be, in deciding whether or not to seek an injunction to restrain J imparting it to others). As Mr Millar points out, J would have no right or interest in relation to such a decision by S, if S had capacity. Why, he asks rhetorically, should it make any difference that, because S lacks capacity, the very same decision is being taken <span style="font-style:italic">on behalf of S </span>by the court. I agree. Nor can J have any right or interest in the prior decision by the court as to whether or not S lacks capacity. Ms Burnham characterises the capacity issue as a &#8220;gateway&#8221; to giving effect to what she says is J&#8217;s right to receive information from S if she were willing to impart it. So it may be, but the argument breaks down, both on the <span style="font-style:italic">Leander </span>point and because it overlooks the true nature of what is happening when the court decides <span style="font-style:italic">on behalf of S </span>where S&#8217;s best interests lie.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, the court&#8217;s best interests decision in relation to S is not necessarily determinative. If the court decides that it in S&#8217;s best interests for information to be imparted to J (or, if that has already happened, that S&#8217;s best interests do not require the grant of an injunction) then that is the end of the matter. There is no conflict between S&#8217;s best interests and J&#8217;s rights. If, however, there is a conflict between S&#8217;s best interests as determined by the court and J&#8217;s rights as protected by Article 10, the court moves on to the third and final stage of the inquiry. But at this stage S&#8217;s best interests are not determinative. There is a balancing exercise. The court is no longer exercising its protective jurisdiction in relation to S but rather its ordinary jurisdiction under the Convention as between claimant and defendant. Accordingly it has to balance the competing interests: S&#8217;s interest under Article 8 (as ascertained by the court), and therefore her right under Article 8 to keep her private life private, and J&#8217;s rights under Article 10. And at this stage, if relief is being sought against J (or against the world at large), J&#8217;s Article 10 rights are directly implicated. So J will be entitled to be heard in opposition to the order being sought.  </p>

Quite apart from the rejection by those to whom this comment appears to be directed of any factual foundation for what is being said, this cannot be a ground for being allowed to participate in the proceedings.
