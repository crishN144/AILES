At that time the wife was aged 23 and the husband aged 33, so they were fully adult and mature graduates and no issue could arise as to capacity to marry.  The marriage was not an arranged one and the parties married out of love after a courtship and a formal engagement.  Family members and other witnesses were present at the ceremony.  The ceremony was performed by a qualified Moroccan Udul or Adoul (a notary), not by an Imam, although the marriage certificate refers also to the blessings of Allah and the use of the Holy Book.  There is a formal marriage certificate and that and an English translation are now at bundle pages C8 and 9.  The ceremony was followed by two wedding parties in London and a honeymoon abroad when, as the husband put it in his statement, "our lives truly started together".  There was, however, no compliance or purported compliance with any of the requirements of the English Marriage Acts 1949 to 1994.  </span></p>

In January 2006, the parties' only child, Selma, was born.  She is now aged 6.  Both parties have always worked throughout their marriage.  </span></p>

At paragraph 7 of his statement (now at bundle page C12) the husband said, "Our marriage was characterised by short periods of happiness, interspersed with more difficult times when we would stop communicating.&#8221;  For a period during 2009 the wife actually left the flat.  Later she returned to live there and both parties still reside there now.  However, they say that any cohabitation in a marital sense ended during 2009 and that they have been separated since then, albeit now still both residing in the same home.  The effective duration of the marriage was, therefore, about 7&#189; years.</span></p>

That petition propounded the marriage in the Moroccan Consulate on 8 January 2002 and prayed for a divorce relying on alleged unreasonable behaviour.  The Moroccan marriage certificate and an English translation of it were lodged with the court.  On 27 August 2010 the husband filed an answer in which he admitted the ceremony of marriage, but alleged that it "did not create a marriage capable of recognition or dissolution under English law".  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In accordance with good practice, the wife's solicitors had sent to the husband a draft petition several months before it was actually presented in May 2010.  It appears that meantime that had prompted the husband to commence, on 14 April 2010, a petition for divorce in a court of first instance in Larache in the Kingdom of Morocco.  The petition was based "on the grounds of dissension".  The wife was later served and engaged in the proceedings through a lawyer in Tangier.  It is common ground between the parties that, whatever its status in England, there had been a valid Moroccan civil marriage between them which, within Morocco, was regarded as valid and subsisting.  There was a final Moroccan civil divorce, which appears from a document now at bundle page D7 to have been finally perfected on 2 June 2011.  It is not in issue that that divorce was obtained "by means of judicial proceedings" in Morocco within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> and that none of the discretionary grounds for non-recognition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>, based on inadequate service or participation or other deficiencies, apply.

He submits that Parliament has created a structured set of rules as to who can contract marriages in England and Wales and how such marriages should be conducted and registered.  Many consequences may flow from marriage, both as between the parties and other family members and members of the public generally, and as between the parties and the State (e.g. taxation and entitlement to benefits).  The Attorney General submits that those who only wish to participate in some religious ceremony or some other personal form of ceremony which has personal significance for them, are completely free to do so.   But, he submits, those who wish to achieve the status and also any benefits from marriage, must do so in the ways and with the formalities that Parliament has prescribed.</span></p>

It is particularly relevant in the presumably unusual circumstances where the parties did not intend to create a valid marriage, or where they realised that for some reason they would not be able to do so. But the converse does not apply. It is not the law, in my judgment, where no or minimal steps are taken to comply with the Marriage Acts and so the marriage does not set out or purport to be a marriage under those Acts, that it nevertheless suffices if the participants hopefully intended, or believed, that the ceremony would create one."</span></p>

The wife then claimed a State widow's pension but it was denied to her on the basis that there had been no valid marriage.  The Court of Appeal held that she was indeed the widow.  The actual decision and the reasoning of the three Lords Justices has to be considered with some care.  Robert Walker LJ based his decision that there had been a valid marriage on the presumption from long cohabitation as man and wife which had not been displaced.

He says in paragraph 4 of his statement (quoted above) that it was important to maintain their links with Morocco for practical reasons, including legitimacy of any children and inheritance rights under Moroccan law.  It was also important to him and his family to have a marriage recognised within Islam.  I fully accept all of that, but it was surely no less important that any children should be recognised as legitimate in England, where they expected to continue to live, and to have inheritance rights under English law as well.

That is the natural meaning and scope of the word "marriage" when used in this context.  Far from needing to use words of limitation or exclusion to limit "marriage" to a valid or void marriage, Parliament would have needed to use express words of inclusion if it had intended to enlarge and include within the word "marriage" even what is characterised here as a non-marriage.  That is particularly so in the case of a marriage which was actually contracted in England.  If the marriage relied upon is a ceremony which took place here but which was so irregular and altogether outside the scope of the Marriage Acts as not to be a marriage at all, not even a void one, then in my view it would require clear words from Parliament before it could fall within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> and Part III.</span></p>

In these circumstances it seems to me that the true issue is whether there was ever any marriage between these parties for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> and Part III at all; and not whether such a marriage was still subsisting at a certain time, namely the date of the Moroccan divorce.
