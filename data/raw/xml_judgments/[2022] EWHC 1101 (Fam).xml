Only &#163;4,000 of the &#163;49,000 odd was incurred before DDJ Morris refused to sanction such an expense. M&#8217;s appeal was unsuccessful, the judge determining that there was no need for M to have a nanny during lockdown.  Undaunted by the lack of provision by the court, M simply borrowed the money from her grandparents instead.</p>
