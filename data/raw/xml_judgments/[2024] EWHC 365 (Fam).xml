It is not entirely surprising as he has effectively disengaged from the proceedings since September 2023. He is aware, not least because of the terms of an order dated 14 September 2023 made at a hearing which he attended, that should he not appear at this final hearing, the court may make final orders in his absence. It is possible that he is currently in Nigeria (he intimated as much to M&#8217;s solicitors) but, if so, he made no application to join remotely.  His general stance is clear; he has in the past indicated he opposes all the orders sought.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">The essential factual background has already been determined by HHJ Henley, sitting as a s9 judge, who conducted a comprehensive fact-finding hearing in public law proceedings at which M and F were present and gave evidence. A number of findings highly adverse to F were made. There was no appeal against those findings. All relevant factual material for this hearing before me is now established by reason of HHJ Henley&#8217;s careful and thorough judgment. Since then, M has put in a short statement which adds nothing material, reiterating her profound concern that F may seek to abduct the children to Nigeria. F has put in a five-line statement rejecting everything M has said in the past as &#8220;fiction&#8221; to which he chooses not to respond. It was not necessary to hear any oral evidence as all material facts have already been established. This case is now about an evaluation of the correct orders to make in order to meet the, as I find,  clear risk of abduction.</p>

They lived in Nigeria from December 2016 to December 2018, being visited by F only about twice a year in that time. In December 2018, by when the parents had reconciled, the children returned to this country with both parents, and in 2019 K was born. </p>

He did not comply with the High Court return order until 8 September 2022 when the children returned to this country and were placed in M&#8217;s care. During their seven months in Nigeria living with members of F&#8217;s family, they had been subjected to sustained physical and emotional abuse, and were gravely neglected. </p>

In all other cases, the Court should impose a time-limit when making such Orders. The time limit will vary from case to case and, like all other elements, be a bespoke provision imposing restriction only in so far as that is justified on the facts as found. Unless the Court can see with clarity that there will be no need for any continuing Order after a particular date, for example when it is clear that the circumstances will change so that the risk is removed, the appropriate course will be for the Court to list the matter for further review a short time before the passport and/or travel ban will otherwise expire.&#8221;</span></p>

Typically, such orders encompass the details of the children and the relevant parent/carer.  Here, by contrast, there is no suggestion of such orders being made in respect of preventing F from travelling, whether by seizing his passport or making a port alert against him. The orders, if made, will be in respect only of the children&#8217;s freedom of movement. That said, any such order is plainly an interference with their human rights and must be justifiable and proportionate. They should ordinarily be carefully time limited, albeit with the opportunity of application for renewal at the end of the term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that there is a real risk of abduction by F. F previously acted out of spite and the litigation of the past two years will have done nothing to reduce his sense of anger towards M; his short statement confirms he does not accept a word she says. F has no respect for this court, the court process and court orders. There is absolutely no reason to think he will abide by, for example, a PSO. He does not accept the findings of HHJ Henley. He shows no insight into his behaviour, would willingly punish M, and would have no compunction about the impact on the children. He is economically mobile and has extensive family in Nigeria who have aided and abetted him. The children are, in my judgment, at risk of abduction if F is given a free hand and, were that to come to pass, the impact upon them would be little short of devastating. They do not want to see F or have anything to do with him, and their past lived experiences of abduction have been traumatising. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Evidence from an expert in Nigerian law states that orders in relation to children&#8217;s welfare made in England and Wales are (save for adoption) not enforceable in Nigeria, and that there is no mechanism for the recognition and enforcement of such orders. If F were able to abduct the children, there is in practical terms very little M could do in Nigeria; legal proceedings in Nigeria would be protracted and expensive. In short, if F were able to achieve an abduction of the children, there is little expectation that a swift return could be achieved without F&#8217;s agreement. Thus, the magnitude of the potential consequences seems to me to be set at a very high level given (i) the difficulty in securing return and (ii) the likely traumatic impact on the children. </p>

However, this apparently mitigating factor is undermined by his ability to obtain Emergency Travel Documents to effect the abduction in 2022 without M&#8217;s knowledge or agreement.</p>

Nor could counsel point to any authority where wardship was continued for the duration of the children&#8217;s minority, or a substantial part thereof, in order to prevent abduction from this country.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">They represent a serious intrusion into the children&#8217;s right to a private life. Why should the court continue to exercise a supervisory role over the children when it has decided that they should continue to live with M under a Child Arrangements Order? This seems to me to a prime example of use of wardship potentially cutting across statutory jurisdiction. And it seems to me to be highly undesirable that, at least in theory, M would have to apply back to court in the event of her wishing to take any major step in their lives. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A Child Arrangements Order for the children to live with M has already been made. So too, an order preventing contact between F and the children. Further, the court has already made PSOs preventing F from removing the children from M&#8217;s care, or from their schools, or from any third party to whom M has entrusted the care of the children. I consider it sensible to enlarge these orders so that F is prohibited from attending at the schools or contacting the schools. I will make an order that F is prohibited from applying for UK and/or Nigerian passports and travel documents. I do not propose to place a time limit on these orders. They will therefore continue during the children&#8217;s minority, unless varied or discharged sooner by the court.  New orders reflecting these matters should be drawn up so that (i) it will be simpler to have regard to one order only and (ii) the warning notice can be prominently placed at the front of the order. </p>

F knows where they are currently at school, and who their doctor is. There is no evidence that he has interfered either at their schools or at the medical practice, nor that it is intended they will move in the near future. The school will be aware that F is not permitted to attend, and in the circumstances the risk of abduction from school (or GP) seems to me to be very circumscribed. M can apply for a similar authorisation in the future if justified. It seems to me that these orders as sought are not proportionate, nor are they necessary to prevent abduction which is the primary concern of M. </p>

F has not made private law children applications. But the children have been subject to appalling behaviour by F, and legal proceedings have lasted nearly two years. The children do not want to see F. They have been traumatised by his conduct. They, and M, need time free of potential litigation. Further litigation would be highly detrimental to their welfare, in my judgment.
