	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is a finding of fact hearing investigating the cause of death of S, a ten-year-old girl. S died in the early hours of a Sunday in November 2016. The case is being reheard following the judgment of the Court of Appeal <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/1718" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 1718" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 1718</ref>.

In my judgment the judge had failed to look at the whole picture. Not only did he fail to marry up the fact that S sustained two sets of injuries (one of which was fatal) but the judge, faced with the incontrovertible evidence in relation to the genital injuries, carried out no analysis of the available evidence in order to see whether an accident (for example) was a likely cause. Whilst in other circumstances I might have identified, or highlighted by way of example, certain evidence which I believe merited consideration by the judge, given my view that the appeal must be allowed and the matter remitted for rehearing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.&#8221; </span></p>

The Local Authority no longer seeks a Care Order in respect of their older brother (E), a boy now aged 17 years. X and Y were removed from M&#8217;s care for three weeks at the start of the proceedings. Z remained throughout with M. All the children were reunited with both parents following the earlier judgment. The Local Authority&#8217;s case is that S was killed by strangulation and that she had, prior to death, sustained serious genital injuries both externally and internally. It is axiomatic that the court has a responsibility to investigate what happened to S in order appropriately to protect the subject children. </p>

The wide ambit of the hearing may conveniently be illustrated by noting that Ms Ball QC and Ms Kelly, on behalf of M, have presented a closing submission document of some forty-six pages with lengthy accompanying appendixes. In addition, Mr Twomey QC has reprised an interesting legal argument (advanced at the now overturned fact-finding hearing) as to whether the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is apt to permit findings against a child, having regard to the wording of section 31 (2) and, by way of supplement, whether, if it is, the delay and the particular circumstances of his young client render it unfair to do so within the principles protected by Article 6 ECHR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Inevitably, these questions branch out more widely but it is, to my mind, important in a case such as this for the judge firmly to resist the siren calls of counsel to enter discursive peripheral debate however forensically stimulating, where it ultimately casts little, if any, light on the central issues. Juries in a criminal trial are always advised by the trial judge that they do not need to resolve every issue that has arisen during the case, but only those issues that will enable them to come to a verdict, applying the requisite standard of proof. This applies, by parity of analysis, to the factfinding exercise here. I do not intend, nor is it feasible to address every issue that has been raised. I propose to confine myself only to those matters that require to be addressed in order to answer the questions that I have crafted and which must be resolved in order to achieve fairness to each of the parties.  </p>

The couple met in 2000, they married within a few months. Their first child E, was born in October 2001. As I have identified in paragraph 3 above there were six children. The family lived in London and kept strong, indeed daily, links with the OC community and extended family members.  The children attended school conscientiously and each of them worked hard at their studies.

M strongly disapproved of F&#8217;s use of Khat. She considered it rendered him generally ineffective and unproductive. He was not motivated to work or to provide for his large family. M eventually gave F an ultimatum and they separated for a while. This plainly had a significant impact on F. He was able to break his dependency and find employment. The couple resumed living together and for the past nine years they appear to have been happily married.  </p>

He asked whether his parents were aware he had been arrested and was told they were not. During the journey W became upset and tried to distract himself with his homework.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I begin my analysis with the medical evidence. Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), Part 35 has evolved, giving judges more flexibility as to how expert evidence is delivered in court. In this case I decided that it would be constructive to hear the key experts together. The process has become known as "hot-tubbing", the colloquial term for the process of calling expert witnesses to give evidence and be cross-examined concurrently. In other jurisdictions it is known as Concurrent Expert Evidence (CEE). It also involves the parties' experts engaging in discussion together while in the witness box. The findings of the Civil Justice Council's consultation on hot-tubbing have been published: <span style="font-weight:bold">Concurrent expert evidence and "hot-tubbing" in English litigation since the "Jackson reforms": a legal and empirical study. </span>The report emphasises that "the overarching purpose of expert evidence (as stated in CPR 35.3) is for those experts &#8216;to help the Court on matters within their expertise&#8217; (page 13).

Recommendations included: training for all civil judges; amending the directions and listing questionnaires to ensure that hot-tubbing is at least considered at the Case Management Conference stage; adopting an amended version of PD35 and guidance for the judiciary and practitioners; preparing an information note for expert witnesses and helping the Academy of Experts to create a training video; ensuring references to hot-tubbing and concurrent evidence in the various court guides are more consistent. The committee&#8217;s comments are predominantly directed towards civil litigation but the research included examples of &#8216;hot tubbing&#8217; in the Court of Protection. I would not wish to be prescriptive but experience in this case has shown that the practise is likely to be useful where there are, as here, significant numbers of experts. In my judgement I consider that it will, at the very least, be helpful to consider at an Issues Resolutions Hearing (IRH) whether &#8216;hot tubbing&#8217; might be a constructive way forward. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In his report of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 Dr Cary identifies some key findings which are, at this hearing, uncontroversial as between all the doctors. They require to be identified: the post-mortem findings and all subsequent tests indicate no evidence of any natural disease that has caused or contributed to death; there are no positive toxicological findings; death is due to ligature compression; there are prominent asphyxial changes above a ligature mark which encircle the neck. Dr Cary emphasises that these encircling characteristics are not those typically seen in hanging, where a ligature mark rises to a point of suspension. In some circumstances a low-level hanging may produce a largely circumferential mark. Fatal self-harm (suicide) is extremely rare in a child of S&#8217;s age. I am very clear that none of the pathologists nor indeed any other witness disputes the accuracy of Dr Cary&#8217;s description or those of his opinions which I have highlighted. It is equally clear that even whilst some of the post morbid anatomy can properly be described as atypical, the preponderance of the evidence points towards a strangulation. It is not determinative but it is an important piece of a much broader canvas.  </p>

Dr Malcomson contemplated a double folding of the netting around the neck but struggled to conceive how this could have occurred accidentally in sleep. It is indicative of his open mindedness to the possibilities and the objectivity of his enquiry<span style="color:#FF0000"/>that he was able to posit the possibility of S having gone to bed with the netting wrapped around her neck, only for it to be wound a second time in sleep.

Ultimately however, there was no doubt that the pathologists considered that the preponderant evidence, tempered by appropriate caution, was that the injury to the neck was in consequence of third party ligature strangulation. It does not require to be said but nonetheless I repeat, the approach of the Court is to evaluate the evidence cumulatively, weighing expert opinion on any issue alongside other features of the evidence. </p>

In respect of the vaginal petechiae, seen on the dissected blocs, these were inevitably outside Dr Lipetz&#8217;s experience as they cannot be seen in life. Entirely properly, Dr Lipetz deferred to the pathologists as to the applicable differential diagnosis in respect of the vaginal petechiae seen on the blocs.

There was not a sudden demarcation around the circumference of the hymen but bruising extended to the introitus. When challenged by Ms Ball as to whether there could be petechial haemorrhaging, in consequence of congestion arising from asphyxia, Dr Cary was clear that could be discounted because such would be confined only to the upper venous system. Dr Leadbeatter added to this general picture his view that if the haemorrhaging had been due to a post-mortem lividity, there would likely have been localised residual hypostasis. It is not necessary for me to identify each of the different shades of opinion. I have highlighted the fundamentals of the consensus. Dr Marnerides considered the petechiae were &#8216;very unlikely&#8217; to be hypostatic in origin. Dr Malcomson was attracted to the explanation but deferred to the pathologists.  </p>

Dr Lipetz coloured in a similar diagram which although not identical, is, at least to my mind, broadly similar. Ms Ball emphasises the differences. Based on these differences and notwithstanding Dr Cary&#8217;s deferral to Dr Lipetz, Ms Ball invites me to conclude that I should prefer the observations of the pathologists at the post-mortem to those of Dr Lipetz. Dr Cary was relying on naked eye dissection and histology; Dr Lipetz on photography which was less than optimal. Ms Ball submits that nothing is shown on Dr Cary&#8217;s diagram which would indicate bruising or injury identified at &#8216;six, eight or nine o&#8217;clock&#8217; and I should conclude that there was no damage in this area.  </p>

Firstly, and logically, the naked eye observations of the wider genital injury, set out in the concessions in paragraph 57 above, render the hymenal signs more likely to be similarly traumatic in causation, the unifying explanation being inherently more probable. Secondly, Dr Cary properly drew to my attention the fact that in his post-mortem report, he had also described the hymen on the right side of the introitus as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;looking slightly ragged&#8217;</span>.  </p>

The evidence relating to this issue is complicated, reflecting the fact that it is based on a ratio of possibilities which are inevitably circumscribed by the available samples and the shared DNA profile within the family. There were very weak individual DNA components on the lace netting, S&#8217;s underwear and on her body (under the nails and her face). I do not draw from this that there is any correlation between the weakness of the profile and the extent of the contact. Both experts advised me this is a false assumption. It was confirmed in evidence, as indeed it emerges from the reports, that the DNA material here should be regarded as having a forensic return of nil. </p>

Whatever criticisms might legitimately be made of their investigation, I am bound to say I do not consider that to be one of them. However, for this hearing, searches have been undertaken and it transpires that there is one match for one sample and fifty matches for another. Any significance in this is entirely illusory. I repeat, it has no statistical forensic value. As both experts confirmed, the genetic material amounted to something <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;weaker than a trace&#8217; </span>i.e. it was not a profile or even a partial profile.

Dr Miller recognises that this is a very <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;imprecise science&#8217;</span>. Dr Cary noted that it can be helpful <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;where there is a very wide range of timings possible&#8217;</span>. Selfevidently that is not the case here. We are considering the late hours of Saturday in November 2016 through to the morning of the Sunday in November 2016 in relation to the strangulation and a probable window of between twelve and twenty-four hours in relation to the genital injuries. Nonetheless it is important to record what Dr Miller says: </p>

Different food types are broken down and/or pass through the stomach into the small intestines at varying rates, with soft carbohydrates and well chewed, cooked protein sources often being amongst the first solid items to leave.  Given the close similarity to intelligence known regarding the range of foods consumed and timings thereof, this would suggest strongly that death or trauma leading to death has occurred within only a few hours of consumption of the pancakes at 21.00hrs.  This interpretation reflects the fact that pancakes are a soft carbohydrate source that disaggregate and transit from the stomach relatively quickly.  Furthermore, rice and meat from the meal eaten around 17.00hrs were also still present in moderate quantities. There was a moderate fat content in the stomach and regular top up with carbohydrates, both of which would slow transit rate somewhat.  Nevertheless, based on intelligence known and the evidence presented, I consider it more likely that the assault leading to death occurred in the early part of the night.  If [S] had slept all night under normal circumstances then died shortly before she was found, her stomach would have been practically or entirely empty.  </span></p>

Having read the parties&#8217; written submissions carefully, I do not see any substantive disagreement. Based on the observations post-mortem, there was a consensus that the genital injuries were sustained up to twelve to twenty-four hours before death. With what was plainly an abundance of caution, the pathologists considered the time window could potentially be extended to seventy-two hours. In relation to time of death all that can be said is that rigor mortis had set in by the time the police and ambulance services arrived.  Accordingly, death occurred sometime during the course of the night, probably in the earlier hours of the morning.</p>

The Local Authority contend that this is a case of sexual assault and homicide perpetrated by a family member or members. Ms Ball and Mr Bagchi QC, who appear on behalf of the parents, contend that the strangulation was in consequence of an accident involving a fall from the top bunk during which the injuries to the genitals were also sustained. Mr Twomey advances a case of an intruder in the night, unheard and unseen by any family member. He refines that case to include both the complete stranger and a Mr B who, at some time, resided with the family and is thought, at least potentially, to have access to keys to the house.  </p>

With great respect to Mr Twomey, who has presented his case with characteristic skill, I have found the theory of the stranger/intruder ultimately to be redundant of coherent argument. Fact finding hearings have an investigative, dynamic complexion to them. The consequences of adverse findings against parents or carers may be profound and life changing. It is for these reasons judges frequently permit great latitude in the presentation of these difficult cases. That does not extend to the unarguable.

During her oral submissions, I extended to her the opportunity to clarify whether, if I found that the injuries to the hymen were real as opposed to artefactual, it was her case that they too were sustained during the course of the fall. I recognise that this is a challenging question and that it really can only permit of one answer in the light of the case advanced. Ms Ball confirmed this is her case. In making that concession Ms Ball must logically confront the fact that the expert evidence indicates that penetrative injuries are not seen in such accidents. Notwithstanding this evidence and because I consider the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;straddle injury&#8217;</span> has been used without appropriate precision, I have tried to envisage how a penetrative injury could have occurred by the mechanism Ms Ball suggests. I have been unable to do so. It strikes me, largely as a matter of common sense, that this is highly improbable.

If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.&#8221;</span></p>

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one.&#8221; </span></p>

The fact that an individual was living with or may have visited a child within a window of opportunity should not easily be regarded as sufficient to discharge the relevant standard of proof.

I see that in interview he said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I only watched the interesting games at the start&#8217;</span> His life revolves around his studies, his friends and his football. With the characteristic self-absorption of a 17-year-old boy, he expressed little interest in what his mother, sisters and other family members had been doing that day. Having found him to be entirely reliable in his account of the Saturday, including the late evening, I also accept that he slept in his bed until the following morning. There is congruency and consistency to E&#8217;s evidence. </p>

It confirmed that the United match that E wished to watch had been one of the earlier matches, confirming his account that he went to bed earlier than F and W, who watched the remainder of the programme. I do not see any great significance in his telling the police, in interview, that he watched the Bournemouth match, which was the seventh of the eight matches screened that night. As Mr Tughan says he may have seen the start of the match but have lost interest having heard the score in the barbers earlier that day (as he related). Ultimately, the significance of all this is that it reveals E&#8217;s timings to the police to be inaccurate and it supports his assertion that he went to bed earlier than the others. In relation to the identified inaccuracies I was impressed that E did not seek in any way to gainsay or dispute the accuracies of the record.</p>

As Mr Goodwin puts it <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;there was no emotional affect&#8217;</span> nor was there <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;manifestation of the physical pain to be expected of her injuries&#8217;</span>. She ate her evening meal of chicken, rice and pancakes. Sadly, this is confirmed by Dr Miller&#8217;s analysis of the stomach contents. Though I do not put any great emphasis on it, I note that Dr Miller considered the meal would have been consumed at around 9pm on the Saturday night. F describes how S kissed him goodnight as she went to bed and he settled down to watch the football. All of this is uncontentious within the family, it has consistency and congruity to it and I accept it as reliable evidence.</p>

I was told that it is traditional within the OC community for a mother not to leave the house for several weeks after the birth of her child. I note, again, that this broadly coincides with E&#8217;s characterisation of his family as culturally traditional. Z was born on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2016. M described him to me as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a baby who rarely slept&#8217;</span>. She told me that he would sometimes cry for hours and she was unable to stop him. She described those first few weeks of his life as &#8216;hard&#8217;. I sensed that she had found it a real struggle. She told me that she spent most of her time in her bedroom with Z trying to calm him, snatching sleep when she could. M has been very clear both in her statements and in her evidence, at this and in the earlier hearing, that Z would rarely sleep until about 2 or 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning and even then, fitfully and for short periods. </p>

M said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;S loved looking after us&#8217;</span>. Everybody agreed that S was great fun, she loved dressing up and, according to her mother, enjoyed helping her with the baby. I note that on the Saturday morning it was S who brought M her breakfast in bed. She then started getting the house ready, clearing and tidying it up. M told me in her evidence that S performed these chores with greater care and diligence than she had requested. The boys helped. In her evidence M told me that E and S were of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a similar nature&#8217;</span> by which she explained that they were &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">quick to help, not having to be asked&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;always kind&#8217;</span>.

I suspect he wanted to create a favourable impression. M eventually left the house, she told me, at around 4pm, to drive to see her husband&#8217;s cousin N, with whom she is plainly very close. According to M she and the younger children stayed at N&#8217;s until quite late. I was told that a lot of food had been prepared and that the day was full of laughter and joking.

Mr Twomey has explored the possibility that S may have been sexually assaulted during the forty minutes that she left the house with her cousin to buy Shawarma, a type of bread. Nobody has suggested that S was distressed on her return or made any complaint at any stage. I discount it as entirely improbable that S was sexually assaulted on her visit to the shop. </p>

It was already past 9pm. When F telephoned her, he, having finished work, M told me that she deliberately concealed from him the fact that she was going to SO&#8217;s house. SO is older than M and obviously respected by her. In her evidence M told me that she had perpetrated this deception because she thought F would be displeased at her still being out so late at night. I found this entirely unconvincing. It attributes to F an authority in the household that I find he simply did not hold. M was the dominant personality, she would have felt no need at all to explain herself. I consider there is some more sinister reason why she lied about her whereabouts to her husband. </p>

This proved to be quite difficult as Mrs G had been travelling overseas. Ms Ball, I think, suspected that she had been trying to evade coming to court. In fact, nothing could have been further from the truth. Although Mrs G had been a foster carer with the Local Authority for eighteen years, she told me that they persisted in sending all her letters to an address further down her street. She told me she had repeatedly complained about this but to no avail. Whilst she was away her daughter went to visit the house. The neighbour gave her the missing letters and the daughter forwarded them on to her mother. Mrs G told me that she immediately realised it was important and decided to fly back at once. </p>

However, she had been advised that this was no longer regarded as appropriate by social services and she was required gently to encourage him back to his own room. Mrs G was advised by social services to record daily events in a diary. I am bound to say that having seen the diary I regard her records as rather chaotic. For example, events are sometimes recorded on the wrong day in the diary. She may not be a good record keeper but in my assessment, she struck me as an outstanding foster carer. </p>

I went to see my GP, there was a temporary doctor and he was shocked at the mutilation that had happened to me. He could not understand how I had got pregnant. He said that everything was very difficult due to the FGM. In March 2001 he referred me to Kings College Hospital and I was on the waiting list for a few months. I refer to page 1 of &#8216;LA3&#8217; for a copy of the referral from my GP.

This would have the effect of imposing upon those deemed to be within &#8216;the pool of potential perpetrators&#8217; an almost impossible evidential burden to be excluded. The test is not who can be &#8216;ruled out&#8217; or &#8216;exculpated&#8217;, both words should be expunged from the lexicon of these investigations, the exercise, as Jackson LJ has stated, must be framed in a way which reflects the fact that the burden of proof remains, throughout, on the Local Authority to identify whether there is a likelihood or real possibility that A or B was the perpetrator of the inflicted injuries. No lesser test permits the finding. </p>

What is postulated therefore is an apparently silent and brutal sexual assault (having regard to the extent of the genital injuries) followed by a strangulation.

There is, accordingly, no realistic opportunity for S to have sustained the genital injuries at a time when she was not in M&#8217;s care. The hypotheses of a sexual assault on S during her visit to the shop and about which she made no complaint or exhibited any distress, lacks any coherency or cogency.  It can properly be discounted. </p>

Y&#8217;s remarks were said in the context of different observations made by him at a time when Mrs G considered that he was trying to make sense of his sister&#8217;s death. For all the reasons I have set out above I agree entirely with the foster carer&#8217;s analysis which I consider to be well reasoned, objective and insightful. I also consider that her description of X as determined to keep her younger brother silent concerning the circumstances of S&#8217;s death is accurate and objective. I remind myself that I was told on behalf of the family that talk of these matters would be between the women and in the absence of the men. The suggestion advanced by M&#8217;s counsel that Y had become confused with male circumcision is unconvincing given the context and detail of Y&#8217;s remarks.  </p>

She had not been able to speak with SO as she had hoped earlier in the evening and had lied about her unsuccessful visit to SO to her husband.

I do not consider that, on a proper construction, there is any evidence to suggest that there is a real likelihood or a real possibility that W could have been responsible for his sister&#8217;s injuries and subsequent death. Though both the Local Authority and the Guardian contend that he should remain in the pool of perpetrators I cannot identify any evidential basis upon which they invite me to do so. Thus, the only person in the household likely to have been awake when S was killed was her mother. Drawing all the above strands of evidence together I consider that it was she who, on the balance of probabilities, caused the genital injuries earlier in the day and strangled S during the night. </p>

Nonetheless, I am told the Local Authority evaluate her denouncement of the practice of FGM as convincing. I am not prepared to make this exception to my assessment of her damaged credibility. Whilst her criticism of FGM was articulate, I was not persuaded of its authenticity. Following the discovery of S&#8217;s body M told me she was too distressed and weak to go upstairs to see her daughter for herself. Certainly, when the police and paramedics were present she made no attempt to do so. She told me that she accepted what F had seen. I consider that she had no need to go upstairs to find out what had happened - she already knew. </p>

Despite M&#8217;s denial, I consider that the genital injuries are more likely to be in consequence of some failed attempt at FGM. By this I mean, the genital injuries were sustained in a manner which was not sexually motivated. It was either an intimate investigation by way of preparation or, more likely, an actual attempt at FGM, in which S was successfully able to resist. I consider the latter to be more likely because this assault is, for all the reasons I have set out, intrinsically linked to the strangulation that followed. I am not prepared to speculate about the actual circumstances. S made no complaint of what were quite significant genital injuries nor, I am told, did she exhibit any distress at home later that evening. Had it been a sexual assault I am convinced she would have done. </p>

Neither am I prepared to draw conclusions as to why M caused her daughter&#8217;s death. What is evident is that M had not been sleeping properly since her baby was born, a period of some six weeks. She may not have been thinking clearly. It may be that she was angry with S or that she felt her family had been dishonoured by S in some way. What is clear, is that from the discovery of S&#8217;s body this family has closed itself off to any investigation and has been determined that the full facts should not come to light. The collusion of silence is between the parents, the children are, to differing degrees, caught up in it. </p>
