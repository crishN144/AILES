All offences were committed on a previous partner who was 17 at the time.  He was required to serve a minimum of 11 years.  He was released in 2015 on licence.  Within a few months, he had formed a relationship with the mother and also a second woman who will be referred to as E.  He met the mother on a dating site and E at a nightclub.  Initially, the mother moved into the father&#8217;s flat in (redacted).  She then moved to (redacted), and the father appears to have split his time between (redacted) and (redacted).  He began his relationship with E a few months after the relationship with the mother.  The father moved in with her.  Both the mother and E complained of significant systematic sexual violence and multiple rapes during their relationship with the father, and eventually made complaints to the police.  The mother was interviewed by police on 23 January 2018.  The police charged the father with 31 separate offences for which the father was convicted after trial.  In 2019, the father received 24 life sentences in respect of 24 counts of rape and separate concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two counts of engaging in controlling, coercive behaviour, 30 months each, two counts of false imprisonment, three years each and two counts of threats to kill, four years each.</span></p>

All it means is that you can, after the requisite period, apply for parole.  The sentence that I have decided on the minimum term will, therefore, be 14 years on each count, concurrent, so on all the counts of rape, there will be life sentences, with a minimum period to serve 14 years before you can apply for parole&#8221;.</span></p>

I suffered countless monstrous acts at your hands.  You&#8217;ve pushed me to the depths of despair I&#8217;d never imagined, to the point of no longer valuing my life.  You went out of your way to break me for no other reason than your own gratification, never showing remorse or mercy for the terror you inflicted and causing more suffering by forcing us through the trauma of a trial rather than taking responsibility for your actions.  My life will never the be same; relationships with friends and family lost and tarnished, forced to bring my son out of hospital into a refuge with only a handful of belongings, suffering anxiety and depression.  I am unable to build relationships as I no longer trust my own judgment.  You are not just my abuser, you are my child&#8217;s father, and for our son, I am thankful.  He gave me the strength, courage and purpose I lacked.  He saved my life.  This will never be over for me, not just because of the scars you&#8217;ve left me with but because of your actions.  I am left to someday, somehow, explain things to our son.  I remain hopeful that you do have the humanity to understand what you&#8217;ve done and how this has impacted on many people.  It hasn&#8217;t been easy, but I forgive you for all that you have done for mine and my son&#8217;s sake.  I hope you get the help you need&#8221;.</span></p>

In particular, I respectfully find myself unable to agree with Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls that the only way in which a defendant can do so is by showing that the conviction was obtained by fraud or collusion or by using fresh evidence which he could not have obtained by reasonable diligence before, which is conclusive of his innocence.  The burden of proof of &#8216;the contrary&#8217; that lies upon a defendant under section 11 is the ordinary burden in a civil action: proof on a balance of probabilities; although in the face of a conviction after a full hearing, this is likely to be an uphill task&#8221;.</span></p>

Any use of familiar terms should not give the impression that the abusive parent has been convicted by a criminal court.  Equally, where an abusive parent has, in fact, been convicted of a relevant offence, e.g.,&#160;a sexual or violent offence against the other parent, the conviction is proof of the fact that he or she committed the offence unless the contrary is proved&#8221;.</span></p>

His case is that a criminal case was brought against him in respect of the complaints made by the mother and E, and that the complaints were based on a complete fabrication by the mother and that the mother has coerced E to join with her in falsely accusing the father of multiple serious violent sexual offences.  It was clear from his evidence that he does not and will not accept or acknowledge guilt in respect of a single matter for which he was convicted, and as a result, refuses point blank to undergo any work in respect of sexual violence against women.  There is no insight, contrition or desire to change.  As he said when giving evidence  he will not undergo any such course and admit guilt until his last breath.  </span></p>

Since the father has been incarcerated, it is clear that there have been communications between the mother and the father, either direct or indirect, which continued up until January 2021.  The father has produced documentation to show that the mother was sending him romantic cards and love notes.  These can be seen from G23 to G29, on one occasion, a sexualised letter at G30, books at G33, 11 emails at G62 to G73, six emails, G110 to 115 and three text messages, G116.  It is clear from the documentation that the mother was using different names to avoid the prison authorities discovering their communication.  She changed her name by deed poll.

The father&#8217;s case is simple.  He says that he has been falsely accused and convicted of each and every offence in respect of the mother and E, that the mother&#8217;s conduct after his conviction has been part of a concerted course of controlling and coercive behaviour over him which, in turn, has caused him emotional harm.  He argues that it is clear from the fact that the mother was communicating with him as much as she did and in the manner that she did, that it was to control him and cause him emotional harm.  In other words, he is the victim in all of this. So much so that he now needs the Court&#8217;s protection of a non-molestation injunction.  He asserts that the mother has lied to Social Services, the police, the Courts, the prison authorities and now this Court, and is manipulating the system.  This was, undoubtedly, one of those cases where one has to have the opportunity to see and hear the parties giving evidence to fully understand the import and impact of their credibility on the case.</span></p>

He sought to suggest that it was the mother&#8217;s sophistication that devised the system for communication between the two of them to avoid detection by the prison authorities and was nothing to do with him.  I simply do not believe that, despite the father producing evidence of one Google search by the mother on how to visit someone in prison.  She readily accepted that it was the sort of thing that she would have done at that time as she was still, clearly, dependent upon him notwithstanding the sexual violence that she reported he had perpetrated upon her.  The father was the one with, already, extensive prison experience.  The mother had none.  He well knew what was required.  He said that the communication from the mother was causing him emotional harm.  I do not believe that evidence.  I found him to be a deeply unimpressive witness and I reject his account as fanciful.  Indeed, four of his own comments exposed him for the type of person that he is.</span></p>

On another occasion, he said that he could not say too much as he had employed a private investigator to look into how the mother was living her life.  He then rode back from that to say that he had suggested that to his barrister, (implying a barrister instructed in connection with a proposed criminal appeal).  At another stage in the hearing, he described the mother as having been &#8220;a bit on the side&#8221; of his relationship with E.  Finally, he said, at different points during his closing submissions, that he would tell his son not to be violent with women, not to make the same mistakes he did, and not to be like him.  I also found him to be a person who would misconstrue or misrepresent matters.  At one point, he suggested that I had said that his previous convictions could not be used against him, that they were not relevant.  He went on to suggest that I put that in one of my orders.  None of that was true.  In terms of discharging the burden of proof on him on a balance of probabilities by reason of section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act to show that he was convicted in error in 2019, he did not even begin to do so in my judgment.  </span></p>

I found her to be entirely candid in the way that she dealt with falling back into a relationship, as she perceived it to be, with the father after his convictions, and how she was duped.  She readily admitted her role in deceiving the prison authorities and lies told to Social Services.  As she said, she had not been ready to leave him at that stage.  She clearly still loved him, and it was only over time and with the benefit of professional help that she was able to see the father&#8217;s motives for what they really were.  Like so many survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence, she developed a toxic, mutually dependant  relationship with her abuser.  She simply could not do without him, irrespective of the emotional and physical cost.  </span></p>

In my judgment, she was not being dishonest; she was doing the best she could to remember and was mistaken.  The father did, as he did more than once in the case, latch onto a point that was less than significant to try to create a smokescreen for the real truth.  He also wanted the Court to attach great weight to a report from a cognitive behavioural psychotherapist, F, at G24.  That document does not advance the father&#8217;s case, in my judgment.  The mother gave clear evidence that she had not made false allegations about her stepfather.  </span></p>

Indeed, I find that this father will do whatever it takes to try to undermine his convictions.

Turning, first of all, to C, you met her in early 2016, and, quickly, you were living together in your flat, and then you subjected her to both psychological and physical coercion over a period right to the end of 2017, which involved frequent beatings and humiliation, on occasions, forcibly inflicting intercourse upon her when she did not want it, both anal, vaginal and oral.  She did not have the strength to resist you and became subjugated.  It is right to say that on many occasions, she agreed to consensual sex as she said she loved you, but you had another side of your personality which saw its outlet in controlling her, battering her and raping her repeatedly.  On one occasion, you threatened to kill her and her unborn child, which is completely, as are all the offences, unforgivable.  This was in relation to her, alone, a campaign of forced sex, in my judgment&#8221;.</span></p>

However, sometimes one parent presents too great a risk to have ongoing contact.  Further, any ongoing involvement through the prism of parental responsibility would give rise to risks that outweigh any benefits that this would give.  This, in my judgment, is one of those cases.  The prison offender manager report at D9 refers to a safeguarding children panel at HMP (redacted) on 20 October 2020 which reviewed the father&#8217;s safeguarding children status at the prison.  Following consultation with the Local Authority the committee probation officer, H concluded that it should remain at level one.  On 27 January 2021, a section 47 report by the Local Authority concluded that the threshold for risk of significant harm for A was met, despite the father&#8217;s incarceration and the risk would continue if the mother continued to promote contact.  The recommendation was that A be subject to a child in need plan.  The father suggested that there would be continuous supervision of any form of contact, to include video contact.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian has been informed by the prison authorities that constant supervision at contact, of course, is not possible.  I accept her evidence.  I also prefer her evidence on the issue of what the father said about having to visit his own father in prison and not liking it.

He may feel a sense of rejection, or, alternatively, that it was, in some way, his fault.  Good quality life story work can help to ameliorate that situation.  That will be particularly important in this case in light of his cultural heritage through his father.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian should inform the Local Authority so that they can provide necessary services to the mother.  In my judgment, these are crucially important.  On the other hand, the involvement of the father in A&#8217;s life and that of the mother would, in my judgment, expose A to an unacceptable risk of emotional harm and would expose his mother to a risk of ongoing emotional abuse which would be likely to impact on her ability to recover from the ordeal that she was exposed to at the hands of the father.  That may, in turn, impact on her ability to provide care for A moving forwards and particularly as he grows older.  She will need to be emotionally available for him.

The father was only in his life for a very short time before he was incarcerated.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian properly recognised that there could be a number of different causes for selective mutism but the point is that he is not without his own difficulties, and he will require warm, loving, nurturing care from his mother as a carer, and she will need to be emotionally available to him and not at the mercy of the father&#8217;s malevolent intentions.</span></p>

However, the prison authorities have made it clear that they will not supervise and monitor all forms of contact at all times.  At some stage, the contact would need to progress to direct contacts by visits.  In my judgment, there are insufficient safeguards that could be put in place adequately to protect the child, and the mother, for that matter, and, as the Guardian observed, a re-establishment of any form of contact indirect or direct, would mean that the mother would need to prepare the child for that contact before it took place, and on each and every occasion, and, also, receive the child back after such contact.  In so doing, she would be forced to relive her experiences at the hands of the father rather than being able to establish space and distance from him to enable her healing.  That would then impact on her ability to be emotionally available for A, as she needs to be.  Also, again, as the Children&#8217;s Guardian said, children pick up and feed off anxieties of their parent/carer and that would impact on his emotional sense of wellbeing.</span></p>

I agree with her.  I accept that the father does, in his own way, love his son and does want to play an active part in his son&#8217;s life.  Unfortunately, I am not satisfied that his involvement in the life of his son and the mother can take place in a way that is safe.  On the other hand, the evidence is that the mother is providing good-enough care for her son presently, and absent the father in her life, that is likely to continue.  </span></p>

Whilst he sought to downplay the extent to which he would want to be involved, in my judgment, he is the sort of personality who quickly would be looking to become more and more authoritative in terms of decision-making around his son.  That would put an unacceptable burden on the mother to work together with this father to discharge the parental responsibility that each of them would have if I made an order for parental responsibility in favour of the father.  In my judgment, it would be to put the mother in an emotional vortex where she was forced to communicate with the father regularly about important decisions in A&#8217;s life.  There would be no escape for her.  She would also be at risk and vulnerable to malevolent intention upon his part.  It would expose her and A to a risk of emotional harm.</span></p>

In this case, the prison authorities have assessed the father as a level one risk.  That means that as far as the prison authorities are concerned, the father should not have any form of contact with any child.  I am aware that the father has made a complaint against one or more of the probation officers that he has dealt with, and, certainly, one has been taken off his case, pending investigation.  I have made it clear that following the judgment of MacDonald J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Z v Z (Contact in Prison) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">[2021] EWFC 47, a full welfare consideration is required from the Family Court so that either party can return to the prison authorities with a decision of the Family Court.  If in favour of contact, then the father could potentially apply for judicial review of the decision-making of the prison authorities if they maintained their refusal to permit any form of contact.  Nevertheless, it is indicative of the level of risk this father is assessed to pose by the prison authorities who are charged with the task of dealing with him on a daily basis.  I do, however, make my own assessment, and do not feel bound by their assessment.</span></p>

I intend to make a section 91(14) order to prevent the father making any application for a child arrangements order or an order for parental responsibility in respect of A for a period of 10 years.  Whilst that is an exceptionally long period, in my view, this is an exceptional case because of the nature of the father&#8217;s offending, his failure to accept the convictions, his attempts to influence the mother to retract her evidence and his sophisticated, controlling personality, as I find it to be.  I am satisfied that the current applications of the father have been abusive and emotionally harmful for the mother.  Further applications would be likely to impact on A to an increasing extent as his awareness and understanding grows.  They would impact on the mother in a harmful way and that would cause her anxiety, which A would be likely to feed off.  I am, therefore, satisfied that further applications by the father, without leave, would put the mother particularly but also A at risk of harm.  </span></p>

In addition, he will also begin to understand the issues in a way that means the Court would have to attach some weight to his views.  At that stage, the father will need to have developed better insight into his offending and the consequences of it for his erstwhile partners and to have accepted it.  That may be a forlorn hope, but it may be that the Court considers making an order for indirect contact at that stage.  I have tried to hold a balance between the need to protect the mother and A whilst also factoring in the possibility that things can change sufficiently for the Court to revisit the issue of indirect contact.</span></p>
