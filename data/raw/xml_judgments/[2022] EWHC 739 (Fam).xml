	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant is the father, and the First Respondent the mother of two boys, V, aged 8 years 8 months, and W aged 7 years 6 months. The family is Lithuanian, both children having been born and brought up there until the mother moved with them to England in December 2020 where, except for a short visit back to Lithuania in January 2021, they have remained. The father applies for a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention. The mother accepts that she wrongfully removed the children from Lithuania where they were habitually resident. She does not argue that the father consented to the removal or has acquiesced in the children&#8217;s retention, nor could she given that she left without informing the father or the Lithuanian courts which were dealing with family proceedings at the time, and she kept the whereabouts of herself and the children hidden for several months. The mother does contend that the court is not bound to order the return of the children because of the grave risk of harm and children&#8217;s objections exceptions under Article 13 of the convention and that the court ought not to order their return.</p>

	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A distinctive feature of this case is that there have been many applications, hearings and decisions involving the Lithuanian courts and authorities in the last two years, including on 25 May 2021, a decision of the District Court that the children, who had been living with the mother, should be removed from her care and residence transferred to the father. That decision is under appeal with judgment expected on 7 April 2022. Given that the hearing before me was conducted on 21 and 22 March 2022 I considered whether to proceed, and whether to give judgment, prior to the appeal judgment. The parties did not request an adjournment, nor did they ask me to await the appeal decision before giving judgment. For reasons that will be evident from what follows, I have decided to proceed and to give my judgment prior to the appeal decision. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the judgment of the District Court in May 2021 there are findings that the mother was causing the children to be hostile to the father and that she was obstructing their contact with the father. In fact the mother had absconded with the children during the course of the proceedings, abducting them to England, and she had not revealed her whereabouts to the Court. One issue for me to determine is the extent to which I am bound by findings made in the Lithuanian courts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 March 2022 the Regional Court, which is hearing the appeal in question, suspended the residence order of the District Court pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father has had no contact with the children, other than by sending them cards and letters, since August 2020. His application herein was made on 25 October 2021. The children&#8217;s whereabouts was only discovered after a Location Order was made by the High Court on 26 October 2021. The mother and children&#8217;s address is still not to be disclosed to the father. Judd J and then Newton J made directions giving permission for expert evidence from Dr Campbell, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, for translations of documents from the Lithuanian proceedings, for contact by way of letters and cards only, and for the appointment of a children&#8217;s guardian who is Ms Magson.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has been clear that she would return to Lithuania with the children if their return were ordered. The father has offered protective measures to apply if a return order were made but he has not agreed not to enforce any order that the children should live with him nor to apply for a stay of any such order. Hence, upon a return now to Lithuania, in the absence of any contrary agreement by the parents, subject to the Lithuanian court orders, the children would remain with the mother until the appeal decision on 7 April 2022, and thereafter would either remain living with her if the appeal were successful or would be transferred to live with the father if the appeal were dismissed. In either event it is very likely that the Lithuanian courts would order contact with the other parent. </p>

On behalf of the mother, Ms Cabeza suggested that I hear oral evidence from the Guardian and, on the question of protective measures, from the father. I gave the father time to clarify his instructions in relation to protective measures and he produced a further short position statement to which I shall return. In the light of his clarification and the fact that the mother&#8217;s challenge to the Guardian concerns the correct legal approach to the Lithuanian court findings, which could be dealt with by submissions, I decided that I did not need to take the exceptional course of hearing oral evidence. The documentary evidence includes expert reports from Dr Campbell, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, from the Guardian, Ms Magson, and voluminous documentary evidence from the courts and authorities in Lithuania including brief psychological assessments of the children and &#8220;Children&#8217;s Rights&#8221; reports on each of them. </p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified.  It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.&#8221;</p>

The court does not simply assume, without more, the maximum level of risk contended for by the abducting parent.  Rather, the court examines the information available to it and, having considered that information, arrives at a reasoned and reasonable assumption as to the maximum level of risk having regard to the available evidence.  </p>

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.&#8221;</p>

In particular, it would not lead to considerations which are undoubtedly relevant being lost, as they will be given full consideration as part of the discretionary stage. It would be unwise of me to attempt to expand or improve upon the list in &#167;46 of Re M of the sort of factors that are relevant at that stage, although I would emphasise that I would not view that list as exhaustive because it is difficult to predict what will weigh in the balance in a particular case. The factors do not revolve only around the child's objections, as is apparent. The court has to have regard to other welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence that will be available as part of the summary proceedings. And importantly, it must give weight to the Hague Convention considerations. It must at all times be borne in mind that the Hague Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly. To reiterate what Baroness Hale said at &#167;42 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, "[t]he message must go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among contracting states".</p>

It is not necessary to establish that the child has &#8220;a wholesale objection&#8221; to returning to the country of habitual residence and &#8220;cannot think of anything positive to say about that other country&#8221;. The exception is established if the judge concludes, simply, that the child objects to returning to the country of habitual residence. Mr Williams QC reminded us, rightly, that the Convention is applicable in a large number of countries and that &#8220;objects&#8221; has an autonomous meaning, but he did not advance a proposed definition in amplification or explanation of the words of the Convention itself. That was prudent, in my view. Whether a child objects is a question of fact, and the word &#8220;objects&#8221; is sufficient on its own to convey to a judge hearing a Hague Convention case what has to be established; further definition may be more likely to mislead or to generate debate than to assist.&#8221;</p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

The father was the subject of criminal investigation and was remanded with conditions not to contact the children. The mother made complaints to the police, and when they ultimately decided to take no action - on 12 January 2021, on the basis that &#8220;no act having characteristics of a criminal offence has been committed&#8221; - she complained about that decision (formal complaint dated 19 January 2021). Her complaint was dismissed on 8 March 2021.

The lengthy court decision, which I have read in full, was that the children should be removed from the mother to live with the father. It was based on findings that the mother had moved the children&#8217;s home repeatedly, causing instability, and that she was manipulating them against the father.</p>

The children were reported to be opposed to seeing the father, although V&#8217;s attitude was more equivocal after discussions with the psychologist. They both had good bonds with the mother. They were anxious about seeing the father. They both reported to the psychologist that the father had beaten W. In the Children&#8217;s Rights reports, which appear to be similar to a Cafcass report in this jurisdiction, the children were consistent in their reporting of the physical beating of W by the father, witnessed by V. The children were said to have a good bond with the mother but did not want to see the father. The father had attended a 20 hour course on &#8220;conscious parenting&#8221;, the children were seeing a psychologist, and the mother was undergoing therapy. The reporter noted the mother&#8217;s hostility to the father and the father&#8217;s complaint that she had made up the allegation of assault against W as an excuse to prohibit contact with the children. There was no recommendation to change the residence of the children, but rather to work with the family to promote contact with the father. The mother eventually ceased co-operation and, as is now known, took the children with her to England.</p>

He told her that he had known that they were leaving Lithuania to stay in England and had had a chance to say goodbye to others (but not his father). He described how the father had hurt W, twisting his ear. The father had not hurt V but he would become very angry with both brothers if they were naughty. He described his paternal grandparents in Lithuania as being on &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s team&#8221;. His mother had told him that she had paid for everything and the father for nothing. He preferred school in England to Lithuania and preferred the shops and activities here. He wanted to remain in England and preferred living here. He did not want to see his father.

Police checks had revealed that the father had been convicted of a public order offence, a breach of the peace, in Lithuania in 2014 for which he had been fined. It was reported to Ms Magson that following her initial discussions with the children they had become unsettled, W especially. The allocated social worker reported that the mother was engaging well with services to support the children.  In the light of the court documents Ms Magson expressed caution about the extent to which the children&#8217;s views as expressed to her could be considered to be authentically their own. She noted that the Lithuanian court had been satisfied that the children could be kept safe in the father&#8217;s care. She noted that it was &#8220;not evident&#8221; that the mother had raised in Lithuania the &#8220;full extent&#8221; of domestic abuse she now alleges which involves an allegation of rape against the father. She concluded that she did not put forward an active case to oppose the children&#8217;s summary return to Lithuania but would support a short delay if their return is ordered to ensure the services can be identified to support their return and for a copy of the judgment of this court and her reports to be obtained, translated, and provided to the authorities in Lithuania.</p>

The father has not been willing to agree to protective measures that would militate against that risk. The mother has acted at all times to protect the children from the father. It is not unusual for a victim of sexual and physical abuse not to make full allegations at an early stage. In fact the mother had learned to obey the father and up until August 2020 was still insisting on the children seeing the father for contact. The beating of W was the last straw and it was the authorities who imposed restrictions on the father seeing the children. The father breached those orders and has himself used the court as a means of trying to control the mother &#8211; he applied for a change of residence very soon after the mother reported to child protection authorities that he had beaten W; he unsuccessfully applied to enforce financial orders against the mother. He did manage to have her assets frozen for a time. The fact that the police did not bring charges against the father does not mean that he did not beat W as the children have alleged. The father knows that the children have not had contact with him for over 18 months and are fearful of him, even if he believes that is due to manipulation by the mother, but he will not agree to a gradual reintroduction of the children to him, or to stay the effect of the order for a change of residence.</p>

The findings of the Lithuanian court in May 2021 are damning of the mother and the children require protection from her.

In the circumstances I do not regard the fact that she has not previously raised allegations of sexual, physical and emotional abuse of her during the relationship as a reason to dismiss those allegations that are made now, in these proceedings. They have not been investigated in Lithuania or taken into account by the courts there. The allegations are strongly denied by the father and they have not been tested in these summary proceedings. I therefore adopt the approach articulated by MacDonald J in <span style="font-style:italic">MB v TB</span> (above), namely, to examine the information available and to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable assumption as to the maximum level of risk having regard to the available evidence.  </p>

In either event they would be likely to spend time with the other parent, at least that is what the courts in Lithuania would be likely to order. An order for return would not conflict with the orders of the Lithuanian courts. A refusal to order the return of the children would not prohibit the Lithuanian courts from determining the appeal and making residence orders as they consider appropriate. The father could apply for enforcement of the judgment of 25 May 2021 or on appeal. The father could apply for child arrangements orders in this jurisdiction, including for the children to live with him in Lithuania. The court would have to consider issues of jurisdiction and welfare, having full regard to the recognition of the Lithuanian authorities&#8217; decisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> Much has happened in these children&#8217;s lives since the decision of the District Court on 25 May 2021. They are established in family life, school and social life in England. They have not seen their father.  They are both older and more mature. I have further evidence relevant to the Art 13 exceptions. Whilst recognising the Lithuanian court&#8217;s decision of May 2021 I must have regard to all the evidence now before this court. Therefore, even if I am bound by findings of fact made by the Lithuanian court in May 2021 those were findings made on the evidence before that court, whilst the evidence before me is more extensive if only because of the events that have occurred since May 2021. On my reading of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">E (BIIa: Recognition and Enforcement)</span> (above) a court in this jurisdiction is not necessarily bound by welfare decisions taken in another jurisdiction (assuming it is a contracting state) if there has been a sufficient change in circumstances to necessitate a fresh welfare assessment. It would be wrong to review the substance of the previous court orders &#8211; to rule on the rulings &#8211; but once the court has embarked on a welfare assessment the previous rulings are to be regarded as part of the &#8220;whole picture&#8221; &#8211; see [76] of the judgment of Peter Jackson LJ . I am not engaged in a welfare assessment but the principle I apply is that the Lithuanian court decisions are recognised and are part of the whole picture. I also recognise the findings of fact made by the Lithuanian court in May 2021 and I do not re-open those findings. However, in considering the issues I have to determine I evaluate all the evidence including the findings made in Lithuania. I do not stop my enquiry at 25 May 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the allegations that the father beat W in early August 2020 and had been violent to the children previously with unreasonable chastisement, I have regard to the findings of the Lithuanian court which were that there were no visible injuries on W when examined on 10 August 2020 ([23] of the decision);  that the criminal investigation had been closed as the evidence to that investigation had been unreliable and inconsistent and no crime was disclosed [24]; that the mother&#8217;s attempts to gather evidence by recording discussions with the children about the beating were not probative and were harmful to the children [26]; and that expert reports did not confirm the alleged beating [27]. Nevertheless, the Lithuanian court did not find that the allegation was concocted nor can I identify a clear finding that some form of beating did not occur in early August 2020 or that the father had not physically punished the children. I am not therefore bound to accept findings to that effect. I do take into account the findings that the mother had influenced the children to be hostile towards the father and that she had constantly told them of the violence they had suffered at his hands [40]. As such, considerable caution has to be exercised in relation to the allegations made by the children and their voiced objections to returning to Lithuania. I note V&#8217;s references to financial arrangements between his parents and his reference to his paternal grandparents being on his father&#8217;s &#8220;team&#8221;. These are indicators that the mother has influenced his thinking to become hostile to the father. However, the children have repeated the allegations of the father beating W independently and consistently to the Guardian. They did so in a way that appears to have been genuine and unrehearsed. I do not doubt the sincerity of their feelings of fear about the father and of their emotional associations with his chastisement of W, even though the mother has strongly contributed to those feelings. </p>

They were receiving psychological support and Children&#8217;s Rights services were involved. By comparison, although there has been involvement of the Guardian, a psychologist and an allocated social worker,  they have enjoyed a more stable life in England and appear to be doing well at school &#8211; V is thriving and W has become more settled and is making progress. Neither wants to return to Lithuania. They are clear in expressing their wishes not to return. V in particular has given reasons for objecting to a return: he prefers his school here, the available activities here, and the shops here. He misses his maternal grandmother in Lithuania suggesting that he does not have a wholly binary view of that country. In my judgement his assertions do amount to objections to return. Furthermore, he has attained an age and maturity at which, I am satisfied on the evidence about him, it is appropriate that take his objections into account.</p>

The children are psychologically very dependent on their mother at this stage of their lives. They would be deeply affected were her mental health to deteriorate.

As to other financial arrangements, the father&#8217;s position is that the mother and children could live in the mother&#8217;s home in Lithuania (she agrees it would be available to her) but that child maintenance &#8220;has already been determined by the court in Lithuania&#8221;, that any medical or therapeutic treatment would be available free of charge, and that the mother could rely on state benefits.

On the one hand such court orders, if upheld on appeal, are intended to be for the benefit of the children and so the father might well not agree to ignore them if to do so would be harmful to the children. On the other hand, the order for residence was made in May 2021 and the circumstances for the children are now very different and would be very different on return. The father took time to clarify his views on protective measures about child arrangements and chose a firm line as set out in a brief, further position statement provided during the lunch adjournment on the first day of the hearing. In that document he did not acknowledge any possibility, even in the interim, of the children being returned with his agreement in their mother&#8217;s care and a gradual reintroduction of him into their lives after a gap of over 18 months. He did not recognise the impact on the children of a forced return to Lithuania. His proposals do not provide for a &#8220;soft landing&#8221; for then children but a very &#8220;hard landing&#8221;, potentially leaving their mother&#8217;s care upon or shortly after return.

He believes that the children are being harmed in the mother&#8217;s care and require removal. He has not reflected on the children&#8217;s viewpoint and the need to protect them from the risk of harm and to avoid placing them in an intolerable situation. It is insufficient simply to rely on the authorities in Lithuania to protect the children because, with respect to them, they will not have time to scrutinise all the evidence that has emerged since May 2021 including the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father, and the children&#8217;s changed circumstances and experiences, in time before the appeal decision. The court is asked to order summary return. Even if some delay is built in to an order for return to allow information to be given to the authorities in Lithuania, such delay can only be for a relatively short period. The 1980 Convention is not intended to secure return, where appropriate, several months in the future when the court does not know what circumstances will prevail. In those circumstances there appear to me to be no sufficient protective measures available to ensure that the children&#8217;s return to Lithuania can be managed so as to avoid a grave risk of harm or intolerability. </p>
