There have been significant modifications to the property, which, according to AW, have mostly been paid for from OB&#8217;s funds.

Having compared similar properties in the same area, the average price for the property is between &#163;250,000 and &#163;363,000. There has been no declaration of trust to show OB&#8217;s beneficial interest in the property.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">[9] AW refutes [the OPG&#8217;s] criticisms. She has acted throughout with OB&#8217;s full consent and approval and in OB&#8217;s best interests. It is only recently that OB&#8217;s failing memory has led to any concern about her mental capacity, and until that time she was able to and did agree to the use of her money to make improvements to AW&#8217;s house which would enable them both to live there more safely and comfortably. It should be remembered that OB had made no contribution to the household expenses between 2007 and 2011, and that AW had just had to give up her job. OB wanted to continue to live with AW and to be cared for by her, and yet AW did not have sufficient funds with which to carry out maintenance and improvement to the property which was necessary to enable AW to care for OB there safely and effectively. </p>

First, OB needed AW&#8217;s care. Second, she had no liquid resources until her own house sold some four years later in 2010. How could OB have been able to afford somewhere more suitable to live? Where would have been more suitable than AW&#8217;s house, given that AW, a trained and capable nurse would be providing OB&#8217;s care?</p>

The relevant question, in any case, was whether the expenditure of the money on the works was done (a) with OB&#8217;s consent whilst she had capacity or (b) bona fide in what the attorney considered to be in her best interest once she had begun to lose it, and not whether the expenditure added value to AW&#8217;s property. This was not an investment: the expenditure was designed to achieve a specific aim, which was of increasing OB&#8217;s safety and amenity whilst living with AW.</p>

The plain fact of the matter is that AW has sacrificed her job, a large part of her pension, her social life, her holidays and her health to look after her mother. It is clear from the Visitor&#8217;s report that OB understands that she is cared for by her daughter, that her daughter makes financial decisions on her behalf, and that improvements to her daughter&#8217;s house were carried out using her money &#8211; a situation with which she appears to be entirely happy.</p>

This situation results directly from the fact that AW gave up work to care for OB in 2011. AW never received any assistance from her sister, DH, and, until the recent appointment of Greenway Homecare, no agency carers could be found whose standard of work was adequate to cope with OB&#8217;s complex medical condition. No criticism has been made of AW in respect of this use of OB&#8217;s funds.</p>

The relationship between them is not good, since AW considers that DH could and should have done more to care for OB and at least be able to cover for her to allow her to go out for an evening or for a short holiday. DH has never taken any interest in OB&#8217;s financial affairs, and her one involvement has been to borrow &#163;4,000 from OB which she is not presently repaying.</p>

AW has had experience of the Council&#8217;s involvement in commissioning carers to provide care for OB in 2007/2008, and was unimpressed by the care provided or the efficiency with which the Council dealt with the matter. It is possible that the Council might have future involvement with OB, in which case it might have a conflict of interest, and it is clear from the email from Debbie Glover of the Council to Stacey Webster of the OPG that even the Council thinks that a panel deputy might be more appropriate.</p>

In reply to a question I asked AW about not involving her sister - her co-attorney - in the decision-making process, she stated that it was her intention that she should be the sole attorney, but Mr Pinks, the solicitor to whom she had taken her mother to draw up the LPA had other ideas, and had allowed OB to appoint AW and DH jointly and severally as her attorneys. AW expressed her dissatisfaction with Mr Pinks, which may account for the fact that she chose to instruct another firm of solicitors to act in the sale of OB&#8217;s property and yet another firm to represent her in these proceedings.</p>

I find on having checked my file that whilst I was instructed by OB to draft the new will on 15th September 2008 and subsequently drafted a will for her, this does not appear to have been signed. I enclose a copy of my attendance note dated 15th September 2008, a copy of the draft will which I prepared for OB (which may have been signed, if so I am unaware) together with a copy of the earlier will of 2004. Given AW&#8217;s relationship with her mother it is of course highly possible that she sought advice elsewhere for a will in different form but I am afraid I have no knowledge of this and may be unnecessarily apprehensive.&#8221;</p>

My mother read and approved the 2013 will when it was signed. I was happy that she understood the nature and effect of the contents of it and that it purported to be in the same terms as her draft will. I was not present when the will was signed.&#8221;</p>

The most sensitive task was to pitch a care allowance (usually for the parents of a brain injured child or young adult) at an appropriate level, having regard to all the circumstances, including the size of the estate and the extent of the care provided. I would discuss the Income Tax and National Insurance implications of such an allowance, which are now contained in HM Revenue &amp; Customs ESM4016 &#8211; Particular occupations: care workers&#8217; payments under Court of Protection order or from trust fund. We would also consider the respective contributions of the patient and the family members towards any newly acquired accommodation and ensure that the respective beneficial interests of all contributors were adequately safeguarded by means of a declaration of trust and the entry of a restriction on the proprietorship register at the Land Registry. Something similar should have happened in this case.</p>

The Court of Protection General Visitor noted that, &#8220;although aware that she is contributing towards household expenses and stating that she was happy with some of her money being used for adaptation work she stated that her lawyer was the one to approve.&#8221; This suggests that OB did not expect AW to make certain decisions without consulting her solicitor or to have unfettered access to her funds.</p>
