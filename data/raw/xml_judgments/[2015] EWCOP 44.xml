The court is extremely grateful that PL&#8217;s social worker was able to carry out an assessment of CC at short notice and within the strict timetable suggested by the court.  A fourth statement sets out in some detail the inquiries she made of the organisation, the accommodation offered, their ability to meet the needs of people with complex needs such as PL, the provision of sensory abilities, indoor space, as well as outdoor and the care package that would be provided.  In addition consideration had properly been given as to how PL&#8217;s educational needs would be met, in particular by reference to the local college. </span></p>

She was further of the view that in order to ensure the placement at OL was a long term option (that being her preferred choice over CC), contact between PL and AL should be off-site.  This being a reiteration of the view she had expressed in her earlier witness statements in February and March.  </span></p>

The court can well understand the frustration of a mother who has spent some nineteen years bringing up, caring for and visiting her son  with whom she has a special relationship when she perceives others charged with his care may not be discharging those functions in necessarily the same way that she would.  AL was able to articulate those concerns in her witness statement, in her very careful and helpful critique of the ISW report, the assessment of CC and in giving her oral evidence as to what she believed was in the best interests of PL.  It was very telling that during her evidence she indicated she was prepared to comply with restrictions on contact, restrictions on its regularity and where PL should live because in her words she loved her son.</span></p>

She expressed some concern that CC was a relatively new facility, that there may be a lack of experience dealing with residents with autism related needs, that new staff have yet to be recruited and there was no on-site sensory facilities.  Her report was couched against the criteria set out in Appendix B of PL&#8217;s social worker&#8217;s statement and she was clearly of the view that it would be in PL&#8217;s best interests to reside at OL, that being the conclusion to her addendum report at pages 17 and 18.

However there should be provision for reviews not necessarily an expectation that this would lead to an increase in contact, simply that contact should be reviewed as it was an evolving process.  She believed there should be a slightly more regular review pattern than suggested by PL&#8217;s social worker and supported the view that contact should not be subject to flexible arrangements. In her view it was very important that PL should not be exposed to any potential of heightened anxiety, discord or disruption, particularly at the end of any contact session and it was important that countdown, (i.e. the ending of a session) was properly managed.  </span></p>

They each contained a detailed analysis in relation to both options for long term residence and each concluded with well-reasoned argument that OL remained the most appropriate placement in meeting PL&#8217;s needs.  There were question marks about the ability of CC to meet the needs of people with sensory related needs, they were a relatively new provider with no established track record and hence no evidence of their success in supporting people with PL&#8217;s level of need. </span></p>

Although OL had a smaller communal sitting room there would only be one other resident and fewer staff and less risk of PL feeling confined or cramped in his home environment.  He would have the opportunity to create an individual personal area and be able to play his music and drums without disturbing his housemate.  There would also be facility for on-site visits in this area.  OL has a well-equipped sensory room and activity room and it was clear they had put together a well thought out plan for PL&#8217;s transition. </span></p>

If a weekly appointment cannot be kept for whatever reason that contact will simply be lost as opposed to being rearranged.  In terms of review then I tend to the view of the ISW that there should be a more regular review of the arrangements and that on each occasion it should be a full review and there should be no automatic assumption that even if contact is progressing well that it should necessarily be extended or include additional sessions. </span></p>

I have listened to what AL has said and also balanced her views against those of the social worker and ISW.  The arguments for contact taking place off-site are compelling, irrespective of the well-documented difficulties for staff at BH in working collaboratively with AL, a significant concern expressed by the ISW is that there needs to be restrictions on contact to prevent AL&#8217;s behaviour leading to future breakdowns in her son&#8217;s care home.  As the ISW states in her report the risk of setting up an unsustainable arrangement with AL to make contact with her son must be weighed against the risk of this resulting in PL facing the disruption and concomitant trauma of another move. </span></p>

Again in concluding that contact in a restricted form should take place off-site I am conscious that this court has made no detailed factual inquiry into what may or may not have led to the breakdown in the relationship between AL and staff at BH.  Nonetheless this matter has been fully considered by the ISW who has balanced the risks for PL in considering venue and firmly concluded off-site contact would initially be in his best interests.  </span></p>
