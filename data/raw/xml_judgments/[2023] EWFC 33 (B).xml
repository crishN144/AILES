Also there is a limited support network available to D.  Notwithstanding this, it is noteworthy that the children have made progress in her care.  She has worked with agencies to protect the children and meet their needs and there is no doubt that she loves them dearly and accepts them for who they are and has been committed to caring for them.  On this basis, it could be considered that there is a lack of analysis and consideration of relevant orders and support plans which could assist the placement of the children remaining with their grandmother, which would eliminate the harm that separating them from their grandmother will undoubtedly cause.  However, due to the children&#8217;s need of a therapeutic nature, the grandmother would need to engage in therapeutic supports and training to support the children in this area&#8221;.</span></p>

This case is regretfully beyond that now.  Whilst the Court is not required to hold the child&#8217;s welfare as the paramount consideration when making case management decisions, the child&#8217;s welfare and the need to avoid delay will always be a most important factor and may well be determinative in many cases.  Making a timely decision as to the child&#8217;s further care is, in essence, what each case is about.  The child&#8217;s welfare should be at the forefront of the Court&#8217;s mind throughout the process.  The Court has also kept in mind the overriding objective as set out in the Family&#160;Procedure Rules, Rule&#160;1.1.  In these times, each of these elements is important but particular emphasis should be afforded to identify the welfare issues involved, dealing with the case proportionately in terms of allotting to it an appropriate share of the Court&#8217;s resources and ensuring an equal footing between the parties.  In considering this application, the Court has also referred itself to Rule 25 of the Family Procedure Rules&#8221;.</span></p>

The Local Authority has filed their final evidence and undertook a full assessment of the grandmother.  The Court, therefore, does not feel there is any gap in the evidence which would make it necessary to appoint an expert.  The Court respects the professionalism and integrity of those teams that are required to undertake these assessments.  The Court is mindful of the guidance of the President, Sir&#160;Andrew McFarlane, that the Court ought to rely more on those experts already available to the Court and do not consider that further instruction is proportionate or necessary in this case.  The maternal grandmother is granted party status and, as such, will have the opportunity to challenge evidence at a final hearing.  The Court considers that the application for further assessment is not necessary to resolve the proceedings justly, section&#160;32(5) Children&#160;Act, and would cause an unnecessary delay.  It was suggested that the Court could not predict what the outcome of a challenge to the assessment by cross-examination would be at a final hearing and to do so would be wrong.  The Court, in granting party status to the maternal grandmother, gave them the proper platform to robustly challenge the assessment of her.  The fact that the independent social worker might have completed the assessment before any final hearing could be listed, as suggested, is not the correct test.  Equally, the fact that if the assessment is successfully challenged, then further delay will result is not a relevant factor for consideration when determining the ISW application.  The test is whether the expert evidence is necessary to resolve the proceedings justly.  At this stage, it was suggested there is no evidence to that effect.  Only in the event that the Court determines the assessment is flawed or identifies a gap in the assessment will consideration of further assessment become necessary.  That is for the trial Judge to determine once the evidence has been fully tested&#8221;.</span></p>

First, as Arden LJ pointed out in Royal&#160;&amp;&#160;Sun Alliance Insurance plc v T &amp; N Limited [2002]&#160;EWCA&#160;Civ 1964, para [47]: &#8216;Case management should not be interrupted by interim appeals as this will lead to satellite litigation and delays in the litigation process&#8217;.  Second, as she went on to observe: &#8216;the Judge dealing with case management is often better equipped to deal with case management issues&#8217;.  The Judge well-acquainted with the proceedings because he or she has dealt with previous interlocutory applications will have a knowledge of and &#8216;feel&#8217; for the case superior to that of the Court of Appeal.  Exactly the same applies in family cases.  Thus, in Re C Thorpe LJ and I dismissed the appeal notwithstanding what I said was the &#8216;robust view&#8217; His Honour Judge Cliffe had formed when deciding to stop the hearing.  And in Re B I refused permission to appeal from an order of Her Honour Judge Miranda Robertshaw involving what I described (para [16]) as &#8216;appropriately vigorous and robust case management&#8217;.  I said at (para [17]): &#8216;The circumstances in which this court can or should interfere at the interlocutory stage with case management decisions are limited.  Part of the process of family litigation in the modern era is vigorous case management by allocated Judges who have responsibility for the case which they are managing.  This Court can intervene only if there has been serious error, if the case management Judge has gone plainly wrong; otherwise the entire purpose of case management, which is to move cases forward as quickly as possible, will be frustrated, because cases are liable to be derailed by interlocutory appeals&#8217;.  As Black LJ very recently observed in Re B (A Child) [2012] EWCA Civ 1742, para [35]: &#8216;A Judge making case management decisions has a very wide discretion and anyone seeking to appeal against such a decision has an uphill task&#8217;&#8221;.</span></p>

Case management decisions of this sort are particularly hard to appeal, and, in this case, it cannot be said that the Judge overlooked any considerations which were material.  An assessment such as the Local Authority parenting assessment of the father can be challenged in ways other than obtaining a competing assessment.  If the facts upon which the assessment has proceeded are wrong, they can be disputed.  If the opinions are flawed, that can be explored in cross-examination, the author of the report being taken to the material which undermines or contradicts the conclusions he or she has drawn or, as the Guardian contemplated here, a party can take steps to address the problems that have been identified and/or that he or she acknowledges&#8221;.</span></p>

Having read dozens of replies to our consultations, I was struck by the way in which almost every group thought things would be better were they allowed to do more including Judges, Magistrates, social workers and expert witnesses.  Hardly anyone thought themselves should do less.  The reality of course is that time and money spent on one child means less time and money available to help another.  Dedication to achieving the best possible result for one child comes at the hidden expense of another whose case is delayed or whose social worker has to come again to court when they might have been working to help another child to remain safely with their birth family&#8221;. </span></p>

This requirement sets a higher threshold than the standard of assisting the Court.  The instruction of an expert is the primary reason for delay in the Family Court proceedings relating to children.  The recent statistics show that an application for the instruction of an expert is almost invariably granted.  To avoid delay, Courts should continue to consider each application for expert instruction with care so that an application is granted only where it is necessary to do so&#8221;.</span></p>

The Family Court will often be presented with differences in professional opinion between safeguarding, medical and other professions and this is the role of the Judge, to determine which, if any, professional view the Court prefers.  The solution is not for the Court to direct another expert, who may, after all, report a view that is inconsistent with both.  It is not the role of an additional expert to be the arbiter between two contrasting and competing professional opinions.  That is for the Judge.  At a final hearing, the Court may prefer the evidence of the Local Authority and determine that the maternal grandmother cannot provide good enough care for these children or any of them.  Alternatively, the Court may prefer the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian and the other parties and take a different course. </span></p>

The application by the grandmother for an independent social worker and party status was made at Week 30 of the proceedings, 26 weeks having expired on 30 December 2022.

If a local authority were able to decline to join with the Court in the partnership endeavour of identifying the best solution to the problem, then there would be no purpose in having a judicial decision on the question raised by the application.  It might as well be an administrative act.  Parliament has decided that the decision is to be a judicial act and, accordingly, the care plan or care plan options filed with the Court must be designed to meet the risk identified by the Court.  It is only by such a process that the Court is able to examine the welfare implications of each of the placement options before the Court and the benefits and detriments of the same and the proportionality of the orders sought&#8221;.</span></p>
