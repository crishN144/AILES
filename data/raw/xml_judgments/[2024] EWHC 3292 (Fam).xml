Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation  Trust (&#8220;the Trust&#8221;) applies to the Court for declaration that it is i) not in her best interests to continue to receive life sustaining treatment in the form of ventilation (whether invasive or non-invasive) and ii)  in her best interests to be extubated and for palliative care and treatment to be provided to her  under medical supervision such that she suffers the least distress and retains the greatest dignity until such time as her life will come to an end.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing is taking place 3 months short of Fatima&#8217;s eleventh birthday. Her parents have four other living children.  She is their eldest daughter. She has three older brothers, ranging in age from 17 to 15 and she has a younger sister. Fatima is in hospital now, but for much of her life has lived at home with her brothers and sister, looked after by her parents along with the help and support of her extended family.  It has been transparently obvious at this hearing that her parents are proud of her, love her and value the contribution she makes to their family&#8217;s enjoyment of life. It has been obvious also that for as long as it may be the case they fervently wish her to continue living as a member of her their family.  Her brothers are approaching adulthood. It is evident that they dote on their little sister. The eldest of them has talked of her as being the &#8216;glue&#8217; that holds them all together. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the second time these parents have had to face the prospect of the death of one of their children. They had a son who, as appears later in this judgment was affected by the same genetic condition which now affects his sister.  He was looked after at home and, his parents tell me, died in hospital but in circumstances where the those looking after him and his parents did not find themselves in court and at odds as to what was in his best interests. Even within the landscape of applications to withdraw life sustaining treatment, it is an especially bleak path that these parents travel having lost one child, knowing that Fatima too will die as a consequence of the same condition, but disputing the circumstances and timing of that inevitability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been difficult for Fatima&#8217;s parents to sit through this hearing and to listen to evidence, some of which has been intensely painful for them to hear. It is almost unimaginable to put oneself in the position of a parent listening to others discussing how and when their child should or might die.  Whilst there is little that can be done to make hearings of this sort any better for parents, they can be made worse. The hearing has been conducted in a sensitive and respectful way by Counsel, each of whom has taken real and obvious care not to make anything worse in their approach to advancing their case and been thoughtful in their choice of words in so doing. Ms Scott whose case is directly contrary to that contended for by the parents has managed well the difficult task of putting her case honestly but with humanity.</p>

The focus of this judgment is Fatima. I confine myself here to saying only that the exemplary conduct of this case by Counsel has been in unnecessarily pressured circumstances and at significant personal cost because of that late production of documents.</p>

It so happens however that in the West Midlands there have been more children with the condition born than even a large teaching hospital trust such as this might expect to care for. The lead clinical neurologist told me she has looked after 6 including Fatima.  One of them was Fatima&#8217;s older brother who died 2 days after his first birthday.  He had the same genetic profile as Fatima and many of the same features of the condition &#8211; though his hearing, unlike Fatima&#8217;s was impaired and he had also been born with a cleft palate which she was not.  The other children looked after by Dr SD all died at the age of about 12 months or earlier. Fatima &#8211; who at this hearing is 10 years and 9 months old has lived markedly longer than any of them or than the assumed life expectancy which I have been told is of the order of 40 months.</p>

Before that, she had lived at home. Between 2014, and June 2023, she had had hospital admissions but had always returned home afterwards. The tenor of the clinical evidence at this hearing has been that hospital admissions for a child with WWOX-DEE are not unexpected. Her first admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was in 2016.  There followed PICU admissions in 2017 and  2018. In 2019 there was a long admission to PICU of 26 days (at this hearing several witnesses from PICU have characterised a &#8216;long&#8217; stay as beyond 3 weeks). There were 2 admissions to PICU in 2020 the first for 53 days the second for 14. From the records it appears that the admission in August 2020 was the first occasion on which she had been intubated though she was successfully weaned off intubation and with some difficulty off non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to self-ventilation. On subsequent admissions she required NIV rather than intubation. In 2021 she was admitted to PICU for 26 days. There followed a period of some two years following her discharge home in April 2021 when there were no further admissions.</p>

The circumstances in which she came to be intubated  are ones which I pause to consider now because they have featured in the evidence called at this hearing and have had an effect on the trust in the relationship between the parents, most notably as I  see it her father,  and the Trust. It is my perception that those circumstances have also had a lasting effect on the ability of Fatima&#8217;s parents to think about her situation as she now is, as distinct from the immediately precipitating events which led to her intubation. On June 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> 2023 there was an incident in which a nasogastric tube had been misplaced or displaced and as a result  Fatima had aspirated drugs and feed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It could not have been clearer when her father gave evidence that this incident coloured his thinking very strongly. As a matter of timing, Fatima was intubated following that incident and it is recorded in the notes that it was as a result of aspiration. It is accepted that it was the precipitating event for the intubation, at this hearing, Fatima&#8217;s parents have been obviously convinced that but for that mistake she would not be reliant on a ventilator now. Her father said as much to me in the course of his evidence.  Professor Hain made the point that aspiration is not an uncommon reason to be placed on ventilator but it is more often a matter of days taken to recover and not months. It is for him the fact that it has not been possible for her to be weaned from the ventilator that is telling. I have reminded myself that the hearing before me is not one  in which I am asked to consider  whether for example there has been clinical negligence, or even the precise and immediate causation of  Fatima&#8217;s need for a move to intubation from NIV (to the extent that it is something beyond a consequence of her underlying condition). Ms Scott has reminded me that the nursing records in places suggest that the father had restarted the feed and Ms Cheetham counters that even if he had (which he denies) the responsibility for siting of the feeding tube lay with the staff. In the detailed written submissions for the parents, there is extensive consideration of the entries in the medical records and the significance to be attached to the event. At this hearing the significance, other than the fact that it was not organic neurological decline that required her move to intubation, is limited essentially to context.  I am however struck by on the one hand the Father&#8217;s palpable anger and on the other what I regret to say has been the flavour of dismissiveness that the evidence of some of the witnesses from the Trust has had in respect of that incident.  Dr Ross Russell, a witness independent of the Trust, was explicitly clear when he was asked about it that it was a very serious event, &#8216;a never event&#8217; i.e. an event which should never have happened and should have been used as a learning point. He readily accepted that he could see why the father was so keen to ensure that it should not happen again either to Fatima or to any other child. He explained how he would have arranged that learning experience in his own hospital had something similar happened there. I realise that it is easier for a consultant from a different hospital to acknowledge in this way the seriousness of an event such as this but it was nevertheless striking to hear how his answers differed in tone and detail from those of others in response to similar questions.</p>

Even if this were the sort of hearing where I were deciding who was &#8216;to blame&#8217; for the aspiration incident and its consequences, and even were it decided that the Trust was responsible, that would not affect how I think about the decisions to be made for Fatima at this hearing.

They were equally unhappy with the notion of joining by remote link which they did not think was a sufficient way to participate in such an important hearing. I therefore arranged to hear the case at the court centre nearest to PICU treating Fatima. I offered to visit Fatima if her parents wished me to. At the wish of her parents &#8211; and confident that through Ms Cheetham they understood the purpose of such a visit- arrangements were made for me to visit Fatima. I went to see her at the end of a court day, accompanied by the child&#8217;s solicitor who attended to take a note. I had by then heard evidence of the lead consultant intensivist and those nursing witnesses from whom I was to hear but not yet from other medical witnesses or her parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was met at the Paediatric intensive care unit by clinical staff and shown to her bedside by Dr SA. It is a busy unit accommodating children in need of critical care and has 31 beds. Some beds are in bays which are open some are in more private side rooms. Fatima has a bed in such a room &#8211; partly because she is colonised by pseudomonas bacteria. She has been in this particular room for quite a number of weeks now and it is thought of more or less as &#8216;her&#8217; room though if there is an urgent need for it in the ward, children might have to move round. It is quite a large room though it feels smaller because of the space taken up by machines and monitors and the columns housing the means to power them.  The ventilator is on the left of the bed looked at from the door. On the right is the monitor showing saturation levels and heart rate. At the back of the room is a chair which extends out to a makeshift bed where her father often sleeps when he is there overnight, and a small chest of storage space for family possessions.  On one wall were some drawings done by I think her sister, on another work sheets relating to school &#8216;learning about winter&#8217;. There was also a reminder that Fatima sleeps in her own sheets and so they should not be taken to be laundered and exchanged in the hospital laundry. The room had the blend of the functional and the personal, characteristic of a child who is both very unwell and very much loved.</p>

Her mother and father after an exchange of pleasantries withdrew to let me remain. Fatima was awake her face turned towards an i-pad which was playing cartoons of nursery rhymes (old Macdonald). She was dressed in what looked to me to be a new set of pyjamas dark red with a spot pattern and fastened with scarlet ribbon ties. Her thick glossy hair had been carefully plaited. The room was warm and she was lying on top of the sheets rather than covered. Although she was not wearing them at the time, on her bed were the splints which are used to try to prevent contractures. They were decorated with a flowered pattern covering.  During the time I was in the room she remained awake; she moved her mouth; moved her tongue in and out and moved her arms. I did not introduce myself to Fatima or speak to her directly. Knowing that awareness is a live issue between the parties I was careful to avoid inadvertently straying into something that might be perceived as close to gathering my own evidence of that.   As I left, I again exchanged pleasantries with her parents and thanked them for letting me visit Fatima. </p>

Whilst there is consensus amongst the clinicians, and instructed experts as to both her underlying condition and as to what should be the route of her treatment henceforth, there have been some differences of approach in their individual opinions. Issues have arisen and have fallen to be considered at this hearing about the way that some of the witnesses&#8217; views have been informed and arrived at.  The consensus is less established across the wider range of those who have looked after Fatima when it comes to her level of awareness.   It will be necessary to examine some of those issues in greater detail in this judgment  than is often the case rather than to proceed on the basis sometimes possible of setting out at this stage a unanimity  of professional, medical, clinical health care evidence and moving then to consider it within the determination of where the best interests decision falls in balancing the burdens and benefits for Fatima.</p>

There was a consensus that she has lived longer than had been thought likely. Dr SD&#8217;s view (shared by Dr SA) is that she has far exceeded her life expectancy having put the mean at about 40 months and that in that respect she is an outlier by a significant margin. It is not easy to say why that is, but it may be, she thought, that the respiratory issues have arisen only relatively recently, and her epilepsy has not been  uncontrolled in the way that for some children with WWOX-DEE can be the factor leading to early rapid neurological decline. Professor Hain too agreed that her life expectancy is difficult to predict given how long she has already lived. In the event that she is extubated he puts her life expectancy at a hours or a small number of days. If she has a tracheostomy and is discharged home he puts it at months or a small number of years. Notably not all of those from whom I heard were willing (for reasons discussed elsewhere) to make any estimate of her likely life expectancy.

Dr Parker, whose written evidence had spoken of her being in pain 24 hours a day, clarified that he meant episodes of pain in each 24 hour period and those episodes were from interventions. The likely course of the neurological deterioration, in the view of Dr SD included likely increase  in the dystonia to a limited degree already seen; the prospect of increased and painful contractures was also an expected development in the event of decline &#8211; in this respect Dr SA identifies that splints have been prescribed to mitigate contractures. Professor Hain when asked was not able easily to say whether, and to what extent, these burdens by reason of the condition as distinct from the treatment would develop in her lifetime since both the expectancy of her life and the path of neurological decline are unpredictable.

Since they arrive at that conclusion, informed by the views they have come to about her ability to benefit or derive pleasure from continued life, that aspect forms part of the later discussion of awareness and responsiveness.  Dr SK, whose specialist field is paediatric palliative medicine has given compassionate and thoughtful evidence about the circumstances in which Fatima&#8217;s life would come to an end if life sustaining treatment is withdrawn. She was explicit both that she would wish to discuss with the family so as to accommodate as far as possible their wishes for Fatima&#8217;s last hours and that she understood why the parents had not felt able to contemplate discussing that prospect with her. It is her hope that if the Court makes the declarations and the parents are faced with a reality rather than a hypothetical position, they will feel able to have discussions with her. It is quite obvious that the nature of her professional life means that Dr SK is well used to the impossibility for parents of contemplating in the abstract the manner of their child&#8217;s death. I have every confidence that if declarations are made,  that under her direction the palliative care path will be, as far as possible one which enables Fatima to die with her family around her and with any pain and respiratory distress associated with her death well managed. </p>

It is not an option contended for by the Trust given the unified view of the treating clinicians and second opinion Doctors in favour of withdrawal of life sustaining treatment. Neither is it an option which is regarded as without risk. Dr SF gave evidence as to the surgery which in and of itself even for a child like Fatima is a technically relatively straightforward process, and of the recovery and transition on to stabilise on NIV and stepping down from PICU, which are not.  Whilst he has looked after many children living at home with tracheostomy, he had not had a child as compromised as Fatima at home with a tracheostomy on NIV. However, this is not a case that falls into the category of those where i) no Doctor will carry out the procedure and, ii) faced with that ethical position, no Court can or would seek to direct it.  In this case the medical evidence was clear that this is the course that will be taken in the event that declarations are not made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I have considered first the evidence from medical professionals and clinicians, the evidence I heard from those who are members of Fatima&#8217;s family is just as important when I come to make decisions for her.   Fatima was born 8 years after her brother had died and her parents had had  3 children in the intervening period who were unaffected. Her father told me of the joy he felt from the day that she, his first daughter was born in February 2014. They knew from birth of her difficulties but there was from his point of view no sense of disappointment or feeling that she was imperfect. <span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;A child like Fatima&#8217;,</span> he told me was to be regarded in his culture as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a special child, a blessing and a gift from Allah. Those who take care of  someone like Fatimah will have their reward in the next life&#8217;</span>. Fatima&#8217;s mother had said that when told of her daughter&#8217;s neurodisability she felt <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a sadness in my heart&#8217;</span> but went on to explain her positive view of life with her after that. Her father described how life had been at home with her and his pleasure coming home from a late shift at work seeing her wake and respond to him as he came into the room, sitting with her for a while before himself going to bed.  He was hands on (my words not his) and involved in her care. He changed her, fed her attended to her medical needs. He was keen to impress upon me that he was proud of Fatima. She was never what he called &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">left behind</span>&#8217; during family activities. When the family visited beaches over the United Kingdom, Fatima was included.  They went together as a family to Saudi Arabia. When the family travelled overseas to visit family in Pakistan, Fatima was included both times and, although she picked up an infection on one trip in 2017, she recovered with no ill effects. The family also travelled together on holiday with Fatima to Dubai. Of course all of these trips were when she was not needing ventilator support. In submissions, Ms Cheetham drew the court's attention to the fact that some of  the trips abroad of which the father spoke took place after her PICU admissions and at least one of them after a time when   her treating clinicians had expressed the view, assessing her prospects,  that it was not thought that she would be able to come off the ventilator. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He was from time to time in talking about her, overcome by emotion. Strikingly he spoke of a difficult conversation he had had with Fatima&#8217;s younger sister who, as a young child struggling to understand her own family situation, observed that Fatima was her older sister but did not play with her like an older sister should.  There is ample evidence that now the sisters are close and as the guardian described have found a relationship in which they spend a good deal of their time together physically close to each other. Fatima&#8217;s younger sister has, so the guardian told me, come to an understanding of how her older sister is not like other people&#8217;s older sisters. It was clear from the father&#8217;s evidence that helping her to that understanding had been a time of real emotional pain to him. I had the sense, that in part that may have had its roots in being confronted by the stark contrast between that which his younger daughter could, and would be able to do, and his elder daughter could and would not.  In their written and spoken evidence Fatima&#8217;s parents were clear that she is aware of them and responds to them; they told me that she smiles &#8211; especially for her father;  that she becomes animated and opens her eyes when she hears her mother&#8217;s voice arriving at the doorway of the cubicle; that she responds to touch by turning her head, moving her tongue in and out;  that she knows when they are there and when they are not and that she is comforted by her mother&#8217;s touch. Both Fatima&#8217;s parents had filed statements in which they had set out in writing what they had wanted to say. Her mother had committed a great deal to writing (with which her father agreed) but said rather less in oral evidence. Her father had made rather shorter written statements but spent longer in the witness box. It was my impression that he was more comfortable expressing himself by the spoken word than in writing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both Fatima&#8217;s parents have a strong Islamic faith within which they are bringing up their children. It was in that context that her father spoke to me of her being a gift and a blessing. The parents have consulted an Imam and Islamic Scholars for moral guidance in respect of this application.  He father told me that her life will endure for &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">however long it is written&#8217;</span>. At an early stage in the hearing Ms Cheetham made it clear that whilst her clients were vehemently opposed to the declarations sought by the Trust they did not put their case as she expressed it on the basis of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">life at any cost</span>&#8217;. I became less convinced as I listened to the father&#8217;s evidence that that was really so given the way in which he expressed himself.  I asked him if he thought there were <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> circumstances in which he could consider that it would the right thing for Fatima for her Life Sustaining Treatment to be withdrawn. Although in response he said a number of things and spoke at some length about looking after Fatima, he did not in fact give me an answer to that question.  I was not sure whether it was that he could not contemplate any circumstances in which it would be right for Life Sustaining Treatment to be withdrawn or that he could not bear to contemplate the question. It was notable however that in this he contrasted with his wife. When Fatima&#8217;s mother gave evidence, she told me that she did not think it was Fatima&#8217;s time to die, but that if she thought it was the right time for treatment to stop, she would say so herself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fatima&#8217;s paternal aunt, MB spoke warmly of her niece. She has been closely involved in her care since infancy. In both her written and oral evidence she was clear that Fatima was a child who was much loved and valued in the extended family. It was her evidence also that Fatima responds &#8211; by moving and smiling - when she visits, touches and speaks to her and to the presence of her parents.  On occasions she has observed Fatima respond to stimulation. In her written statement she had described an occasion when Fatima had responded during play facilitation the previous month to the use of a rattle toy in a way reminiscent of a similar play at home. It is her perception that Fatima has an awareness of those around her and that though the signs may be subtle &#8211; especially to those who are less familiar with her who may miss them &#8211; there are signs of response.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I did not hear from her brothers and her sister directly, I heard about them and their views via the Guardian who had visited the home and who told me of her conversations with the other children. She spoke to Fatima&#8217;s brothers separately from their youngest sister because they are aware of the court proceedings and she is not. She described them as engaging young men, nervous about talking to her and on occasion with the eldest brother becoming a spokesman for all three. The word that was used to describe Fatima as part of their family home was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">joyful</span>&#8217;. That is an unusual word amongst teenagers speaking in English but I notice that it is used in the parents&#8217; evidence translated from their own language and I think it is probably less unusual in the language of these teenagers&#8217; home. In speaking to the Guardian, one of the younger boys gave their view about how Fatima is different now and described her as being &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">sad</span>&#8217; in hospital in comparison to how she used to be. Relating this evidence, the Guardian told me that the eldest brother had interjected &#8211; perhaps by way of reassurance &#8211; that she was <span style="font-style:italic">ok</span>   and had <span style="font-style:italic">got used to it. </span>Fatima&#8217;s younger sister also spoke of her being <span style="font-style:italic">sadder</span> in hospital. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>From the Guardian&#8217;s meetings with all the other children of the family came good evidence that Fatima is someone who has always been a full part of her family&#8217;s life. They are used to her living at home with them and being part of their day-to-day life. The Guardian gave a telling vignette of the younger sister, sitting in Fatima&#8217;s bed in the parents' bedroom and explaining that it is her sister&#8217;s place. Sometimes siblings of a very unwell child only know them by visiting them in a hospital setting. That of course is simply a family life in a different way.  Fatima&#8217;s siblings however have experienced her (and she them) not just as they do now, in visits to PICU, but living at home, going on days out together, travelling abroad on holiday. Her absence is felt by all of them. They spoke of missing her and wanting her to return home. </p>

Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it.

That would subvert the framework of the established law which preserves the interests of the child as paramount. Nor do I believe Macdonald J intended to sever medical 'best interests' from an overall evaluation of the child's interests. Such an approach would be artificial. A true and meaningful assessment of a child's best interests requires a conscientious survey of the wide canvas of his life, in which process the views of his parents concerning matters of faith, culture and more widely will be important but never a determinative factor.&#8221;</span></p>

If a child&#8217;s life can only be sustained at the cost of significant pain and distress it may not be in their best interests to receive such treatments, for example, use of invasive ventilation in severe irreversible neuromuscular disease. It is important that all options to relieve or overcome the negative effects of treatment are explored before proposing that it should be limited. However if such treatment can only be delivered at the expense of compromising the child&#8217;s consciousness, for example, by deep sedation, its potential benefit maybe significantly reduced. Other examples of particularly high impact treatments include ECMO, renal dialysis and, sometimes, intensive chemotherapy.</span></p>

All appropriate measures to treat and relieve the child&#8217;s pain and distress should be taken.

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation. Although it is possible to distinguish these different groups of decisions to limit LSTs that are based on quality-of-life considerations, in practice combinations may be present. For example, a child or infant in intensive care may have sustained such significant brain injury that future life may provide little benefit, while both intensive treatment and future life are likely to cause the child substantial pain and distress.&#8217;</span></p>

Life is precious -whether viewed through the lens of Faith as by her parents, and so importing to &#8216;precious&#8217; also the connotation of &#8216;sacred&#8217;, or whether viewed from a more secular or humanist standpoint from which &#8216;sanctity&#8217; retains very significant value albeit unallied to the religious roots of the word.  The instinct to survive and to live is strong. From this flows the principle that there is a presumption in favour of a course that will prolong Fatima&#8217;s life. A presumption but not an irrebuttable one. Linked to the concept of sanctity, is that Fatima&#8217;s life has inherent value. Her life is one of profound and irreversible disability but I hold in my mind that a life of disability is of no less value than a life without disability. It could not be clearer from the way in which  her family have spoken - to the Court, to the medical professionals and, movingly in the case of her brothers to the Guardian - of their experience of having her as a daughter, a sister and a niece that her life is one which has inherent value to them. The acuteness with which they feel her absence speaks of what her presence means. Neither the sanctity of her life nor its well established value is absolute. Each and both are capable of displacement.</span></p>

She can be disconnected from the ventilator for short periods (and has been in hospital) for the purpose of being moved across a room but at the moment, despite longer periods - including when placed on a bagging circuit during Dr SN&#8217;s assessment - in the past, no more than that.  Ventilation itself is uncomfortable and although in Fatima&#8217;s case that is mitigated by the fact that the settings and her oxygen requirement are low it should not be lost that her lungs are undergoing inflation by mechanical and invasive means. Her lungs are in good condition, from the evidence I have heard at this hearing perhaps surprisingly so, but invasive ventilation long term may lead to stiffening which will make effective inflation and therefore effective gas exchange harder over time.</span></p>

This is not something she has had to have with a frequent regularity &#8211; Ms SG sees her in the order of once a week or once a fortnight.  Nevertheless, it is a vigorous process so when she has it, it is likely to be experienced as at least uncomfortable, perhaps painful.  There is evidence within the medical records which indicates that daily physiotherapy stretches cause her pain. I accept both that and the evidence of Dr Parker who observed that either at home or in continued PICU setting this is and will be a part of her life. The evidence in relation to dystonia which I heard from Dr SD is that it is likely that it lessens when she is relaxed in the presence of her parents. There are two things which are interesting about that aspect of the evidence from the perspective of  a burdens and benefits analysis: first that since the effect is to lessen the dystonia (as she is more relaxed) it diminishes the pain consequent on dystonia;  the second is that it demonstrates some awareness of and appreciation of the presence of her parents from which she derives comfort.</span></p>

I accept also that if the scoliosis develops in the way that is expected one of the effects of that will be that the lung on the side of her body the curvature curves towards will be compressed into a smaller space and so will become more difficult to inflate by ventilation for effective gaseous exchange. The laws of physics being as they are, so Ms SG explained, the air pushed from the ventilator will take the route of least resistance into the larger available volume of the other lung.</span></p>

I accept the evidence that Fatima&#8217;s range of control over purposeful movement means she is not a child who can withdraw from a painful stimulus. She is sufficiently able to communicate when she is in pain such that the signals are understood and interpreted by the clinicians treating her as well as by her parents, though they are sometimes picked up quicker by those who know her well. By way of illustration, I heard of an episode during this hearing when Fatima&#8217;s foot had become trapped in the wheelchair and whilst her discomfort had been noted, it was her Mother who identified the cause.  Examples of how she communicates pain are grimacing; widened/startled expression about her eyes. Elsewhere in the medical records, arising from Ms SR&#8217;s examination,  there has been a note or suggestion of a small noise made by Fatima and associated with pain although not in more recent times.</span></p>

I accept the submission made by Mr Davy that it may be that some of the procedures undertaken on Fatima have become so much a matter of routine the effect of them may be less noticeable to those used to seeing them. His submission to the effect that there is value to that which comes from the eye of the beholder is one which is well pitched and which I have found helpful to reflect upon.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">There are other ways in which it is possible to detect signs of pain in Fatima. In the example where her foot had been trapped her need for oxygen (normally at or minimally above that in air) had increased to 35. Dr SD spoke of it being possible clinically to detect markers in the blood of pain having been experienced.  I heard no suggestion that indications of pain and distress outside her control i.e. governed by her autonomic nervous system were not reliable. Thus, a raised heart rate might indicate pain or discomfort experienced from a procedure. Heart rate is recorded in the nursing notes. Dr SN who visited Fatima on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> September 2023 for the preparation of his second opinion report noted that her heart rate increased from a base of 83 to 113 as a result of suctioning, and took 20 &#8211; 30 mins to subside to its baseline.   More recently the run of recordings in the nursing notes for the month of October 2024 show either an elevated heart rate &#8211;  as high on occasion as figures in the late nineties - on suctioning or no discernible increase in the heart rate. Those notations are accompanied by very frequent recordings of a &#8216;grimace&#8217;  or &#8216;pain grimace&#8217;; sometimes it is recorded that she moves her head away from the suction tube. That latter gave me cause to reflect on the consensus that this is a child who cannot withdraw from painful stimulus but I concluded that being able to turn a head slightly away from an implement being pushed into the Endotracheal tube is something subtly different. In some entries she appears not to be experiencing suctioning as painful either by reference to raised heart rate or by reference to her own response to it. On reviewing the evidence, I did not accept that Ms Cheetham&#8217;s submission that Fatima has become accustomed to suctioning &#8211; and by inference that it is not to be counted as a burden </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">at all</span><span style="color:#000000">   or weighs minimally in the burdens analysis. I do however agree that in relation to suctioning it is not experienced by Fatima as uniformly and consistently painful. That is accepted also by Ms Scott for the Trust who does not seek to suggest that suctioning is always unavoidably painful. I hold in my mind however that this sort of acute and short-lived pain from a procedure is not something for which analgesic pain relief such as paracetamol can be used to relieve.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The burden arising from pain and discomfort on suctioning is important as Fatima requires and will continue to require suctioning. It is necessary to keep her alive &#8211; otherwise she will in effect drown in the secretions.  The experience of those who have had (and can communicate about it) and of those who carry out suctioning, is that it is painful &#8211; at the very least uncomfortable.  Mr Davy reminded the Court in submissions of the well-recognised description by adults who have had deep suctioning as being like a hot poker. At this hearing the evidence both of the professionals/clinicians to me and from her parents is that Fatima does not always seem to experience it as painful &#8211; sometimes she does sometimes she doesn&#8217;t. Dr SD thought that neurologically there might come a time when she was less able to experience it as painful or to experience pain at all. It was clear in her evidence that Dr SD was speaking then of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">experiencing</span><span style="color:#000000"> pain rather than being able to </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">express pain experienced</span><span style="color:#000000">.  Dr  SD was also clear that if Fatima were to cease to experience for example suctioning as painful at all that was not necessarily a positive thing overall since it was likely indicative of neurological decline.  By contrast Dr Parker was of the view that she would retain to the end (or near to the end) the ability to feel pain.  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">That divergence of opinion or respectable difference of professional opinion between 2  who are so expert in their field speaks perhaps volumes of the difficulty of knowing with anything approaching certainty how pain is experienced in the context of a neurologically compromised brain in the absence of communication.</span></p>

That aligns also with the evidence I heard from Professor Hain.  The nursing staff as a matter of routine record her pain scores and it is the case that rarely are they recorded as other than zero. Ms Cheetham relies heavily on that and has put it to several witnesses. I might have felt some caution regarding that recording had it been </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">always</span><span style="color:#000000"> zero since the FLACC score system for pain recording is not as well suited to children who are neurologically compromised.

Her evidence was that she did not think Fatima was in pain (as distinct from irritation or discomfort) because she would expect an experience to endure for 15 minutes or more to make it something she would call pain. Whilst I found her evidence in some other respects helpful, I did not think that she was someone on whom I could safely rely in relation to pain. Had she been the only nurse responsible for pain scores I would have been very hesitant indeed to accept them as reflective of  Fatima&#8217;s day to day experience and would have accepted the submission made in closing by the Trust that it might explain why the pain scores are often marked so low. Fatima is however looked after by a number of different nurses who are responsible for the pain scoring   It is a reasonable inference for me to draw  - and I do so &#8211; that over so long an admission, were the pain scores, marked as they are, not reflective of the day to day experience of pain for this child it is more likely than not that one of the senior clinicians involved in her care &#8211; and notably Nurse SC  who was the senior nurse clinician - would have noted and queried the discrepancy.</span></p>

The pain of procedures necessary to keep her alive, most notably deep suctioning, weighs with significant weight. That it is over in a matter of seconds does not diminish the experience of it, it only lessens the time for which it is experienced. I accept the evidence of Professor Hain that Fatima is living with many episodes of pain on a daily basis. Between those episodes of pain there are times when she is not in pain. I am satisfied that either continuing ventilation as she is in PICU or with a tracheostomy with a view to long term ventilation at home, the burden of pain and or discomfort associated with suctioning will continue.</span></p>

There is no strong evidence, in fact little if any, of spontaneous desaturation.  The most recent instance recorded appears in August 2024 and is associated with a period of infection.  That stability is important in terms of the options available for her at this hearing. She is regarded (though it is not an option favoured by the Trust) as a patient for whom surgery for a tracheostomy is clinically viable. In the event that I do not grant the declarations the Trust seek, that is the course that will be taken. From that it follows that one of the things that does not fall to be considered in the burdens is that of interventions to rescue her from spontaneous desaturations by reason of an instability on ventilation.</span></p>

So too with some of that which is in the context of burdens. Professor Hain&#8217;s evidence was that Fatima was likely to experience anxiety. Both Ms Scott and Mr Davy rely strongly on his oral explanation that anxiety is a primal human emotion present even where the cognitive impairment is significant. I agree that when considering the burdens the prospect of anxiety should not be overlooked. I am less persuaded by the Trust&#8217;s submission that if she experiences anxiety, there is little that can be offered by way of reassurance. I conclude that it is more likely than not something which may be ameliorated by the proximity of her family. In this respect I draw on the evidence I heard from Dr SD in a different context about the way in which her dystonia is noticeably lessened when she is more relaxed in and by the presence of her family.</span></p>

It is right however that  I should also consider what in effect are said by the applicant and the Guardian to be the benefits to her of making the declarations. Since I have set out in some detail the burdens of her condition and treatment I can  much more shortly encapsulate the primary benefit  attaching to the course contended for by those who support the declarations, which is that all of those burdens she will be spared.  The context in which she will be spared it is that without Life Sustaining Treatment she will almost certainly die within a short period of hours or days. To be counted amongst the benefits,  (and therefore in her best interests) on the case of the Trust and the Guardian is that that death will be one that is managed, predictable, so far as is possible in a place away from the busy PICU ward, with her family around her and with any pain or discomfort managed by those whose expertise lies in paediatric palliative care medicine.</span></p>

Ms Cheetham in her submissions makes the obvious but none the less powerful point that many people would consider life itself to be the ultimate benefit. I accept that point with the caveat that whilst many do, some &#8211; those for example in unendurable pain &#8211; do not.  There is no possibility of evidence of any earlier expression of view by Fatima to draw on in this case to help me in thinking about from her perspective, what might be her view of her current situation.  The very fact that there is professional guidance, and a balancing of benefits and burdens is in itself a recognition that to regard life as the ultimate benefit which eclipses all else would be the wrong approach. Notwithstanding that caveat, I accept the submission that continued life for Fatima where the alternative course is near certain death weighs strongly in the balance as a benefit and I hold in my mind in so accepting, the well &#8211; established strong although rebuttable presumption in favour of preserving life.</span></p>

It is intended to be a more relaxed setting aimed at more closely resembling a home environment. In accepting, as I do, that a move to that ward on the evidence I have heard should be weighed as a benefit I caution myself and take into account that whilst from Dr SF the evidence I heard was that the &#8216;usual&#8217; recovery period from tracheostomy is about 7 days there was a recognition that it might take a little longer.  What is also required is that Fatima would have to be established on a home ventilator (which is properly to be understood as a ventilator for use outside the PICU rather than necessarily at home). That process may be achieved in a matter of 3 &#8211;4 weeks but might take as long as 3 months. A step down move out of PICU is I am satisfied to be considered as a benefit in the analysis. Sometimes in making best interests for children the consideration is not whether there is the prospect of a move home but whether there is a prospect even of a step down to HDU.

Earlier in this judgment I had touched on my perception that Fatima&#8217;s parents, may find it hard to think of her, and her best interests as she is now. Should she return home her life will not be the same life that she had, or that they experienced her having before the admission to hospital. On the evidence it would be wholly unrealistic to expect her to benefit from the opportunity of international travel and holidays to family overseas that had been a part of her life before admission. So when her parents say that she will be able to resume her &#8216;joyful&#8217; life it is important that neither I nor they consider the benefits and burdens analysis as if, all being as hoped in relation to the return home with a tracheostomy the clock will be, as it were, reset to pre June 2023 admission. It will not.  I do nevertheless regard as having significant weight in the analysis that she will be at home and living within her family&#8211; which no one disputes will be far better for her; that whilst she will as the Guardian has pointed out in the consideration of burdens remain &#8216;separated&#8217; by machinery  from her family, she will be able to be moved from room to room in the home disconnected for short periods from the ventilator to do so; I accept also the submission that disconnection from a humidified circuit for 2 perhaps 3 hours will mean that in the better weather she can join her family in the garden or on a </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">short</span><span style="color:#000000"> outing.

Dr SA did not accept &#8211; he said in oral evidence that he was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">not convinced&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000"> that Fatima smiles. Movements of her arms are in his view repetitive and reflex movements without purpose. He regards her has having no or virtually no awareness.  Dr SB, had not seen Fatima smile or show any expression of pleasure whist for example seeing or hearing cartoons played on her i-pad but did say that she had seen a positive interaction when Fatima has appeared to be comforted during deep suctioning by her mother&#8217;s hand stroking her face. Ms SG, the lead physiotherapist reported that she had seen neither expression of pleasure nor positive interaction from Fatima during her engagement with her &#8211; though she candidly acknowledged that  her role in delivering physiotherapy  means that she almost by definition is doing something to her that is not likely to be pleasurable or to elicit a positive response. Ms SC the senior nursing clinician in evidence said she had not seen a positive response to pleasure, she acknowledged that she had seen widened eyes and movements of arms and head but not in a way that she said she could &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">wholeheartedly&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000"> put down to pleasurable stimulus. Dr SD had not herself ever seen Fatima smile and so did not feel she could comment on whether she did. She did acknowledge that she was calmer when her parents were present and, as I have noted elsewhere, agreed that dystonia was less when Fatima was more relaxed in the presence of her parents. This aside, her view was that Fatima showed no &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">spontaneous</span><span style="color:#000000"> or </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">purposeful movement&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000">and asked about responsiveness she responded that </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">responses to stimuli are often reflexes rather than responses.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The view given by the senior clinicians of Fatima&#8217;s level of awareness and responsiveness was similar across the period of her intubation in PICU. That is to say what I heard from them was not that they had seen a very different picture early on and it had now altered.  It is not wholly surprising that a lead clinician who might see a child relatively infrequently or from the distance of the nurses' bay might not see the same indications of awareness as those who are more frequently at the bedside.  If there is nothing to see then no one will see it, whatever their role, but if there are nuanced signs of awareness then they are more likely missed from greater remove. The Guardian speaking in her evidence of the smile that she had seen in October 2024, made the point that if you don't happen to be there when Fatima smiles you don't see it and it is hard to capture it otherwise.</span></p>

I have not heard from those compiling the school notes but I accept that their recordings of Fatima&#8217;s movements when engaged [113 at (v)] are congruent with the play facilitator&#8217;s. In accepting that submission and the observations of the play facilitator  I have paused for reflection as to those aspects where repeatedly recorded are observations of movement of arms as a response of excitement or to stimulation. In the face of the clear view of senior neurological clinicians,  that she lacks  purposeful movement of her arms and hands so as to reach and grasp items   - the classic example I was given was of a child trying to pull out an NG tube-, I was careful that in accepting the observed evidence of responses seen by  this witness, I was not either elevating her evidence inadvertently to neurological expertise </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">or</span><span style="color:#000000">  accepting from her something that conflicted, other than by way of her own observation,  with the evidence of the senior neurological clinicians. I am clear that I am doing neither. I accept the observations of response &#8211; which includes movement, characterised as excited or agitated - in response to a stimulus.  Dr Parker when cross examined about the observations of Dr SN that Fatima&#8217;s face lit up in response to play therapists session when he saw her with them on his visit, said that he would respect the observations of Dr SN as he is an experienced intensivist but that he would want to see the reaction as one that was consistent &#8211; which he explained meant repeated 3 or 4 times  so as to be sure it was not a coincidence or reflex. Dr SN is indeed an experienced intensivist. He does not however have the benefit of repeated observations at the child&#8217;s bedside over a number of weeks. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Within the context of examining the decision making and the evidence of awareness and responsiveness however, there are two important aspects of the evidence arising from the commissioning of an assessment by Ms SR. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">First</span><span style="color:#000000"> the notes of her examination which appear in the records do not reflect a picture of no or very minimal awareness. They record &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">distinguishable drowsy/light sleep and wake states; a range of facial expressions during calm and interactive periods that were different to expressions during stretch and assessment of range; a small smile when CPAP was removed and a frown and vocal sound when I was assessing her foot ankle and wrists&#8217; . </span><span style="color:#000000">There was noted also that in a 30-minute period of wakefulness Fatima responded with opening eyes and touch to play opportunity; that she was alert for variable periods more notably when engaged, being touched and interacted with during songs and activities. The notes also contained a recommendation of reassessment at different times for a greater assessment and understanding. Other than a review by a different neurophysiotherapist in May of the following year (which recorded no change) there is no evidence that there was such a review. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Second</span><span style="color:#000000"> that an assessment report from Ms SR following the request and her examination of Fatima has never been produced: not as part of the medical records; not to the ethics committee  or before me at or in preparation for this hearing. I have had a degree of caution about accepting Ms Cheetham&#8217;s submission that by September a decision had been made to apply to withdraw life support provided there was no different view taken by the ethics committee. I see why it is said however that it is hard to read otherwise the references at that stage to court proceedings. I am more confident however that the evidence points to the fact that by September the consensus to which I have made reference at [115] was already firmly established amongst the senior clinicians. For me the relevance of that firm consensus is the extent to which it may have affected i) the thinking about awareness levels ii) a willingness to reconsider Fatima&#8217;s situation over the following months.</span></p>

I realise  that a desperate longing might well cause a parent to see a twitch of a mouth as a smile, or a movement that happens to coincide with their arrival one day as a response to it. Dr Parker warned that family members in situations such as this might over-interpret small gestures.

The shift pattern operated in BWCH PICU is for a nurse to be 4 weeks one side of the ward (which appeared to be neurologically compromised children) and 4 weeks the other.  So for 4 weeks at a time a nurse on shift looking after Fatima might see and interact with her daily; then not see her for time rostered off then see her again. Nurse SH described leaning over Fatima so as to be able to make proper eye contact when talking to her, because since her eyesight is known to be impaired and she lies on her back otherwise it is less easy to make a connection with her.   She was clear that Fatima knows when her father arrives at night (from his work shift) and that she observed a difference in Fatima when her parents were present. The words she chose to describe the difference she observed were &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">more confident&#8217; .</span><span style="color:#000000"> She described how on arrival of her parents, Fatima shows awareness of their arrival and pleasure in their presence.

She contrasted also Fatima&#8217;s appearing to be &#8216;sad&#8217; during the day before her parents' arrival and went on to say this: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">parents come and she started to cry &#8211; think missed them the whole day. That is the main concern. When they talk in own language she will be fine. More comfortable. Whole day not reacting to us. When talking not sure understanding language. Mum and dad come.

In her visit she captured also the real sadness felt by one of the nurses who has looked after Fatima who spoke of the fact that she &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">never gets  better, she never will, it feels really sad&#8217;. </span><span style="color:#000000"> For much of the time she saw little response from Fatima to those who spoke to her, and none herself when she introduced herself , however then at paragraph 33 of her report she relates this: </span><span style="font-style:italic">I was fortuitous enough to be visiting when the &#8216;Giggle Doctors&#8217; came to see her. These two women were dressed up in embroidered white doctor coats, flowery dungarees, with patterned Doc Marten boots, heavy bright make up, and had scarfs woven into their hair. They engaged with Fatima for around ten minutes with high pitched tones, and gentle fun and frolics. They sang songs, showed her an octopus (produced from a pocket) and made delightful mysterious noises. Fatima was positioned facing them but had been drifting to sleep before their arrival. She became more and more aware of their presence and remained open eyed throughout. Her hand/arm was moving, though not to reach out and her body was reacting. She then smiled the broadest of smiles several times that reached her eyes and lit up her face</span>.  That observation has been the focus of much attention given what is reported and its proximity in time to this hearing. In answer both to her own counsel and when cross examined for the parents, she was clear that the smile was in response to what the &#8216;Giggle Doctors&#8217; had been doing. In describing to me what she had seen she said <span style="font-style:italic">It was a smile and then I remember how I felt I remember thinking Oh she smiled </span> going on to say <span style="font-style:italic">The smile I saw was much bigger and a smile happens so instantaneously I  was there and I saw it ...the smile is  was bigger and broader and more alight that the ones I have seen in the five videos. </span>She was specifically asked by her own counsel in chief what her interpretation was of what she had seen was in response to what the Giggle Doctors were doing and replied <span style="font-style:italic">My interpretation was they come in they had been high energy and worked hard and all of a sudden she smiled in response.</span></p>

Listening to this Guardian&#8217;s account of her visit I was  put in mind of that characterisation. Having since hearing her evidence received the parties submissions however, I am struck also by the fact that this observation is one which is also usefully considered alongside Mr Davy&#8217;s submission in relation to [86] above as to Fatima&#8217;s observed reaction to pain. What I have described there as the value that may come from considering the eye of the beholder, so too here. I found this a powerful piece of evidence from a professional witness outside the family when I came to consider the difficult aspect of awareness and responsiveness.   This was not the sort of subtle response that the unfamiliar might miss. Though interestingly Professor Hain, a person well used to assessing children in this situation said in evidence that when he visited to assess and entered her room he had &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the very definite impression that she was aware someone new had walked in and she was aware I was there&#8217;</span>. </p>

There is an issue as between the parents and the Trust as to whether I should or can safely rely on those failed attempts as evidence of significant neurological decline.  The position of the Trust is that I can and should; the position of the parents is that the attempts to wean her have been made in circumstance which are not optimal and that this should lead me to be particularly cautious in relying on the failed weans as evidence of neurological decline.

The evidence before me indicates that they are known  to have drug interactions causing sedation and respiratory depression. The clinical witnesses asked about it acknowledged that potential but did not regard it as explaining the failure of the wean. On this occasion the attempt to wean was interrupted by intercurrent infection which meant Fatima required treatment with Nitrofuranton (from 27.06.23 to 06.07.23) for a urinary tract infection and with Piperacillin and Tazobacterium between 27.06.23 to 08.07.23 for suspected Sepsis.  </p>

The purpose of Melatonin in PICU I was told was to regulate sleep patterns which are otherwise susceptible to disruption of the ordinary night/day sleep/wake cycles by the 24 hour busy and noisy nature of the ward. I heard evidence from some that it was not properly to be regarded as having a sedative effect though Dr SD talked about its value being that it caused drowsiness and helped with dropping off to sleep and Dr Ross Russell went further saying of Melatonin that his could cause a sedative effect and could reduce breathing. In addition to the increased Melatonin, she was having, as previously, Nitrazepam and Levetriracetam, and also Gabapentin. There is evidence that Gabapentin is known to have side effects of dizziness, drowsiness and respiratory depression. It is also known to have a drug interaction with Melatonin, in like form to that between Melatonin and Levetiracetam. Those clinicians asked about it were again doubtful that the recognised side effects and potential for drug interaction adversely affected the outcome of the wean.  Fatima&#8217;s progress on this attempted wean was however also affected by an infection.  Fatima was prescribed additional antibiotics and PRN paracetamol for the infection  between 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>  and 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  September 2023.</p>

Second Dr Ross Russell noted the cumulative effect of sedative medicine in the system which reduces not immediately it ceases to be administered, but over time. In respect of this attempted wean, there is force in Ms Cheetham&#8217;s submission that Fatima was not given a proper opportunity to wean without the presence of medication sedative in effect in her system.</p>

It was more gradual than earlier weans and I have heard from Ms SG at this hearing was consultant led (which the others had not been). The attempt was to wean her onto CPAP. Although she continued to be on the 6mg dose of melatonin, she came to this attempted wean without the benzodiazepines or Gabapentin in her system. Fatima did well in the initial stages of this attempted wean such that by 7th May 2024  it is recorded that she was tolerating 18 hours on CPAP. There are numbered stages of the process and that level of tolerance is stage 10. Unfortunately, Fatima developed an infection on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and her temperature increased.

This is a drug which had been problematic for her when previously used. During this wean attempt the nursing notes recorded that it had made the secretions &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">too thick&#8217;</span> which had been the earlier difficulty. The resulting advice recorded by the registrar is <span style="font-style:italic">Cut off glycopyrolate and Prescribed 200mcg one off dose.</span> In the event, for reasons that are not clear that drug continued to be given to Fatima for three more days. It was agreed in her oral evidence by Dr SB that in the light of the clear direction it should not have been, though these aspects of the failed attempt to wean had been absent from her written evidence. Glycopybyronium is a drug which had caused difficulty for Fatima in the past when its effect of thickening secretions had not been helpful to her. In those circumstances it was put to treating and expert witnesses that it had been wrong to prescribe again and continue during a wearing process a drug which had previously been problematic. The answers to that proposition were illuminating in the way they gave insight into how hard it can be to medicate effectively children with complex neurological and clinical needs which might have differing responses to different drugs or variations in titration of the same drug. I was struck by the way in which Dr Ross Russell ran through the relatively limited list of possible drugs available to someone treating Fatima; the advantages and disadvantages of using them, and by the way in which he arrived at the point where he responded that he might indeed have considered trying Glycopybyronium again. At a different time in altered circumstances, he explained it might be effective, or it might be the best available option.</p>

It was not extubating (as is the case contended for by the Trust at this hearing) on a pathway to palliative care.

The disquiet Dr SB's evidence caused me added to that which I had already considered at [115] above that she and some of her colleagues had already in their own analysis of that balance decided   that the burdens were such that they sufficiently outweighed the benefits that application had been made to discontinue her life support. It is hard, when such a decision has already been made in the mind of a professional for that professional to look objectively at aspects of presentation which might go against that view.

Consciously or otherwise, most likely otherwise, if a professional has arrived already at a conclusion in their own mind that a child&#8217;s best interests are served by palliative care path to death,  there is, as I see it, a real risk that that may affect the lens through which things like awareness  and responsiveness are viewed.

Pleasure is a subjective quality. It is easy to understand pleasure in someone who is well; less so in someone who is not. To take a hypothetical example (away from Fatima) &#8211; For a sports enthusiast perhaps pleasure might come from playing or watching sport. In someone who becomes less well and cannot play any more, it is not difficult to see that pleasure might still come from watching it; if less well still, perhaps from lying in a hospital bed and listening to it ; perhaps listening and discussing it in the company of friends or family members who played or went to matches together when they could ; if less well still, unable to communicate verbally,  perhaps showing signs of recognition when the sports broadcast is turned on and a perceptible awareness that the friends they once played alongside have come into sit beside the bed in company with them. When does that experience cease to become pleasure or a benefit? I have found it useful to remind myself, by thinking in those theoretical terms, of the spectrum across which pleasure may be experienced and of the way in which pleasure may mean different things to different individuals, and for that matter different things to the same individual according to circumstances.</span></p>

The evidence of Fatima&#8217;s reaction as she hears her mother's voice and the change in her when her family arrive is in my view not only to be counted as a benefit (in the language of the balance I must carry out) but also as an expression of some pleasure. Whilst I am cautious in attributing much to the movement of her arms when considering whether it is what has been variously described as &#8216;purposeful&#8217; and &#8216;functional&#8217; and on the evidence she does not reach out or grasp independently for items, I do not see that observed increased movement  by those who report it as linked to  a parents arrival  falls to be  dismissed  in the same way.  In my judgment ,  along with benefit of deriving solace and comfort from their presence, the touch of her mother&#8217;s hand, her parents&#8217; voices, the security of her father's arms as she is carried from one side of the bed to the other to be winded and appeared to the Guardian to be comfortable held in the arms of the man for whom the notes record she reserves her biggest or broadest smiles; the attention of her brothers and sister are all sources of pleasure to her. I have discussed already the Guardian&#8217;s observation of Fatima&#8217;s response on 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> October and my conclusion that it is clear evidence of responsiveness. I regard it also as a response indicative of pleasure.</span></p>

Prominent in the burdens [83 et seq] above is that of pain from interventions. I do not underestimate the significance of pain as a burden. In contrast with for example </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Raqeeb</span><span style="color:#000000"> in which MacDonald J was able to proceed on the basis of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">no</span><span style="color:#000000"> pain (and thus as a matter of logic nothing to weigh in the balance of burdens as regards pain) here there is a mixed picture of sometimes experiencing pain; the question to weigh is whether alone or with other burdens the component of pain is such that it displaces the benefits leading me to a conclusion that it is in Fatima&#8217;s best interests for her life sustaining treatment to be withdrawn.  I regard this case as finely balanced. I have thought long and hard about where the balance lies in considering my decision within which consideration it has been necessary to examine with particular care the evidence available to me of Fatima&#8217;s levels of awareness and responsiveness. I have neither ignored the views of the eminent clinicians whose collective clinical view on the balance is that the burdens displace the benefits even if those benefits include the prospect of long-term ventilation with tracheostomy at home for (at most) a small number of years; nor have I underestimated the significance of pain.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Prominent in my thinking also has been the fact that Fatima&#8217;s Guardian has through Counsel strongly contended that the burdens of Fatima&#8217;s treatments and quality of life are such that continuance of her life sustaining treatment is not in her best interests. The Guardian has concluded that evidence of awareness and responsiveness, including her own observation discussed elsewhere, is outweighed by those burdens. That position taken by so experienced a social work professional, safeguarding Fatima&#8217;s interests independently of the Trust or her parents, warrants considerable respect. </span>Whilst the Guardian has been focussed on and given proper consideration to the burdens of Fatima&#8217;s condition and treatment, I have formed the impression that there has been an undervaluing of the benefits to her and on the totality of the evidence I have come to a different view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequence of that decision is that Fatima will undergo a tracheostomy with a view to a return home. That is not a path without risk or uncertainty and, as her Guardian has been astute to point out is one that carries with it its own burdens. I have not ignored those burdens but putting them into the overall burdens and benefits analysis I have found them to be outweighed by the prospect flowing from  of a step down from PICU and intensive care and the prospect of  a return home to  a life lived, for as long as that life may be, within her family by whom she is deeply loved, whose presence has been a constant in her life, in whose presence and from whom I am satisfied she retains an ability to take some pleasure.</p>
