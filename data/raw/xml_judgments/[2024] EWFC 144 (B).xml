	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">In or about 2015, the wife&#8217;s mother, who lived in Italy, required increasing care on account of being diagnosed with dementia. It is the wife&#8217;s case, which I accept, that the parties agreed that the wife would relocate to Italy to care for her mother. This was on the basis that the parties already had an Italian home and, says the wife, the parties respectively visited each other in England and Italy over the course of the time the wife&#8217;s mother required nursing care.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">The parties purchased their final English matrimonial home in about 2010. This was long after the children had grown up. It is the wife&#8217;s case, which I accept, but only after a careful weighing of all the evidence, that by 2014 the parties wanted to move on. The husband is a builder. At around this time he had started to develop back issues and it was clear he could not go on as a builder forever. The parties had options. They had retained for many years an Italian home which they could locate to. However, the parties&#8217; adult children and grandchildren were in England and so there would be attractions in staying in England, or at the very least having a pied &#224; terre here.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">On any option, the sale of the family home would release equity for the future. Whilst the parties have capital in the order of about &#163;1.5M, they have little pension provision. It has been a notable feature of this case that the cost of property and living in Italy is enviably cheaper than here in England. The release of equity would provide some free capital on any option to assist with retirement provision in addition to any state pensions.</p>

One photograph the wife dates as being on 28 April 2018, which was the date of a friend and neighbour&#8217;s wedding. The husband does not dispute the date. The photograph shows the wife in a black soft top F-Type Jaguar motor vehicle. The vehicle belonged to the wife. It appears (as I will explain later) that a BMW belonging to the wife was sold in about 2016. This would have the Jaguar being purchased after that date. </p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">Surveying the wide canvass, as I must, on the balance of probabilities, it seems unlikely that the wife would have purchased such a luxury vehicle if she had moved to Italy permanently in 2014. The husband&#8217;s case is that the parties remained on &#8220;good terms&#8221; and that despite having separated in 2014, she later acquired this vehicle which the husband stored in the garage to the family home. He further asserts that he was insured on the vehicle and would drive it from time to time. I do not accept this account.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">In or about 2018/2019 (the exact date is not material), the husband had a relationship with another woman. The husband said that the relationship lasted about 18 months. During this time, he told the wife he was going on a fishing trip to St Petersburg. In the hearing we did not explore the precise itinerary and detail of the trip, save to note that this woman accompanied the husband. The wife was speaking on the phone to the husband during the trip and she heard a woman&#8217;s voice in the background. When challenged he said that it was the television. Later in 2019, he admitted to the wife that he had been in a relationship. If the parties had not been in relationship since 2014, it seems unlikely that the wife would have been calling the husband when on holiday in 2019, and also challenging him about the sound of a woman&#8217;s voice in the background. It would have been none of her business. However, both parties accept that this exchange about the woman&#8217;s voice did take place.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">Despite having placed the family home on the market in or about 2014/2015, it took until November 2018 to sell. At this point the wife returned to live in the parties&#8217; Italian family home. The husband remained in England and went to live with the parties&#8217; daughter. This was, in part, to assist her with renovations to her own home. However, at some point shortly thereafter the husband and his daughter fell out and he was no longer welcome to stay in her house. It seems, on the balance of probabilities, that the daughter had &#8220;taken the wife&#8217;s side&#8221; about the husband&#8217;s relationship with another woman. Had the relationship between the parties truly ended in 2014 then I doubt there would have been this kind of falling out between father and daughter.</p>

A further particular alleged in the petition is that, &#8220;The Respondent used manipulative behaviour by promising he would retire to Italy with the Petitioner, but he never came. He would not respond to calls or engage fully in conversation to resolve marital disputes and would disappear for days on end without contact.&#8221;</p>

The daughter has made plain in correspondence that she agrees that this money must be returned, but that she regards it as a loan from both of her parents. Each party indicated within the hearing that they would offer me an undertaking to share 50% of the loan with the other, depending on how the daughter decides to make the repayment.</p>

Again, the parties can deal with this by way of like undertakings, should it ever be repaid.</p>

The husband is nestled back into the wife&#8217;s chest taking a &#8220;selfie&#8221; photograph of the parties together. It is a warm and intimate photo. The parties look relaxed and happy together. The husband disputes the date which the wife asserts. The wife says it was taken on the way to a holiday together in Italy on or about 20 July 2018. The husband says that it was taken after the parties had sold their home in November 2018 when they took many of their possessions to their Italian family home. The wife is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt. It is also &#8220;shoulder-less&#8221; in style. It is not in any way immodest, but it is &#8220;skimpy&#8221;. On the balance of probabilities, I do not think that this is the way someone would dress when boarding a plane in England in the winter months. The husband&#8217;s attempts to persuade me otherwise simply do not ring true.</p>

Difficult questions can arise as to whether and to what extent property which starts out as non-marital acquires a marital character requiring it to be divided under the sharing principle. It will all depend on the circumstances, and the court will look at when the property was acquired, how it has been used, whether it has been mingled with the family finances and what the parties intended.</p>

Of course, in very many cases, possibly most cases, this will be very obviously marked by the parties&#8217; cohabiting, possibly in conjunction with the purchase of a property. However, in other cases, and this may be one of them, it is not so easy to identify. The mere fact that parties begin to spend time in each other&#8217;s houses does not of itself, it seems to me, equate to marriage. In situations such as this the court must look at an accumulation of markers of marriage which eventually will take the relationship over the threshold into a quasi-marital relationship which may then either be added to the marriage to establish a longer marriage or becomes a weightier factor as one of the circumstances of the case.&#8221;</p>

Shortly put, it is normally the right date because the economic features of the parties&#8217; marital partnership will have remained alive and entangled up to that point. The fruits of&#160;the partnership will not have been divided and distributed. The share of one party in the partnership assets is likely to have been unilaterally traded with by the other. I accept that a different view might be taken in respect of a completely new asset brought into being during the interregnum between separation and trial. But that is not the case here.

Delays set in. The application was listed as a reserve hearing in November 2023 but then stood out to avoid brief fees being incurred. Following yet more delays, we arrived at the May 2024 final hearing with no time for written questions to be asked of the SJE.</p>

I was left with the impression that the husband was unable to summon a clear recollection about this. However, he did not say this either.

The wife stated that her mother had previously lived in England and had come &#8220;unstuck&#8221; at one point by not having an English bank account in her sole name. The wife was making arrangements pursuant to a change in her life, namely an unspecified time relocating to Italy, and she wanted an English account.

The wife and her mother were sleeping downstairs in what sounds like makeshift beds to accommodate the mother&#8217;s frailty. The parties had a family home in Italy at their disposal.</p>

One can see a balance in the account in 2014 at &#163;51,126, rising each year to show a figure of &#163;277,454 which the husband says are the fruits of his post-separation endeavours. The yearly savings (excluding the receipt of the husband&#8217;s share of the net proceeds of sale of the English family home) range between &#163;17,000 and about &#163;50,000.</p>

Why was the money not paid to the wife? I have already noted above that the reply to this relates to a complex description of accounting as between husband and wife, whereby the husband was permitted to keep the money on account of the wife having accessed some funds in Italy held on his account, albeit in his sister&#8217;s name. The character of the Italian funds were not explored. I am left slightly baffled about all of this, but doubting, if indeed the &#163;25,000 on 11 July 2016 does relate to a car sale belonging to the wife, that this is the husband&#8217;s post-separation endeavour which he is entitled to keep.</p>

This was said to be a monthly repayment to the husband for works which he did for a garage-owning friend in 2015. Rather than pay the &#163;40,000 up front, there appears to have been some kind of agreement, based upon the husband&#8217;s good friendship with the owner of AA, that he would receive monthly repayments and a small commission on each MOT which was undertaken until the &#163;40,000 was repaid. All of the works having been undertaken in 2015, the later receipts were not &#8220;endeavour&#8221; but simply receipts for work done at an earlier date, much more proximate, even on the husband&#8217;s case, to a time when the marriage was subsisting. </p>

The husband was unable to tell me what these relate to, despite their scale when set against the size of his economy. I think there may have been a suggestion that one was a cash payment from a premium bond, but the husband did not give me chapter and verse as to the character of the premium bond so that I could understand whether it was non-matrimonial in character.

He says that although the husband has lost in the final analysis, he was not frivolous in pursuing these points. He submits that there where there is a legitimate dispute over material facts that should not necessarily result in a costs&#8217; penalty for the losing party.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Allen also analyses the wife&#8217;s offer dated 28 February 2024 and points out that she was not quite asserting a 50/50 split and that the precise terms of the offer resulted in a capital offset in her favour, as the assets were understood at that point, as to her 54.7%. He says that 20 May 2024 offer is too late to have any costs&#8217; potency. Further, the wife did not win on her getting the Italian family home in settlement. Mr Allen says that the wife is not the clear winner in that respect.</p>

He says the husband&#8217;s conduct did not cause disproportionate costs to be incurred by the wife and that I should be slow to penalise the husband in the overall context of this case.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">The wife&#8217;s open offer was much closer to the outcome than the husband&#8217;s. It was a reasonable attempt at settlement. Although I do bear in mind that the wife did not get it all her own way in the final analysis, as the husband kept the Italian family home. I am afraid to say that the husband&#8217;s open offer was unreasonable.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">At paragraph [96] the court found that each party had points of substance to make. Ultimately the wife&#8217;s case prevailed. I do not consider that this was an unreasonable case to contest by the husband. Whilst the Italian life policy was a hinderance, this taken alone would not persuade me to make a substantive costs&#8217; order. The bribery allegation did not add to costs.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">Reasonable and/or unreasonable open offers may well have costs consequences. There is little point in having rules, practice directions and stern proclamations from the higher courts if they are not followed through with. Whilst the husband was free to contest the issues which he did, the law is plain that if his open offer was unreasonable, he faced a costs&#8217; peril. It would have been open to him, for example, to contest these issues but make some kind of open compromise offer which hedged his position, factoring in some litigation risk he may lose.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">As to quantum I am going to say &#163;20,000 should be paid. The reduction from the amount requested takes into account a broad assessment of the reasonableness and proportionality of costs and also factors into account that on one issue, the wife&#8217;s offer was not adopted. I am satisfied that such an order will not have undue financial implications on the husband.</p>

Whilst I bear this in mind, I think that this is likely to have only a slight impact on private and family life and such impact must be weighed against countervailing factors in favour of publication. No particular harm has been asserted to flow from any identification, although I accept there may be some embarrassment.  I bear in mind that it is the usual practice of many other courts to publish their decisions without anonymisation in any event.</p>
