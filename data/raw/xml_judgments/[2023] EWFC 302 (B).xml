The Father appears through Counsel Ms Rhone-Adrien, and the Mother through Mr Arksey of Counsel.  I say immediately that Counsel have conducted themselves in an exemplarily manner through this case.  Each of them could have had much more to say, none of which would have assisted me.  By way of example, in closing submissions Mr Arksey made it clear that he was not wanting to mud-sling, although had of course to respond to submissions made on behalf of the Father.  It is an example of what both Counsel have demonstrated throughout the hearing.  Very often advocates feel they have to &#8216;point score&#8217; &#8211; Counsel did not engage with such in this case.  Instead they focussed on those issues which were likely to, and did, assist me.  I could not have been assisted any further by counsel: I am most grateful to them.</p>

She said nothing about her move at that hearing.  Father&#8217;s counsel emailed the representative of the Mother to indicate that the Father would collect the children from the school on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2021.

She has moved to a rural location where any cab fare to a station would be &#163;20.  She moved without apparent consideration of the impact on the Children of their move from school or to contact.  She planned the move during school holiday and with no proper planning and, on her case, signed a tenancy agreement very shortly after considering the move.</p>

She blames her barrister at the hearing on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2021 for that.  So the Father was left, on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2021, without the children not knowing where they were and having no idea where to start looking for them.  It would have been a terrifying time for him.  Her solicitors, who the Mother says she told, should have passed on that the Mother had moved if they had been told.  Likewise, Counsel has a duty not to mislead the Court.  If Counsel had been told about the move, they would have had a duty to the Court not to mislead the Court in the administration of justice.  I find it very unlikely that both her solicitors and Counsel overlooked telling the Father or his representatives of the move.  I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Mother acted in a way that meant the Father would not know of her move.</p>

The matter came before the Court for a contested hearing before Recorder Stott on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2021.  At that hearing contact was agreed.  Where previously the handover was at Redhill Station, it moved to Watford Junction Train Station.  By that time, of course, the Father was in difficulty in relation to the relocation as the Children were in a new school in Buckinghamshire, a school the Mother denied him the opportunity of visiting before she unilaterally enrolled the Children.</p>

It happened in December 2021, it happened when the Mother sought to reduce contact to indirect only in May 2022.  In her August 2022 statement she tells the Court she will commence working so will not be able to transport the children to their Father from October 2022.  There was no application to vary, there is just the statement that she will not be able to transport the Children.  It is an example of the Mother believing she is able to dictate what can happen.  Matters need to be agreed and, if not agreed, the Court will decide.  It is not open to any party to say &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing/can&#8217;t do it&#8221;.

If this matter comes back before me under this new regime, if children do not live with father as stipulated (on alternate weekends), I may have no choice but to consider that the only way the Children will see both parents is by the arrangements being swapped with them living with their Father in the week and alternate Sundays, and they live with their Mother on alternate weekends.</p>
