They included allegations of aggravated rape, grievous bodily harm, attempted murder, aggravated fraud, threats to sexually abuse the child, attacks on the mother&#8217;s cat, and threats to kill. 26 out of those 27 allegations were found not only to be &#8220;not proved&#8221; but &#8220;fabricated by the mother.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The mother applied to the Court of Appeal for permission, but on 6 September 2021 withdrew her appeal against the fact-finding judgment. This step by the mother is highly significant. She thereby accepted that the findings made against her were true and correct. Yet, before me, the she dramatically denounced the entire child arrangements application made by the father as malicious, threatening and unprecedented.</p>

It merely requires a person who has repeatedly made wholly unmeritorious claims or applications to have any new claim or application which falls within the scope of the order reviewed by a judge at the outset to determine whether it should be permitted to proceed. The purpose of a civil restraint order is simply to protect the court&#8217;s process from abuse, and not to shut out claims or applications which are properly arguable.&#8221; </p>

The GCH senior staff who assisted RBKC in this, betrayed A&#8217;s educational interests in the process. Following the collapse of RBKC&#8217;s case against me, I resolved to continue supporting A&#8217;s attendance at GCH, hoping that relations with GCH would improve now that the court proceedings were over. However, by the end of 2021, A was desperately unhappy to continue attending the school and begged me to let her home school until I was able to secure a private school place for her. After much careful consideration, I agreed.&#8221;</p>

The father himself was not educated privately and his other children aged 13 and 9 are not educated privately. But in her oral submissions to me the mother stated that about 10 years ago the father wrote an email in which he accepted the principle of a private education at secondary level. That was the first time in this huge and extensive litigation that such a stance on the part of the father had ever been alleged. This email was not produced with the mother&#8217;s additional statement of 7 October 2022 which I allowed her to file after the hearing concluded (see above). However on 12 October 2022, after this judgment had been largely written and the day before the scheduled hand-down, the mother wrote to my clerk stating that she had found two emails and asked for permission to file them. With reluctance I allowed her to do so and I gave permission to the father to file a statement in response on 14 October 2022.   </p>

Your letter was the first I had heard of the Kambala school or that Katie was in fact asking me to commit to payment of school fees for the next 12 years or so at a cost of up to around $30,000. As you may imagine your letter therefore came as quite a surprise.</p>

The schedule attached to your letter lists far  greater costs. I do not know when these are meant to start. As indicated in my email to Katie I am not in a position to pay anything in addition to the maintenance payments I currently make. Only when the payments reduce around A&#8217;s fifth birthday do I anticipate being in a position to contribute towards school fees. At that point in time I would want to be much more involved in the decision about which school is appropriate for her and what a fair level of contribution might be. In the circumstances I am certainly not willing to enter into any new binding arrangements. As for the suggestion that you will commence proceedings in the UK, I will clearly have to take advice about this when I return home.&#8221;</p>

As is clear from the two emails she has now disclosed, that is not the case. I have never agreed to pay for private school fees. I merely indicated, over a decade ago and when A had just turned three years old, that I would be willing to discuss the issue at some point in the (then) future. I also made it clear in the same email that I would want to be involved in any decision about which school would be appropriate for A. As the court is aware, I have not been.</p>

To the best of my recollection, whilst I was in Australia to visit A in March 2011, Ms. De Renee asked me, out of the blue, to attend an appointment with her solicitor, Mr. Michael Conley &#8230; Ms. De Renee wanted me to meet Mr. Conley to agree an amendment to the Binding Financial Agreement we had entered into in relation to child support. I subsequently (and whilst still in Australia) received a letter  from Mr. Conley explaining the purpose of the appointment and attaching a schedule of school fees for the Kambala School (a Church of England school).</p>

I wrote the email in a state of some confusion as to why I was being asked to pay for school fees. Whilst I have always taken the view that I would not want any child of mine attending private school in the UK, I had little understanding of the Australian education system and knew nothing about the State&#8217;s provision of education. I did not know whether it was normal or usual for children to attend private school. Furthermore, I was trying not to be unnecessarily dif&#64257;cult or obstructive, as the primary purpose of my visit was to spend time with A and I did not want to jeopardise that.</p>

It was as a result of this that Ms. De Renee made it clear to me she was not willing to facilitate me having further contact with A. For example, she refused to allow me to telephone A when I returned to the UK and refused to allow me to have any face-to-face contact with A when I next visited Australia in March 2012. It was because she took this stance that I commenced proceedings in Australia on 22 September 2011 for parenting orders, the equivalent of a Child Arrangements Order. This is the application that led to the order of Judge Scarlett dated 19 October 2012.&#8221;</p>

In my judgment it would be in her best interests for her to attend a state secondary school. I cannot accept that the local authority or the staff at Grey  Coat Hospital school conspired to sabotage A&#8217;s educational interests. Equally, I think it unlikely A herself has independently formed the uninfluenced view that she would not be happy until she left that excellent state school and was placed in a private school, a position which coincidentally exactly reflected the views of her mother. </p>

As stated above, the father himself was not educated privately and his other children aged 13 and 9 are not educated privately. The mother has emphasised to me repeatedly that the father was deprived of parental responsibility in Australia (but not here) and that accordingly, in her opinion, hers is the only parental voice that should be heard on the question of education. The father should have no say or other input, according to her, other than to pay. In my judgment to force him to do so would be a gross injustice which I am not prepared to contemplate.</p>

There is no evidence of the present level of the father&#8217;s income. In June 2018 District Judge Aitken found his gross taxable income to be &#163;185,000, inclusive of dividends from Assurety Ltd. He is now a silk of 8 years&#8217; standing practising from an elite set of chambers. He is a leader in the field of employment and equality law. I would be surprised if his gross taxable income (including dividends) was less than &#163;350,000. At that level, applying the guideline, his liability for child maintenance would be &#163;2,361 per month. I have to say, notwithstanding the oppressive nature of the mother&#8217;s conduct towards the father, that the present level of general maintenance strikes me as too low. </p>
