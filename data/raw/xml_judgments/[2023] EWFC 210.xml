After some 30 months of litigation the wife had not provided a schedule of alleged non-disclosure of assets notwithstanding the extensive costs expended by her.  In such circumstances, it would not be appropriate to authorise any further costs to be expended on that question, save those required to facilitate the meetings required to finalise the joint expert report, to take legal advice in respect of the conclusions of that report and to give instruction on it.</p>

The court gave directions to PTR on 17 November 2022 and the court expected those directions will be complied with.  Under the LSPO the wife would have legal funds to do so.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">With respect to MPS, the task of the court was complicated by the fact is that these interim applications involved contrasting presentations as to value, as to income and as to need, and the fact that it is neither possible nor appropriate to resolve those competing positions at an interim hearing.</p>

The court also ordered the husband to pay the rental deposit and the moving costs for the wife to return to London.  It will also be apparent from my previous judgment that I re-timetabled the case management directions made in this case to take the matter to final hearing dealing with the completion of expert report, updating valuations of US properties, agreement on tax issues or the provision of a jointly instructed tax report, agreement on pension issues or the provision of a jointly instructed pension report, updating disclosure and witness statements.</p>

However, following the hearing in June 2023, instead of taking up rented accommodation in London, as she had stated to the court was her intention, the wife instead moved into one of the parties&#8217; properties in Wyoming.   Ms Campbell on behalf of the husband sought to demonstrate that this was the wife&#8217;s intention at the time she represented to this court that she intended to take up rental accommodation in London, that is a matter that falls to be dealt with at the final hearing if necessary.   However, and quite remarkably, on 21 July 2023 David Lillywhite, the wife&#8217;s former solicitor at Burgess Mee, sent a demand for payment of removal costs of &#163;19,123 relating to the wife&#8217;s relocation to Wyoming without any apparent reference to the fact that that step did not accord with what had been represented to the court by the wife only a month before.  The husband also contends, by reference, to a LinkedIn page, that the wife is now in employment in Wyoming.  Again, that is a matter which the court cannot take to conclusion at this interim hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife is currently engaged in litigation against a US bank in Wyoming arising out of the husband having paid down part of the mortgage on the Wyoming properties in 2022.  In July 2023 the wife lost her case against the US bank with prejudice.  As a result, the US bank deducted $113,000 from the parties&#8217; joint account to satisfy the costs awarded against the wife (the husband contends that had the Wife not failed to comply with a direction of this court made in November 2022 that she set up a corporate bank account to assist in the management of the Wyoming properties, this money would not have been lost).  The wife continues to litigate against the husband in the US on the same grounds as she pursued against the bank, although he has not been served with proceedings and has instructed lawyers in the US to apply to dismiss the proceedings.  The court was informed that the wife is funding the costs of that continuing litigation through a conditional fee agreement.  Within this context, at this hearing the husband initially sought an anti-suit injunction or Hemain injunction to prevent the wife from pursuing litigation against him in the US.  However, the court having indicated that that application would need to be listed for a separate hearing, the husband elected not to pursue that application on the grounds of cost.</p>

The application that brought the matter back before the court was an application by wife to vary the LSPO to permit the funds payable under that order to be paid to her new solicitors (a drafting error meaning that the LSPO did not make provision for payment to any successor firm).   In addition, the parties had been incapable of agreeing the terms of the directions order following the hearing in June and sought to advance further arguments on a range of case management issues.  On the day of the hearing, the wife issued an application for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> to prevent the husband from taking steps to transfer, dispose of or in any way deal with &#8220;any crypto assets he holds&#8221; and the policy, including using it as collateral for any borrowing.</p>

The court declined the application for a freezing order in respect to cryptocurrency assets but granted the order in respect of the policy.  For a second time, the court re-timetabled the case management directions.  In circumstances where none of the cardinal case management directions with respect to the completion of expert report, updating valuations of US properties, agreement on tax issues or the provision of a jointly instructed tax report, agreement on pension issues or the provision of a jointly instructed tax report, updating disclosure and witness statements had been complied with, and for the reasons set out in my judgement of that date, the court was compelled to vacate the final hearing listed in October 2023 and re-list the final hearing in February 2024. At this hearing it was apparent that, notwithstanding the court making an LPSO in favour of the wife in June 2023, and thereafter varying the order to permit funds to be paid to her new solicitors in September 2023, such of those directions that were due to have been completed by the date of this hearing had <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> not been complied with.

As I further noted, that decision was not the subject of an appeal.  The husband now, however, contends that the court&#8217;s conclusion that his savings and investments of &#163;514,443 were liquid was erroneous.  In this regard, Ms Campbell relies on the fact that as early as 2 May 2023, the husband wrote to the wife highlighting the likely need to rely on the policy to deal with outstanding liabilities in the context of law levels of liquidity.   Ms Campbell further relies on the fact that the husband, when submitting typographical corrections in respect of the judgment of June 2023, at which time the husband was a litigant in person, made clear his position that the &#163;514,443 in &#8220;Savings and Investments&#8221; were illiquid in circumstances where they comprised of private equity and venture capital investments and land investments, which could not easily be realised.   That suggested correction was not adopted by the court.</p>

Where the court is considering whether to vary an MPS order, the court will again need to consider the question of whether there has been a change of circumstances since the MPS order was granted and, if so, to apply the principles applicable to the determination of an application for MPS to those changed circumstances, namely &#8220;reasonableness&#8221;.  </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Almost invariably, an application to vary an earlier periodical payments order will be brought on the basis that there has been some change in the circumstances since the original order was made; otherwise, except in exceptional circumstances, the application will, in effect, be an appeal. If an order is not appealed against, or is made by consent, then the presumption must be that the order was correct when made. If it was correct when made, then there will usually be no justification for varying it unless there has been a material change in the circumstances. However, because of the impact of continuing inflation, because children grow older and cost more to support and because, for example, the cost of living in its increase may hit one party harder than another, it will usually follow that, if time has passed, there will inevitably have been some changes in the circumstances, and in particular in the financial circumstances, of the parties concerned.&#8221;</p>

On occasions, the court may be slow to accede to an application to vary a consent order; not least because the parties' solicitors might otherwise be deterred from either seeking to negotiate such a provision or to achieve finality. Another factor which may influence a court will be the time that has passed since the original order was made. If an application consequent on an order is brought very soon after that order has been made, the court, in normal circumstances, is likely to attach more weight to the earlier order than if it had been made some years previously. Likewise, the court would expect to pay full regard to any special terms agreed between the parties at the time the original order was made &#8211; as, for example, when endorsements on briefs or contemporaneous correspondence show that an agreed order has, for some particular reason, been set at an artificially low figure. Shortly stated, the court must decide what weight it should attach to the original order and all the surrounding circumstances. However, once an application to vary is before it, the court is fully entitled to make an order considering all the circumstances afresh, paying such regard to the old order as may be thought appropriate.&#8221;</p>

I am further satisfied that the MPS order should be varied to remove the provisions in that order which deal with rent.  I am satisfied that the husband&#8217;s application that the parties be released from undertakings with respect to the bank accounts and for the net rental income from the Wyoming property and the properties in New York be divided equally between the parties, his application for an order that the wife vacate the Wyoming property and his application to discharge the MPS and LSP orders should be dismissed.

The husband seeks to discharge the LSPO and MPS orders on the grounds that the parties living expenses and legal expenses can be met by the arrangement he proposes, including borrowing against the policy.  The latter step would require the discharge of the freezing order, which the husband submits is in any event justified having regard to the established principles governing such orders, and the discharge of the scheme of undertakings governing the income generated by the US residential properties that has been in place for some 12 months.  Subject to her application for an adjournment, the wife resists the applications to discharge the MPS and LSP orders and seeks to enforce the sums outstanding under those orders.  In turn, the husband argues that in such circumstances the court will in any event have to permit access to the policy and the rental income from the US properties if those orders are to be satisfied by him whilst allowing him to meet his own outgoings.  </p>

With respect to the husband&#8217;s case, there has been no appeal of the court&#8217;s finding in June 2023 with respect to the extent of his liquid assets as including his investments.  There is no updating disclosure to support his narrative of spending from his bank accounts.  With respect to the wife&#8217;s case, she has not pursued rental accommodation in London presented to the court as a firm requirement in June 2023 notwithstanding provision of &#163;7,000 per month to meet that stated need, but instead has taken the unilateral decision to occupy one of the matrimonial properties that was producing a rental income.  Her assertion that the husband can afford to maintain the current payments on the LSP and MPS orders without the need to lift the injunction on the policy appears to be based, at least in part, on her continuing and still unparticularised assertion that the husband has extensive undisclosed assets.  </p>

However, as has been consistently recognised in other cases, it is not unusual for the court to be faced with an incomplete evidential picture when dealing with applications at the interim stage of financial remedy proceedings.  Indeed, this was also the position at the time when this court made LSP and MPS orders in June 2023 in favour of the wife.  Having regard to the issues before the court at this hearing, which centre on the extent to which the orders made in June should continue, be varied or be discharged, I am satisfied that the court has before it sufficient information to deal with those interim questions.  </p>

Whilst the court is prepared to proceed at an interim stage on the basis of less comprehensive evidence than that which will be available at the final hearing, I am satisfied that the court should only proceed so far as is necessary to ensure the position of the parties in the interim, pending the final hearing.  In circumstances where interim applications inevitably involve contrasting presentations as to value, as to income and as to need, and the fact that it is neither possible nor appropriate to resolve those competing positions at an interim hearing, this is not the occasion to engage in a comprehensive restructuring of the financial position between the parties in the absence of their having been any updating disclosure in this case since July 2022 and in the absence of the court being able, at an interim stage, to investigate and determine issues such as non-disclosure of assets.  In this context, I am satisfied that the court should make only those orders that are strictly necessary to ensure the parties&#8217; respective positions in the 12 weeks before the commencement of the final hearing.</p>

With respect to the LSP order, I am not satisfied that the circumstances have changed in a way that would justify the court altering the conclusion it reached in June 2023 that, without the provision of funds under an LSPO, the wife would not reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services up to and including the final hearing.   With respect to the LSP order, Ms Campbell candidly concedes, as she must, that the husband is in breach of the LSP order in circumstances where there remains &#163;30,827 outstanding on the amount payable up to the PTR.   </p>

As set out above, in June 2023 the wife stated to the court that it was her intention to return to rented accommodation in central London.  In that context, the court concluded that the husband must make reasonable provision for the wife's rent in London, absent which provision she would not be able to secure reasonable accommodation.  Notwithstanding the wife&#8217;s clear representation to the court, she did not take up rental accommodation in London, but instead moved to occupy one of the matrimonial properties in Wyoming.   It was not suggested at this hearing that this is anything other than a permanent move pending the final hearing.  </p>

Whilst the wife sought to suggest that the &#163;7,000 per month should be redirected to meet expenses consequent on her visiting the children in the US and England, there is no supporting budget in this regard.  In any event, on its face, &#163;7,000 per month on expenses related to visiting the children cannot be considered reasonable.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the rental component of the MPS order of &#163;7,000 should be removed, leaving a monthly MPS payment of &#163;11,862 to the final hearing in February.</p>

The husband contends that the liquid assets set out in the unagreed updated Schedule of assets are not sufficient to cover the obligations summarised above up to the final hearing and that the policy must now be available to meet those obligations, the criteria for a freezing order not being met in any event.  Against this, on the information before the court, the wife contends that no adjustments are necessary in order for the husband to continue to meet his obligations under the LSP and MPS orders and the freezing order should be maintained to meet a real risk of unjustified dissipation.  </p>

At this interim stage however, even if equipped with updating disclosure, the court would not be in a position at this short hearing to engage in a line by line analysis of the appropriateness or otherwise of the husband&#8217;s expenditure from his bank accounts, which exercise can be undertaken at the final hearing if necessary and adjustments made to the final division of assets if justified.  At this interim stage, and subject to further consideration at the final hearing, I am satisfied that the husband now has available to him significantly reduced funds in his bank accounts, a significant portion of which has been spent on meeting his obligations under the LSP and MPS orders. </p>

As was as made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Garner</span> however, albeit in a different context, where the court is seised of an application to vary the position established by a previous order the court is entitled to make an order considering all the circumstances, paying such regard to the original order as is appropriate.  To take any other approach would risk delay and more expense consequent upon the court not being able to acknowledge and take into account new or corrected information.  It is correct that the court&#8217;s finding that the &#8220;Savings and Investments&#8221; of &#163;514,443 were liquid was not the subject of an appeal.  Against this, the husband is now represented and, as Ms Campbell demonstrates, further scrutiny of the Schedule prepared for the hearing in June 2023 and for this hearing does demonstrate some private equity investments and venture capital investments and land investments included under the &#8220;Savings and Investments&#8221; heading.   Again, the interim nature of this hearing does not lend itself to a detailed exploration of the competing positions on this issue.  It is however, vital that this matter can be made ready for what will be the third listing of the final hearing in February 2024.  These parties have now spent the best part of &#163;2M in legal costs on proceedings that have been ongoing for two and a half years.  These proceedings must now be brought to an effective conclusion.  In such circumstances, I am satisfied that any doubt as to the current extent of funds available to ensure the obligations ahead of the final hearing can be met in the interim falls to be decided in favour of a course of action that keeps these proceedings on track to final hearing. </p>

In these circumstances, and where the husband indicated from May 2023 that the policy might be required, where the wife originally pursued the policy for that very purpose in June 2023 and the husband again wrote to the wife in August 2023 with the same proposal, I am further satisfied that the criteria for continuing the freezing order are not met.</p>

I acknowledge that this represents a shortfall on the husband&#8217;s own figures for the period leading up to the final hearing.  However, within the limitations placed on the court by this being an interim hearing, and in particular the incomplete nature of the evidence before the court in that context, I am not satisfied that court should go further and implement the complete re-ordering of  the interim arrangements between the parties proposed by the husband, comprised of the release of undertakings with respect to the bank accounts, for an order that the wife vacate the Wyoming property and for the net rental income from the Wyoming property and the properties in New York be divided equally between the parties and to discharge the MPS and LSPO.  In circumstances where the court is not yet in a position to determine the competing arguments of the parties with respect to non-disclosure of assets, employment income and liquidity, I am satisfied that the court should only proceed so far as is necessary at this interim stage to ensure the position of the parties with respect to living and legal expenses pending the final hearing.
