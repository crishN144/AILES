Where do they fit within the definition of domestic abuse found in Practice Direction 12J?  Certainly, the father would threaten to self-harm if ever the mother said she was going to leave.  He has mental health issues which until recently had not been sufficiently regulated.  </span></p>

There was a clear pattern of intimidatory behaviour, but it is difficult to see to what end.  It seems to me more likely that the father was taking revenge on anyone associated with the mother due to his anger and his feelings of rejection at the end of the relationship and his concern that he would not see L.  He was not getting his own way and decided to threaten and intimidate the ones he thought were preventing this.  The threats were to punish the mother and others.  It amounted to coercive behaviour.  </span></p>
