Painful past experience has taught that the greatest care needs to be taken if the risk of obtaining unreliable evidence is to be minimised. Children are often poor historians. They are likely to view interviewers as authority figures. Many are suggestible. Many more wish to please. They do not express themselves clearly or in adult terms, so that what they say can easily be misinterpreted if the listeners are not scrupulous to avoid jumping to conclusions. They may not have understood what was said or done to them or in their presence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found the mother to be a particularly unsatisfactory and unreliable witness. When her daughter C gave evidence of being sexually abused or of engaging in sexually activity with her siblings, she evinced no emotion or distress whatsoever. When she came to give her evidence her demeanour was even more extraordinary. For most of her evidence her answers were interspersed with her laughing or giggling or smirking. I do not doubt she may have been nervous &#8211; although she gave no impression of being so. I have never seen a parent in a care case let alone one where the most serious allegations of intrafamilial sexual abuse over a period of years have been made, give evidence in such a manner. </p>

First, in a statement filed shortly before the start of this fact finding hearing the mother conceded, that sexual activity between her older children, J, L, B, and C, had probably occurred. When pressed, however, by Ms Fottrell QC, on behalf of the local authority, she resiled from those concessions save for two &#8211; namely that B and C had engaged in sexual activity and that PH encouraged J to behave in a sexual way towards his siblings. Then a few moments later she accepted that J and C had engaged in sexual activity over a period of six years. Thus either her concessions were false and a lie or she lied in her evidence when she resiled from the same. </p>

She asserted that J lived for a period of time at his maternal grandmother&#8217;s home and would not have been at the family home on school nights. Although it is true that for some two years after starting at secondary school J did spend time living at his grandmother&#8217;s house, that does not explain the mother&#8217;s acceptance and then minimisation of sexual activity between J and C. </p>

An agreed basis of threshold, acknowledging this neglect, was filed at court on 11 April 2012. When asked about her care and supervision of the children, the mother said she did do the housework. She denied she was drunk or that she slept on the sofa for most of the day. She claimed she had wanted to contest the basis of that threshold but was advised there was no point. She claimed not to be aware of the agreed basis of that threshold. She told me that the children were not neglected, they were not dirty and unkempt and that the washing machine was constantly on. All of this evidence was a lie and is palpable nonsense. The very considerable body of available evidence demonstrates overwhelmingly the degree of chronic and severe neglect of all seven of the children. </p>

The mother began her answer by saying she had been more vigilant, but then she paused and said that she had always been vigilant and that every time the children came home from school and again at bedtime she stood on the landing to ensure that the boys did not go into the girls&#8217; rooms and that the girls did not go into the boys&#8217; rooms. She said she had always ensured that the boys and the girls were in separate rooms and dressed separately.
