B was joined to the proceedings by HHJ Lynch at an earlier case management stage, and appears through her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Miss J.  I have a helpful report from Miss J.  The Guardian is represented by counsel, as is the Local Authority. I am particularly grateful to Ms Anning (for the Local Authority) for the careful and scrupulously fair way in which she has prepared and presented the case for the Local Authority.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has a long and complicated litigation history which needs to be summarily reviewed in order to place these current applications in context.  B is the mother&#8217;s fourth child.  Her first child, who I shall refer to as S, was born in December 2002.  She was the subject of public law process in December 2013 (when she was 11 years old), having made allegations that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather (the father of B). She was interviewed under ABE Guidelines shortly before Christmas 2013, and in light of the contents of that interview, she was removed into care under Emergency Protection procedures.  The proceedings concerning S were complicated to some extent by the fact that neither the mother nor the father (i.e. the step-father of S) chose to have legal representation &#8211; a decision they have maintained for most of all subsequent litigation concerning their children.  Although the mother and father were advised in correspondence, and at interim hearings, that the issues they faced were serious, and the findings sought against them of such gravity that if made they would have profound consequences for them, the parents chose (so it appears) not to co-operate with or participate in the proceedings, and continued unrepresented.  The mother at least would have been automatically entitled to public funds. The father chose not to intervene in those proceedings and in the end the mother failed to attend the fact-finding hearing.  In February 2014, HHJ Anderson conducted that fact-finding hearing, delivering a judgment on 3 March 2014.  She made a range of findings against the father. The judgment is lengthy running to over 70 paragraphs.  </p>

The local authority applied for a care order, and initially the mother indicated her willingness to participate in assessment of her capacity to parent the baby. That early promise was soon supplanted with a reluctance, indeed an opposition, to engage with the social workers; the parents indicated a wish to appeal against HHJ Anderson&#8217;s findings and resolved not to work with the authority until that had happened. The parents made repeated application for HHJ Anderson to recuse herself; those applications failed. Although initially represented in these proceedings, within three months the parents&#8217; solicitors both came off the record. An independent social worker (from outside the area) was appointed by the court to assess the parents; her work did not get off the ground given the parents stance. In February 2015, a final care order and placement order was made in relation to K.</p>

These proceedings were once again, it seems, characterised by obstruction on the part of the parents, or the very least an unwillingness to engage; to accept service of documents; to participate in assessments; or attend court hearings. In November 2015, a final care order and placement order was made in relation to H.  </p>

The parents issued an application for permission to oppose the adoption order in respect of K; they issued an application in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division for injunctive relief to restrain the local authority from taking further steps in relation to the adoption. They further issued an application for permission to apply to revoke the placement order in respect of H.  All of these applications failed.  The dismissal of the applications in the Family Court by HHJ Lynch was the subject of an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal; Black LJ adjourned the consideration of permission to an oral hearing which was conducted by McFarlane LJ; on 1 September 2016, he refused the parents&#8217; permission.</p>

The parents have not engaged meaningfully with the Local Authority in the meantime.  The Local Authority maintains that B is doing well in foster care; the parents have raised concerns about her well-being and consider that she has been neglected and suspect that she has been abused.  They raised specific concerns following a contact session on 22 March 2017; those concerns were investigated at the time by a doctor, and were found to be unsubstantiated.  I have also seen the evidence of a medical examination conducted for pre-adoption purposes, which describes B as a healthy normal little girl.</p>

Their continued focus on the injustice (as they perceive it) of the 2014 findings underscores all of what they say, but this of course harps back to a period many years even before B&#8217;s birth.  Their case at this hearing is not materially different from the case presented to HHJ Lynch (see [14] above).  The 2014 findings have never been appealed, and have indeed provided the factual foundation of three final orders under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> and <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref></span> in respect of B&#8217;s siblings; there have been no fewer than three applications for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, all of which have been based on the parents&#8217; dissatisfaction with the 2014 process and outcome, and all of which have been knocked back at that permission stage.</p>

The mother is wrong, in my judgment, to assert that the HHJ Anderson&#8217;s judgment fails to support the finding that she failed to protect S; in that regard (and without rehearsing the full contents here) I have particularly noted paragraphs 69 to 71 of HHJ Anderson&#8217;s judgment.  Moreover, the judge set out at paragraph 21 a list of the witnesses from whom she had heard, and Ms Anning (who was present at that hearing) has not sought to contradict the accuracy of that account. </p>

It is quite apparent that the mother and father were encouraged by the Judge, as well as by professionals, to engage in the process and they did not so engage. The findings were made on the basis of the evidence as it was presented; the judge&#8217;s judgment is careful; it is in my view binding as against the parents until or unless it is set aside;</p>

While the family court judge has found on the balance of probabilities that the father did perpetrate harm, the outcome of the criminal process signifies at least a reasonable doubt about this. These outcomes are not mutually inconsistent; see <span style="font-style:italic">F&#160;v Cumbria County Council and M (fact-finding no 2)&#160;</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/14" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 14 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 14 (Fam)</ref>. Interestingly, the mother told me that she believed that the family court should operate in accordance with the criminal standard of proof, given the gravity of the decisions which it makes.  While this is a respectable opinion, it does not accord with the current law, which I am satisfied HHJ Anderson faithfully applied and so must I.  I associate myself entirely with what Peter Jackson J said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cumbria</span> case at [45]:</p>
