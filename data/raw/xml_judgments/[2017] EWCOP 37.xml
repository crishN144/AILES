Parties should be free to bring personal welfare issues to the Court of Protection without fear of a costs sanction. Local authorities and others who carry out their work professionally have no reason to fear that a costs order will be made. The submission that local authorities will be discouraged from making applications to the Court of Protection if a costs order is made in this case is a thoroughly bad argument. The opposite is, in fact, the truth. It is only local authorities who break the law, or who are guilty of misconduct that falls within the meaning of [Rule 19.5], that have reason to fear a costs order. Local authorities who do their job properly and abide by the law have nothing to fear. In particular, the Court of Protection recognises that professional work in this very difficult field often involves very difficult judgments and decisions. The Court is not going to impose a costs burden on a local authority simply because hindsight demonstrates that it got those judgments wrong.&#8221; </span></p>

The Local Authority failed to meet that requirement, or to provide any reasonable explanation for such failure, notwithstanding that AT&#8217;s family had been raising concerns well before the events which led to 4GS serving notice on him.  (In oral submissions, she pointed to evidence [<span style="font-weight:bold">I130 &#8211; 131</span>] which records that AT&#8217;s family raised concerns about the placement at 4GS at a 3 month review, and again at the 6 and 9 month reviews.) When London Borough of Harrow did make an application in September 2017, that application was not for review and it included no evidence, even though it was acknowledged that by then (actual) living arrangements had become more restrictive.</p>

There would therefore have been no need for the Official Solicitor to act (and incur costs) at all. The involvement of the Official Solicitor was necessary and appropriate primarily because of the conduct of the applicant authority in failing to make timely application for review; or alternatively because, having failed to make a timely application, the placement had broken down and an urgent move was required. </p>

Either way, it is unlikely that in early June 2017 an alternative placement would have been identified and agreed, and so likely that the court would not have considered the matter suitable for determination under the streamlined procedure.
