	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, by way of introduction, it is important at the outset to note that between 10 July to 26 November 2020 the Home Office undertook a survey of local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland and of health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland to provide an estimate of the numbers of looked-after children and care leavers eligible to apply to the EUSS.  The results of that survey indicated that the total number of looked after children and care leavers eligible to apply under the Scheme was 3,300, of which 2,080 were the subject of an interim care order, a care order or a placement order.  As at 26 November 2020 the survey indicated that of those 3,300 eligible children and young people, 1,520 applications had been received.  Of the 2,080 eligible children and young people in respect of whom there was in force an interim care order, a care order or a placement order, 890 had had an application to the Scheme made on their behalf by a local authority.   The court was told that the Home Office is now repeating this survey in order to ascertain what further progress has been made in respect of applications to the EUSS for looked after children and other children with whom local authorities are concerned who are eligible to apply under the scheme. </p>

Rather, the necessary application must be dealt with in a timely manner that ensures the relevant deadline is met and minimises uncertainty for the subject child.  Within this context, the guidance issued to local authorities by the Home Office in April 2020 and entitled <span style="font-style:italic">EU Settlement Scheme: Looked after children and care leaves: local authority and health a social care trust guidance</span> (hereafter &#8220;the local authority guidance&#8221;) highlights the following: </p>

Addressing immigration issues early as part of any assessment and care plan, offering support and if necessary, seeking legal advice about the appropriate action based on the circumstances of the individual looked after child is an important part of these responsibilities.&#8221; </p>

Care proceedings were commenced in early 2018 and the children were made the subject of interim care orders and placed in local authority foster care on 11 May 2018.

That application requires that the children be able to produce a passport or national identity card or, as will become apparent below, some alternative form or evidence of their identity or nationality.  This court understands that there has been ongoing dispute between the parents as to who holds the passports for the children, with each having blamed the other for having lost them.  In any event, it is clear on the evidence before the court that no valid Polish passports or national identity cards for the children have been identified or are available to support an application under the EUSS. </p>

The mother has agreed to do this, although her formal consent (which is required to be witnessed by a Notary Public) has not been received and, as I deal with below, her consent appears now to have become conditional in nature.  The mother had also agreed to an application being made in respect of each of the children for immigration status under the EUSS but, again, her position has now altered somewhat.  The father opposes both the issue by the Polish Embassy of new passports for the children and immigration status for the children under the EUSS.  The father has set out his position, which is plainly bound up with his objection generally to the intervention by Warwickshire in his family, in copious correspondence sent by email to the local authority, which correspondence has been placed before the court.  In addition, and pursuant to a direction made by this court on 24 February 2021 the father sent an email to the court on 12 March 2021 setting out his position, which email states as follows: </p>

When the matter came before Mrs Justice Knowles on 1 February 2021 the court directed Warwickshire to amend its application to include an application for permission to apply for immigration status under the EUSS in respect of both children.  Both applications are supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  At the hearing on 1 February 2021 the court was informed by Ms Agata G&#243;recka of the Care Proceedings Unit at the Polish Embassy in London that the granting to the children of immigration status in the UK under the EUSS will not have any negative impact upon the children&#8217;s Polish citizenship.  Both children would remain Polish citizens and would retain all of their rights in that jurisdiction. </p>

The local authority submits that, in any event, in circumstances where, absent the parents&#8217; consent to passports or national identity cards being issued to the children, the Polish Embassy requires a court order dispensing with that consent, the court is able to and should make such an order under its inherent jurisdiction in this case.  As I have alluded to above, whilst the mother has in the past indicated that she agrees to both applications being made, her position at this hearing was more equivocal, she making her agreement conditional on the children being returned to her care.  The father reiterated his objection to the applications as set out in the correspondence to which I have referred.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian submitted that she did not seek to depart significantly from the submissions advanced on behalf of the local authority. On behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian however, Mr Green pointed to aspects of the Home Office guidance that suggest that where passports or identity cards are not available by reason of parental opposition or unavailability then alternate forms of identification and proof of nationality acceptable to the Home Office can be sought, potentially negating the need for an application to be made to court for an order under the inherent jurisdiction dispensing with parental consent. </p>

Both children were said to be homeless and were being left alone.  In February 2019 the case was closed following the family securing accommodation.  In April 2019 DZ made an allegation of physical abuse by her mother and father and was noted not to have been at school for six months.  In June 2019 the children were made the subject of Child Protection Plans due to neglect.  The case was again closed in January 2020.  In March 2020 Northamptonshire again received a referral in respect of the children following the family becoming homeless again, allegations of drug use by the parents and further allegations by DZ of physical violence by the father.  The children were placed with WH on 15 March 2020 pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and proceedings under Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were issued on 19 August 2020.   </p>

On 27 January 2021, having ascertained from the Polish Embassy the legal requirements for obtaining Polish passports for the children as set out above, Northamptonshire sent a letter to each parent informing them that Northamptonshire intended to make an application to the court for orders enabling passport applications to be made to the Polish Embassy.  A copy of the application and the statement in support was provided to each parent.  On that same date Northamptonshire made an application to the High Court for permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and for an order dispensing with the consent of the parents so Polish passports could be applied for in respect of each child. </p>

There is no application fee where the application concerns a child looked after by a local authority.   The position of the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Education is that parental consent is not required for a valid application by a child under the EUSS, as the rights from which eligible children benefit under the Withdrawal Agreement are not dependent on parental agreement. </p>

This guidance and the Immigration Rules it covers form part of the arrangements for ensuring that we give practical effect to these obligations. Where a child or children in the UK will be affected by the decision, you must have regard to their best interests in making the decision. You must carefully consider all the information and evidence provided concerning the best interests of a child in the UK and the impact the decision may have on the child. Although the duty in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 55</ref> only applies to children in the UK, the statutory guidance &#8211; Every Child Matters &#8211; Change for Children &#8211; provides guidance on the extent to which the spirit of the duty should be applied to children overseas. You must adhere to the spirit of the duty and make enquiries when you have reason to suspect that a child may be in need of protection or safeguarding, or presents welfare needs that require attention. In some instances, international or local agreements are in place that permit or require children to be referred to the authorities of other countries and you are to abide by these and work with local agencies in order to develop arrangements that protect children and reduce the risk of trafficking and exploitation.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Giving the lead judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Y (Children in Care: Change of Nationality)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/> Lord Justice Peter Jackson concluded that, in circumstances where changing a child's citizenship is a momentous step with profound and enduring consequences that requires the most careful consideration, it would not appropriate for the local authority to proceed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in the face of parental opposition and where that course may lead to a loss of their existing citizenship, with an application being required under the inherent jurisdiction if the local authority sought to pursue that course.  However, Peter Jackson LJ considered that in cases where it is possible for a child to have dual citizenship, where &#8220;the child is gaining a benefit and losing nothing&#8221;, the local authority may rely on its general statutory powers within this context. Peter Jackson LJ further drew a distinction between the question of citizenship and steps required to regularise the <span style="font-style:italic">immigration</span> status of the subject children in this jurisdiction short of citizenship.   In this respect, Peter Jackson LJ observed at [20] that (emphasis added): </p>

The judge is not to be criticised for not doing so: she was dealing with more immediate issues in difficult circumstances, but it is clear that this important question did not receive the attention it required. Even so, the court would surely have approved steps being taken to regularise the children's <span style="font-style:italic">immigration position</span>, short of an application for citizenship, and such steps can now be taken by the local authority under its <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33</ref> powers.

As was recognised by the judge at paragraph [17], in the event that a local authority proposes to have a child vaccinated against the wishes of the parents, those parents can make an application to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and may, if necessary, apply for an injunction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> to prevent the child being vaccinated before the matter comes before a court for adjudication.&#8221; </p>

Further, for many parents, and particularly those whose immigration status is insecure, that will not be an effective remedy. They will only have legal representation within care proceedings, and they may have neither the knowledge nor the means to seek an injunction under the Human Rights Act or to bring judicial review proceedings. It is conceded that an application to discharge the care order would be disproportionate. Similarly, the children themselves have a central interest in the matter and in the absence of proceedings they will not have a Children's Guardian and will not be legally represented.&#8221; </p>

Art 18(1)(f) further requires that application forms shall be short, simple, user friendly and adapted to the context of the Withdrawal Agreement. Within this context, Mr Payne submits that an obligation on local authorities to seek an order from the court authorising an application to the EUSS on behalf of each looked after child who is the subject of a care order would, arguably, be inconsistent with the mandatory obligation under Art 18(1)(e) of the Withdrawal Agreement as it would not be consistent with the requirement on the UK to ensure that any administrative procedures for applications are smooth, transparent and simple, and that any unnecessary administrative burdens are avoided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, as highlighted by Mr Setright and Mr Davies during the hearing with respect to case NN20C00122,<span style="font-style:italic"/>not every child who is looked after by the local authority or with whom the local authority is concerned is a child for whom the local authority has parental responsibility by virtue of a care order or a placement order.  For example, children who are looked after by reason of being accommodated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and children who are lost or abandoned and in respect of whom no one holds parental responsibility.  The local authority guidance issued by the Home Office makes clear the obligation on local authorities to work with those who have parental responsibility for the former cohort of children in order to ensure that applications are made for immigration status under the EUSS.  With respect to the latter cohort, children who are lost or abandoned, the guidance enjoins a local authority to look to its duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, what action should a local authority take where, despite advice and support in accordance with the local authority guidance, those with parental responsibility for the child fail, whether by way of malice, neglect or incapacity, to make the necessary application under the EUSS?  Second, what, in fact, are the <span style="font-style:italic">practical</span> steps the local authority should take under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to ensure an application is made on behalf of a lost or abandoned child for whom there is no-one with parental responsibility?   Whilst the Secretaries of State assert that parental consent is not required for an application to be made by or on behalf of the child under the EUSS, the rights thereby conferred being the rights of the child independent of parental consent, it would almost certainly not be appropriate for a local authority to make an application for immigration status on behalf of a child for whom it does<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span> hold parental responsibility.  </p>

Within this context, they go as far to suggest that children in this situation may meet the threshold for proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  It would not be appropriate for this court to speculate in that regard, each case falling to be determined on its own facts as and when they arise. However, the submissions made in this context by Mr Setright and Mr Davies serve once again to highlight the need for local authorities to remain alive, when discharging their obligations to looked after children for whom they do <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>share parental responsibility, care leavers and children in need, to the possibility of cases that may, <span style="font-style:italic">exceptionally</span>, require the intervention of the court.</p>

That question arises in circumstances where, even if the local authority is entitled to make an application for settled status and for the passports required to prove the identity and nationality of the children for the purposes of that application under the power granted to it by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> of the Adoption Act 2002 in the face of parental opposition or absence, the procedural requirements of the State issuing the passports applied for are such that the application for passports requires in this case to be supported by a court order.   In this case, given the position of the parents in the Warwickshire case and the absence of the parents in Northamptonshire case, the order required by the Polish Embassy is an order dispensing with the parents&#8217; consent to the issuing of passports to the children. Whilst, for the reasons I set out below, I am satisfied the court does have jurisdiction make such an order under its inherent jurisdiction in an appropriate case, of which these are two such cases, an application under the inherent jurisdiction should <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> ordinarily be the first port of call in such situations.</p>

Within this context, in cases where the procedural requirements of the State issuing the passports or national identity cards required include the need for a court order dealing with the position of absent or recalcitrant parents, <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> issuing such an application the local authority should first confirm with the Settlement Resolution Centre whether such documents as the child <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> has available are sufficient for the purposes of the EUSS application.

In this matter I have the benefit of a welfare analysis from the Children&#8217;s Guardian setting out an analysis of the potential benefits and detriments to the children of the proposed applications for passports and for settled status under the EUSS.  In her report the Children&#8217;s Guardian makes clear that settled status will permit the children to continue with life as they now know it, to remain in their current foster family, with their peers and at their schools as they wish to do, to remain the subject of care orders and to receive support as looked after children, to live and remain in the United Kingdom and to retain their Polish nationality and to return to Poland in due course should they wish to do so.  Within this context, the balance of convenience comes down firmly against restraining the local authority from the action it intends to take to ensure this outcome. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The analysis in respect of this case is necessarily similar to that in the first matter before the court.  Both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian submit that the power conferred on Northamptonshire by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> constitutes the appropriate basis for Northamptonshire to proceed to apply for immigration status for the children under the EUSS.  Within this context, again, there is in this case no evidence before the court to suggest that the exercise of parental responsibility proposed by the local authority with respect to the EUSS falls within the very small category of cases in which it would be wrong for a local authority to use its power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s33(3)</ref>(b) to override the wishes or views of a parent and that, instead, the matter should come before the court for its consideration and determination. The Polish Embassy has confirmed in this case that the granting to the children of immigration status under the EUSS would have no effect on the children's Polish nationality and rights, in addition to the advantages articulated in the report of the Children&#8217;s Guardian to which I will come to.  The parents do not appear before the court to seek to gainsay any of these assertions.   </p>

Within this context, I am satisfied that the imperatives of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are met, including the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100(4)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and that it is in the children&#8217;s best interests to make the order sought. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the foregoing circumstances, and applying the principles articulated in this judgment to the two cases before the court, in each case I declare that each local authority is entitled to proceed under the power conferred on it by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> as appropriate when applying for immigration status for the children under the EUSS and when applying for passports or national identity cards in support thereof.  Further, in particular circumstances of each case, and for the reasons I have given, I grant permission to each local authority to invoke inherent jurisdiction and make an order dispensing with the consent of parents to issuing of passports by the Polish Embassy in each case. </p>
