	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These care proceedings concern two young children, both girls.  They are K, born in March 2011, who is 3 years old, and S, born in May 2013, who is aged just 1.  Lancashire County Council issued the proceedings in September 2013 following the sudden death of S&#8217;s identical twin sister L on 11 September 2013 at the age of 16 weeks.  Since then, K and S have been in foster care with a very high level of parental contact.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is the second time proceedings have been issued in relation to K.  On 14 November 2011, when she was aged 8 months, her mother took her to hospital with a swollen head; this was investigated and it was found that she had a fractured skull.  Proceedings were taken but in September 2012 they were withdrawn with the court&#8217;s approval and K, who had been in foster care for 10 months, went home.  The present Children&#8217;s Guardian acted for K in those proceedings and the current social work team manager was also involved.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_3">
	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the original proceedings, the mother gave an account of K having fallen down some stairs at home 12 days before she was taken to hospital.  A paediatrician accepted that this might explain the skull fracture and swelling and it was in that context that the proceedings were withdrawn.  In these proceedings, that explanation has been discounted by the medical experts, and no party now suggests that such an incident could realistically have been responsible for K&#8217;s injury.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This hearing has therefore been an investigation into the injury to K and the death of L.  The written evidence is spread across a dozen files and oral evidence was given over the course of eight days.  In addition to conventional written submissions, counsel have created several agreed documents.  These include summaries of the medical evidence, of the sequence of events from the moment the parents sought medical attention for each child, and of the statements made by the parents to others.  These helpful documents were possible because of planned breaks in the evidence when the court could not sit for other reasons.  This has saved court time and clarified the issues.  In this instance, the effect of the medical evidence was agreed before the parents gave their evidence.</p>

	    <num>5.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority's case at the outset of the hearing was that the parents were responsible for ill-treatment of K and L either by way of inflicting injury upon them or from accidents that were concealed or arose from a lack of care.  Having tested the evidence, the local authority no longer pursues allegations of inflicted injury, and in particular any allegation of assault or deliberate suffocation.   However, it alleges that one or both of the parents knows how K&#8217;s head injury occurred, but that they are concealing it.  It further alleges that L probably died as a result of her father lying on her when he was sleeping on the same sofa, or that he recklessly put her to sleep on the sofa in such a way that she rolled and could not breathe.  </p>

In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of her two children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother&#8217;s two other children had experienced apparent life threatening events taking a similar form. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions. There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation. In the course of his judgment, Judge LJ (as he then was) observed: &#8220;What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then, any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in"><span style="font-style:italic">With regard to this latter point, recent case law has emphasised the importance of taking into account, to the extent that it is appropriate in any case, the possibility of the unknown cause.

Such a temptation must be resisted. In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, an unknown cause. As </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cannings</span><span style="font-style:italic"> teaches, even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown.&#8221;</span></p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities.</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of nonaccidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

On 14 November, the mother took her to the GP with a large swelling to the side of her head.   On advice, K was taken to hospital, where tests were carried out and the parents were asked to return the following day for a CT scan.  This was initially said to be normal and K was again sent home.  However, on review of the scan a fracture was detected and K was returned to hospital on 16 November, where she remained until her discharge into foster care a few days later.  A full skeletal survey was normal.  K was noted to be a well-nourished infant who was developmentally advanced, was crawling and could pull herself up.</p>

A new kitchen was being delivered first thing and the normally tidy house was in some disarray.  The father had got up very early to get things ready.  When K woke, he fed her and gave her a shower.  The mother got up, dressed K, and went out to collect some timber, leaving K with the father for a few minutes.  On her return, the delivery men were bringing the kitchen into the house.  When the delivery was complete, a process taking maybe half an hour, she left the father at home and went to open the shop, taking K with her.  She ordered breakfast from a neighbouring cafe and describes noticing the swelling on K's head while Mr C, the cafe owner, who is a friend, was delivering it.  She telephoned the father to ask if he had seen it.  She made an appointment with the GP and from there was sent to the hospital.    </p>

She now believes that Mr C may be right.  I do not regard this as necessarily sinister.

But at the time, Dr Mecrow considered the case to be difficult and gave the opinion on a fine balance that the fracture and swelling were days and even weeks old when K was taken to hospital.  He was influenced by the absence of tenderness when the swelling was touched.  This point of view prevailed at an experts meeting.</p>

On the basis of the medical findings, Professor David does not contend for inflicted injury.  That conclusion has not, in my view, been shifted by the wider evidence.  I therefore find that the injury was likely to be the result of an accident.  The question is whether the local authority has proved that one or both of the parents know(s) how it occurred.</p>

It is a cause that can never be excluded, but there are usually preceding symptoms, none of which were reported for L.  The absence of symptoms and the results of the metabolic analysis of the post mortem tissue led Dr Newbould to conclude that there was no evidence that L had an underlying metabolic disease that might have led to her death.</p>

Overall the assessment of the parents was very positive, though some concern was expressed about the state of the home and about sleeping and feeding practices.  In its submissions, the local authority contends that the parents made poor decisions that amounted to a hazardous situation in the home.  It argues that the untypical state of the home suggests factors at play that combined to compromise the care of children.  The parents' resistance to criticism is noted.</p>

Theoretically she may have died as a result of suffocation, either accidental or deliberate, as typically there are no positive findings.  Dr Cooper agrees with Dr Newbould that the presence of intra-alveolar haemorrhage excludes neither a natural cause of death nor death due to upper airway obstruction.  Dr Newbould opines that the presence of the intra-alveolar haemorrhage in the lung is a common terminal sign.  Dr Cooper describes it as &#8220;the only slightly atypical post mortem finding&#8221;.  They further advise that blood coming from L&#8217;s nose after a lengthy attempted resuscitation does not assist with a cause of death.  If it was blood-stained frothy secretions that had come from L&#8217;s nose, Dr Armour has seen cases of admitted overlaying with this feature.  However, she could not rule out resuscitation attempts being the cause. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Sudden infant death cannot be excluded as the cause of L&#8217;s death.  There is a higher incidence of sudden infant death in babies who were born premature and in babies who are twins.  It is very uncommon for a sudden infant death to occur in the presence of an adult carer.</p>

L having been last seen alive at about 3 am is more consistent with sudden infant death, but being alive at about 6 am and dying shortly thereafter cannot be excluded.  Dr Armour attaches no significance to the paramedics&#8217; varied observations of temperature and stiffness.</p>

However, the descriptions of the time when L was last seen alive differ markedly between the two dates.  On 11 September, as stated above, the account was that L had last been fed at 1 a.m. and was last seen alive at about 6 a.m.  In November, the parents described the father attempting to feed L unsuccessfully at 3 a.m. before putting her into her rocker. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his court statement, the father (who had previously said that the twins fed around 1 a.m.) says that he placed the twins on the sofa sometime after the mother went to bed at between 9.30 p.m. and 11 p.m.  At 3 a.m. L woke up crying.  She did not need a nappy change.  He made a bottle of milk which she refused and so he then added some baby food into the milk, but when he presented the bottle she would not open her mouth.  He placed her in a baby rocker at the other end of the room so that her crying would not disturb S.  He then went to sleep, waking at 6 a.m. to S crying.  He left her crying on the couch and, without checking on L, went upstairs to get the mother to attend to S, asking her to wake him at 7 a.m.  When she woke him, he went downstairs and noticed something wrong with L.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority argues that the parents have changed their account as a result of the concern expressed by Dr Armour about the rapidity of death.  It points out that the earlier account is more consistent with the twins' normal feeding pattern, which involved bottles every four or five hours at most.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother's case is that she was relying on the father for times and that she should not be criticised for information given when she was in deep shock.  She says that it was only when she came to make a statement that she realised how important timings were.  The father's case has varied between saying that he never said that L had been alive at 6 a.m. and saying that he cannot remember saying this.  Both parents deny tailoring their evidence to meet Dr Armour&#8217;s concern.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered the accounts given by the parents in relation to each of the events, making full allowance for the extremely distressing circumstances that existed following L's death.  Having done so, I regrettably do not find them to be witnesses whose accounts can always be accepted without question.  I have already found that the account of the police officers and Nurse C is to be preferred to theirs, and that the parents did say that L had been alive at 6 a.m. or thereabouts.  There is no reason why they should have made a mistake about this.  Even at that time, it would have been obvious that a broadly accurate account was important, there being real worries about the health of L&#8217;s twin, S, and also that of K.  I accordingly reject the parents' account on this aspect and the reason they offer for the different timing in their November statements.    </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having seen them give evidence, I am unable to differentiate between the mother and the father in terms of credibility.  They are a very close couple.  In relation to events on the night that L died, the father is in a better position to know what took place, but the mother was also around in the early morning to know for herself what was going on, and she has also had the opportunity to question the father.  Painful though the subject was, the parents were very active in trying to seek explanations for L&#8217;s death and I do not accept that the mother would have allowed herself to remain under such a potentially important misunderstanding for over two months.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, a feature of potential relevance in this case is that the parents are acutely concerned to present themselves to the outside world as good parents.  It is easy to understand how defenceless a young couple must feel in these circumstances, but these parents are notably reluctant to make concessions.  Most people in their position, struck by such misfortune not once, but twice, would allow others to see their vulnerability.  The mother&#8217;s repeated self-reproach at hospital ("I should have checked on her") may give a truer picture than her evidence in these proceedings, in which she firmly rejected any criticism.  Her description of the sleeping arrangements as "not the greatest idea" was the furthest she was prepared to go.  When one considers the obvious possibility that those sleeping arrangements might be linked in some way to L&#8217;s death, this was a strange and telling choice of words.  The mother&#8217;s request to Ms G on 2 November that the father should not be told about K&#8217;s fall provides another example of this fear of criticism.  As for the father, he did not accept any failures whatever.  My impression is that this is couple who have lost so much that they find it very hard to accept any blemish on the image that they hold of themselves as excellent parents. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As already stated, the evidence establishes that this is likely to have been an accidental injury that occurred on the morning of admission to hospital.  The question is whether the local authority has proved that the parents know how it happened.  With some hesitation, I find that it has not done so and that the parents&#8217; account of events can be accepted.  Balancing the matters contained in paragraphs 33 and 34 above alongside my view of their credibility, I cannot conclude that it this more probable than not that they are concealing a known incident.  The general probabilities of the situation are not underpinned by any specific feature of the evidence that disproves their account.  Furthermore, I think it likely that K was not always as closely supervised as the parents suggest.  The incident on 2 November is a case in point.  A similar, but unwitnessed, fall by K against a hard object (to take an entirely hypothetical possibility, the marble fireplace and surround) on the morning of 14 November could have led to injury that escaped notice during the course of a hectic morning.  This may mean that K, a highly active child, was being inadequately supervised, but that would not in these circumstances cross the threshold for intervention.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Again as stated, it is not suggested that L&#8217;s death was the result of any deliberate act by either parent.  What is now alleged is that she died as a result of inadvertent suffocation arising from unsafe sleeping arrangements, and that the father may have covered this up by placing her in her rocker after death.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Again, taking everything into account, I do not find this more probable than not.  The medical evidence allows for, but does not demand, such a finding.  The indicators for inadvertent suffocation are slight (a moderate degree of intra-alveolar haemorrhage whose significance is disputed between the pathologists) and there are a number of potential indicators that do not exist (facial or conjunctival petechiae, or blanching of the skin).  The location of the hypostasis does not indicate that L was on her side or front after death, as might be the case if she had been lain on by her father or had her face in the sofa or cushions.  The temptation to seek an explanation for L&#8217;s tragic death on the basis of such equivocal evidence must be resisted.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The only other evidence of potential significance relates to the parents' changing accounts.  What inferences are to be drawn from that?  I acknowledge the possibility that they have put their heads together to cover up a case of overlaying, but I have in the end concluded that a more likely reason for the change in their story is to defend themselves against what was at the time an allegation extending to their having deliberately suffocated L.  Accordingly, unsatisfactory though the parents' evidence has been on this issue, I do not find that it adds weight to the medical evidence.   Specifically, I am not satisfied that the parents have changed their accounts in order to cover up what happened to L.  The parents say that they do not know how L died and the local authority has not proved that they do.      </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the end, despite the close attention given to the issue, it is not possible to reliably identify the time of L&#8217;s death or to say which of the parents&#8217; accounts of the last time she was seen alive is more likely to be true.  One might assume that they had moved from an accurate account (6.a.m.) to an inaccurate one (3 a.m.) but it is in my view just as likely that they gave an inaccurate account of her being alive at 6 a.m. in order to shield themselves from any suggestion that they had neglected L, and later reverted to a more accurate account when they saw that the first account was leading them into difficulty.  The irony, as Ms Irving QC puts it, is that the medical analysis is not determined by which account is correct.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My conclusion, echoing Dr Cooper, is that we simply do not know when or why L died.  Nor has it been proved that either of the parents knows.  In such circumstances, a finding against the parents would be based on speculation or suspicion, which would be impermissible and wrong.  The sleeping arrangements that were made for such small babies were obviously unwise, but that does not cross the threshold for intervention.</p>
