	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 October 2006 the Applicant father, R, issued a Form C2 applying for directions in advance of a review hearing listed for 18 January 2007 in respect of 2 children, 5 year old N and 2 year old K.  It was in relation to an order made by me on 7 February 2006.  There was a subsequent hearing before me on 6 December 2006.  It became clear that an important issue of jurisdiction arose which needed to be decided before the review hearing.  Accordingly I heard argument on this issue on 19 December when I reserved judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was concerned at the beginning of the hearing to define the issue I was being asked to determine.  In answer to my questions Mr Nicholls made his position clear.  The father was seeking a residence order not only in respect of N but also K as well.  He sought a direction that Ms Odze be re-appointed as the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  However the father was content to rely entirely upon the recommendations of the Guardian.  He would not seek any order from the court in respect of the 2 boys other than that which the Guardian supported.  Mr Jarman for the mother argued that the court had no jurisdiction to consider any matter other than contact.  If it did have such a jurisdiction, it was not an appropriate case in which to exercise it.</p>

Thus it was that, in the draft order of 6 December, he had framed the question of whether the court had jurisdiction to make orders in matters of parental responsibility over the children.  I took the view that a more specific application was required.  This was not least because an order for or defining the exercise of parental responsibility under s.3 &amp; 4 of the Children Act 1989 was not included as a Part 1 order under the 1986 Act.  It was as a result of my concern that Mr Nicholls agreed that he would issue an application for a residence order in respect of both boys.  The hearing continued on that basis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be wrong to permit the father within a year to re-open that issue within this jurisdiction unless there were compelling grounds to do so.  That safeguard arises because there is always a residual jurisdiction in relation to a child who was resident in England but is in the care of a parent resident abroad with the recent consent of the other parent.  But the circumstances in which that jurisdiction will be exercised are very limited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Assistance on this is to be found by analogy under s.6(5) of the 1986 Act.  The section is concerned with custody order and the jurisdiction of courts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  By s.6(3) a court in England and Wales does not have power to vary a Part I order if matrimonial proceedings are continuing within the other jurisdiction.  An exception is made where the child is present in England and Wales and the immediate exercise of the court&#8217;s powers &#8220;is necessary for his protection&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, though matrimonial proceedings are continuing, the children&#8217;s element of that has been decided.  Where international considerations arise as here, no encouragement should be given to re-opening that issue within a comparatively short time.  As I have said, it does not exclude the court&#8217;s jurisdiction if an urgent and serious issue arises over child protection.  I am not satisfied on the present evidence (even without the mother&#8217;s response) that it does.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That in my judgment is sufficient to resolve the present issue over this court&#8217;s residence jurisdiction.  I accept that the court has of course power to vary its own orders.  It is a power to be used sparingly in an international context where issues have been resolved and implemented and jurisdiction passed to another state.  It should not be used in this instance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The jurisdiction to resolve issues of contact has however been specifically reserved to this court.  It makes sense where the original order was made in a new situation.  The boundaries may well need to be reconsidered in the light of 4 periods of contact which by then will have taken place.  That will happen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I am wrong in finding the recent events and the father&#8217;s statement decisive in relation to the appropriate forum for determining where the issue of residence is to be decided, then I look at all the circumstances.  I bear in mind that the burden is on the mother.  She has to show that Panama is clearly the more convenient forum.  In effect she has to show that it has the real and substantial connection in terms of convenience, expense, and availability of witnesses.  I grant a stay of any residence application here if Panama is clearly more appropriate in the absence of more potent factors pointing to a difficult conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On that basis the matters I would otherwise have found decisive become important considerations to be considered with others including the children&#8217;s welfare.  I consider the hearing now fixed for 1 day on 18 January in terms of the father&#8217;s application for a residence order.  Though there is no detailed response from the mother it is apparent that the father&#8217;s application will be seriously challenged.  The father&#8217;s allegations are that N&#8217;s health has deteriorated, he is performing poorly at school, he is ill-treated by his mother and maternal grandfather, he is no longer confident but nervous, he is isolated and restricted, and it is his wish to return to live with his father in England, as he has told his father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father says through Mr Nicholls that he will be bound by the Guardian&#8217;s decision in relation to N.  Whilst the Guardian can ascertain N&#8217;s wishes and feelings, it is not readily apparent that the other matters can be determined in the absence of some investigation.  There is therefore a real prospect, as Mr Nicholls accepts, that the hearing in January will not be decisive but a opportunity for directions for a future hearing of longer duration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are plain advantages in having that early hearing date in England.  Furthermore each parent has a legal team here well familiar with the background. The Guardian is familiar with N and he will remember her.  The proceedings will be in a language readily understood by everyone in a jurisdiction which has already been involved in a series of interlocutory hearings including the final one in February 2006.  All these factors point to this country being the appropriate forum, though which jurisdiction would reach a final conclusion more quickly is unknown.</p>

His maternal grandfather is also there as will be any other witnesses on these issues.  Translation and interpreters will be needed as it would be for the father in Panama.  Video evidence would be needed at I believe some cost.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also the question of expense.  Whilst each party would have to pay lawyers in Panama, the mother has public funding here.  However she would have to come for a further hearing presumably with N and K.  She sought financial assistance for her visit in January 2007 from the father.  It was not forthcoming.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jarman tells me that this trip will cost the mother half her annual earnings.  Another visit for a contested residence hearing would be a substantial expense which, without help, could prove to be a major problem for her.  This is in contrast to the father.  Mr Jarman tells me that his solicitor calculates that the father&#8217;s legal costs may well approach &#163;100,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If that is only a very rough guide, it does make clear that the impact of the cost of proceedings here will fall far more hardly on the mother than the expense of proceedings in Panama for the father.  The trip and the expense for him are likely to have a far smaller impact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is next the welfare of the children to consider.  Whilst no particular points have been made by counsel save for the position of K, that is by itself a highly significant matter.  The father says in his statement (paragraph 2) that he has been increasingly anxious for the last 9 months about N and K.  But K hardly features in the next 109 paragraphs and nowhere adversely in relation to his welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would be against any attempt to give this court jurisdiction in relation to K&#8217;s residence given his background and the absence of any reasons to support such a change.  That is unless it be that he will suffer as it is said N has done and they should not be separated, though so far this has not been put forward by or on behalf of the father.  If it was part of the father&#8217;s case I am sure I would have heard.  I consider K&#8217;s welfare as a major if not a decisive welfare factor especially when he and N have now been together for 9 months.  There are telling welfare issues making it contrary to K&#8217;s best interests for his residence to be determined here.  Can it be right, if that is so, for N&#8217;s residence alone to be determined by this court?  I consider it is not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing all these factors together, I am satisfied that the mother has shown that England is not the appropriate forum for determining residence issues.  The expense and availability of witnesses favour Panama.  The convenience of England has attractions but there are other potent factors.  Firstly there is the recent history and the crucial order of February 2006.  It excluded this court from further consideration of K&#8217;s residence.  This could be reconsidered if compelling reasons were put forward.  However where there are no reasons at all, I am not prepared to sanction such a reconsideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to N, different considerations arise.  But the absence of any action by the father from August to November does not suggest he views N&#8217;s position as giving rise to any particular urgency.  Furthermore, for the reasons I have given, I should resist any attempt to re-open the agreement of February in the absence of compelling reasons which I do not see.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally the advantages of a determination by this court are outweighed by the factors above and the question of expense and the presence of witnesses, doctors, teachers, and family friends in Panama.  Despite the skilful presentation of Mr Nicholls it is right for both boys that the decision where they live should now be taken in Panama.  I should resist his arguments.  I am grateful to him and Mr Jarman for their help.</p>
