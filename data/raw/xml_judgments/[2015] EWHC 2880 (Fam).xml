The application is opposed by the mother of the boy who wishes to remain in this country with him.  The parties are of dual British and Israeli nationality.  The father is aged 47, the mother is 45.  The parties have known each other for a long time.  They knew each other as teenagers, but resumed the relationship in about 2008.  At that time, the father had been living in Israel since 2004, while the mother was still living in England.  The parties went through a civil marriage in Scotland on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2009, followed by a religious ceremony at a synagogue in London a week later.  </span></p>

The only child, the subject of these proceedings, R, was born in Israel on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2012, very prematurely at 29 weeks gestation.  Thereafter the family lived together on the kibbutz.  In his evidence, the father describes community life on the kibbutz and says that the family was fully integrated into that community.  R suffers from periventricular leukomalacia requiring extensive physiotherapy, which is largely carried out by his mother.  It is accepted, though, that his condition, fortunately, does not stop him leading a very normal active life for a little boy aged three.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">According to the mother, her relationship with the father deteriorated after R was born.  She found the father to be unsupportive and unsympathetic, obsessed with himself and dismissive of her concerns about R's health.  The father does not accept this description of his behaviour.  According to the mother, matters came to a head at Yom Kippur in October 2014 when, according to her, an argument ensued in the course of which the father accused her of disrespecting him and his religion.  The mother says that she told him that she would leave with R, whereupon he ran at her with a fork, held it up to her face and said he would have her killed before she even got to the airport.  The father denies that this incident occurred in the way described by the mother.  The mother said that this was a turning point for her.  On a subsequent occasion she alleges he was aggressive to her again in R's presence.  She gives other examples of what she portrays as selfish and boorish behaviour on the father's part.  </span></p>

She said that it was agreed that she would go to England for as long as she needed to.  It is the father's case that he only agreed to R being brought here for a holiday until 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March, and that this was subsequently extended by consent to the beginning of April.

That process would have taken a further three weeks and, given the fact that the end of the summer term is now upon us, there was no prospect of the case being heard until at least September.  It is well recognised that applications under the Hague Convention must be dealt with speedily.  Having read the mother's position statement and documents, I have formed the view that she will be able to argue her case and, insofar as necessary, cross-examine the father with the assistance of her stepfather, Mr. Dodd, acting as her McKenzie friend.  In the event, the hearing has taken place and has taken longer than it normally would have done had the mother been represented.  I am satisfied, however, that the mother has been able to represent herself effectively and has not been at a disadvantage.  In the circumstances, I did allow oral evidence to be given perhaps rather more extensively than would normally be the case if both parties were represented.  Both parents gave evidence and were cross-examined.  At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr. Gration, on behalf of the father, delivered short oral submissions, supplementing his comprehensive written skeleton argument, and the mother then asked me to adjourn the hearing until the following morning (this morning) before she gave her oral submissions, supplementing her own well-argued and clearly-written position statement.  I agreed and the mother has duly given her oral submissions this morning.  </span></p>

	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The mother opposes the father's application for a summary return of the child to the jurisdiction of Israel.  The mother is the primary carer of the child and has been throughout his life.  The child has special needs insofar as he suffers from periventricular leukomalacia and has done so since his premature birth.  The child is fully dependent on the mother.  The mother left Israel following serious psychological and emotional abuse at the hands of the father, including physical violence to property in her presence and threats of direct physical violence, and psychological and emotional abuse of the child.  The child has witnessed severe psychological abuse of the mother and the frequent and violent rages of the father.  It is not true that the mother came to England for a 'holiday', as stated in support of the father's application.  With the father's consent, she came to England at the time of the crisis in the relationship due to the father's abuse and for respite.  The father was fully aware of this and consented to it.  The mother came to England for an indefinite and indeterminate period.  Accordingly, the child was not wrongfully retained in England.  The child has become habitually resident and is habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  It is the mother's contention that a return of the child to the jurisdiction of Israel will place the child in grave risk of psychological or other harm and place the child in an intolerable situation.  The mother and father live on a kibbutz.  The father remains in the home on the kibbutz, which is the parties' shared property.  It is not possible for the mother to return to that home or to the kibbutz community.  The father further has made it clear on a number of occasions that the mother is 'not wanted' by the kibbutz community nor is she welcome to rejoin the kibbutz.  The mother has sought medical assistance for the severe psychological harm that the applicant has caused her.  The child cannot be returned to Israel and to mother's care; to do so would cause him emotional and psychological harm."  </span></p>

On the first issue, therefore, the father need only establish (1) that R was retained in this country and (2) that he was habitually resident in Israel immediately to that retention.  "Retention" occurs when a child who has previously been for a limited period of time outside the state of its habitual residence is not returned to that state on the expiry of that period, per Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re H (Minors) (Abduction:  Custody Rights)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 AC 476" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 AC 476</ref>.  Thus, a lawful removal can become a wrongful retention if the child removed, for example, for a holiday with permission of the other parent, is then retained at the conclusion of the agreed period.

She rests her case on the risk of psychological harm and emotional harm that will be caused to R if she and he are required to return to Israel where they will be exposed again to the father's behaviour.  The mother characterises the behaviour as emotional abuse.  She has described herself as being an emotional punch bag on whom the father took out all his frustration.  She alleges that he continually undermined her self-esteem.  She relies on the incident in which he became annoyed at her at Yom Kippur last year when, as he accepts, he felt insulted by what he perceived as her lack of respect for his religious beliefs and observances, and how he (on her account, which I accept, having heard the evidence of the parties) waved the fork menacingly in her direction and said she would be killed before she got to the airport if she attempted to leave with R,. she also relies on how subsequently he behaved in an aggressive and domineering way to her, illustrated in particular by a recording of a telephone call made by the father alongside, and in similar vein to, a phone call made by his own father (who had also moved to the kibbutz) in which each of them castigated the mother for removing R to this country, in highly abusive and profane language.  Having heard the tape and read the transcript, I regard the father's behaviour on that occasion as reprehensible, and, in the circumstances, his expression of regret in the witness box was the least that could reasonably be expected.  The father's manner in the witness box was indeed arrogant and egocentric and consistent with the mother's descriptions.  I accept that he has been angry, and the mother's case that he has lost his temper in circumstances which have on occasions been witnessed by R, and caused R distress.  </span></p>

She pointed out that her version of events remained consistent and that it was therefore believed that she was a good mum who just wanted to keep herself and her son safe.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is notable that these undertakings were in similar terms, save for one or two other matters, to those requested by the mother in her statement drafted at a time when she was represented by experienced solicitor and counsel.  In my judgment, these undertakings do amount to protective measures so as to provide strong protection to the mother and R - sufficiently strong, in my view, to preclude a grave risk of R suffering psychological harm or being placed in an intolerable situation.  The mother and R will be returned to the kibbutz, a community, I am told, of 600 to 800 people.  Many on that kibbutz do not speak English, but others do.  In closing submissions the mother went so far as to describe the kibbutz as an open prison, but earlier in evidence and again in submissions she told me that she had a number of close friends with whom she has remained in contact since her arrival in this country.  I do not therefore accept, on the basis of what I have seen, that she would be isolated or ostracised, as she claims, if forced to return to the kibbutz.  In addition, as one would expect, there are support services within the community, including a social worker, with whom, as set out above, the mother was in contact prior to her departure to this country in February.  There is also a social manager responsible for providing further services.  There is therefore, to my mind, evidence of a significant support structure, and I am satisfied that the mother would receive support in the circumstances of her return.  Furthermore, to provide further protection for the mother and R, in my judgment, it is important for copies of this court order, including the father's undertakings and a transcript of this judgment to be delivered to and held by those two individuals on the kibbutz.  </span></p>

If I ordered her and R to return, she said that I&#160;would be returning her to what she had run away from.  I understand her position and have some sympathy for it, but, having said that, Article 13(b) provides a high hurdle.  The court's role, as I have spelt out to her repeatedly in the course of these proceedings, is limited.  Once the undertakings have been proffered &#8211; and I accept those undertakings from the father &#8211; I cannot accept that, by returning R to the jurisdiction of Israel with the benefit of those undertakings, he will be exposed to a grave risk of psychological harm or placed in an intolerable situation.  </span></p>

It is plain to me, although I have no role in determining future decisions about R's welfare, this mother is an excellent and caring mother who has put R as her number one concern, as she has maintained throughout the hearing before me.  The father has recognised that in his oral evidence.  As I have repeatedly said to the mother, the role of this court on an application under the Hague Convention is limited.  It is not my function to make welfare decisions about R's long-term future.  That must either be agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, be the subject of further proceedings in Israel.  This court's role is limited to the application under the Hague Convention.  For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the father's application must succeed and I therefore make the order as indicated.</span></p>
