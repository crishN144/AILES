He accepted, as he had to, that he been guilty of non-disclosure of pre-listing unit sales during the proceedings, for which he gave certain explanations. He was generally clear and composed, only showing a flash of anger when saying, as he sees it, that W&#8217;s conduct has caused him huge financial loss. W was rather less satisfactory. She had a tendency not to answer the question, heading off on tangents, and was clearly irritated by the lines of questioning. Her mistrust of H, who she considers to have betrayed her, was almost palpable. She is charming and articulate, but at times she was a little histrionic. None of this is to say that she was deliberately dishonest. But I felt that she embellished or exaggerated so as to put a more persuasive slant on her case. Where there was a direct conflict of evidence, I preferred H&#8217;s account.</p>

H was introduced to the senior leadership and in due course offered a position there. His role was to build and operate the research and engineering team, operating between the West Coast of America and Europe. He had an alternative offer in the same sector  but elected to join AB Company, opting for the potential upside (but also greater risk) of equity in the new business ahead of the well paid security of the alternative role. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am quite sure that H secured the job because of his long experience, proven track record and knowledge of the tech industry. It seems to me, contrary to W&#8217;s presentation, that her involvement in H&#8217;s decision to join AB Company was minimal; little more than general encouragement during a relationship which was at a relatively early stage and, on any view, had not progressed to cohabitation. By the time H accepted the job in August 2018, they had only met over a handful of days in March 2018, and for a weekend in Switzerland in June 2018. W had minimal knowledge or understanding of the tech world. The contemporaneous messages show W being supportive but not particularly engaged or involved in the process: &#8220;Well I hope you get the job you want,&#8221; and &#8220;Hope it all works out the way you want it to&#8221; are examples. I accept H&#8217;s evidence that they talked about his job options, but not at great length. W sets some store by her role in introducing H to a relative of hers who worked in an unrelated part of the technology sector. He did not seem to me, from what I heard, to have had particularly relevant credentials. Their telephone conversation on 21 July 2018 lasted 10 minutes according to H, or 30 minutes according to what W was told; either way, I accept that it had no bearing on H joining AB Company. W, who did not participate in the call, seemed to me to exaggerate its importance. I find that H&#8217;s decision to start employment at AB Company was his alone, and not a joint one; he did all the research and had all the experience in that field. He weighed up the advantages and disadvantages with little or no reliance upon W&#8217;s views. This was not a joint decision, but a unilateral one.</p>

On 15 August 2018, H signed a contract with AB Company and started working there on 4 September 2018. His base salary was $400,000pa gross. He was awarded the right to acquire 600,000 units in the company, subject to working at AB Company for a period of 1 year, and vesting over 4 years. The units were required to be valued professionally for the purpose of his employment contract; the attributed valued was $0.42 per unit. The nature of the business lent itself to the prospect of very substantial value, if successfully listed, but equally the risk of complete failure. On 15 February 2019, H became entitled to the right to acquire 1.6 million units (subject to the 1 year service period backdated to August 2018, and the 4 year vesting period), including the original 600,000, to reflect the fact that his role was significantly greater than originally envisaged; again, the value was specified in the employment contract. </p>

W moved out of her London flat. On 25 January 2020, they married in London. The marriage became fraught almost immediately, although I am satisfied that it did not finally end until June 2020. Thus, the total period of cohabitation and marriage was no more than about 7 months (December 2019 to June 2020), according to H, or 19 months (November 2018 to June 2020), according to W. The significance of the timespan is that during the period of cohabitation asserted by W, H was working at AB Company and earning the right to acquire units in the company. Thus, she says, some or all of the units became matrimonial in nature. </p>

As he said to me, nine out of ten start-ups in the sector fail. There was no intrinsic value, but a potentially spectacular upside in the event of a successful listing, which of course is why he joined AB Company in the first place. He told me that when he joined, he thought there was a one in ten chance of success, but after he had been at the company for a few months he thought it was more like a one in four to one in six chance. </p>

I accept, however, as H says, that (i) there would have been plenty of undisclosed conditions in the fundraising making it impossible to assess true value, (ii) the fundraising would have been fuelled by a speculative PR drive and (iii) for investors, this was one of many bets that they would have placed on start-up ventures in the hope that a few would convert remote chance of success into spectacular gains; it was not, therefore, a market value in the traditional sense. Further, messages from the AB Company founder to W in November 2020 expressly differentiated between the price stated for investors and the price stated for employees. </p>

They were artificial options markets created by the exchanges under which (a) the exchange created and offered the option to buy a unit, (b) a purchaser would buy the option at a particular price and (c) the option could be sold. These markets operated bubbles, with limited liquidity and plenty of hype. They were open to anybody. The prices exchanged were not indicative of the value of the company; they were bets or trading games. All of this was very different from a market for the sale of employees&#8217; or investors&#8217; contractual entitlements. H was aware of these markets, but they did not enable him to deal with his contractual entitlement to acquire units. </p>

He described this as a revelation, and I am confident that he was truthful. Pre-sales is not strictly the right description as H had nothing he could sell unless and until he received units upon listing of AB Company. The structure was for monies to be paid to the prospective owner of the units (H) who would generate an IOU in favour of the payer to transfer units upon listing. The transaction would be conducted through an independent broker. In practice, only a handful of trades could be done in this way because they represented a liability until listing. Trading volumes were small, not indicative of a market value but generated by a fear of missing out. </p>

This seems to me to have reflected a prudent approach by H who, with his knowledge of the sector, feared that the units might in fact be worthless.

Messages confirm that the founder wanted to control the release of units, and limit supply, so as to keep the price high. The founder saw an opportunity to drag things out rather than release units to H. W says in her written evidence that &#8220;I suspect [he] was looking for any reason not to release units to [H]&#8221;, &#8220;I believe [he] had his own motives for not releasing [H&#8217;s] units&#8221; and it was not in the founder&#8217;s interests &#8220;to release them all in one go and I was used in order to further this wider agenda&#8221;.  Orally, she told me that she was used by him. The founder, a man of unpredictable nature, saw all of this this as an opportunity to disadvantage H, and gain advantage for himself.  The simple reality, as I see it, is that W&#8217;s actions gave the founder just the excuse he was looking for. </p>

There were 22 transactions in total for which H received $11,531,991 gross. The prices ranged from $10.5 to $85 per unit. These were significant sums and indicative of H attempting to lock in substantial value. I do not regard H&#8217;s actions as irrational, and there is nothing before me to suggest he was endeavouring to defeat W&#8217;s claims by deliberately selling at an undervalue so as to defeat W&#8217;s claims. Anything of the sort would have been completely illogical as it would have caused him loss as well.

During this period, his solicitors wrote that &#8220;There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that our client&#8230;.is disposing of the units in a clandestine manner&#8221;; in fact, he had been doing just that. H&#8217;s solicitors assured W&#8217;s solicitors of full disclosure. It was not until the day before a hearing before me on 28 July 2021 that he disclosed having made pre-sales, albeit comprehensive detail was lacking. What he had previously instructed his solicitors to write was false. Even after 28 July 2021, it took time to extract from H the precise sequence of events in respect of the pre-sales. He appears to have considered (albeit not ultimately carried through) faking documents to conceal or distort the fact of pre-sales having taken place. </p>

However, the duty of disclosure is absolute and fundamental. If he had concerns, he should have restored the matter to court. He should not have disregarded basic principles and I am quite sure that he knew that what he was doing was wrong. His failure to tell W, and the court, the whole truth, was deplorable.</p>

This critical letter was inexplicably not copied to H&#8217;s solicitors. Neither they, nor H, knew anything of this approach, a matter for which W apologised in her written evidence, although in her oral evidence she told me she thought she did nothing wrong. It was not in fact seen by H until July 2021. This letter strikes me as a very surprising one to have sent at all, let alone on a unilateral basis. It brought into their private divorce dispute a company in an overseas jurisdiction, beyond the territorial reach of this court, where H was no longer employed, in circumstances where very significant sums of money were at stake, at a particularly delicate stage, and only a matter of weeks before the intended listing.    </p>

In the same paragraph he said: &#8220;The mere fact that parties begin to spend time in each other&#8217;s homes does not of itself, it sems to me, equate to marriage.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Baroness Hale was not laying down an immutable law, as W&#8217;s counsel accepted. It must surely depend on the circumstances. It is unlikely, for example, that a lengthy period of engagement, with few or no indicators of cohabitation, would justify an entitlement to assets accrued pre-marriage. It is hard to see how engagement without mutual commitment and shared lives akin to a marital relationship would come close to justifying an equal share (or any share) of assets built up between the date of engagement and the date of marriage. In my view, engagement may be an indicator of the strength of the commitment and shared life, and may be an evidential factor pointing towards a period of cohabitation, but it should not ordinarily be seen as a separate event which by itself gives rise to a sharing entitlement. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The picture became clear during oral evidence. H and W fell in love. H in particular, in my view, was swept off his feet by W&#8217;s creativity, free spirit, glamour and connections and wanted to make a life with her; he was introduced to a world which he had never experienced before, where W had a number of well known, rich and international friends. They dreamt of a future together. They discussed where they would live. They talked of buying properties in the USA or London or Northern Europe, although they never did so. They were a couple, going out together, holidaying and travelling together. But there were formidable logistical obstacles to their hopes and aspirations. H was living and working in the West Coast of America. His family and friends were there. W was living and working in London. W did not like the city where H lived in the USA, and H could not work in London. Throughout their relationship, they struggled to find a permanent, solid modus operandi for their relationship. H would spend time with W at her London flat when transiting to AB Company&#8217;s European offices. W would travel on occasions to the USA and spend time in H&#8217;s rented house. They tried to make things work. Various options were considered; for example, H said in a message on 27 May 2019: &#8220;I want to be with you. If you can&#8217;t make your career work coming here each month, I will start looking for a job in London&#8221;. H wanted W to feel involved in finding a suitable property in the USA which she would want to come and visit, and making H&#8217;s rental property more homely; in that way, he hoped they would spend more time together. It was only towards the end of 2019, when H&#8217;s employment with AB Company came to an end, that a way forward opened up, enabling him to leave the USA. H gave up his rental and moved to London. W left her own flat.  In December 2019 they moved together into a rented flat in Kensington, London, before marrying in January 2020. This was more than a casual boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, but I am satisfied that the enduring solidity of cohabitation did not truly take place until December 2019. I need, however, to consider this overarching finding in a little more detail given its centrality to the case presented to me. </p>

She told me that she put her career on the back burner, devoting herself to H, reducing her work activities by about 90%. I thought that was an exaggerated presentation. The various messages show that she was still creating, developing ideas, travelling, writing scripts, attending events and networking. She and H had separate lives with separate interests and commitments.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is of some relevance, in my judgment, that W spent little time in the USA while H lived at Flat H. She says that she found it too small and too dark. H, eager to find an arrangement which worked for W, was willing to look for an alternative property with which she would be satisfied, although he himself was content with Flat H. Even after H signed up to a new property at Flat F in June 2019, W only went 3 times (the same number of visits as to Flat H). In other words, she <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">chose</span> not to spend time with H in the USA for much of the relevant period. As she said in a message to H on 25 April 2019 &#8220;I&#8217;m just not moving to [the USA]&#8221;. True, she helped furnish Flat H and Flat F with decorative items such as lamps, side tables, bedding, and a sofa, but I do not view that as part of a settled state of cohabitation. The suggestion that she made all the choices, and took all the decisions, was not made out on the evidence. H was paying, and W consulted with H on almost all purchases. Similarly, she helped H look for a different property to rent, and assisted H in moving in his things (but was not exclusively responsible, as she suggested), but that is just as consistent with a relationship of boyfriend/girlfriend, or even friends, as it is cohabitation. Overall, I felt that W exaggerated her involvement in these matters. The fact is, W did not really want to live in the USA; I thought her oral evidence to me to the contrary was unconvincing. She also made it clear to H that she would not live in Europe. I formed the impression that long term W would only have accepted living permanently together in London.  </p>

H was cross examined at length about looking at properties or property particulars. They talked about where they might live together; they daydreamed. At one point, H put down a deposit on a London property, which fell through in March 2019. At times, the ideas were untenable; H was not particularly wealthy and could not afford some of the property particulars. In the event, however, they did not buy a property, nor move into one together. </p>

From October 2018 onwards, H gave W $4,000-$5,600pm (and on one occasion $8,000), and paid for some additional items such as &#163;7,000 to repair W&#8217;s car, &#163;4,700 on the management fees on W&#8217;s property and $10,000 towards a music studio upgrade. These were because W repeatedly told H (quite truthfully) that she needed money, could not support herself, was &#8220;broke&#8221; and &#8220;stuck financially.&#8221; She told me in evidence that she was very stressed financially; she had only &#163;100 in her bank account at the start of the relationship. H gave her money because she requested it. The total financial support before the parties&#8217; marriage, according to W, came to about &#163;118,000<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> W also had use of H&#8217;s credit cards, although, on the evidence, they were used only minimally for her personal expenses. But they did not have joint accounts, or acquire joint assets. I accept that W had had similar financial arrangements with previous partners which partly informed why H made financial subventions; he was replacing the monies received by W in a previous relationship. That is not to criticise either of them, it is simply how it was. </p>

She learned that he had been married twice, not once as she had understood. She discovered that he had concealed details of a criminal conviction and alcohol rehabilitation. It seems to me that the marriage went downhill rapidly, such that H moved out for a period of time in March/April 2020. In my judgment, this begs the question of why this had not been apparent to W before, to which the probable answer is that they had not lived together until late 2019. It was only when they truly cohabited, and shared their lives, that their incompatibility became all too obvious. </p>

First, there is gross and obvious personal misconduct meted out by one party against the other, normally, but not necessarily, during the marriage.

The authorities clearly indicate that such conduct would only be reflected where there is a financial consequence to its impact. In one case the husband had stabbed the wife and the wound had impaired her earning capacity. The impact of such conduct was properly reflected in the discretionary disposition made in the wife&#8217;s favour. Mrs Miller alleged that Mr Miller had unjustifiably ended the marriage discarding her in favour of another woman. Therefore, she argued that Mr Miller should not be permitted to argue that their marriage was short. This argument was rejected by the House of Lords which held that the conduct in question, although greatly distressing to Mrs Miller, should not find independent reflection in the court&#8217;s decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H sold part of his entitlement to units prior to release day. H failed to disclose this to W or the court. I accept that his reason was because of concerns that W would speak to the founder, who might seek to interfere with a smooth realisation of value. As it transpired, his concerns were well founded but, whatever the reason, he should have informed W and the court. I regard his failure to disclose these matters to W or the court as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">litigation </span>misconduct, which would ordinarily sound in costs. However, I am satisfied that H, in pre-selling units, was acting, as he saw it, prudently. He was not a man of vast wealth, and it was logical to attempt to hedge the outcome of the listing. To secure $11m in advance of the listing was not such gross and obvious misconduct as to enter into the reckoning. There is nothing to suggest he pre-sold at an undervalue. The prices quoted online (which in theory suggest he sold at between 71% and 88% lower than the marked price) were not realistic market figures, and in any event, it is not clear whether the prices quoted were for the type of markets in which H undertook the pre-sales. H could only sell at prices which purchasers would pay. Although he concealed the fact of pre-sales, I do not think that they were carried out to defeat W&#8217;s clams. Apart from anything else, it was not in his own interests to sell at a below achievable price. All the monies went into an account which has been disclosed, and upon which he has not drawn save to meet his, and W&#8217;s, legal fees; there is no suggestion that H has concealed monies. Insofar as W says that had he not pre-sold, H would have been able to sell the units at higher prices upon implementation of the staggered compromise agreement, (i) that argument melts away because of W&#8217;s own conduct in preventing sale at listing and (ii) had it not been for the need to refund purchasers, the prices would have been broadly similar.</p>

So, goes the argument, even without W&#8217;s involvement the release of H&#8217;s units would have been delayed i.e there is no causation referable to W. But there is not a scintilla of evidence that, until W&#8217;s communications with the founder started, he intended to take such steps in respect of H who had been such a prominent part of the team. On the contrary, there are numerous messages between W and the founder in which the founder told W that H would receive his units on listing day absent her taking action. The only issue H faced (other than W&#8217;s interference) was KYC confirmation which was resolved before listing. H&#8217;s contract was solid. In any event, it is known that at least some employees did receive their units immediately so that the picture is far from as clear-cut as W would have it. </p>

The units would, on the balance of evidence, have been released to H until W instructed her lawyers to write to AB Company, demanding non-release and threatening a damages claim if they were released. Such letters gave the founder exactly what he wanted, the opportunity to slow down release for his own purposes, precisely as he had indicated in the message in which he suggested that a solicitor&#8217;s letter would &#8220;slow things down&#8221;.

H was willing and able to spoil W. It is of some relevance in assessing needs that W was largely dependent upon H from October 2018 onwards, receiving &#163;117,000 in one year, in addition to H funding the lifestyle described above. I also take the view that although H has provided W with &#163;4,000 per month during the course of these proceedings, that was arguably a low figure in the context of the case. True, the marriage was short, but H is wealthy and has a high income whereas W, by contrast, has modest resources and a limited earning capacity. W&#8217;s conduct is also a factor. It seems to me that had H&#8217;s wealth been much greater, as it would have been absent her behaviour, then her needs based award would likely have been higher than that which I propose to make.

As a comparison, H&#8217;s budget (excluding mortgage) is $321,960 which is about &#163;243,000pa. I accept that her earning capacity is relatively modest, and she seems never to have earned great sums. Her career focus lessened somewhat during the relationship, but not as much as she said. She can, I am sure, with her charisma, and skill, deploy her talents to generate some income which I put at about &#163;15,000pa net. I accept that her age counts against her, and it will take her a while to rebuild her earning capacity, but she retains the ability to take positive steps to revitalise her earnings.</p>

Although I do not regard a Duxbury award as appropriate given the brevity of the marriage, such a sum produces about &#163;30,000pa on a Duxbury basis.</p>

Stepping back, and looking at all the s25 criteria in the round, I am satisfied that this is a fair outcome. W will exit this short childless marriage debt free and with total assets of about &#163;1.2m (her pre-owned, non-marital property at &#163;750,000 and &#163;450,000 capitalised maintenance) out of about &#163;11.8m (plus unvested shares notionally worth over &#163;6m gross), of which H&#8217;s assets are, on my findings, entirely non-marital.</p>

An issue arose towards the end of the hearing about items of W&#8217;s jewellery which may have gone missing, and I invite counsel to agree a way forward.</p>
