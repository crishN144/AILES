He said that there was an occasion some years ago when the mother had kicked him twice on the shin and another when she hit him in the face causing his nose to bleed. </span></p>

He has produced some messages during that period in which she says that she was finding it a struggle to manage and had slapped him.

He had stopped defending himself when his younger cousin was rough with him. He said the child displayed no affection to his mother and there was &#8216;no expression or emotion whenever she entered the room&#8217;.  He said &#8216;I felt as though he had almost developed a self-defence mechanism to minimise the abuse coming from his mother&#8217;.

She says that he has fabricated allegations in order to get accommodation in this country and public funding.  She says she would be willing to pay for the children&#8217;s flights back but not to provide separate accommodation for them and the father together. During the hearing she modified her stance so as to offer to provide funding for accommodation for him alone. The children, she says, can live with her, and the father could spend time with them during the day.</span></p>

At best, he states that they relate to the quality of care that each of them can give X that should properly be a matter for a welfare determination. So far as Y is concerned, Mr. Fletcher submits that there is virtually no criticism of the mother&#8217;s care of her at all. </span></p>

Within the context of this tension between the need to evaluate the evidence against the civil standard of proof and the summary nature of the proceedings, the Supreme Court further made clear that the approach to be adopted in respect of the harm defence is not one that demands the court engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the matters alleged as grounding the defence under Art 13b. Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13b, go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified&#8221;. </span></p>

The risk is that she will become impatient and aggressive, particularly with respect to X. She may slap him in anger (she did this once between September 2021 and April 2022 but may have done this more often when the father was still in England). She may become frustrated with him and shout when he needs patience and understanding. She could yank or drag him if he does not do as she tells him.  This may affect him particularly as he is a child with special needs. In his statement the father has described X&#8217;s behaviour when he came back to Poland both on visits and then finally in September 2021. He was, the father said, saying less, not making eye contact, and had stopped defending himself when other children were rough or took things away from him.  He would hang his head low and behave in a timid fashion.</span></p>

The mother is now working full time and her own mother will be assisting with the childcare.  It is true that frustration can arise in the middle of the night, but apart from a complaint in the mother&#8217;s messages that X had kept her and Y awake one night there is no evidence that this has been a particular problem.</span></p>

Whilst I do not wish to minimise the effect on X in particular of being subjected to impatience, anger and physical chastisement from the mother, I do not find that there is a grave risk that the return of the children would expose either of them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation.  In my judgment the situation that X and Y would be in if I ordered a return does not reach that level for either child. Assuming the risk at the highest, the level is that of discomfort and distress, not intolerability.  The children have spent much of their lives being cared for by the mother. They will be returning to a home which is familiar to them, and where the maternal grandparents also live.  X will return to his therapeutic nursery where he was doing well. </span></p>

In his statement the father said he had received threats from the mother&#8217;s family but they were not particularised at all. In oral submissions Ms Amiraftabi said that the threats were from the mother&#8217;s brothers, but such details as she gave did not suggest anything explicit.

I also note that she remains willing to provide the father with accommodation for himself for a period if he was to return to Poland, and that he will not forfeit his right to benefits here whilst he remains temporarily in Poland.
