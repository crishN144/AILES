	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 November 2015 I handed down judgement in relation to an application made pursuant to section 15 of the mental capacity act 2005 for a declaration determining whether it was in the best interests of a Mrs N to receive life-sustaining treatment by means of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration.  At that stage treatment was provided through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.  In the course of that judgement I considered the medical evidence, the carefully considered views of the family and the framework of the law.  I came to the clear conclusion that respect for Mrs N&#8217;s dignity and human freedom overwhelmed further prolongation of life and I granted the declaration in the terms annexed to the judgement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of the judgment I had particular cause to commend the family for what I have described as the complete candour of their respective accounts.  I observed that none of them made even the slightest attempt to shape the evidence to their preferred outcome.  In specific terms I stated &#8220;where evidence was ambivalent, in the sense that it carried a potential interpretation which pointed away from the course that they considered to be in Mrs N&#8217;s best interests, they offered it to me without embellishment or distortion&#8221;.  I went on to observe how each of them had a very different relationship with Mrs N and how in their different ways each loved her but was unprepared to overlook her manifest faults and foibles.  I concluded that Mrs N emerged as a woman who could be &#8220;capricious selfish and seemingly at times quite shallow&#8221; in her interests.  That said, I made it perfectly clear that her prevailing characteristics were that she was immensely proud of her family, jealous of her privacy, extraordinary feisty and profoundly loyal to her children.  The family&#8217;s emphasis on Mrs N&#8217;s basic and unvarnished humanity enabled her own voice to come through to the court room and I was left in no doubt as to what she would have wished for in the parlous situation that she found herself.</p>

On 2 November 2015 I made a reporting restriction order, prohibiting the identification of the first respondent and Mrs N in any press reporting &#8220;during her lifetime&#8221; I also decided that, for a period of seven days after her death, the injunction should continue.</p>

In that case, to which I will refer below, Charles J was considering the scope and ambit of such Reporting Restriction Orders following the death of P.  On 13 January 2016 I varied the order in the terms applied for, no party sought to contest it. On 16 December 2015 Mrs N died.</p>

Reliance was placed upon Charles J&#8217;s judgment in V in support of the application, which was made on notice to the parties and to the press.  On 5 May 2016 I refused the application which it had been anticipated might proceed on paper and instead listed a hearing today, 22 June 2016. This hearing is on notice to the press and I have received detailed written submissions from the Press Association opposing the application.</p>

Such declarations had previously been confined to those in a vegetative state (VS).

The essence of the exercise is one of a parallel analysis in which neither the Article 8 ECHR rights, that broadly protect individual privacy, nor Article 10 rights, which safeguard freedom of expression, have precedence.  To adopt Charles J&#8217;s analogy in Re V, it is a clash of titanic proportions in which the public interest in the effective administration of justice plays a significant role.  It follows that whilst the framework of the law to be applied is now easy to state its application, in this highly fact sensitive arena maybe anything but.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;The principle of open justice is one of the most precious in our law. It is there to reassure the public and the parties that our courts are indeed doing justice according to law. In fact, there are two aspects to this principle. The first is that justice should be done in open court, so that the people interested in the case, the wider public and the media can know what is going on. The court should not hear and take into account evidence and arguments that they have not heard or seen. The second is that the names of the people whose cases are being decided, and others involved in the hearing, should be public knowledge. The rationale for the second rule is not quite the same as the rationale for the first, as we shall see. This case is about the second rule. There is a long-standing practice that certain classes of people, principally children and mental patients, should not be named in proceedings about their care, treatment and property. The first issue before us is whether there should be a presumption of anonymity in civil proceedings, or certain kinds of civil proceedings, in the High Court relating to a patient detained in a psychiatric hospital, or otherwise subject to compulsory powers, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>&#8221;). The second issue is whether there should be an anonymity order on the facts of this particular case.</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">The question in all these cases is that set out in CPR 39.2(4): is anonymity necessary in the interests of the patient? It would be wrong to have a presumption that an order should be made in every case. There is a balance to be struck. The public has a right to know, not only what is going on in our courts, but also who the principal actors are. This is particularly so where notorious criminals are involved. They need to be reassured that sensible decisions are being made about them. On the other hand, the purpose of detention in hospital for treatment is to make the patient better, so that he is no longer a risk either to himself or to others. That whole therapeutic enterprise may be put in jeopardy if confidential information is disclosed in a way which enables the public to identify the patient. It may also be put in jeopardy unless patients have a reasonable expectation in advance that their identities will not be disclosed without their consent. In some cases, that disclosure may put the patient himself, and perhaps also the hospital, those treating him and the other patients there, at risk. The public&#8217;s right to know has to be balanced against the potential harm, not only to this patient, but to </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">all</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt"> the others whose treatment could be affected by the risk of exposure.&#8221;</span></p>

This involved her discussing in court the most personal aspects of her private life.  All this was in the 1960&#8217;s where public attitudes were still far less liberal and people perhaps quicker to condemn the private lives of others than they are today. I note that these proceedings took place in a courtroom to which the press would have had full access.  As I re-read those paragraphs of my earlier judgment they strike me has having some resonance in this application.  For this reason I set them out again:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">At 18 years old Mrs. N found herself in a very difficult situation. Following what was a superficial relationship with a man 10 years her senior she became pregnant. In 1960s Britain that situation still carried a social stigma, particularly in the close knit Jewish community where she grew up. Mrs. N's parents were a tower of strength to her. They gave her unfaltering support and offered Z, their grandson, the same unconditional love that they had always shown their daughter. With the benefit of this emotionally secure foundation for herself and her baby, Mrs. N took a course which, particularly by the standards of the day, required enormous courage and resolve. Z's father refused to acknowledge his paternity and so Mrs. N pursued the paternity claim through the courts. This action, which I have been told was resisted at every stage, was regarded by Mrs. N as nothing less than Z's own basic right to have his paternity known and recognised. She was entirely unprepared to compromise on anything less than what she perceived to be Z's full legal recognition and entitlement to proper financial provision. &#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.28in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">It is important to remember that this claim was pursued at a time when DNA testing was not available. The court, in those days, required evidence which was intimate, often rather graphic and inevitably embarrassing for a young woman from a protected background. Mrs. N succeeded in her claim. Paternity was established, maintenance ordered but Z and his father have never met. What is striking is how each of the family members I heard from wanted to tell me about this aspect of their history. They plainly respect Mrs. N for her courage and determination and each recognises the personal cost and effort involved. They all knew her as a woman for whom outward or public appearance was enormously important. I think each of them struggled to imagine how she had managed to force herself through litigation of that kind. They recognised in it an indomitable spirit which they saw flashes of in different contexts over the years.&#8221;</span></p>

It was however, as I recorded, striking how each family member independently emphasised what had obviously become a significant part of their history and which they saw as defining Mrs N&#8217;s indomitable spirit.  Whilst Mrs N would not have expressed it in the terms I do, I have no doubt that she would have been alert to the three significant rights in focus in her own application: her son&#8217;s right to know the identity of his father; her own right to privacy; the right to freedom of expression given effect to by access of the press to that process.  I note, to take up the point addressed above (at para 18) that following that Court&#8217;s declaration, paternity would have become a matter of public record.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When M first brought this application I do not believe that it was generally regarded as having great prospect of success.  In the end, three of the country&#8217;s most distinguished experts were broadly in agreement and the Official Solicitor, after much careful reflection, changed his mind and supported M&#8217;s application.  As the judgment records, so significant did I regard this issue to be, in the evolution of the case law that notwithstanding the broad professional consensus, I required Mr Lock QC, acting on behalf of the Official Solicitor, to test the evidence objectively in an investigative non partisan manner.  This he did with characteristic professional discipline.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise these matters because the decision I was being asked to take is one of the most difficult required of any Judge in any Court.  It requires there to be a process which is not only rigorous but transparently so.  As medicine itself progresses what constitutes life or consciousness becomes increasingly challenging to define.  In a society where more of us grow old and potentially vulnerable it is self evident that the public is entitled to be fully informed on these issues.  Cases of this kind in the Court of Protection add to that sum of knowledge.  The integrity of the investigation requires to be beyond doubt.   There is a risk, as explained in the case law above, that both the integrity of the process and the proper dissemination of the information maybe compromised by cloaking the parties with anonymity.  This will of course be necessary in some cases but those cases will, as has been submitted, require cogent and compelling evidence to justify the making of a RRO.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The experience of grief is one unique to the individual, it takes on many forms.  I am sure that this family began to grieve for Mrs N some considerable time ago.  I am equally confident that their present grief is none the weaker for being in some way already familiar.  I have no doubt that having brought this application M, in particular, requires both peace and privacy.  I feel bound to say that she falls securely within those individuals contemplated within the Editor&#8217;s Code of Practice (see para 19 above).  Though there is of course no guarantee against press intrusion, there is no evidence at all of any having occurred in the last few months, as there might have been, notwithstanding the existence of the interim order.  Nor does a dispassionate analysis of the facts point to any significant intrusion in the future.</p>

I have no doubt that those closest to M and her family, those who matter to the family the most, will have identified Mrs N from the facts of the case.  For those beyond that circle, the name of the individual serves only to make her story more real and the issues it raises more acute.  Therein lies the public interest.  By contrast the introduction of both Mrs N&#8217;s and M&#8217;s name into the public domain has relatively limited impact on M&#8217;s privacy or Article 8 rights more generally.  Certainly there is no real evidence to that effect.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">What's in a name? "A lot", the press would answer. This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European Court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed: <span style="font-style:italic">News Verlags GmbH &amp; Co KG v Austria </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2000) 31 EHRR 246" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">(2000) 31 EHRR 246</ref>, 256, para 39, quoted at para 35 above. More succinctly, Lord Hoffmann observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Campbell v MGN Ltd </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/22.html" style="font-style:italic"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 AC 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 AC 457</ref></a>, 474, para 59, "judges are not newspaper editors." See also Lord Hope of Craighead in <span style="font-style:italic">In re British Broadcasting Corpn </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/34.html" style="font-style:italic"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 3 WLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 3 WLR 142</ref></a>, 152, para 25. This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive. </p>

It may well be that Charles J contemplated a situation not dissimilar to that which has arisen here in V when he said (at para 150):</p>

And it may be that this will lead to a number of injunctions in such cases being limited to P's lifetime. But, in my view, this should not be a presumption or default position.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, as has now been analysed in a number of cases in the Court of Protection, evaluating P&#8217;s best interests will invariably involve the Judge considering the wider canvas of P&#8217;s life, often via the conduit of evidence from family members.  Inevitably, that involves an inquiry into the private sphere which will usually engage facets of the rights protected by Article 8.  It is unlikely, in my view, that many cases will be confined solely to assessing the advantages or disadvantages of a particular course of treatment without considering some of the circumstances of the individual patient.  In this case whilst I have undoubtedly considered features of Mrs N&#8217;s life, character and personality, the issue of withdrawal of hydration and nutrition from a patient in MCS is plainly the predominant one.  Indeed, I think it can properly be characterised as one of the major issues in contemporary life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The challenge, in the parallel analysis of the competing rights and interests in play, is that the rights in contemplation are of wholly different complexion.  The exercise involves the juxtaposition of the intensely personal (grief, loss, privacy) alongside the conceptual (the public interest, the freedom of the press, the effective dissemination of information, the administration of justice).  In a jurisdiction where there is a human, and inevitable pull to the protection of the vulnerable, (this is after all the Court of Protection), it is easy to overlook how some of the wider, abstract concepts also protect society more generally and in doing so embrace the vulnerable.</p>

The case, brought by Ms Miranda Rosenbaum, has also added significantly to the public knowledge and understanding of issues that any one of us might have to confront.  As I have already commented, there are echoes of her mother&#8217;s own courage and determination, from that legal action 40 years ago, reverberating through this application.  Ms Miranda Rosenbaum has shown enormous strength in bringing this application.   I hope that this family will be allowed peace and privacy to heal from their long ordeal.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Press Association did not raise the question of jurisdiction in this application.  Charles J identified the issue as to whether the COP has powers to grant a new injunction because it relates to proceedings that were before it, although by reason of its decision and / or the death of P it no longer has any jurisdiction to make the welfare order sought.  Section 47 of the <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref></span> provides that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the Court has in connection with its jurisdiction, the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court&#8217;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Charles J considered the answer to be that the Court is exercising a power &#8216;in connection with its jurisdiction&#8217;, concluding that the nature and extent of the relevant Article 8 rights relied on, derived from the very existence of the earlier proceedings.  To construe section 47 in such a way as to limit it to a period circumscribed by the lifetime of the subject of the proceedings would be to take an unnecessarily restrictive construction of the language of section 47.   Furthermore, it would ignore the important interpretive principle that legislation should be construed, so far as possible, in a way which is compatible with convention rights.  I respectfully agree but, like Charles J, to avoid uncertainty, I would wish to make clear that in considering this application, I do so as a Judge of the High Court as well as a Judge of the Court of Protection.  </p>
