	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This judgment brings to a conclusion proceedings launched earlier this year by Redcar &amp; Cleveland Borough Council (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;), under the inherent jurisdiction, in relation to a capacitous but apparently vulnerable adult.  The judgment further examines the circumstances in which interim orders under the inherent jurisdiction were made, and whether injunctive-type orders could and/or should have been made against the adult for whom protection was sought.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In this case, the subject of the proceedings is PR; she is 32 years old.  She is the First Respondent.  She is an intelligent woman who is studying in higher education for a PhD.  She is unmarried and without a partner; she has been living with her parents and a sibling.  In January 2019 she suffered a significant deterioration of her mental health, and was admitted as a voluntary patient to hospital.  While on the acute admissions ward, she made a number of allegations about her personal and home life. In significant respects, these allegations related to SR.  It is unnecessary, and not overall helpful to PR, for me to rehearse the allegations here in this judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As PR&#8217;s mental health improved to a point where she was well enough for discharge from hospital, the Local Authority&#8217;s Adult Mental Health team became concerned that she was planning, and indeed expecting, to return home to live with her parents.  The Local Authority has various duties towards PR including those under <span style="font-style:italic">section 42</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/23" uk:canonical="2014 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Act 2014</ref></span> to protect her from abuse or neglect; in the exercise of those duties, the Local Authority felt compelled to issue an application under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court on 25 March 2019, with a view to obtaining orders to protect her.  PR had no knowledge that the application was being made; the Local Authority was of the view that she would be &#8220;increasingly anxious&#8221; if she knew of the application.  Over the period of just over four weeks, three orders (set out at [7], [8] and [10] below) were made by HHJ Hallam sitting as a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(1)</ref></span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At that hearing (2.7.2019), a large measure of agreement was achieved between the parties about the way forward.  PR had not returned home following her discharge </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">from hospital and was no longer planning to do so; she had been provided with suitable accommodation by the Local Authority.  PR&#8217;s parents had agreed to have only limited contact with PR, and not to persuade her to return home. The parties all agreed that the orders made by HHJ Hallam under the inherent jurisdiction should be discharged.  The issue arises, given in part that costs applications are threatened, whether the court should have exercised the inherent jurisdiction in relation to PR at all, and if so, whether it should have made the orders which it did.  While I am not conducting any appeal against the orders earlier made, inevitably I am required to review the circumstances in which they were made.  Given that (for reasons more fully explained in [9] and [30] below) SR and TR have so far had access to only very limited documentation, this judgment has been handed down in a state which is necessarily light on factual detail. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">PR&#8217;s in-patient treatment in early 2019 lasted for approximately eight weeks.  While PR was hospitalised, she disclosed aspects of her home life with her parents which gave the professional safeguarding and care agencies considerable concern about her future well-being should she return there.  A capacity assessment of PR was undertaken by the relevant mental health professional and clinical lead on the ward; this assessment revealed that PR was considered to be capacitous to make decisions about returning home, and about her contact with others (including her parents), albeit that she was (and still is to some degree) confused and vulnerable, and there was a suggestion that parental influence over her was disabling her from making true choices.  Notwithstanding the outcome of the capacity assessment, the Local Authority social worker concluded that PR &#8220;needs the protection of the court ... immediate and urgent intervention is justified and proportionate&#8221;.  PR was threatening to end her life if she did not receive protection.  The Local Authority accordingly sought &#8220;protective orders&#8221; in relation to PR.   </p>

The application was supported by a detailed statement from the key social worker, exhibited to which were the minutes of a recent multi-disciplinary team meeting.  Having heard argument, this application was granted albeit on an interim basis; the order reads as follows: </p>

She appeared to be initially upset, and was fearful (said to be &#8220;petrified&#8221;) of the consequences of not returning home, but was co-operative with plans to move her from the hospital to accommodation provided by the Local Authority.  The move to her new accommodation on the following day was said to be &#8220;uneventful&#8221;, and PR did not express any resistance.  Over the next couple of days, PR had reasonably extensive contact with her mother, TR.  Three days later, on 28 March, the matter was restored for hearing before HHJ Hallam.  On that day, the Judge made the following order: </p>

The order reflected the fact that the hearing had been conducted partly in &#8216;closed session&#8217; and partly in &#8216;open session&#8217;, issues of disclosure of information to SR and TR being discussed in the &#8216;closed session&#8217;.

What, then, of the arguments about the use of the inherent jurisdiction in these circumstances, and on the facts as presented?  Mr Burrows and Miss Collinson for the Local Authority contend that it was permissible, indeed entirely appropriate, for the court to invoke the inherent jurisdiction in this case, at least on an interim basis, until the question of PR&#8217;s capacity and/or vulnerability could be properly assessed.

Ms Khalique says that there was insufficient clarity on the evidence that the court could be so satisfied.  She makes the further point that given the coercive nature of an injunction, an order directed against a person so as to limit their choice of residence represented a deprivation of PR&#8217;s liberty (see below).    </p>

In one part, she heard advocates for all parties including SR and TR (the &#8216;open&#8217; hearing), and in the other part, SR and TR and their advocates were excluded (the &#8216;closed&#8217; hearing).  No one took any particular issue about this form of process, which was deemed necessary at that stage in order for the court to assess the extent (if at all) to which the evidence filed by the applicant should be disclosed to SR and TR.   At the hearing on 29 April, HHJ Hallam specifically provided that I should determine the issue of disclosure of documents to SR and TR at the hearing on 2 July 2019.  I adopted a similar procedure on 2 July 2019, dividing the hearing into two parts, again with the concurrence of the parties and their legal representatives.   </p>

PR did not bring these proceedings, and she objects to disclosure to SR and TR of information filed within the proceedings <span style="font-style:italic">by the applicant</span> which she wishes to keep confidential (and which, but for the proceedings, she would have been able to do).   As Ms Khalique has pointed out, PR is not a child, nor a person lacking capacity to make decisions as to disclosure of confidential information. PR has not &#8216;bowed to the jurisdiction of the court&#8217; to decide whether disclosure of confidential information should take place.  She has not in fact filed any evidence at all, but a reasonable amount of evidence has been filed about her.  It is not immediately obvious, Miss Khalique argues, that the court can proceed on the conventional basis upon which disclosure in relation to the subject of the proceedings has been justified in relation to children/adults with impaired capacity &#8211; i.e. considering the overall interests of the child/adult.

The burden on them is a heavy one. Only if the case for non-disclosure is convincingly and compellingly demonstrated will an order be made. No such order should be made unless the situation imperatively demands it. No such order should extend any further than is necessary. The test, at the end of the day, is one of strict necessity.

It is in those cases that the court is faced with the particularly difficult decision as to whether to make a &#8216;holding&#8217; order/injunction (ibid. see p.142).   The approach to an application for an injunction may well differ at different stages of the proceedings, and may depend upon the state of knowledge available to the judge.  It is clear from the authorities relied on by Mr Burrows (see in particular [16] above) that there is, now, well-recognised access to the inherent jurisdiction for the making of <span style="font-style:italic">interim</span> orders in cases where there is evidence of vulnerability and a <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> to protect the vulnerable person, and in my view Judge Hallam was entitled to follow that line of caselaw.   </p>
