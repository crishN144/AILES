After the accident X was initially cared for by A and B, his paternal grandparents (PGPs) in their country of origin, they then came here with X and lived with M and X in the same home.</span></p>

The PGPs were parties to the care proceedings, represented by different solicitors and counsel to those instructed within the COP proceedings. The care proceedings were listed before HHJ Roberts on 1 June 2017. The court was informed during the appeal hearing that due to increasing concerns about the position on the ground HHJ Roberts agreed, or directed, that she should also give directions in the COP proceedings on that day. The COP directions made on 1 June listed the matter for an interim hearing on 7 June 2017 before HHJ Roberts. The 1 June COP order made provision for disclosure of some documents from the family proceedings into the COP proceedings, and all the COP papers to be disclosed into the family proceedings. The order did not accede to Z&#8217;s position in her draft order, submitted with her COP application, that the family proceedings and the COP proceedings should be listed together.</span></p>

Both applications were refused. The basis of the adjournment applications was they wished to respond to the evidence on behalf of Z. The directions order dated 1 June required the PGPs to file their evidence by 6 June, which they had been unable to do. As the PGPs position statement for the hearing on 7 June made clear, they had only been granted public funding on 5 June and had only received the case papers the day before that hearing. The position statement also raised the issue of the family and COP proceedings being heard together.</span></p>

According to a note of the judgment given by HHJ Roberts on 7 June (which was not in the papers before this court) she observed, according to Mr Simblet&#8217;s skeleton argument, that Z&#8217;s case contained a suspicion of the family and their friends which she said was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;unhelpful and distasteful. There is no reason to think the respondents motivation is anything other than love for [M], love for [X] and a sense of family duty as to what is right&#8217;.</span></p>

It would be a nonsense and I pushed as far as I possibly could. What power can this court or the family court have over the defendant insurers&#8230;what was very clear in the evidence in the other [family] proceedings was that the goodwill was fraying&#8230;so reality, please and again, your clients [PGPs] were party to those proceedings, so they are well aware of that order to which they agreed&#8230;&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> The parties were given further time to negotiate, but were unable to reach agreement.

Whilst acknowledging that the judge was seeking to try and focus the parties on the issues in the case, I have reached the conclusion that when what she said is looked at it did mean there was a real possibility she had formed a concluded view adverse to the PGPs case. I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons:</span></p>

The fact that what was said took place in the absence of the parties adds to the complexity of the situation. The PGPs did not hear first hand what had been said, but the test is would a fair-minded and informed observer have concluded that there was a real possibility that the judge had formed a concluded view prior to the parties making their oral submissions. In my judgment they would have done, as the language used was clear and unambiguous.</span></p>

Reliance by the Local Authority and Z on the argument that the PGP&#8217;s solicitors agreed to some of the material from the family proceedings being removed from the court bundle for the COP hearing on 18 July does not stand up to close scrutiny; as it was without any express or corresponding reference between the parties to any agreement that the issues to be determined on 18 July had in some way been limited by the events and order made on 12 June. </span></p>
