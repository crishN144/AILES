The position statements from all Counsel are full, clear, relevant and extremely helpful in pinpointing the real issues between the parties. The cross-examination was (with some judicial encouragement) kept to a minimum and the closing speeches concise and to the point. In those circumstances it was possible to complete the application in the two days allotted. I am extremely grateful for the assistance I received.</p>

The decision to authorise the execution of a will for P is a decision which must be made by the court itself, and cannot be entrusted to a deputy: section 20 (3) (b). The will may make any provision (whether by disposing of property or exercising a power or otherwise) which could be made by a will executed by P if he had capacity to make it: Sched 2 para 2.</p>

Indeed the paramount objective is that of P&#8217;s best interests. However, by giving such prominence to the above matters, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> does in my judgment recognise that having his views and wishes taken into account and respected is a very significant aspect of P&#8217;s best interests.

	      <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.25in">She went on in paragraph 57 to suggest that there was a presumption in favour of implementing those wishes.

	    <content>
	      <p class="NormQuote" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the broad thrust of this, although I think that HH Judge Marshall QC may have slightly overstated the importance to be given to P&#8217;s wishes. First, section 1 (6) is not a statutory direction that one &#8220;must achieve&#8221; any desired objective by the least restrictive route. Section 1 (6) only requires that before a decision is made &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">regard</span> must be had&#8221; to that question. It is an important question, to be sure, but it is not determinative. The only imperative is that the decision must be made in P&#8217;s best interests. Second, although P&#8217;s wishes must be given weight, if, as I think, Parliament has endorsed the &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; approach, they are only one part of the balance. I agree that those wishes are to be given great weight, but I would prefer not to speak in terms of presumptions. Third, any attempt to test a decision by reference to what P would hypothetically have done or wanted runs the risk of amounting to a &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221; rather than a decision of what would be in P&#8217;s best interests. But despite this risk, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself requires some hypothesising. The decision maker must consider the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision if he had capacity and also the other factors that P would be likely to consider if he were able to do so. This does not, I think, necessarily require those to be given effect.</p>

Both Lewison J and Munby J took the view that this was a relevant matter to be placed in the balance sheet. However Morgan J and Senior Judge Lush have expressed doubts. [See paragraphs 52 &#8211; 53, 64 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re G(TJ)</span> and paragraph 54 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JC</span>.] As Morgan J pointed out the making of the gift and/or the terms of the will are not being made by P but by the Court. Furthermore insofar as there is a dispute between family members the unsuccessful members are not likely to think that he had done the right thing. For my part I think there is force in Morgan J&#8217;s views on the facts of this case with the result that I do not intend to place any weight on this factor.</p>

	    <p class="Normal2" style="text-indent:0.5in">Miss Griffin&#8217;s submissions were to much the same effect. She also submitted that the document was relevant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>. Ignoring the effect of Inheritance Tax and taking a value of the estate in 1986 as &#163;400,000 she submitted that F had left 82% of his estate to T. Plainly IHT should not be ignored but there is force in her submission that it showed that T was important to F and that he wished to make substantial provision for her.</p>

	    <p class="Normal2" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr Rees, Miss McQuail and Miss Rich advised a significantly more cautious approach to the document than that advocated by Mr Roberts and Miss Griffin. First there is the fact that the document contained an attestation clause in clear terms yet it was not witnessed. They ask why F did not get it witnessed if he intended it to be a valid will. Second there was some inconclusive hearsay evidence as to the existence of another will (possibly drawn up by a solicitor) which was torn up by T as she did not approve of its contents. In particular it left out Great Aunt W. Third the document was made in 1986. As Miss Rich pointed out there have been very significant changes in the 26 years since 1986. K has grown from a schoolboy of 10 to a married man with two young children of his own with a continuing relationship with F.  In 1986 the relationship between F and N was in its infancy. It has blossomed and N is now acting as F&#8217;s carer. The relationship between F and his siblings has or may have changed over the 26 years. One example of this is the fall out between F and I and F&#8217;s statement that he would never talk to I again. T is, of course, 95 incapable of managing her affairs and living in a care home.</p>

	    <p class="Normal2" style="text-indent:0.5in">In the light of the evidence from the beneficiaries that F told them that they were included in his will I think it more probable than not that F thought he had made a valid will. In the absence of any other document I think it probable that he thought that the 1986 document was that valid will. I attach little weight to the hearsay evidence about T destroying another will. In those circumstances I accept that it is a document within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> which I must consider and have regard. I think it is of assistance in that it shows that as at 1986 F wished his siblings and especially his mother to be included as objects of his bounty. However, for the reasons set out by Mr Rees, Miss McQuail and Miss Rich I do not regard it as a &#8220;magnetic feature&#8221; of the case. Nor do I regard it as the starting point for the determination of F&#8217;s best interests in relation to the terms of the statutory will. As Munby J pointed out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M</span> whilst P&#8217;s wishes will always be a significant factor the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will always be case-specific and fact-specific.</p>

At the time of the application I did not have much information about N&#8217;s financial situation and there were some doubts as to the length of her relationship with F. Having now considered all the evidence I accept that she has a very long standing relationship with F. Further if I may say so I agree with the Official Solicitor that her claim should not be considered solely in the context of the Inheritance (Family and Dependants) Act 1975. N has shown and continues to show great devotion to F.</p>

I agree that K has strong moral claims on F&#8217;s bounty. K is F&#8217;s only child. He has a young family of his own. There has been a normal relationship between father and son. However I also agree that members of the S family have made a very significant contribution to F&#8217;s wealth. I, L and Q all contributed to it without payment before F&#8217;s dementia. I and B have contributed since. If it were not for these contributions I suspect that the value of F&#8217;s estate would be significantly less than it is. </p>

On the other hand I think that Mr Roberts&#8217;s suggestion that the provision should be as much as 33% is too high. My mind has wavered as to the appropriate percentage. In the end I have decided to award the S family 22% of the estate. This provision is subject to the provisions to be made for T set out below.</p>

I am satisfied that there was a strong relationship between F and his mother. I am also satisfied both from the terms of the 1986 document and the financial assistance that F had already provided that he wished to contribute to her care. The relationship is continuing and I note that N takes F to see his mother every week.</p>

	    <p class="Normal2" style="text-indent:0.5in">I will direct that the payment be made within 3 months. The effect of such a payment will be to increase the theoretical value of her estate to &#163;140,000. However I accept that because of the difficulties in selling the property, the possibility of a charge to CGT, and other expenses it may be appropriate to take a more cautious approach and to reduce the value of the estate by &#163;30,000. There is currently an income shortfall of &#163;21,000 p.a. On any view a payment of &#163;50,000 should be sufficient to maintain T for another 4 years. If she and F survive 4 years it will be possible to apply to the deputy for a further payment.</p>

In those circumstances I propose to award T an annuity of &#163;20,000 per annum out of the S family&#8217;s share. However that annuity will not commence for 4 years (i.e. March 2017) in the event that F dies before that date. If F dies after March 2017 the annuity will take effect on his death. There will, of course, be no substitution provisions in relation to this gift. It will lapse on T&#8217;s death.</p>
