	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application issued by an originating summons in the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court on behalf of the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester.  The Chief Constable asks for an order or in the alternative a declaration that has the effect of granting him permission to interview two young girls who I shall refer to as KI and KW.  They are the first and second defendants and are represented by CAFCASS Legal.  The third defendant is the children&#8217;s mother, NP.  The local authority in which the children and their mother reside, Manchester City Council, has also been represented as an interested party.  They have been directed to undertake an investigation of the children&#8217;s circumstances in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KI and KW were born on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2000 and are therefore 7 years of age.  The un-contradicted facts upon which the application relies are that on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2007 they were both present when their older sister, then aged 12, died from a single gun shot wound to her head.  The gun was fired by their brother who is now just 17.  He is presently detained in secure accommodation charged with murder and related firearms offences.  He is waiting to be arraigned before the Crown Court in Manchester and bail has been refused.  It is said by everyone that there were no other eye witnesses to the incident, although that of necessity is peculiarly within the knowledge of the girls and their brother.  </p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his own interview with the police, the girls&#8217; brother indicated that the gun was in his jacket pocket and that he was messing about with it when it went off accidentally.  There is forensic opinion evidence that may tend to contradict or support aspects of the Crown&#8217;s case and the defendant&#8217;s explanation and, accordingly, it is said that the girls&#8217; evidence may be crucial to a proper determination of the criminal process.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s mother, NP, was not in the home at the time.  She was attending a funeral in London for a man who had been murdered in Manchester.  On the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2007 she admitted in interview that she had been asked to look after the gun on behalf of her then boyfriend, that she had buried the gun in a plastic bag in the back garden of her home and that she had informed her son of its whereabouts but instructed him not to touch it.  She has recently been charged with firearms offences.  It is said that since her interview she has received threatening telephone calls and that she fears for the safety of her family.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NP has sole parental responsibility for KI and KW and she has declined to give her consent to the girls being interviewed by the police on the basis of the detrimental impact that she says an interview will have upon them.  Their brother&#8217;s legal representatives have informed the court that he too is opposed to his sisters being interviewed on the basis that they have suffered enough.  The criminal defence team has no present intention to interview them.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Chief Constable would not ordinarily ask permission of the family court before embarking upon an aspect of the investigation of a crime, whether that involved children as perpetrators, victims or witnesses and a hearing such as this is not to be encouraged save in the most exceptional of circumstances.  In this case the tragedy that has engulfed the family and the sensitivity that the proposed interviews engender has caused him to take an advised course to examine the lawfulness of pursuing his investigation in the face of the opposition of the children&#8217;s mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not pretend to have described an exhaustive list of the rights that are engaged.  I do not doubt that it would have been necessary to do so and that the proportionality of the interference with each of them would have had to be considered and balanced were the outcome of this application to have been in any doubt.  However, for reasons that I shall shortly describe, I am of the clear view that the welfare balance comes down firmly in favour of the interview of the children by the Chief Constable and accordingly, the balance of rights on the facts of this case points in one direction only, namely, in favour of the application.  Nevertheless, in my judgment the cross check with an analysis of rights confirms me in the view that there are multiple rights in play and that the appropriate test must be a balance of the same rather than a discrete welfare enquiry.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A joint expert opinion as to the welfare implications of the proposal to interview the children has been provided by a well known expert in the field, the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and trauma specialist, Dr Jean Harris-Hendricks.  She was jointly instructed in circumstances of considerable urgency and as the court made clear, mother has at all relevant times had the right to obtain a second opinion.  She advises that a failure to give the girls the opportunity to talk will only lead to an increase rather than a reduction in their anxiety about the incident.  She opines that the children should have been interviewed before now and that their distress will be related to the actual events and their aftermath rather than the effects of the questioning i.e. the opposition to the interviews is based on a false premise, it is not the interview that will be detrimental to them but the incident itself and the failure to deal with same.  She believes that it will be a relief to the girls to bring their knowledge into the open and that it is necessary and appropriate for them to speak about it.</p>

The court is asked to be critical of it.  Suffice it to say that the opinion is apparently cogent despite the lack of reasoning from first principles and that it follows what might be described as the conventional approach to trauma cases where a death has the potential to seriously affect children in a family.</p>

I am sure no-one would disagree with the assertion that therapy whether subsequent to interview or so soon as it can be made available would benefit these children.  On balance I prefer the submissions of the Chief Constable, supported as they are by evidence that is un-contradicted save as to the opinions of the teachers and play therapist.  For the reasons I have set out above the real distress and likely harm in this case is more likely to be caused by the girls witnessing the incident rather than being interviewed about it and the sooner they can be given the opportunity to express their feelings about that the better.</p>

However, as Hale J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> (@ 829), only in an extreme case might there be such great trauma, and so little to be gained by an interview, that it would be justifiable to refuse permission altogether.  The balance of evidence does not support the opinion that the interview would cause such great trauma, quite the contrary.</p>

In the circumstance that I must balance the rights of others with those of the children, there can be little or no doubt that the correct decision is to hold that the children should be interviewed.  Although the evidential value of the interviews has been questioned, it can be seen from the circumstances to which this court has had regard that there are contrary opinions that are at least as cogent. </p>
