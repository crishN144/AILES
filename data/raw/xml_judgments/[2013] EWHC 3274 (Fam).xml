Over thirty years ago the father became a citizen of the United Kingdom.  &#8216;X&#8217; herself was born in 1997. </p>

There she underwent a ceremony of marriage to a man living in Pakistan which I will assume has formal legal validity under the law of the place where it was contracted. On the date of the marriage &#8216;X&#8217; was aged fourteen. </p>

On the facts that I have very briefly summarised it appears, on a balance of probability, that he was domiciled in England and Wales on that date and, accordingly, that her domicile of origin is England and Wales.  There is nothing at all to suggest that the father&#8217;s domicile changed between the date of her birth in 1997 and the date of the marriage in late 2011, so as to change her own domicile by dependency.    Accordingly, it appears, on a balance of probability, that her domicile on the date of the marriage remained England and Wales.</p>

It follows, therefore, as a matter of mixed fact and law, that the marriage in question is, so far as concerns the law of England and Wales, void.   Further, the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pugh v Pugh</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1951] P 482" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1951">[1951] P 482</ref> clearly establishes that the statutory provisions as to minimum age are extra territorial in effect. If either party was domiciled here on the date of the marriage (as she was) and one of them was under the age of 16 (as she was), it makes no difference that both parties may have been of sufficient minimum age and had capacity under the law of the domicile of the other party or under the law of the place where the marriage was contracted.</p>

In that, they are supported by &#8216;X&#8217; herself and by &#8216;X&#8217;s guardian in the care proceedings and by the baby&#8217;s guardian in the care proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second reason is to clarify, for the purpose of the proceedings in relation to the baby, the legal status of the baby&#8217;s father.  The father is not named on the baby&#8217;s birth certificate. At the moment, the local authority do not know the identity, and still less the whereabouts, of the man with whom &#8216;X&#8217; went through the ceremony of marriage, who is, indeed, the genetic father of the baby.  Under English law, if he was validly married to &#8216;X&#8217; at the time of, or at any time between, the conception or birth of the baby, then he has parental responsibility for the baby.   (See <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2 (1)</ref> and (3) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, read with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref>).   If he was not validly married to her at any time during that period, then (not being himself domiciled here) he does not.

Sometimes that outcome is sought in situations where the party to the marriage lacked mental capacity to contract a marriage and continues to lack mental capacity to take any steps to seek its annulment.  Lack of mental capacity, however, and also duress, are not grounds which render a marriage void but, rather, which render it voidable under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>(c) or (d) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case, however, is different.

The advocates have sought to rely, in particular, upon the authority of Baron J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">B v I (Forced Marriage)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1721" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1721</ref>.  In that case the young woman in question was already aged sixteen at the time of the ceremony of marriage. It was, however, a forced marriage into which she had been forced by duress.  There was no question of the marriage in that case being void, although it was, at its inception, voidable.  However, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> has the effect that there is a statutory bar on petitioning for a decree of nullity where a marriage is voidable for duress if more than three years have elapsed from the date of the marriage.  In that case, the issue as to the status of the marriage was only raised after more than three years had elapsed, and accordingly at a stage when it was no longer legally possible to obtain a decree of nullity. It was in those circumstances that Baron J was asked to make, and did make, a declaration that the marriage in question was never a marriage which was capable of recognition as a valid marriage in England and Wales.</p>
