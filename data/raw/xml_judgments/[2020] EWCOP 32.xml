The parties were informed on 3 February 2020 that Dr O&#8217;Donovan would be going on maternity leave in mid-March.  The Official Solicitor told the parties that she accepted Dr O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s conclusions, and raised her concern that the content of the report gave rise to a real concern that it was no longer possible to rely on Dr Carpenter&#8217;s previous conclusion that SB lacked capacity to make decisions about care and contact, and that accordingly the declarations to that effect would need to be revisited.  In particular, the section in Dr O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s report concerning decisions about residence strongly suggested that SB would also have capacity to make decisions about her care. Paragraphs 14.2.10-14.2. 11 stated as follows: </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">SB was of the opinion that day to day she required assistance with a number of activities of daily living. She was able to recognize that when she had lived without the support of her mother previously, she had struggled to adequately care for herself. Furthermore, she was able to draw comparisons between the level of support provided by both her mother and her partner. While she stated that her partner is very attentive and happy to support her, she felt that her mother enabled her to feel "safer" and was able to support her with different tasks in a way that her partner was unable to. SB was therefore asked to consider what she would do in the event that her mother was taken ill for example and was unable to reside at the property in order to support SB. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">She stated that in these circumstances she would seek support from her sister or her brother. Again, she felt that they would be able to meet her needs better on a more consistent and regular basis than her partner. However, if they could not support her, she believed that her partner would. SB did not consider that supported accommodation or support from carers would ever be necessary. However, during the initial assessment she did agree to view material detailing such options. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">There is evidence that historically SB has struggled to understand and weigh up decisions in regards to her residence, particularly when considering this in the context of her own care needs. During previous assessments SB had the opportunity to reflect on her experience of different environments but was unable to weigh up the information to make a decision. However, during this assessment, SB did demonstrate an understanding of the different residential options that are currently available to her. She could use the necessary information and weigh it up.&#8221;</p>

Whilst it is highly regrettable that SB will have to engage with a further expert, it was agreed at the hearing before me that Dr Camden-Smith should undertake an assessment in this area. Following submissions on whether this report should also contain an assessment of SB&#8217;s capacity to conduct litigation (it being suggested by those acting for AB that the third expert should be asked to report on this area as well) I handed down a short oral judgment indicating that it was not necessary for there to be a further assessment of SB&#8217;s litigation capacity.  </p>

Before I do so, I wish to make it very clear that AB is clearly a concerned and committed parent. It is abundantly clear that SB&#8217;s past experiences and decisions have not always been ones that AB, as a caring and committed parent, has found easy to either observe or condone. Many parents at one time or another (and often more than once) struggle to balance support for their capacitous adult child&#8217;s decision making, more so during the child&#8217;s formative years as a young adult, with the need to allow their adult child to grown and learn from their experiences (and mistakes).  </p>

It is clear from the evidence (and the details of the conversation between AB and Dr O&#8217;Donovan set out in Dr O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s first addendum report) that AB was shocked by Dr O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s expert opinion in </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.25in;margin-right:0.53in">As indicated at the outset of this judgment, some risk-taking in adolescents and young adults can be perfectly healthy, such as in sporting activities, or artistic and creative pursuits, travelling, making new friends (including internet dating and friendship groups), or entering competitions. Healthy risk-taking helps young people to learn. Some adolescent risk-taking can be unhealthy and dangerous &#8211; casual sexual relationships, unprotected sex, driving too fast on the roads, excessive consumption of alcohol, consumption of nonprescribed drugs, dealing with anger and confrontation. These forms of risk-taking are inherently unwise and unsafe. In dealing with risk issues in relation to a young person in the context of assessment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, it is necessary to separate out as far as is possible the evidence which indicates that second category of risk taking (unhealthy, dangerous, unwise) from that which reveals or may reveal a lack of capacity. As Lewison LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">PC v City of York </span>(above) "adult autonomy" includes the freedom "to make unwise decisions, provided that they have the capacity to decide" (see [64]).

The legal test that the expert (and the court) must apply does not require the consideration of hypothetical alternatives. However, in this context I note firstly that Dr O&#8217;Donovan did discuss two hypothetical situations with SB (the first of AB moving to Scotland and the second of AB being too unwell to care for SB) and SB was able to weigh up information in relation to these options and reach a decision. I note in passing that AB agrees with the conclusions that SB reached in relation to both of these hypotheses; it happens that in both of these scenarios SB placed the same or similar weight on factors as her mother would </p>

She does not budget well. She does not know how to pay domestic bills. However due to her level of disability I seriously doubt that she would be able to put this together to decide independently that in general she needed a certain level of support in different areas and that this needed to be provided by either her partner or co-habitee or external carer, where ever she lives. If such a statement was drafted and put to her I would expect her to be able to agree with what was stated, as she is pliant, but not retain it as she would not fully understand its implication.&#8221; (Dr Carpenter&#8217;s second report dated 6 December 2018). </p>

SB&#8217;s presentation went far beyond pliant agreement with a proposition put to her. This is again indicative of the progress that she has made since Dr Carpenter last reported. I make it clear that in making these observations I make no criticism of Dr Carpenter&#8217;s stated views, which were matters of considered professional <span style="font-style:italic">opinion</span>. By its very nature expert psychiatric evidence is ultimately opinion evidence. That subsequent events establish that such opinion is superseded does not in any way undermine the initial validity of the original opinion.   </p>

However, this does not necessarily indicate that she is unable to manage her property and financial affairs. A large proportion of the population who are in control of their own finances struggle to effectively budget and instead are considered to make unwise decisions in regard to their financial affairs, as opposed to lacking capacity. Following the discussion with AB however, it would have been helpful to explore this matter further with SB. However, after arrangements were made to do this, the teleconference subsequently did not go ahead on the basis of the instruction of the Official Solicitor and the relevant parties. In the absence of SB cooperating openly in the assessment, in my view it cannot be assumed that inaccuracy of the information she provided indicates that she lacks capacity to make decisions about her finances. </p>

CJ gambles frequently and I am concerned that he is using SB's money in order to do so. CJ attends the Amusement Arcade around four times per week. He receives his benefits from the DWP once fortnightly and attends the Arcade as soon as he has been paid, I asked SB how CJ affords to gamble and she stated that she provides him with money once he has spent his own. SB informed me that CJ spends all of his money gambling and she has to pay for the electric and gas in their home. Around every 2 weeks SB asks me for money. I usually give SB &#163;60&#163;80 at the end of the month, every couple of months, and she states that she spends this on gas, electric and food, I have given SB &#163;60-&#163;80 on around four occasions. I have asked SB where she spends her money at the end of every month and she states "I try to stop him gambling mum. He doesn't have any money mum."&#8221;</p>

The second issue, which arises from this, is that there has been no factual determination of what SB may (or may not) have said to AB and whether there is any truth in these comments, if made.

Within this checklist an individual is required to know the extent of their property and affairs in terms of how much income they receive, what they spend, their financial liabilities, financial needs and responsibilities and that a person would be likely to seek, understand and act on appropriate advice were it necessary.  </p>
