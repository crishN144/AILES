The hospital made a safeguarding referral to the local authority and a joint section 47 investigation commenced. The parents were arrested on 20 July 2023 and released on police bail following interview.  They signed a section 20 agreement for M on 21 July 2023, albeit he was not discharged from hospital until 28 July 2023. He moved to the care of the paternal great aunt and uncle at this time under an interim care order, which was made by this court on 26 July 2023.  M changed carers to the Mother&#8217;s maternal cousins on 13 January 2024 following issues in the first placement. M has remained in this placement to date, enjoying extensive supervised contact with both parents and extended family members.</span></p>

There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause.

In the period leading up to the admission of the children in hospital, and in the 19 months since that admission, their care has been observed and scrutinised by a large number of professionals and the picture that emerges, not least from the highly positive assessment carried out on behalf of the Local Authority, is that these are doting parents who are devoted to the children and provide them with a very high level of care. This was obvious to me throughout the hearing, from the way they spoke about the children, the large numbers of photographs taken and produced in the 19 albums, the huge book of artwork, the DVD of the children and the smiles on their faces on the many occasions when the children are being spoken of, not least as I am giving judgment.

The Mother had the Father&#8217;s support both on his return from work in the morning and once he had woken up in the afternoon; for example when discussing M&#8217;s colic with the police the Mother described days when she has been a bit upset if he has cried too much, &#8220;but it&#8217;s just the fact that I can&#8217;t make it better for him&#8221; [J680] and &#8220;the father will take over and I&#8217;ll just have a bath or something&#8221;[J681].

The family had only just returned from a trip to Wales where they had scattered the maternal grandmother&#8217;s ashes. The Mother is understandably heartbroken and expressing to her father that M is the only thing keeping her going, but the Mother had expressed she was upset feeling like she was a criminal. This experience would be stressful for anyone and the message sent is both justified and not indicative of significant stress.

The Mother reflected that she had been told it could take four weeks for Omeprazole to work, which accords with Dr Cleghorn&#8217;s evidence, and that as M had settled and they were going on holiday she decided to continue with the Omeprazole. She was able to recall taking the bottle to the Isle of Wight and keeping it cool and O in his evidence spoke to assisting the mother in administering it. There was plenty of medicine in the bottle and therefore she did not need to get more from the GP when she attended on 2 May 2023 to get the hydrolysed milk.</span></p>

She described the Mother as thinking it looked similar to M&#8217;s presentation on 17 July 2023 and that she had been &#8220;worried about M being in pain without her knowing&#8221;, which led to the allocated social worker suggesting that the Mother contact the GP surgery, which she duly did by email.  The Mother&#8217;s thought processes are self-evident and her concern about M clear. It was also necessarily difficult for the Mother to deal with this whilst not having M in her physical care. The paternal great aunt did not produce evidence herself in relation to these marks and indeed the other concerns raised by the allocated social worker, in the context of concerns raised about her failure to report marks and dismissal of safeguarding queries. This is a further gap in the evidence which I note that the medical experts &#8211; Dr Cleghorn in particular &#8211; have not been able to comment on for want of evidence or sufficient evidence. </span></p>

It is not surprising that the Father did not wake up, noting he mentioned in his police interview he had been awake a long time   driving [J597]. The evidence about when the Mother told the Father is not clear and it is true that the Mother did not initially put it forward as a possible explanation, it evidently not being at the forefront of her mind on 17/18 July. In her police interview it is evident that the Mother did not initially think this incident was significant &#8211; she noticed M had trapped his foot and he was crying but &#8220;he also had a fully nappy which he doesn&#8217;t like&#8221; &#8221;so we didn&#8217;t think too much of the leg at the time&#8221; (the evidence established that the Mother has a tendency to say &#8220;we&#8221; interchangeably with &#8220;I&#8221;).  The Mother states that M pulled his own leg back down when released and he wasn&#8217;t in any pain that the Mother was aware of. The court&#8217;s impression is that at the time the Mother did not consider the incident particularly significant. The Guardian questions why the Mother would review the Cubio AI footage but it appears to the court that that is entirely consistent with the Mother&#8217;s parenting behaviour.  There is no impression that the Mother was trying to exaggerate or over-dramatise this incident to point towards this causing one or more of the fractures, quite the reverse. </span></p>

This is conjecture; there is no evidence of the Father having either been stressed or excessively tired, and it is entirely normal for parents to deal with a grizzly teething baby from time to time, including the appropriate administration of Calpol. </span></p>

From the court&#8217;s perspective the material point is that there is no question about whether or not O suffers from rheumatoid arthritis; this was diagnosed in 2015. This is a condition which is subject to flare ups, and therefore it is not inconsistent that the pain will be variable. O has got disfigured fingers &#8211; he showed them to the court albeit the court does not have any rheumatological expertise &#8211; and there is no challenge as to whether he struggled to find shoes. I do not find O to be dishonest; he is a Litigant in Person without the benefit of legal advice and I accept his evidence that he sent the email defensively and in haste. </span></p>

The Mother received appropriate medication to deal with her morning sickness in pregnancy and support in caring for M after his traumatic birth. No doubt this was challenging but not exceptional in terms of pregnancy and childbirth. Importantly there is no evidence to suggest that the Mother was not coping by reason of her pregnancy and birth difficulties, nor indeed the loss of her mother. The evidence conversely speaks of M bringing joy to this family&#8217;s life after the recent sadness. </span></p>

This prompted the parents to take entirely appropriate action, in terms of contacting the GP, discovering there would be a two day wait and deciding to call 111, commencing the journey to hospital prior to receiving the 111 call back. The Local Authority points to a perpetrator having to take action to avoid suspicion, however some action does not equate to this level of action &#8211; which points to a particularly assiduous parent in the court&#8217;s view. </span></p>

Whereas the court does accept the independently reported evidence in relation to M&#8217;s crying during nappy changes, there is still a question mark around how the caregivers could not have observed additional distress when these fractures were sustained even if organic. The court notes that administration of Calpol for teething may have incidentally reduced M&#8217;s distress but not entirely in the view of Dr Cleghorn. Thus if the leg fractures were caused by the &#8216;onesie&#8217; incident or  through &#8216;bicycles&#8217;, one would still expect the caregiver to notice some distress on fracture.

The court&#8217;s impression is that by virtue of these being multiple metaphyseal fractures combined with a posterior rib fracture such discussion wasn&#8217;t necessary in the view of these experts. Dr Cleghorn in her conclusions relies on Dr Jones, but Dr Jones made errors in his report that Dr Cleghorn likewise does not appear to have spotted. </span></p>

The parents in this case have also lost the opportunity to determine whether M has sustained further injuries, through no fault of their own. The result is an inconsistent and incomplete radiological and paediatric expert opinion.</span></p>

This is an emerging field and no doubt more research will emerge, but given the involvement of rib fractures in the research papers there remains a possibility that this could explain all the fractures, albeit the absence of discernible pain and distress is not explained. There is no burden on the parents and intervenors to explain away any anomalies but I observe that there are obvious other factors over the relevant period, notably initially digestive discomfort/colic and latterly teething. </span></p>

The court is unable to identify with any specificity other than that outlined above when and how these fractures were sustained by M and, to this extent, they are of unknown cause. It follows, for the avoidance of doubt, that there is no real possibility that either of the parents or the intervenors inflicted M&#8217;s injuries. </span></p>

In the event there is no appeal the court invites the Local Authority to give immediate thought to a transition plan to enable M to return home. The Guardian points to the possibility of this being under a child in need plan. The court is clear that no findings have been made which meet the requirements of section 31 of the Children Act 1989. However the court notes the parents&#8217; anxiety about the way forward, particularly if M has further health issues with unanswered questions, and some support may be beneficial in relation to this. </span></p>
