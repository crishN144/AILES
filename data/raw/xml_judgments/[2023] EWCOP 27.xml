Y is a natal male who identifies as female.  Though she was initially taking hormone medication, which she was purchasing on the internet, she has now been referred to a gender specialist and is taking prescribed female hormone medication. Y was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder as a child. Her education records reveal difficulties with learning but she remained in mainstream education and was provided with support. She passed NVQ Level 1 and 2 in Engineering. In the summer of 2018, when Y was a very young adult, she sustained serious injuries in a road traffic accident. She was riding a motorbike and was involved in a collision with a car. The accident generated personal injury proceedings which are ongoing. Liability is not in issue in those proceedings, it has been admitted. Y was not at fault. Quantum of damages remains to be assessed. In those proceedings, Y&#8217;s father (F) is her litigation friend. </span></p>

Her support package is overseen by a clinical lead. Establishing the package of support was challenging, complicated by the destabilising influence of Y&#8217;s mother and, inevitably, exacerbated by the restrictions of the pandemic. Following an unsettled period where Y was moving between various hotels, seemingly, at her mother&#8217;s direction, she eventually moved to a rehabilitation unit in Sheffield. The stability she achieved there was important and enabled her to move, in April 2022, to a rented bungalow in the North West, with a support package. Care and support is commissioned by her Deputies and managed by a case manager. </span></p>

In his report Dr Todd assessed Y as lacking capacity to make a range of decisions but found that she had the capacity to engage in sexual relationships. As there was evidence that Y lacked capacity to make decisions as to her residence and care arrangements, her living arrangements served effectively to deprive her of her liberty. Authorisation for this, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 4</ref>A and 16 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8216;MCA') was subsequently given by orders made by the Court of Protection, upon the application by the Local Authority.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">After receipt of Dr Grace&#8217;s report it was no longer disputed that the Y had the capacity to decide to take cross-sex hormones and to use the internet. </span></p>

She sustained a brain injury which is classified as moderate-severe and is associated with either permanent or transient changes in cognition, behaviour, and emotional regulation. Mr Browne KC, Counsel for the Local Authority, has emphasised that alongside the brain injury was a very serious injury to her left arm. The injury is to the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is&#160;formed from five nerves that originate in the spinal cord at the neck. The plexus connects these five nerves with the nerves that provide sensation (feeling) to the skin and permit movement in the muscles of the arm and hand. The damage has been so significant that Y has no control at all of her left arm. Mr Browne has described the arm as &#8220;dead&#8221;. This injury caused a protracted period of intense pain which required significant pain relief. Y continues to have chronic pain. </span></p>

Opinion on this is divided between Dr Janet Grace, Consultant Neuropsychiatrist, and Dr Todd. The two bring differing specialisms to bear. Whilst there are important areas of common ground, their ultimate conclusions are very significantly different. Mr O&#8217;Brien KC, Counsel for the Deputies, has described this as a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;particularly complex and finely balanced case&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. I agree that it is complex but I do not think it can properly be described as &#8220;finely balanced&#8221;. Dr Todd is very clear that Y lacks capacity to make decisions as to where she resides and the care and support, she requires. Dr Grace forcefully articulates the opposite opinion. Ultimately, the question for the Court is which of the two views is to be preferred. </span></p>

This is known as the &#8216;frontal lobe paradox&#8217;. Failing to take account of this when conducting Mental Capacity Act assessments can result in disastrous consequences for patients. We suggest that neuropsychologists work collaboratively with local authority social workers and care managers, who often have the final say in such assessments, to raise awareness of this issue&#8221;.</span></p>

As I have already discussed above, the brachial injury is regarded as a very significant and painful one. It certainly had a very marked physical impact on Y in that early period of treatment. Dr Todd considers that the focus on this, the pain generated by it and the extent of the pain relief medication required, may either have obscured the clinical picture or distracted professional focus from the impact of the brain injury. Thus, the apparent atypical trajectory of a brain injury which seems to have worsened over time, might in fact, be inaccurate. </span></p>

Although that fits with Dr Todd&#8217;s analysis, it is right to say that both doctors agreed that pain or mood disorders might also legitimately explain this apparent disengagement. Though Dr Grace had placed some emphasis on the apparently deteriorating trajectory of the brain injury, as pertinent to her view that ASD was predominately causative, both she and Dr Todd alert me to a number of important facts:</span></p>

Dr Todd is of the opinion that this is secondary to the executive/frontal deficits identified on cognitive testing giving rise to a phenomenon called the frontal lobe paradox (FLP), whereby people have an intellectual awareness of the relevant information but do not act on it due to neurocognitive changes. Dr Todd phrases this as &#8220;does not translate into emergent or anticipatory awareness&#8221;. He notes that [Y] has not fully engaged and has missed sessions.

However, by that hearing, Dr Grace&#8217;s report had arrived, expressing the conclusions that have been set out above. I was troubled about whether the criteria for an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> continued to be met i.e., was there reason to believe that Y lacked capacity in the contemplated spheres. I heard from Dr Grace and I found her evidence to be persuasive and well-reasoned. I asked if Dr Todd could be contacted. He was, but he remained firm on his own conclusion. Provision was made for a full transcript of what Dr Grace said to this Court to be prepared and sent to him for consideration. This was done but Dr Todd, again, respectfully, retained his view. Though it has been possible, as illustrated above, for both experts to identify clear and helpful areas of agreement and disagreement, I repeat, their ultimate conclusions on the key issues remain entirely different. It is important that I highlight that this is not a case where the two experts have been sucked into an ideological battle in which both have retreated to a defence of their amour propre. There is a genuine difference of opinion in which both have engaged in an intellectually honest dialectic. Having heard evidence from Dr Todd, I found his evidence to be persuasive and well-reasoned too. </span></p>

I very much doubt that he was ever told that the &#8220;head injury&#8221; would &#8220;clear up&#8221;. But I do recognise his account as a layperson&#8217;s interpretation of what I have been told is the prevailing medical consensus i.e., that there is often a period of noticeable improvement in the months following the injury. F also emphasises the extent to which the shoulder injury dominated treatment at this point. Reading the papers in this case and having regard to the issue in focus i.e., capacity, it is very easy to be distracted from the enormity of this physical life-changing injury. Mr Browne, and I make no apologies for repeating this, is entirely right to give it the prominence he does. F, it seems to me, is doing very much the same. The significance of this, in Dr Todd&#8217;s view, is that this may have altered the conventional changes immediately following the frontal lobe injury or alternatively, they may have been present and eclipsed by the focus on the shoulder injury. </span></p>

Taking her shopping is like managing a toddler in a supermarket. She jumps from one thing to another and wants what she sees. Given access to her own money, that is what she would do. In my view she is not capable of managing a budget to allow her to do the weekly shop; to pay bills; to deal with the unexpected expenses like a broken boiler or a broken down car and to re-budget accordingly. She could not manage that even with help, she is disinclined to budget and becomes distressed when discussions turn to money or budgeting or control of spending, or she simply goes blank and disengages. That has not improved, and I can&#8217;t see that it will in the future.&#8221;</span></p>

Whilst she was with me and the family over Christmas, we went out to an Indian restaurant. [Y] likes Indian food. However, it was not a place that she had been to before. She found it very difficult to stay focused and struggled with choosing from a menu. For example, she likes naan bread. The restaurant did very large ones for sharing and she could not deal with the fact that they were larger than normal and order one to share. She could not commit one way or the other to making a decision. This wasn&#8217;t a disinclination to share. It was an inability to manage the difference. She found it difficult to choose from the menu. She just could not engage when the group were selecting what they wanted to eat. We were all ordering dishes to share, so that everyone could have a taste of a wide variety of curries. She went blank and disengaged when being asked what she wanted, and I had to order a number of dishes for her. If she had been offered a choice between A &amp; B, then she would likely have been able to choose if told she had to choose A or B. Left to her own devices, she would choose neither or both. Having multiple choice, and having to select things to share, and having to think what would go well with some other selection was a wider decision tree in a fairly mundane context and she just could not manage. It was noticeable to me and the wider family, but we did not make a fuss about it.&#8221;</span></p>

It was abundantly clear that Dr Grace does not share Dr Todd&#8217;s view about the impact of [Y]&#8217;s brain injury on her functioning &#8211; it cannot be right to rely on [Y]&#8217;s alleged failure to grasp these matters when the court-appointed expert does not agree with them, and when Dr Todd accepted that was a reasonable view to take.&#8221; </span></p>

To my mind, what Dr Todd is emphasising is Y&#8217;s inability to plan or to convert an expression of motivation into practice in the way that she was able to do so before the accident and which is behaviour which Dr Todd considers, within mainstream opinion, as consistent with brain damage. He has been taken to F&#8217;s statement and has interrogated it, as indeed I have, in the context of his central proposition. There is also, as I understand it, a consensus view that Y&#8217;s mother is unlikely to be an entirely reliable chronicler of events. Her apparent resistance to therapeutic support for Y, historically, has properly been deprecated. Later, Ms Butler-Cole makes the following submission: </span></p>

His view was that watching Netflix, seeing family, playing the piano and so on was not good enough.  There had to be not just &#8216;community access&#8217; but this had to be regular and routine. There needed to be participation in a course or vocational programme.  At the time he assessed [Y] she had just left almost a year in a rehabilitation unit, and had only been in her own property for a matter of weeks.  There is no evidence that her staff have tried hard to support her to participate in a course or other programme and that she has been unable to manage it.  She does now do more activities (for example going to the gym &#8211; see the Gym Support Plan) but her rehabilitation plan of 7 January 2023 does not even include finding courses or programmes for her to participate in as a goal There is a real issue about staffing in any event &#8211; staff had been completing written records dishonestly and inconsistently and a new team leader was introduced around February 2023 to address problems with the care provision.&#8221;</span></p>

Dr Grace considers that Y&#8217;s difficulties are, as I understand her opinion, predominately caused by her anxiety and fail to meet the diagnostic test of capacity.</span></p>

The former derives from clinical practice, the latter is the test prescribed by MCA. Neither is &#8216;insight&#8217; to be viewed as equating to or synonymous with capacity. To elide those two would be to derogate from personal autonomy, every adult from time-to-time lacks insight into an issue or indeed into themselves. I do not consider that Dr Todd falls into these rudimentary errors. It must be emphasised that severe traumatic brain injury has been identified neuroradiologically in this case and that this is not challenged. Dr Todd considers that Y has cognitive, emotional and behavioural manifestations which are not confined to periods of heightened arousal but are pervasive and reductive of capacity for problem solving. These, he considers are frequently associated with frontal lobe damage.  Again, whilst recognising the variability of these behaviours, I do not understand this central premise to be in dispute. The consequence, Dr Todd contends, is to impair the ability to think consequentially and ultimately, to be able satisfactorily to understand, retain or weigh information in order to make a decision about care needs and accommodation. To my mind, that establishes both the functional and diagnostic test. Moreover, for the reasons I have already explained, I consider that the accounts given by F very much reinforce Dr Todd&#8217;s views and do not sit as comfortably with those expressed by Dr Grace. It is Dr Todd&#8217;s opinion which unifies most of (though by no means all) the features of what is undoubtedly a complex evidential matrix. </span></p>

The decision is essentially binary. It requires me to determine which of two carefully analysed opinions I consider likely to be accurate. I have come to the clear view that Dr Todd&#8217;s opinion is to be preferred and for the reasons I have already stated. This is not, in any way, to reject all that Dr Grace has said. On the contrary, as I have highlighted, there is much common ground between the two professionals. I am particularly alert to her entirely proper warning that a dissociation between knowing or understanding and a failure to follow through or convert to action, is not, axiomatically, pathological. It would be reductive of Dr Todd&#8217;s opinion however, to characterise it in that way. </span></p>

It is a powerful safeguard of civil liberty. It requires to be rebutted on cogent evidence, nothing else will ever do. The principle was well embodied in the case law that preceded the MCA. It is both a guard against the power of the state and a gateway to State support where needed. It is woven into the professional DNA of practitioners and Judges in this important and evolving sphere of the law. I feel confident that every Judge, evaluating a question of capacity, approaches the test with a resolve to find that an individual has capacity and arrives at a contrary conclusion only when the evidence demands it. Having concluded that Y lacks capacity to make decisions relating to her care and accommodation, it is important always to remember that the MCA constructs an ongoing obligation to promote capacity, in effect, to build a pathway to capacity where there is a prospect of it. There is evidence that Y is making progress cognitively and more broadly. That evidence, at present, has a degree of fragility which causes me to draw back from any more confident assertion. What it indicates, however, is the importance of the obligation to provide a scaffolding of support for Y in order that she is availed of the very best opportunity to reassert her autonomy in these two very important spheres of decision taking. It may well be that in the months to come, the landscape might change and require my decision to be revisited. I suspect, though I may be entirely wrong, that some of Dr Grace&#8217;s reservations may also reflect my own sense from the evidence that Y&#8217;s situation remains an evolving one. </span></p>
