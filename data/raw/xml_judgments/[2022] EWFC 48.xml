	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment follows a finding of fact hearing in public law proceedings brought by Bradford MDC in relation to two children, R, a girl born in 2004 and now aged 17, and S, a boy now aged 12. The Respondents are the children&#8217;s parents to whom I shall refer as the mother and father in this anonymised judgment. There is a third child of the family, T, who is now an adult male aged 20, and who is an intervenor in these proceedings. The parents, T, and R were all born in Pakistan. The family moved to Country A (in continental Europe) when T and R were young. S was born in Country A in 2010. The family moved to England in 2017.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were begun following allegations made by R on 7 June 2021 that T had sexually abused her when they were younger, that she had informed her mother of what T had done but she had dismissed her complaints, and that the father had made threats of violence against her after she had raised her allegations with her mother. The nature of the allegations and the manner in which R raised them are discussed later in this judgment. The Schedule of Findings sought by the Applicant appears at Appendix One to this judgment. I set out the details of the allegations in Appendix Two which is to remain confidential. My findings appear at Appendix Three.</p>

	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The identities of the children, their parents and T are protected because it would be against the interests of, and positively harmful to, the children for their identities to be known. I have not included the details of the allegations of sexual abuse in the body of the judgment to guard against prurience and because those details need not be known for the judgment to be understood.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Upon R making the allegations, T and the mother were arrested. T was interviewed by police on 7 June 2021.

The events she described were not witnessed. T disputes all but one of the allegations. The allegations occurred within the home, or within the home of a member of the extended family in Pakistan. They are historic, the last alleged occurrence of abuse being at least four years before the allegations were made. R was between the ages of about 9 and 12, and T between the ages of about 11 and 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. The consequences of R having made the allegations and of the findings made by this court are far reaching. Accordingly, the court has to approach the evidence with great care, although the standard of proof remains on the balance of probabilities.</p>

Although the making of findings is of great importance to R, T, and their parents, the need to make findings is not as obviously necessary to the welfare determinations involving S. I considered the recent Court of Appeal judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2022/468" uk:canonical="[2022] EWCA Civ 468" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWCA Civ 468</ref> However, T was heavily involved in S&#8217;s care, S is highly vulnerable, the parents may be found to have failed to protect S, and since the court had previously decided that a finding of fact hearing was necessary, I was content to proceed.</p>

The police interview took place on the same day that R had first made her allegations to Ms K at her school. The mother and father&#8217;s evidence was that R was a good daughter: she worked hard at school and helped her mother at home.

The first part of the DVD film of the interview shows R alone in the interview waiting for the interviewing officer to arrive. She is seen to be blowing and taking deliberate, deep breaths and appears to be preparing herself for the interview ahead. On being asked to introduce herself for the recording she gives her name and adds, &#8220;and I am a survivor of sexual abuse&#8221;. Early in the interview she speaks more or less continuously for about fifteen minutes setting out all the allegations against T which are now for the court to determine. It is clear that T had given a lot of thought to the allegations before the interview. By her own evidence during the interview she had researched the issue of sexual abuse on the internet. Initially she had been researching the Black Lives Matter movement, then the Me Too movement. She had spoken to a school friend about her experiences over a period of at least six months. She chose to make her allegations on the day she finished her last GCSE. Evidently she wanted to focus on her examinations before sharing her allegations. There is no evidence that R had spoken to a counsellor or to any professional about the alleged abuse prior to 7 June 2021. She may have been influenced by her friend or by what she had read on the internet, but the impression watching and listening to the interview is that she is speaking her own mind, for her own reasons, having given a great deal of thought before reporting the allegations to the school and the police. She appears to me to be very aware of the importance of the allegations she is making and of the possible ramifications for her and the family.</p>

She is sympathetic to her mother even whilst telling the police that her mother did nothing to protect her. Once R has spilled out her account in her initial long answers, and begins to be questioned in detail, she appears to be spontaneous and direct, she is able to give details in many of her answers, and, when asked, she draws sketches to assist without hesitation. Furthermore, she begins to grimace when remembering certain unpleasant details, pauses to compose herself and then, about fifty minutes into the interview, she becomes very upset and has to take a 15 minute break. The immediate trigger for her becoming overwhelmed with emotion at that point is when she says that she loves her mother. </p>

When in the toilet R says that T was looking through the door into the toilet so R stood in front of the girl to protect her and T moved away [G144, line 11].

On the one hand it might be said to demonstrate authenticity &#8211; that she remembered a smell &#8211; on the other it is a very adult expression for a young and inexperienced person to make. There is also an apparent inconsistency in R&#8217;s account of the bathroom incident when she was nine years old. In her police interview at [G157, line 26 onwards] R describes what happened. As set out in the confidential Appendix Two to this judgment, when she described that incident to Ms K there was an additional important detail that she did not mention to the police.</p>

However, in her first statement CY says that R had informed her that in 2015 her mother had said &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; and that she should tell her father. R told CY that she had told her father during the holiday in Pakistan and that he had told T off in a &#8220;laughing way&#8221;.

However, R then confronted her brother, accusing T of having stolen her innocence. Her mother called her &#8220;crazy&#8221; and said she was destroying the family and that no-one would marry her. R felt suicidal. [G144, line 22]. This happened in 2020. R said that she did not blame her mother who was brought up in an &#8220;ignorant&#8221; household. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have a statement given to police on 1 July 2021 from a school friend of R&#8217;s whose identity remains confidential. I shall refer to her as G. She says that in or around November or December 2020 R confided in her that when she was about 7 or 8 years old and living in Country A her brother had told her to go to the bathroom with her  and to get undressed. She then reports an account that is similar to the one given by R to the police. A day or so later R then told G that her brother had been threatening and blackmailing her to take naked pictures of herself to send to him. G could not recall if R had told her when this had happened. R also told G that her brother had asked her to touch his penis when she was about 10 years old, and that on another occasion she had seen her brother looking &#8220;inappropriately&#8221; at a young girl visiting with her family, when she had been in the bathroom. G told the police that R had told her that she had informed her mother about what her brother was doing but her mother had said that it was normal for boys to do that and had blamed R for what had happened, telling her it would damage the family honour. G tried to persuade R to speak to the safeguarding teacher but R wanted to wait until after her examinations and so it was in early June that G went with R to speak to the Ms K. G&#8217;s evidence that R told her she was 6 or 7 years old when the bath/shower incident occurred is inconsistent with R&#8217;s account to the police that she was 9. However, I do not regard that as a significant inconsistency: G may have misremembered what R had told her. Alternatively, R may have reflected more on the timing of the incident before giving her considered account to the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms K was the first professional person outside the family to whom R made her allegations. Ms K was the safeguarding lead at R&#8217;s school. R went to speak to Ms K with her friend, G, on 7 June 2021. Ms K told the court that she made contemporaneous notes by typing them into the Child Protection Online Monitoring System (CPOMS) record during the discussion. She contacted the police and then children&#8217;s social services. She did not discuss the allegations further with R. She did return to her CPOMS record, which she had left open to add to it. She referred to these additions as &#8220;elaboration&#8221; but she meant that she added comments about R&#8217;s demeanour and about what comments R herself had made during the meeting. She closed the CPOMS record in the early afternoon of 8 June 2021 and she made a police statement using the CPOMS record that same day. There are inconsistencies between the CPOMS record and the police statement including an important detail of the incident R had alleged had occurred in the shower/bath when she was nine. This is addressed in the confidential appendix two to this judgment. It is regrettable that Ms K did not record her contemporaneous notes of the discussion on 7th June 2021, close that record, and then open up another record to write up her reflections, the context, how R had presented and so forth. Then the court would know more clearly what was said by R on 7th June and what was comment by Ms K. Some criticism was made of Ms K for referring to R&#8217;s allegations as &#8220;disclosures&#8221;, but I do not find that Ms K pre-judged the truth of the allegations made. Her role, which she fulfilled, was to listen to and record the allegations and to alert the appropriate authorities whilst looking after R&#8217;s welfare. She did that, albeit her notetaking might have been more transparent if she had done it in the manner I have suggested. Given the way in which the notes were recorded I find it difficult to rely on any apparent discrepancies between what she recorded and what R subsequently said to the police save that I accept that what she recorded in quotation marks was what she contemporaneously recorded R as saying to her.</p>

I have referred to an inconsistency in the recorded accounts of the shower/bath incident, and an inconsistency as to whether she told her father of T spying on her in 2015. Otherwise, she has given consistent accounts of the reported incidents and of the family&#8217;s response. I do not detect any inconsistency in her description of informing her mother of &#8220;everything&#8221; in 2020, of her father knowing about what she had made allegations against her brother without R having told him directly, and about her parents&#8217; reactions. It is true that at [G182] when asked if her father knew what was happening, she began her answer &#8220;No. I think my mum probably told him&#8230;&#8221; However, I would caution against over-scrutinising R&#8217;s free flowing responses in interview &#8211; she clearly meant to say, and did say, that she had not told her father about the allegations, but that he must have known about them because of the way he subsequently spoke to her. Generally, there is an absence of significant inconsistency in R&#8217;s evidence.</p>

The mother accepted that she would very occasionally go out and leave R and T alone in the flat: that would be the opportunity for T to abuse R as she alleges in the bath/shower. Again, when the family were in Pakistan, different opportunities arose for T to spy on or touch R inappropriately. The history of the allegations fits in with the circumstances that prevailed at the relevant times.</p>

She accepts that she is an uneducated woman. She appeared to me to adopt a simple view of her role in the family and of her children. It is entirely credible that she should both be upset that her daughter was upset on informing her what had occurred, but also upset with her for causing a row with T, and concerned that the allegations would be made to the authorities or would go public. Likewise, it is credible that rather than confronting R directly, the father would try to bury the allegations by thinly veiled threats to R that it would be in her interests to keep her allegations to herself.</p>

To the contrary, she appears to have been a &#8220;good&#8221; daughter and sister. It would be wholly out of character for her to concoct a series of serious allegations of sexual abuse, add to them fabrications about informing her parents and their responses, and to go to the school and then the police, knowing of the serious potential consequences of doing so. I note that R has raised other complaints about her former Guardian and a young person in her placement that have been found to be valid. Again, this is evidence that she is not prone to making false allegations for ulterior motives or otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T&#8217;s responses to R&#8217;s allegations in his own police interview are revealing. I do take into account that he had no time to prepare for the interview and was a young man alone, without a solicitor (as was his choice). Nevertheless, T struck me as being an intelligent man who understands the importance of the words he uses. He flatly denied certain allegations, such as taking photographs or film of R, but said that he could &#8220;not remember&#8221; others. It is plain from the whole of the interview that he drew a distinction between allegations he denied, and those he did not deny but could not remember. Even though he was young at the time of the alleged events, it is noteworthy that he could not say to the police that he had never done what was alleged. Also, in relation to the kissing allegation, T admitted it and said that he had been &#8220;animalistic&#8221; when he had kissed R. It is evident that T was unable to resist an impulse to act in a sexual way towards his sister. As Mr Hargan put it in submissions, T crossed the line of acceptable conduct by one sibling to another. Whilst admitting his actions, T was unwilling to admit that he had felt a sexual impulse. He was uncomfortable confronting what had caused him to act as he admitted he had acted. It does not follow that because T was caused on impulse to act in that way on one occasion that he did so on other occasions. On the other hand, it is more credible that he did so than if there was no evidence that he had ever &#8220;crossed the line&#8221;.  </p>

It has tentatively been suggested that R wanted freedom and a more Western lifestyle, but (i) her parents say that she could wear what she wanted and have friendships with whomever she wanted whilst at home with them; (ii) if she were to fabricate allegations to secure her &#8220;freedom&#8221; she could have made up allegations of ongoing abuse, or of more serious abuse, but she was very clear that the abuse had stopped and as to its limits. Even knowing the price she is paying for having made the allegations - complete separation from her family &#8211; R has maintained her allegations. I find it implausible that she has deliberately and maliciously caused damage to herself and to her family simply in order to leave the family unit.</p>

If the parents are to be believed, then R has fabricated a mountain of detail about her interactions with them in order to mislead the authorities. It was suggested on behalf of the mother that R had to lie about telling her mother about the allegations because if she had not blamed her parents for failing to protect her, the consequences of making the allegations against her brother would have been his exclusion rather than her freedom. That suggestion did not come from the mother herself and it seems to me to be fanciful, projecting onto R a level of manipulative scheming of which I do not accept she is capable.</p>

However, what R then told the police is that the mother said that R would destroy the family, not that she would bring dishonour on the family. It is right to say that R told the police about the importance of honour when describing her mother&#8217;s reaction, but I can only safely conclude that the mother said that R was crazy and would destroy the family. Further, the mother said those things, I find, only after R had confronted T (after she had informed her mother of the abuse). I note that the mother said in evidence at court that she thought that R was mentally unwell and that she uses the word &#8220;crazy&#8221;. In any event, for the reasons already given I find R&#8217;s evidence more credible than the mother&#8217;s in relation to this allegation. In acting as she did, and failing to take any steps to support R beyond an initial hug, the mother failed to support R. I find allegation 3 proved.</p>

I accept, as did R in her police interview, that the father did not intend to kill or cause serious harm to R, but he nevertheless wanted to keep her quiet and so made these threats for that purpose. I reject the evidence of the father and the mother that they would have gone to the authorities had R raised these allegations with them. Firstly, now that R has made the allegations, they have both taken a similar position: if they did not see the abuse they cannot accept that it happened. The father says that he leaves the decision as to whether the abuse happened to the court. He has not listened to his son&#8217;s police interview. There is no evidence that he or the mother have anxiously enquired as to the allegations and their son&#8217;s account. Rather they have been passive in dealing with both T and R in the aftermath of her allegations being made to the authorities. That is consistent with a passive approach before 7 June 2021 when they just wanted the issue to go away and for R to keep it to herself. Ironically, the pressure caused to R by her parents&#8217; attitude is one of the reasons she decided to speak out. R became suicidal at times between revealing her allegations to her mother and 7 June 2021. I am satisfied that allegations 4 and 5 are proved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been a danger of losing sight of S in all the disputes about the sexual abuse and its aftermath. One of R&#8217;s motivations for speaking out was concern that T was bathing him, that S was vulnerable and could not complain for himself if anything happened to him, and R&#8217;s experiences of abuse by T when he was younger. She was anxious that perhaps T&#8217;s abuse of her had stopped when she became older and that T had a predilection for younger children. That was speculation on her part and there is no evidence that T has ever done anything inappropriate to or with S. However, there is evidence that he was close to S, spent a good deal of time with him and, sometimes, bathed him. The mother accepted that he did. Given the nature of the abuse revealed by R, perpetrated on her by T when she was at about S&#8217;s age, the parents should have been expected to respond to her allegations, which I have found she made to the mother and the father was made aware of, by taking steps to protect S. They could have spoken to T about what had happened but there is no evidence that they did. They could have asked him to stop bathing S, but there is no evidence that they did. They could have monitored T with S to satisfy themselves that there was no risk, but there is no evidence that they did. I am satisfied that allegation 6 is proved.</p>

As for S, the findings I have made satisfy me that he was at risk of suffering significant harm, namely sexual abuse, attributable to the care likely to be given to him not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him. That is not a finding that S has suffered harm of that nature, only that there was, at the relevant time, a risk of it. The risk did arise because of the matters set out in the preceding paragraph of this judgment.</p>
