	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Anorexia nervosa (from the Greek </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">an-/without </span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">orexia/appetite</span><span style="font-size:12pt">) is a pernicious condition.  In its severe form it is life-governing and potentially fatal.  In order to stay alive, a human being needs air, water and food.  The normal energy intake for an adult woman is about 2000 calories a day.  A healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 18.5 and 25.  If the body uses more energy than it gains over a prolonged period, the result is malnutrition, with a global effect on well-being.  The physical consequences can include endocrine disorder preventing the onset of puberty, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, hypothermia, anaemia, reduction in white blood cells, reduction in bone density and reduced immune system functioning.  The social consequences for individuals and their families can be devastating, as they damage or destroy normal social development.  The psychological consequences for the sufferer include a mental life dominated by thoughts of food.  The act of eating is all too easy for most people in developed societies.  But for the sufferer, whose life would be utterly transformed by the most modest food consumption, the ability to eat is seemingly overpowered.  Years are spent thinking and talking about eating, but talking about eating is not the same thing as eating.</span></p>

In this judgment I will call her W.  Since the age of 11, she has had six admissions for inpatient treatment, spread between five units around the country and amounting to about 10 years in total.  Her current admission has lasted for 2&#189; years and yet, despite the most intensive support, she is barely eating and is losing weight at the rate of 500 g &#8211; 1 kg per week.  She now weighs less than 30 kg and her BMI is 12.6.  If she continues to lose weight at this rate, she will die.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I have read reports from many of the medical professionals who have treated W, statements from W herself and from her parents and sister, and reports from Dr Tyrone Glover, the psychiatrist instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of W.  I have spoken with W herself by video-link and have heard evidence from her responsible psychiatrist, Dr X, from Dr Glover and from W&#8217;s mother and sister.  After receiving closing submissions from Mr Andrew Bagchi QC for the Health Board, and Mr David Lock QC for W, instructed by the Official Solicitor, I gave my decision on 25 February with brief reasons, which I expand upon in this judgment.  W said that she would like to speak to me again after the decision had been made, and I have done that.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The outcome is that, accepting the unanimous professional view, I approve the plan of the Health Board.  This is that W should now be discharged into the community with a closely thought-out package of support for her and her family.  Given W&#8217;s fragile condition, it is a plan that has only been arrived at after the most anxious consideration by her care team.  It will at first seem counterintuitive that someone so ill should be discharged from hospital.  The conventional assumption is that hospital treatment is likely to bring benefits, but the evidence has persuaded me that in this case that is not so.  The outcome is to some extent in accordance with W&#8217;s wishes, which I will describe below.</span></p>

(This point of view is expressed, somewhat more strongly, by W&#8217;s father who by his own description has taken more of a back seat.)

W is only 28 years old, with potentially many years ahead of her.  However, in my view the picture is a very complex one.  If the pattern continues as it has been for W, we have potentially a young woman who could spend the rest of her life in hospital, distressed and angry at having all self-determination, autonomy and control taken away.  This will have subsequent impact on her quality of life and ethical as well as practical implications&#8230;  After 18 years duration, sadly my opinion is that it is very unlikely W is going to make a significant recovery&#8230;  In my view, over the years some iatrogenic factors could have potentially crept in, in terms of W&#8217;s relationship with services and others around her&#8230;  NHS clinical staff have become her main social connections&#8230;  Services can become a reinforcing influence by providing an overly protective environment which ensures safety and security while reducing loneliness and isolation.  This limits the need for an individual to develop their own sense of responsibility, autonomy and independence.  Also, the highly structured environment of inpatient care supports the rigid attention to detail and inflexibility which is characteristic of people with eating disorders, allowing these negative behaviours to thrive&#8230;"</span></p>

She confirmed that she would immediately discharge W from compulsory detention because, while her condition warrants treatment, they have found no way of treating it.  If W is to stay on the ward, there needs to be a treatment plan and a goal.  It is not otherwise possible for an acute bed to be held open.  The decision to discharge W into the community has received the utmost consideration.  There may only be a glimmer of hope that the change in circumstances will lead to a change in thinking and behaviour.  However, in Dr X&#8217;s opinion, the alternatives are worse.  She does not believe that life on the unit is a life for W, who anyway does not want to be there.  It would be a continuation of what has been happening for the last 20 years, which hasn&#8217;t worked.  As to the prospect of a move to another unit, assuming one could be found, that would be cruel because the prospects of change are so remote.</span></p>

She was asked about the element of her plan which states that W will not be readmitted to the unit, even in an emergency, unless there is a reason to think that there has been a real change in her treatability.  In such circumstances, W would be treated on a medical ward and any decisions would have to be taken in that context.</span></p>

Questioned about a number of &#8220;softer&#8221; options, such as a move to another unit or a postponement of the discharge, she responded convincingly.  Although she has previously proposed other options (feeding under sedation, imposition of a DNACPR notice) that had understandably caused real concern for W and her family, by the time Dr X came to give evidence, I found her to be flexible in her thinking but clear in her conclusions.  I accept her evidence.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Dr Glover is a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders.  He has advised in similar cases and once again his formulation has been of great assistance.  He confirms that W has severe and unremitting anorexia from which she has never enjoyed a period of remission.  He considers that coercion is no longer justified and that after such a long course of illness a cure is not to be hoped for.  The early age of onset, the resistance to treatment, the distortion of personality, and the lack of insight are all negative prognostic factors.  The best that could be achieved is a limited degree of recovery and the maintenance of that state.  He thinks that a move to an alternative unit while matters remain as they are would be very likely to be futile.  If progress (by which he means no more than a significant period of limited deterioration) could be made, that possibility might be reconsidered, but it is not worth pursuing as matters stand.  If W was now admitted elsewhere as a voluntary patient, the chances of her being able to start eating sufficiently would in his view be nil and the process would be unwise and unfair.  Likewise, there would be no real benefit to W in postponing her discharge from the unit for a few weeks.</span></p>

This hearing has in effect been a search for a less drastic outcome than those with which the court was originally presented.  Assisted by all parties, I have looked to see whether there is a realistic alternative to the Board&#8217;s proposal.  In agreement with the doctors and medical staff, and also to a significant extent with W and her family, I have concluded that there is not.  After all that has happened, it now has to be accepted that it is beyond the power of doctors or family members, and certainly beyond the power of the court, to bring about an improvement in W&#8217;s circumstances or an extension of her life.  The possibility that the withdrawal of inpatient mental health services will bring about a change for the better may not be very great, but in my judgment it is the least worst option from W&#8217;s point of view.</span></p>

Hard as it is to accept, I nonetheless agree that this environment, designed to be therapeutic, is not therapeutic at all for W.  It has become a place for talking about eating, and not for eating.

The court can only make decisions in relation to existing circumstances or circumstances that it can foresee with reasonable confidence.  It is accordingly accepted by the Board that if a significant period of time passes, accompanied by signs that W&#8217;s thinking and behaviour have been able to change, the normal ethical and legal obligation upon the health services to reassess the situation will exist.  In brief, the Board is saying &#8220;not now&#8221;; it is not saying &#8220;not ever&#8221;, and it is that outcome that the court is endorsing.  </span></p>
