In addition, H has acquired shares which he cannot realise until December 2026 with an estimated net value of &#163;365,000 (agreed by W to be his separate property). H&#8217;s income from his employment is &#163;198,972 net per annum.

That latitude and flexibility applies to the assessment of needs as much as it applies to the other s25 factors. Each case is a highly fact specific evaluation and discretionary exercise. There is a world of difference between, say; (i) a childless couple whose marriage lasts for 2 years, enjoying only a modest lifestyle, at the end of which one party might need no more than short term maintenance or a highly attenuated housing budget (perhaps restricted to time limited rental), and (ii) as here, a couple with 2 young children, where the impecunious wife will have the primary responsibility of bringing up the children for many years to come, leaving the already wealthy husband able to enjoy the fruits of his successful career.</span></p>

Whilst I accept that W felt pressure to sign the agreement, it is clear that she was not forced to sign it and that she did have the benefit of independent legal advice and the terms of the agreement were explained to her by her own solicitor. Indeed she accepted in her evidence that she understood the reasons for the agreement and that she did not have a problem with H protecting his property.  It was not clear from the presentation of her case at the final hearing that validity was seriously challenged and her main objection has been that the PNA is out of date and does not meet her needs.

Such an approach may, albeit unusually, lead the court in its search for a fair outcome, to make an order which, contrary to the terms of the agreement, provides a settlement for the wife in excess of her needs. It should also be recognised that, even in a case where the court considers a needs based approach to be fair, the court will, as in KA v MA 2018 EWHC499 (fam) retain a degree of latitude when it comes to deciding on the level of generosity or frugality which should appropriately be brought to the assessment of those needs. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"</span></p>

The result of this is that the PNA leaves W with an unknown quantity of capital in no more than 8 years&#8217; time when A turns 18 and no maintenance in the intervening years whilst she is the main carer for the parties&#8217; son.  Her evidence is that the child arrangements agreed mean that she has 72% of the childcare time with A and H has 28%.   In my view the PNA is unfair as it leaves W without adequate income and I consider that this falls well to the left of the left book end in Mostyn J&#8217;s analogy referred to above as it clearly does not meet W&#8217;s needs. The parties&#8217; circumstances are now such that it would clearly not be fair to hold the parties to that agreement without a full consideration of all of the circumstances, particularly as the court's first consideration is the welfare of any children, which in this case is A, who is aged 10.

The PNA is one of the important circumstances that I bear in mind. I have found that the overall effect of the agreement is unfair when looking at the clauses that apply to separation after five years of marriage. The court can give effect to the parts of the PNA which are not unfair, in particular the provisions which relate to pension and H's retention of the former family home and his premarital assets.  One aspect of the agreement which I find should be taken into account as a relevant circumstance is the provision that H agreed at clause 11 to provide financial support for B whilst he remains in the UK and in receipt of full-time education up to and including First Degree. That is to be calculated by using the same formula that is used by the CSA or equivalent body, i.e. CMS. Obviously this is not the same amount as the &#163;27,000 sought by W as a capital need, and it would appear likely to be a figure of around &#163;379 pm which is said to be the likely amount of CMS payable for A based on H&#8217;s anticipated retirement income (amounting to &#163;4548 p.a).  I factor this into my consideration of what is reasonable to award as maintenance to W in respect of her income needs against the background of the PNA not providing for maintenance on separation after 5 years.</span></p>

W accepted in evidence that she could not expect to have the same standard of living after divorce. However, this acceptance was not apparent from her list of criteria for her housing needs that she put to the court which was rather more of a wish list. I am satisfied on the evidence that W&#8217;s reasonable housing needs could be met by a property costing &#163;350,000 in the area that she wishes to live in, as suitable examples were provided by H and W&#8217;s objections were not reasonable. Of course it is understandable that ideally she would want a property which has second and third bedrooms of a similar size but it must be borne in mind that B is now over 18 and therefore not the court&#8217;s first concern, and the property examples provided are in the area which W wishes to live and reasonably close to good schools for A.</span></p>

H agrees that W should gain the professional accreditation she seeks in order to maximise her future income and his offer factors in the costs her studies.&#160; It is clear that she will require financial support during the period of 4 years when she will have limited earning capacity and will remain the main carer for the parties&#8217; child who is 10 years old now and will therefore only be 14 when she finishes this course in around July 2028.</span></p>

The standard of living was a comfortable one as a result of H&#8217;s high earnings. I bear in mind that H is due to retire in 6 months&#8217; time. I am therefore assessing income needs with these factors in mind and with a view to striking an appropriate balance between what the parties agreed 10 years ago and the fact that during the marriage there has been a significant increase in H&#8217;s income and the addition of a child of the family who is now aged 10.</span></p>

Looking at the breakdown of her figures I find that this is certainly in excess of reasonable needs. I consider that reductions are necessary in respect of various amounts including for cleaning, gardening, some maintenance costs, pet expenses (there is currently no pet), holidays and general shopping. Taking a broad brush approach I assess reasonable income needs as &#163;2,500 per month (&#163;30.000 p.a). </span></p>

I therefore find that the appropriate term for payment is for 4 years to enable her to adjust to independence without undue hardship, and thereafter a clean break.  It is clear that H can easily meet this shortfall &#8211; it is less than 10% of his current net monthly income. In the next six months until retirement he will receive a net amount of &#163;99,486. Capitalisation of payments of &#163;1500 per month over the next four years is a total of &#163;72,000, and this is the amount I find H should pay as capitalised maintenance.</span></p>

W should vacate the former family home within 4 months of receipt of this amount, which ought to give sufficient time to purchase an alternative property. The court will expect that H will be reasonable in allowing some amount of limited extra time if there are delays in the moving process which are not the fault of W. If W moves from the family home prior to H&#8217;s retirement she will be entitled to receive CMS calculated on his current earnings at a much higher rate which will more than cover any delay in her being able to obtain an income from employment.</span></p>
