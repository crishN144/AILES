	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 5 November 2019 Recorder Posner gave judgment in respect of the child arrangements order for a young person who I shall call SH for the purposes of this judgment. SH was 12 &#189; at the time of that decision and is now 13. The application the Recorder was considering had been made by SH&#8217;s father (&#8216;the father&#8217;) in early 2019; it was for a variation of a shared lives-with order, which dated back to October 2015. The application to vary that order emerged after a series of hearings in December </p>

The father&#8217;s position was that for a significant part of the previous three years the parties had by agreement not complied with the terms of the shared lives-with order and that SH had lived for the majority of that time with him.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s application was timetabled to a final hearing that was due to take place in July 2019. SH had been joined as a party to the proceedings and NYAS appointed as her Children&#8217;s Guardian. In a report for the final hearing the NYAS Caseworker made a recommendation that was not in accordance with SH&#8217;s wishes. The final hearing was adjourned to enable the mother to secure legal representation and relisted in September 2019. By the time the adjourned final hearing came before the Recorder, SH had instructed her own solicitor, Ms Hansen, and HHJ Oliver had granted her application to be represented directly in the proceedings. NYAS&#8217;s appointment was terminated but the NYAS Caseworker remained a witness. I shall refer to that Caseworker as &#8220;the Caseworker&#8221; in this judgment, for ease of reference. </p>

On that day the Recorder gave a judgment and made an order which provided that SH would live with her father. No order was made in respect of the time SH was to spend with her mother. An application for permission to appeal was made on behalf of the mother to the Recorder and refused. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Over three months later, on 12 February 2020, the mother, as a litigant in person, lodged an Appellant&#8217;s Notice with the Family Division, seeking to set-aside the order made by the Recorder. The Appellant&#8217;s Notice was accompanied by a lengthy narrative &#8216;grounds of appeal&#8217;. I gave initial directions on 24 February 2020 and further directions on 6 April 2020. In those directions I indicated that the reasons given for the delay did not appear to be good ones but if the merits of the appeal were strong that might tip the balance in favour of granting an extension of time. I sought to distil from the 23 paragraphs of narrative grounds what then appeared to me to be potentially arguable points. I shall return to those later. I listed the application for an oral permission hearing, on notice. </p>

An appeal bundle amounting to some 330-odd pages was agreed between the lawyers for the father and the lawyers for SH, and </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">filed. The mother filed a supplemental bundle of some 85 pages and I later received a transcript of the oral evidence of Ms Hansen. Given that only one hour had been allowed for pre-reading, I was unable to read all of that material in advance of the hearing. The application was listed before me on 3 June 2019. I heard oral submissions from Ms Ward on behalf of the mother (who did not appear below), from Mr Turner QC on behalf of the father and from Ms Honeyman on behalf of SH. Both Ms Ward and Mr Turner (and his solicitors) acted <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> and I would like to express my thanks to them, in particular, for the assistance they have given to the parties and to the court at no charge, but also to Ms Honeyman and Ms Hansen for their input. The focussed written and oral submissions were of great assistance to me. At the conclusion of the hearing, in particular because of the reliance placed on the transcript of the oral evidence that had been given by the Caseworker at trial,  I informed the parties that I would read further documents, in particular the transcript of the Caseworker&#8217;s evidence, and would circulate my decision and a draft judgment later that day. In the event it was not possible to complete that further reading and this judgment on 3 June. </p>

Ms Ward submitted that the Caseworker had seen SH in different contexts and was thus able to assess what SH said about spending time with her mother against what she (the Caseworker) saw of </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In particular, Ms Ward emphasised that both the Caseworker and previous judges had found the father to be dishonest and manipulative and she argued that the Recorder had failed to give any weight to such previous findings in respect of the father. She submitted that the Caseworker was entitled to reach the conclusions that she had in respect of the father, which were based on her direct experience of him, in particular in relation to him appearing to agree the summer holiday contact at court but then reneging on it. The Recorder gave as a reason for not following the Caseworker&#8217;s recommendations and discounting her evidence that she had not provided a balanced assessment of the parents. However, Ms Ward said  it is clear from the Caseworker&#8217;s reports and her evidence that she had identified failings in the mother as well as the father and that her evaluation was a balanced one, albeit she was more concerned by the father&#8217;s failings than the mother&#8217;s. There was no basis, Ms Ward contended, for the Recorder to conclude that she could not find any objective evidence which supported the Caseworker&#8217;s evaluation of the father as dishonest and manipulative. </p>

It only emerged in the course of evidence that it was the father&#8217;s solicitors who had made initial contact with Ms Hansen and this all pointed, it was argued, to orchestration by the father. </p>

She submitted that the Recorder was strongly swayed in her decision by SH&#8217;s academic ambitions, prioritising them at the expense of her other emotional needs, in particular for a full relationship with the mother. Ultimately, Ms Ward contended, the Recorder&#8217;s analysis was deficient, as a result of the weight placed upon this issue, which is disproportionate to the holistic evaluation of welfare.  </p>

As the White Book makes clear, where an application is made to extend time and is itself made out of time the court should approach it on the basis that it is an application for relief from sanctions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">In the present case the explanation given by the mother for her delay is unsatisfactory. Given the history of the litigation between the parents she was well-aware of the possibility of an appeal and, at least in general, must have been aware of the time limits. An oral application for permission to appeal was made at the conclusion of the hearing. The delay of nearly three months meant that the order was communicated to SH and began to operate. It appears, for reasons which I have not gone into, that the regime has now broken down. I have not explored that and it is not part of this appeal. In any event, the net result is that now, at the time of this hearing for permission, SH is rising 14 and her wishes and feelings would become even more weighty. The explanation given by the mother does not provide an adequate explanation. Neither </p>

Nothing indicates she was incapacitated or otherwise occupied in a way which justified putting SH&#8217;s future on the back-burner. The court must consider all of the circumstances of the case, which includes the underlying merits of the proposed appeal but also other matters. It seems to have been accepted that an end to litigation was essential for SH, given she had been exposed to it for several years. The hearing of an appeal with its prolongation of this litigation and the uncertain outcome, including the possible remission of the case for further hearing, by which time SH would undoubtedly be 14 is a factor I take into account.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having had the opportunity to read the reports of the Caseworker and the statements of Ms Hansen, together with the transcripts of the oral evidence of each of them, the judge&#8217;s conclusion that SH&#8217;s views were her own and should be given significant weight appears to me to be unassailable. The curious feature of SH&#8217;s views is that she spoke positively of both her mother and her father and of her time with each of them. The records of what she said seem to show balance, reflection, passion and maturity, notwithstanding what the Caseworker (and, according to the Caseworker, the school) said about her lack of emotional maturity. However, SH identified issues to do with her mother, combined with her desire to prioritise her particular academic talent, as being reasons for preferring to live with her father and to spend down-time with her mother. The evidence from a variety of sources provided an objective foundation, both in relation to the emotional pressure she said she experienced from her mother and her genuine passion for her academic subject. This was a long way from alienation. Although criticism was made of Ms Hansen not having seen and spoken to SH in her domestic context, the records of what she said to Ms Hansen is not very different in substance to that which she said to the Caseworker. The record of that, and Ms Hansen&#8217;s evidence in relation to it, supports the judge&#8217;s conclusion that SH&#8217;s concerns about emotional pressure and her desire to prioritise her studies were authentically her own views. Ms Hansen said that she had not had access to any of the papers when she first spoke to SH but that when she did she saw that what SH had said to her was generally borne out by the papers. She was very clear that in her initial interview with SH, and subsequently, she did not detect the markers of influence, or the markers of immaturity and lack of competence, which often cause her to decline to accept instructions from a young person. Although Ms Ward submitted that Ms Hansen had not had the opportunity to see SH in different contexts, which might be said to be a disadvantage, she had seen SH in a neutral environment, without either of her parents being in earshot, and had spent something in the region of 5-6 hours in meetings or telephone calls with her, which would seem to have given Ms Hansen a very good opportunity to gauge SH&#8217;s competence and the authenticity of her views. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">any criticism of the father of a similar nature within the child-related proceedings. The Recorder was critical of the father and was well-aware of the history and of what had been said of him elsewhere. Her conclusion that the Caseworker&#8217;s characterisation of the father as being deceptive or punitive was unsupported by objective evidence might perhaps have been more fully explained (for instance, by setting out the evidence of one or more examples which illustrated the erroneous characterisation), particularly given the depth of criticism which infused the Caseworker&#8217;s report and the number of examples she gave. However, having read those reports and the transcript of the Caseworker&#8217;s evidence, it is quite clear that the Caseworker&#8217;s oral evidence did not justify the conclusions she reached. There are numerous examples in the transcript where she is asked to support such conclusions and in most cases she was unable to make good her criticism, either because she had mistaken something or had taken the mother&#8217;s word for something or had not taken into account some other evidence which was relevant to the evaluation. She also demonstrated a tendency to hyperbole.  The Recorder&#8217;s conclusion that there was no objective basis for the Caseworker&#8217;s characterisation of the father is a finding on the evidence which she was well-entitled to make, having heard from the father, the mother and the Caseworker. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having reached the conclusion that the Caseworker&#8217;s extensive criticisms of the father were not borne out by the evidence, the consequence was that the report was unbalanced. However, the imbalance went further than simply the removal of some of the criticism of the father by reason of the judge&#8217;s rejection of those criticisms. Although Ms Ward&#8217;s submission that the Caseworker had been critical of the mother in her reports is correct, the differential between the criticism made in the report and the criticism that might properly have been made of the mother and which emerges and is accepted by the Caseworker, in particular during her cross-examination by Ms Honeyman, demonstrates even more clearly the lack of balance in the reports. Again, it might have been helpful, particularly to the appellate court, had the judgment set out clear conclusions, for instance on the 2015-18 consensual variation, the collection order impact, the phone theft allegation, and the video-pressurising of SH. The evidence from SH alone was powerful and seems to have been corroborated by other evidence. The Recorder was therefore justified in rejecting the Caseworker&#8217;s criticism of the father and in the limited criticism that the Caseworker had  herself made of the mother. The Recorder was therefore also entitled to depart from the Caseworker&#8217;s assessment and her recommendations. </p>

Given the very considerable difference between the Caseworker&#8217;s recommendation, which was in effect for a 50-50 split of time, whereas SH wished for two nights per week and the occasional weekend (on a flexible basis) with her mother, it would not be surprising if a highly intelligent 12 year old had been dissatisfied with her representation. The evidence as to how she came to instruct Ms Hansen is commonplace; indeed perhaps more arm&#8217;s-length than is often encountered. More important though was the content of what SH said to Ms Hansen, and Ms Hansen&#8217;s evaluation of it in terms of SH&#8217;s competence and motivation and the underlying objective substance of what she said. The totality of the evidence simply does not support the contention that SH was manipulated into instructing Ms Hansen to further the father&#8217;s goals but rather lends support to the Recorder&#8217;s conclusion that SH was an articulate and highly intelligent young person who had objectively valid reasons both for being unhappy with her Caseworker and for the sort of child arrangements order that the Caseworker articulated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>It is undoubtedly the case that the Caseworker&#8217;s reports provided a holistic evaluation of SH&#8217;s welfare. However, this was a highly unusual case with a driven child with a genius for a particular subject. In cross-examination of the Caseworker by Ms Honeyman, the Caseworker accepted that unique children, whether in the sporting or academic fields, justified a change in the approach that their families might take to them. It was clear from the evidence that SH valued the time she spent with her mother and that it met her need for downtime. Issues such as maintaining contact with her wider family, her ability to have a female figure in her life, her ability to connect with her roots and to have her emotional needs met were plainly being met by the regime which SH was advocating. The evidence from her school was that she was thriving in all of the aspects of her life that they were able to comment on. The totality of the evidence also demonstrated that she was achieving some balance and that whilst her academic studies were a central and highly significant part of her life they were not to the exclusion of all else. The Recorder&#8217;s conclusion that SH&#8217;s needs could be met under the regime that SH herself proposed, and which the Recorder adopted, were clearly well-rooted in the evidence. The Recorder&#8217;s conclusion that the Caseworker in her reports had failed really to recognise and reflect the fact that SH was an academic genius, which inevitably would lead to a departure from the sort of regime which might meet the needs of the average 12 year old, was justified, particularly when one takes account of the Caseworker&#8217;s evidence under crossexamination. I am therefore satisfied that the criticism of the Recorder&#8217;s evaluation of SH&#8217;s alleged need to have greater balance in her life is not supported. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>I have already addressed some of the arguments in relation to this above. It is correct that the father has been criticised by courts in the financial arena. Mr Turner submitted that no such criticisms had been made of him in the children arena and that the Recorder&#8217;s assessment of his character and evidence, as reflected in her judgment, was one she was entitled to reach, having seen and heard from him and having had the advantage of reading the two lever-arch files of evidence that were before the court. Having had the benefit of reading the transcript of the Caseworker&#8217;s evidence, in particular sections of cross-examination by Mr Turner, but also significant parts of the cross-examination by Ms Honeyman, the Recorder&#8217;s conclusion that the Caseworker&#8217;s evidence lacked balance seems to me to be unassailable. Both the inability to make good the deceptive or punitive or manipulative criticisms, or to have reflected more fully the valid criticisms that could be made of the mother, demonstrate a lack of balance. The Caseworker, having expressed the view that the father was relentless and continued making applications in relation to SH until he got what he wanted was one example where the Caseworker had misinterpreted the history. In reality the father had not appealed any of the orders in relation to SH, in contrast to the mother who had appealed several. This is simply one example of where the Caseworker demonstrably misinterpreted the history. Having reached that conclusion, the Recorder was fully justified to depart from the Caseworker&#8217;s recommendations and to give less weight to them and more weight to, in particular, SH&#8217;s views. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>The evidence before the Recorder demonstrated that since 2015 SH had continued to have a relationship with her mother, which she valued and from which she benefited. Whilst the shared care arrangements had plainly not been adhered to this is very far from a developing estrangement. The evidence suggests that the mother may have agreed, or at least not objected, to it for lengthy periods and was herself absent from the UK for lengthy periods.  From what SH said she valued her time with her mother but wished to limit it in order to prioritise her academic studies. Her enjoyment had also been undermined by the mother&#8217;s behaviour on various occasions, all of which appear to have been well-evidenced in terms of the impact on SH of them. The Recorder was entitled to assume that this sort of relationship would endure, given that was what SH said she wanted and given that it had occurred over the previous four years. The isolated reference to alienation in the Caseworker&#8217;s report appeared to be an aside and the reference to a change of residence, when explored by Ms Honeyman in cross-examination, appeared to have been ill thought through. The Recorder was therefore not faced with evidence which supported the likelihood of estrangement or of alienation. The history from 2015 to 2019 did not put this case into the category where there was a clear and obvious risk of the child becoming estranged from the mother. Nothing in what SH said about her feelings for her mother, and the value she placed on that relationship, supported such a conclusion. The absence of any weight being given to that risk in the judgment is therefore hardly a surprise. What has happened since does not of course support the mother&#8217;s case, as her own role would also fall to be considered.  </p>

It is inevitable that judges will know expert or professional witnesses but that does not mean they do not treat their evidence objectively.
