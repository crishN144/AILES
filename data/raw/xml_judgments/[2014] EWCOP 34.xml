They point out that the police investigation did not conclude until May 2013 and they were awaiting the conclusion of the police involvement. I do not accept that the police investigation dictated the pace of MKC&#8217;s investigation. It was incumbent on MKC to pursue and conclude their investigation as quickly as possible. Even if the police involvement did not conclude until May 2013, which is not accepted by the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> respondent, one questions why it took them until September 2013 to conclude their investigation, and then decide in February 2014 not to pursue the allegations any further.</p>
