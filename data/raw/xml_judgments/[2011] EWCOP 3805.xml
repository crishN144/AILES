The deputy engaged Countryside Letting Agents in late 2009 to manage and visit the house on a regular basis. He has acknowledged that there was no formal written agreement or contract with the agents, and that the arrangements were made by telephone and e-mail. It is not clear how significant this is in terms of liability for the losses and the negligence claim, but we are critical of the deputy in this respect as such informal arrangements do not seem to be good practice. &#8230;</p>

See attached photos at the appalling state of the property under the care of RC current deputy appointed by COP.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The breach of RC has meant that insurance which should have been in place has not been honoured. As a result EB has lost the benefit of the indemnity that she would have been entitled to under the policy if the conditions had been met. This would have entitled her to have the property fully repaired and reinstated at the cost of the insurance company. The loss therefore is the loss of the benefit of the policy indemnity &#8211; the chose in action. This has a clear monetary value in that EB should have had works done at someone else&#8217;s expense. She has lost a clear benefit with a financial value &#8211; the cost of the works. On any sale of the property in the future it would obviously be of benefit that the property be sold in a good condition rather than a wrecked condition. Its present condition will obviously, as a matter of common sense, affect its desirability in the market place and any sale will be achieved with more difficulty. The alternative option of letting the property has been irrevocably lost.</p>

It is not the proper forum to decide the issue of of what damage EB has suffered. Again because of the loss of the indemnity that she should have had under the policy in respect of chattels, she has suffered loss.</p>

He has ignored the advice of counsel instructed by him that there is a risk of a conflict of interest. It should be noted that the claimant submits that the evidence of Mr M as to the merits of the claim against RC by EB is flawed and incorrect.

Both sons are appalled at the way that the flood issue has been dealt with and RC&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the existence of an obvious disabling conflict of interest. Even prior to the flood the two sons were concerned about the lack of adequate consultation and the failure to take their views and preferences into account &#8211; e.g. in relation to the sale of the house. The position is now such that there is a complete and utter lack of trust and confidence in RC. It cannot be in EB&#8217;s best interests for such a situation of conflict to continue.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A provisional reading of those principles might be thought to sit rather uncomfortably with the concept of appointing deputies at all. Since the principle of appointing deputies is fundamental to this part of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, it must be appreciated that Section 16(4) has to be read in the context of the fact that, ordinarily, the court will appoint deputies where it feels confident that it can. It is perhaps important to take one step further back even than that, and for the court to remind itself that in a society structured as is ours, it is not the State, whether through the agency of an authority or the court, which is primarily responsible for individuals who are subjects or citizens of the State. It is for those who naturally have their care and wellbeing at heart, that is to say, members of the family, where they are willing and able to do so, to take first place in the care and upbringing, not only of children, but of those whose needs, because of disability, extend far into adulthood. It seems to me at least that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> ought to be read subject to that overriding policy aim. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;If Hedley J&#8217;s comments in paras 8 and 9 in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> were intended to indicate that family members should as a matter of course be appointed deputies irrespective of the circumstances, I would respectfully disagree. But I do not read his judgment in that way. The unusual facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> - the extraordinary gifts bestowed on P which enable him to have a career as a performer and earn significant sums of money - mean that many decisions will have to be taken about his personal welfare and property and affairs over and above the normal decision making involved in caring for a person who lacks capacity. Since it would be manifestly impracticable in those circumstances for the Court of Protection to make those decisions, the appointment of deputies was unavoidable and indeed desirable. As I read Hedley J&#8217;s judgment, this was agreed by all parties and the issue to be determined by the court was the identity of the deputies. The greater part of that judgment is devoted to the terms on which the deputies were to be appointed and, in particular, whether an independent deputy should be appointed in addition to members of the family. As I read Hedley J&#8217;s judgment, his comments about the importance of the family were directed more to the question of <span style="font-style:italic">who</span> should be appointed as deputy rather than the question of <span style="font-style:italic">whether</span> any deputy should be appointed at all. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is axiomatic that the family is the cornerstone of our society and a person who lacks capacity should wherever possible be cared for by members of his natural family, provided that such a course is in his best interests and assuming that they are able and willing to take on what is often an enormous and challenging task. That does not, however, justify the appointment of family members as deputies simply because they are able and willing to serve in that capacity. The words of section 16(4) are clear. They do not permit the court to appoint deputies simply because &#8220;it feels confident it can&#8221; but only when satisfied that the circumstances and the decisions which will fall to be taken will be more appropriately taken by a deputy or deputies rather than by a court, bearing in mind the principle that decisions by the courts are to be preferred to decisions by deputies. Even then, the appointment must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. It would be a misreading of the structure and policy of the statute, and a misunderstanding of the concept and role of deputies, to think it necessary to appoint family members to that position in order to enable them better to fulfil their role as carers for P.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very briefly, the facts in the <span style="font-style:italic">Holt</span> case were as follows. Michael Holt was born in 1956 and was a police officer. He married in 1979. In June 1986 he suffered traumatic brain damage in a diving accident during the course of his employment. In May 1991 his wife, Debbie Holt, applied for the appointment of the Protective Commissioner (who at that time was the &#8220;manager&#8221; or &#8220;deputy&#8221; of last resort in New South Wales) to manage his estate. Michael Holt&#8217;s mother, four brothers and sister were not notified of the application. The order was duly made. In December 1991 proceedings for personal injury were compromised in the sum of 1.95 million Australian dollars. In June 1992 Debbie Holt commenced divorce proceedings. Michael Holt&#8217;s siblings became concerned that the Protective Commissioner might settle the divorce on terms favorable to Debbie Holt and insufficiently attentive to Michael Holt&#8217;s interests. Two of the brothers, John (a chartered accountant) and Brian (an orthopedic surgeon) applied to be appointed as managers of Michael&#8217;s estate in place of the Protective Commissioner. In December 1992 Mr Justice Powell dismissed their application, holding that: &#8220;when, in a case where there is an installed manager, a person ... seeks to have the management of the protected person removed from the installed manager and vested in another, that person bears the onus of demonstrating a case for change, the grounds upon which such a change might be based being limited to either: (a) demonstrated incompetence or impropriety on the part of the installed manager; or (b) a clear and convincing demonstration that the form of management proposed would better advance the interests of the protected person than the existing management.&#8221;</p>

This is a sensible hierarchy of choices. In many estates of modest size it will be appropriate where there is no risk of conflict of interest and duty, and where a relationship of love or affection is established, to reflect in the statutory appointment the form of management which for millennia, in primitive societies as in civilised communities, has been followed when a family member is found to be incapable of managing his or her own affairs. It is normal then for the family to step in. The courts conserved their intervention to cases where there is no family or where no family are willing to act or for special reasons of incompetence or conflict of interest it is unsuitable to appoint a family member.

Other considerations that I have taken into account include EB&#8217;s age and life expectation (even if it were only the national average of about six years for a woman aged 85), her anticipated care costs, and the fact that, apart from a few pecuniary legacies, in her will dated 1 June 2005 she has left her residuary estate equally between her two sons. Naturally, totally different safeguarding considerations would apply if P were a young adult who had been awarded substantial damages for personal injury, which were intended to last his lifetime on the basis of an unimpaired life expectancy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the reasons why RC has safeguarding concerns is because of IB&#8217;s evasiveness and possible duplicity regarding the two accounts which are the subject of the second application. The co-mingling of funds tends to ring alarm bells because it is often &#8211; though not always &#8211; a sign of financial abuse.</p>

We understand that these monies were placed into joint names in or around 2005 but that this resulted from EB confirming her wish to gift these monies to our client, given that she had already made substantially larger payments to JB. We understand that, in order to reassure his mother of his best intentions towards her, our client indicated that, whilst he was happy to accept the gift, the money should perhaps be placed into joint names.&#8221;</p>

Mr O&#8217;Sullivan has stated in paragraph 20 of his skeleton argument that IB is prepared to pay one half of the balance on the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester account into a designated deputyship account. Accordingly, we are talking about a sum of, at most, &#163;33,500 and the legal costs that would be incurred by members of the Chancery bar conducting a full investigation of the status of the funds on this account would be disproportionate, bearing in mind that EB has overall assets in excess of &#163;1 million, and JB, who is a co-beneficiary with IB of EB&#8217;s residuary estate, seems to be content with his brother&#8217;s explanation. </p>

Faced with an extremely hostile application to remove him as the deputy, it was inevitable that he should seek to defend his reputation, and it would be unjust to penalise him as to costs. In considering the conduct of the parties generally, it is obvious that the family were extremely difficult clients for RC to deal with. Sometimes they were disingenuous. They were prone to exaggerate and, although they were trigger-happy in firing off complaints left, right and centre, their complaints were not always justified. For example, the Public Guardian&#8217;s report confirmed that allegations that RC had failed properly to consult EB&#8217;s sons with regard to the sale of the house were untrue, and IB&#8217;s intention to apply to the court to remove RC as deputy clearly predated the burst pipe incident, which in many respects was a red herring.</p>
