At that stage she understood she was around 7 or 8 years old.  She came on a flight from Uganda with her mother and father, and they all claimed asylum in the UK as refugees.  Her parents were from Somalia but the family lived in Kenya throughout her childhood.  She explained that her travel documents said that she was much older than she believed was her real age at the time.  She believed that she was travelling on documents for a 14 or 15 year old when she was only really aged about 8.  She also explained that her travel documents claimed she was born in Somalia, but this was wrong as she was born in Kenya.</span></p>

At this stage she says that she did not speak much English and tried the best that she could, but she found college very difficult.  At some point during her childhood the Mother was subject to a form of Female Genital Mutilation (&#8220;FGM&#8221;).  There is no medical evidence about precisely what form of injury was inflicted upon her but I accept that she was subject to FGM.  Sadly, the evidence is that FGM is part of the cultural norms of parts of the Somali community and that 98% of women in Somaliland have been subject to FGM.  The Mother has indefinite leave to remain (&#8220;ILR&#8221;) in the UK but has not applied for UK citizenship.  She does not have a British passport and, as I understand matters and as explained to me by counsel, she is presently not entitled to apply for a British Passport.</span></p>

She claims he neglected her during the marriage and left her with sole charge of the children for extended periods whilst he pursued relationships with other women.  I have not been asked to make findings about these matters and do not do so, but it is clear that the marriage was unhappy and there was a considerable level of tension between the couple.</span></p>

The children suffered from eczema and the Mother appears to have had difficulties in applying appropriate medication.  CA also suffers from asthma and it appears that the Mother found it challenging to manage this condition.  The children&#8217;s attendance at school also appears to have been intermittent.  The local authority became involved with the family and raised concerns that the children&#8217;s health needs were not being met by the Mother, that she was poorly supervising them, that the children were suffering harm as a result of domestic abuse between the parents and that the Mother was not engaging appropriately with professionals.  It is not necessary for the purposes of the present hearing to go into any detail about those matters save to say that there were no allegations that the Mother was doing anything deliberate to harm the children.  This was a sad case where, at that time, it became clear that she did not appear to have the ability to cope with the demands of parenting 3 small children.  </span></p>

These assessments concluded that the Mother&#8217;s overall thinking and reasoning abilities were limited to the extent that placed her at a level between about 1% and 3% of the population, although there was some uncertainty about this because her English was still limited.  The overall outcome was that the Mother&#8217;s cognitive abilities were in the borderline range for learning disabilities.  A positive parenting assessment was conducted in relation to the Father and he indicated a willingness to care for the children on a full time basis.  With the greatest reluctance, the Mother agreed to this plan and the care proceedings were concluded in August 2021 with (a) no order being made in the public law proceedings and (b) an order being made within private law proceedings that the children should live with the Father on a full-time basis and that the Mother should spent time with the children.  </span></p>

There is no suggestion that the care provided by the Father to his children during this time was lacking in any material respect.  It appears that he provided proper support to his children and also supported them to have a good relationship with the Mother.  Whatever other findings I make about the Father in this judgment, I readily acknowledge that he was a supportive and loving parent to the children during this period.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s case is that the Father said that the children had never seen their grandmother and he was anxious that they should be able to do so before she died.  The Mother was naturally anxious about allowing the children to visit Somaliland because she feared that, once the children were taken abroad, the Father might not return with them to the UK.</span></p>

Although the details of both parents have to be given on the application form, it is not normally necessary for both parents to join in making an application for a child&#8217;s passport.  Passports for children are generally issued for a 5 year period by UKPA.  The Mother&#8217;s case is that the Father told the Mother that she needed to sign her approval for the children to obtain renewal of their passports.  There is some evidence that the children had passports prior to the summer of 2022 because there is a reference in the local authority notes to the Father being handed expired passports when he took over care of the children as explained above.</span></p>

He was with a friend when both boys were arrested.  This incident clearly shocked the Mother and made her worried.  The Mother said that the Father tried to persuade her to allow the children to go on a holiday saying that the children needed to have a period in Somaliland in order to understand their own culture as this would give them a grounding and hopefully avoid this type of behaviour in the future.  The Mother was reluctant to allow the children to go on this trip but eventually agreed to the Father taking the children to Somaliland to see his mother and meet relatives.  But she insists that she only agreed for a visit for a period of about 3 months.  The plan, on the Mother&#8217;s case, was that the Father would take the children to Somaliland in August 2022 and return in October 2022.  By this stage the Mother says she had still not signed the passport consent form.</span></p>

She says she was distracted by the children when she did this and the Father knew that her reading was not very good.

First, there is no evidence from any other member of the extended family on either the Mother&#8217;s side or the Father&#8217;s side to confirm that they were aware of the Father&#8217;s plans to move permanently to Somaliland.  It would have been relatively straightforward for the Father to have sought corroborating evidence from relatives in this country or abroad who discussed this move with the Father before he left.  In my judgment, the absence of any supporting evidence from anyone else to confirm that they were informed about these plans by the Father has some significance.  Secondly, he referred to part of his plans involving finding new schools for the children in Somaliland.  However, he has disclosed no documents to suggest that he made any inquiries about schools before he left.  It later became clear that no arrangements were made for the children to attend schools in Somaliland until the Father had arrived in the country.  He said that he then found that the school he hoped to send his children to was full and the only option was to send the children to an Islamic school where they spent their whole time learning Arabic and the Koran.  That arrangement meant that the children have not progressed their education in any other subjects for the last academic year.</span></p>

My starting position was therefore that the responsibility for taking appropriate steps to secure permission for the Father to give evidence by video link lay with the Father&#8217;s solicitors and they had failed to take those steps. The Father&#8217;s solicitors only made a first approach to the FCDO to transmit the request to the Somali government on 24 July 2023, a few days before the final hearing.  That meant there was no practical opportunity for the Somali government to consider and respond before the hearing.  However, the situation here is unusual.  It was common round that &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; is a self-governing region within the country that is internationally recognised as part of the state of Somalia.  Somaliland has been separately governed from the rest of Somalia since 1991 but there is no international agreement on the governance of Somaliland.  There is no agreement between the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">de facto</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> government in Somaliland and the government of Somalia, which continues to claim Somaliland as part of Somalia.  As a result of the absence of internal agreement within Somalia, there are no diplomatic relations between London and Somaliland.  It is therefore unclear to me whether the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Agbabiaka</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> request should have been made to the Somali government or the de facto government in Somaliland but, whatever request ought to have been made, it was not transmitted in time for a decision to be make before this hearing.  </span></p>

It thus appeared that he had not taken any steps to try to get the child benefits stopped before or after he left the UK.  None of that evidence provides support for the Father&#8217;s case that this was a carefully planned permanent move away from the UK.</span></p>

He said that the children were excited about going to Somaliland to meet their relatives.  To that extent, there is common ground between the Mother and the Father.  However, when he was asked whether the children had ever been asked if they wanted to move to Somaliland on a permanent basis, he was only able to say that they had agreed but could not offer any detail to support that evidence except at a very high level of generality.  It seems to me that these were children who had lived in the UK all of their lives.  If they had been asked about a potential move to Somaliland with the consequence that they would be cutting themselves off from their friends and family in the UK, it seems to me inevitable that they would have had numerous questions.  They would have asked why the Father wanted the children to move to Somaliland, where they would be living, what type of education they would get there and crucially whether they would continue to see their mother and London friends once they moved abroad.  They would ask what type of future they would have in Somaliland since, even a basic internet search would have shown that they were moving from a developed western country to a very poor country.  The children may not have appreciated the full significance of the fact that this was a country with the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">fourth lowest GDP per capita in the world but any 12 year old in the UK who could access the internet would have been easily able to establish that Somaliland was a very poor country.  It seems to me that, if the children had been asked about their views about moving to </span><span class="hgkelc" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Somaliland on a permanent basis, they would have asked numerous questions of the Father and would have raised those issues with the Mother.  It seems inevitable that they would have been concerned about cutting themselves off from their family in the UK, their friends and their lives in London and all those issues would have been raised.  Hence, whilst I can entirely understand the Mother&#8217;s evidence that the children were excited to be going to Somaliland on an extended holiday, I find it difficult to accept that they would have agreed to going on a permanent basis unless there had been very extensive discussions in the family about whether this was a good thing.</span></p>

No challenge was made by counsel for the Father to the Mother about this part of her evidence during cross-examination.  Thus, at the end of her evidence, the position appeared to be that the Father&#8217;s case was that the Mother had consented to the children moving permanently to Somaliland, but the children thought they were going on an extended holiday.   Thus, the Father&#8217;s case thus appeared to be that he did not challenge the fact that the children were tricked into leaving the UK on a false basis.   He challenged the Mother&#8217;s case that she had been tricked into agreeing for her children to move abroad but not that the children had been misled.  If it was the Father&#8217;s case all along that the children knew that they were moving on a permanent basis to Somaliland, that they had discussed this plan with their parents and the plans had been agreed with the children, that ought to have been a central challenge to the Mother&#8217;s evidence.  There was no such challenge, and that substantially weakens the Father&#8217;s position on this point.  Having heard the evidence of both the Father and the Mother, I am fully satisfied that the Mother has proved her case that the children thought that they were going to Somaliland on an extended holiday.  I do not accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that the children knew in advance that the plan was for them permanently to relocate to Somaliland.  </span></p>

There are a number of aspects of this dispute which are less than satisfactory.  First, the Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she did not sign the Passport Consent Form and was told by the Father that her consent was needed because the UK Passports Agency would not release the passports without her consent.  There is no evidence from UKPA that UKPA ever imposed such a condition.  If the Father made that statement to the Mother, it seems to me highly unlikely that it was true because, on his case, he had the children&#8217;s passports by the time of the meeting at McDonalds.</span></p>

However, when the Father gave evidence a different picture emerged and he claimed that the Mother had signed the Passport Consent Form.  However, no signed Passport Consent Form was put in evidence and there is no good explanation of the lack of challenge to the Mother&#8217;s evidence that she had not signed the form.  All that has led me to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Mother never signed the Passport Consent Form.

There is no dispute that the Father provided her with this form to sign.  He says that she read the form but the evidence in this case is that the Mother&#8217;s literary abilities were substantially limited and I accept that she did not read it.  The Father was unable to say clearly whether he had explained what the form said or that he had read the form to her.  His case was that this form represented the agreement which had already been reached between them but, as I noted above, his evidence on this aspect of the case was far from satisfactory.  Having heard both the Father and the Mother give evidence on this point and having very carefully taken note of all of the points made by both counsel in their skeleton arguments and in oral submissions, I have no hesitation in saying that I prefer the evidence of the Mother.  I cannot accept that the Mother would have agreed to her children relocating to live with the Father on a permanent basis in Somaliland when this was not discussed and agreed with the children and when she knew that she had no passport and so could not visit them there.  I do not accept that she would knowingly have signed a form saying that she would be visiting the children in Somaliland when she knew that, without a passport, this would not be possible.  </span></p>

She said that he reports being worried for CA as she is young and girls are married off at a very young age in Somaliland.  She said he is worried about when he will come home and feels that all his dreams have been crushed and feels that he cannot trust either his Mother or his Father.  The Mother also said that BA had spoken to her of killing himself.   He explained that he was going to an Islamic school and the only things he learned were Arabic and the Koran, and he was worried about being behind with his schooling if he returned to England.  He said he had tried playing football with other boys but was made fun of because he could not speak Somali and the other children called him names.

I see a problem with that evidence because the Father has not explained why he thinks it is better for them to be brought up in an exceptionally poor country with the limited life opportunities that Somaliland offers to the children as opposed to being brought up in London with all the opportunities of living in an advanced western democracy.  The Father has never explained why he decided to move to Somaliland, what job he is doing in Somaliland or what the benefit would be for his children in Somaliland as opposed to living in London.  His view appears to have been that, having made this decision, the only real options for the children were living with him in Somaliland or being in foster care in London and being with him was the better of those options.   I do not accept that the options are as stark as the Father suggests because it is 3 years since the local authority last looked at the Mother&#8217;s parenting abilities and the children are now 3 years older.  Hence it is unclear what view the Local Authority will take in 2023 as to whether it would be appropriate to seek care orders for the children if they were to return to live with the Mother.

However, that principle is not the same as saying that the Treaty cannot set up rules which all contracting states agree to apply in their own courts, regardless as to whether the rules are to be applied in a case which solely involves contracting states or involves a contracting state and a non-contracting state.  It is entirely possible that a treaty is intended to set up a set of rules that all contracting states agree to apply to a specific issue in their own courts regardless as to whether the facts of a case relate solely to circumstances engaging another contracting state or circumstances engaging a state that is not a party to the treaty.  The Hague Convention has provisions which are to be applied by all contracting states where a child has been wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained, regardless as to whether that wrongful removal or retention is to a contracting state or a non-contracting state:  see articles 11(3) and 12(3).  Thus at least part of the Hague Convention sets up a system of legal rules that have to be followed by all contracting states in circumstances where a child is wrongfully removed or retained in a non-contracting country.</span></p>

Indeed, that provision does not deal with such a situation. It follows that, in those circumstances, the rule laid down in article 10 of that Regulation, whereby it is possible to set aside the jurisdiction which could be claimed, on the basis of the general ground, by the courts of the member state where the new habitual residence has been acquired, loses its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre, and there is not, therefore, any reason to apply it.

Thus, the court concluded that the rule in article 8(2) which extends jurisdiction can only apply as between member states who are all bound by the terms of the Regulation and not between a member state and a non-member state since the latter state is not bound by the terms of the Regulation.  </span></p>

However applying the more literal approach seen in Re H, which was subsequently referred to by the Supreme Court without disapproval suggests that Article 7 should be applied according to a literal reading of the words. On that basis it would apply to any other state. However for reasons which will become apparent I have concluded that Article 7 would not apply to retain jurisdiction in this case for other reasons and so my conclusions on this are not central to the outcome of this decision&#8221;</span></p>

The focus must therefore be on the first reason, as set out at paragraph 46 of the decision.  The reasoning in that paragraph is, in summary, that once a child has become habitually resident in a non-member state, article 8(1) of the Regulation ceases to apply and that the jurisdiction extension rule under article 10 does not apply because that rule is confined to rules between Member States who are all parties to the Regulation.  Thus Regulation 10 is to be treated an internal rule between Members States.  The reasoning is that it only applies to allocate jurisdiction between Member States and has no application in a case where a third state is involved because that third state is not bound by the terms of the Regulation.  Looked at in that way, it seems to me that, in order to understand whether the same reasoning applies in the case of article 7 of the Hague Convention, it is right to ask whether the Hague Convention and the wording of article 7(1) in particular was intended to apply to child abductions solely between contracting states or was intended to set rules that had to be applied by contracting states regardless as to whether the state where the child had been wrongfully removed or retained was a contracting state or a non-contracting state.  I have already referred above to parts of the Hague Convention that clearly set rules that have to be applied by a contracting state regardless as to whether the child has been taken to a contracting state or a non-contracting state.  The question is whether article 7 should be interpreted differently.  </span></p>

This text permits the requested authority not to order the return of the child where the proceedings for return have only been commenced after the expiration of a period of one year and it is demonstrated that the child is settled in its new environment. The discordance arises from the fact that, in the Convention of 25 October 1980, the period of one year starts with the removal or retention, while in the new Convention, as indicated above, this point of departure is later. Therefore, one cannot eliminate the hypothesis in which the authorities of the State to which the child has been removed or in which the child has been retained are not bound to order the return of the child &#8211; which might make one think that the child&#8217;s habitual residence has been transferred to that State and that its authorities have acquired jurisdiction, in any case under Article 5 of the 1961 Convention, to take measures of protection and decide in particular on custody and rights of access &#8211; while this jurisdiction over protection would still belong, under the new Convention, to the authorities of the State in which the child had his or her habitual residence immediately before the wrongful removal or retention. If, in this hypothesis, the authorities of this latter State, which have jurisdiction under Article 7 of the new Convention, decide to change the custody rights, it seems that the authorities of the State to which the child has been wrongfully removed will have to recognise and enforce this decision in accordance with Articles 23 et seq. of the new Convention.  But if this State is not a Party to the new Convention and is a Party only to that of 25 October 1980 (or even to the Convention of 5 October 1961), it will not be bound to recognise this decision; and it may, it seems, consider itself alone to have jurisdiction&#8221;</span></p>

There are occasions when the text uses the word &#8220;Contracting State&#8221; and other occasions when it uses &#8220;non-Contracting State&#8221;.  It thus seems to me that where the text uses the word &#8220;state&#8221;, it should be interpreted as encompassing both a contracting state and a non-contracting state unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.  In contrast to the words of the EU Regulation 10, there is nothing in article 7 of the Hague Convention which limits its application to a child which has been unlawfully retained in a contracting state.  Applying that approach which is consistent with the Lagarde Report, in my judgment the High Court is required to apply the rules in article 7 because it covers a child which has been taken to any other state, regardless as to whether that state is a contracting state or not.</span></p>

I thus find it difficult to envisage any policy justification for limiting the powers of the courts in contracting states to take action to protect children when they are wrongly taken from one country with agreed standards to another that has no such agreed standards in breach of the rights of the other parent.  </span></p>

Doing the best I can on the evidence available to me, the position is that the children appear to be living in a house where they rarely go out save to go to school.  They appear to have few friends outside the house and little if any wider social interaction with people in Somaliland.  There is no reliable information that they have interacted regularly with other members of the Father&#8217;s family apart from his Mother who has moved from Ethiopia to live in Somaliland in this property.  The only reference in the evidence to the children having interaction with other children is to BA playing football with local children and this appears to have been an alienating rather than bonding experience for him.</span></p>

Their network of friends does not appear to have changed between the date when they left the UK and today but what has changed is their ability to take part in the lives of their friends in any way other than through social media.  I accept that they cannot speak the local language of Somali at anything other than at a basic level and have limited opportunities to interact with local people as a result.  It appears clear from the text messages and the Mother&#8217;s evidence that the children still see their home as being in London and are anxious to return home.</span></p>

They have been required to remain in Somaliland against their wishes and the focus of their lives remains on their lives in London as opposed to being focused on their lives in Somaliland.  I am not satisfied that their new situation in Somaliland has any real features of stability for the children.  They know hardly anyone in Somaliland apart from their Father and his Mother, do not have settled schools and do not speak the local language.  Based on the limited information available to me, their emotional ties appear to remain firmly linked to their Mother and their friends in London based on a desire to return and, no doubt, a failure on the part of the children to understand why they cannot return.  In my judgment I do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that these ties have been replaced by ties in Somaliland.  I thus conclude that, as a matter of fact, the necessary degree of integration required for the children to acquire habitual residence in Somaliland has not been established and these children remain habitually resident in the UK both today and in May 2023.</span></p>

The evidence in this case is that the Father is opposed to FGM but 98% of women in Somaliland experience a form of FGM.  In a culture where the application of this practice is virtually uniform, it is far from clear to me that CA would be safe from being subjected to this vile procedure even if the Father remains opposed.   I also accept that it is the culture for children to be subject to arranged marriages and for the children to have very little say in the matter.  The Mother explained her concerns when she said that &#8220;the men&#8221; in Somaliland make all the decisions.  It is not clear to me whether that is wholly correct because senior woman also appear to be important figures in the culture as was the case for her.  It is clear that marriage decisions were made in her case without her having a real choice in the matter and I accept that the same issue may arise if these children stay in Somaliland.  There is thus a real danger that the Father will come under pressure to ensure that CA will enter into an arranged marriage once she reaches puberty.  I accept that the Father&#8217;s present position is that he would not allow that to happen.  I also I accept that the Father is devoted to his children and is doing what he considers to be best for them, but given the wider cultural environment there remains a significant risk that CA will be forced into an early arranged marriage if the children remain in Somaliland.  </span></p>

If the children are returned, the Mother has arranged for her sister to come to live with her and to support her in looking after the children.  The relevant London Borough have told the court that, if the children return, they will undertake a fresh assessment.  I acknowledge the Father&#8217;s fears that, if the children return to London, they will end up in foster care.  The Father also relies on the fact that the Mother has not until very recently engaged with therapy and support to assist her to learn parenting skills.  However, she explained that she is presently seeking support and may well now have a very different attitude to engaging with social services than she had in 2020.  </span></p>

I am grateful for the explicit acknowledgment that the Father made in evidence when he assured me that, if this court makes a return order, he will comply with the order.  I accept that, once he made the decision to move to live in Somaliland, he felt he was doing what was best for his children in requiring them to live with him.  I hope that he will accept that, however he hoped things would work out once the family arrived in Somaliland, the children have been there for some time and are not settled.  The evidence in this case makes it very clear that the children want to return to live in the UK.  It is, of course, a matter for the Father as to whether he takes the decision that he will return to the UK.  I accept that his present position is that he does not wish to return to live in the UK but I also accept that he is entitled to change his mind and return to live here.  If he does so, there will be a difficult question to examine as to whether the children should continue to reside with him, as they did prior to August 2022, or live with the Mother and her sister.  I express no views about that issue because, at present, the Father has indicated his intention to remain in Somaliland.  Whilst I respect that decision, I trust he will abide by his promise to the court and will co-operate in making arrangements for the immediate return of the children.</span></p>
