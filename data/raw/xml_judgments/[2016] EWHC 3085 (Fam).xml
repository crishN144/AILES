It was during this visit that my sister gave N into our care. I already knew that my sister was struggling with having another child. The pregnancy was unplanned and she was not happy to be pregnant. The difficulties with her husband were escalating and she spoke to me about not being able to care for another baby. I tried to help her and I would give her money when I could but her husband was never going to change.</p>

She was crying about her situation and clearly in trouble. Again, I tried to reassure her that were there for her and for the baby. My sister then handed N to me, and she said to me &#8220;this is your child&#8221;. From that moment, I have treated N as my own. I told my sister then that we would take all responsibility for her and when she was placed in my hand that day she became our daughter. We were both very emotional, knowing what an important decision this was for both of us. I felt overwhelming joy and great sadness for my sister. I know that my sister was also sad but relieved to be spared a responsibility she could not undertake. From that point onwards N has been our daughter. I have supported N. S and I had joint responsibility for her ever since this date until his death, when I have taken over sole responsibility for her. She has been brought up knowing me as her mother and S as her father. I have provided everything emotionally and materially for her. Everyone understands, including N, that we are her parents.</p>

It was very emotional for all of us. Girl children often miss out in India and PM said that she wanted N to have an education and not to have to struggle for her education, food, home, security and everything. We would all have helped PM to keep and support N.  She was clear that she made this decision and wanted [the applicant] and S to be N&#8217;s parents.

My sister and her husband, my brother and his wife, and my cousin&#8217;s brother (now deceased) all attended the ceremony at our home. Afterwards we had a meal at the home to celebrate. The Priest stayed for the meal and my sister hugged me and told me that N is my legal daughter and she needed to concentrate on her son who was going the same bad way as her husband. She looked happy. My daughter was with me all the time; she kept asking me whether she could now travel with me so that we could live together. I told her that she could not come now, but that we would be together later. My sister had to go back to her home in the village and she left that night with her husband.&#8221;</p>

We were taken into a room and my lawyer started off by speaking to the registrar to explain why we were there. The registrar confirmed whether my sister and her husband consented to the adoption and to make sure that they understood the effect of the adoption &#8211; that they were no longer her parents, that all their rights as parents were removed and that I was now N&#8217;s sole parent. He spoke to them to ensure that they were happy to give N in adoption to me. My sister and brother in law both answered that they were, and my sister said that she had given N to me when she was 8 months old and that I was her mother from that time. She said that she understood that she had no role as a mother to N. N&#8217;s father agreed but did not say anything more. The circumstances and reasons for giving N to me were mentioned: that my sister was struggling and not supported to bring up a girl and that she had a son to support, that I was childless lonely and depressed and that my sister had a lot of difficulties and could not look after N.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The registrar then asked me questions about my care of N and my circumstances. I told him that I send money for N and make decisions about her welfare, that my brother attends school meetings on my behalf and tells me all about her progress and I spoke about my close contact, the time I live with her and that I call every day. I was asked whether I will look after N for the rest of my life as my whole and sole responsibility. I said that I would. The registrar was told about the death of my husband, N&#8217;s close attachment to him and that I would not have any more children. I gave an account of my circumstances in the UK and said that I work for the British government in a hospital and that I have my own house with a mortgage and no dependents. I showed proof of my residence status in England and my old passports, also letters from the hospital that confirmed where I worked and my earning capacity.  I showed the Registrar the letter that I had from the hospital. The registrar also asked me questions about my medical circumstances and support network in England. I said that I was healthy and that if I had any problems I had family in Preston, Bolton and Coventry who I or N could go to. I showed my husband&#8217;s death certificate, my birth certificate, my sister&#8217;s marriage certificate.&#8221;</p>

The second method of adoption is to conduct the proceedings according to religion based personal laws. Both these sets of Acts, Rules and procedures are equally valid in India and so a person can choose to adopt under the procedures of either of these two sets of laws.</p>

The birth certificate itself records the change in parentage. This is correct and in keeping with the procedure regarding the re-registration of birth certificates after adoptions. As per procedure the original birth certificate should have been sealed and kept away but since all parties are aware of the adoption its presence in the bundle is not an issue. All these actions are in conformity with the guidelines on the registration of birth certificates sent to the State Registrars by the Registrar General of India in 1999 in order to enable the recording of adoptions and protect the privacy of the persons involved. The state government machinery would not record, register and go to the extent of changing a birth certificate if the slightest doubt existed as to the validity of the adoption.&#8221;</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The adoption of N by [the applicant] is a valid and final adoption as the Karnataka High Court has recognised adoptions amongst the Christian communities of the state. The procedure as accepted by state authorities with regard to such adoptions has been followed. Various state departments have been involved in examining whether a valid adoption existed, the giving and the taking of a child in adoption is recorded in a very detailed deed once the registrar has been satisfied that the adoption was intended to have its full consequences. The fact that the registrar went into the details of the procedure and ensured that all the pre requisites of an adoption had been fulfilled and that the parties were willing and capable of accepting the consequences of the adoption is very important. If there had been any doubt as to the validity or the capacity of any of the parties to undertake this adoption, the registrar would not have accepted and registered the deed especially keeping in mind the primacy of the concept of best interests of the child. Thereafter, various other governmental agencies have satisfied themselves with regard to the bona fide nature of the adoption. These in depth and detailed investigations are especially important in customary adoptions as they serve to ensure that the adopting parents are capable of fulfilling their responsibilities upon adoption and also that the adoption was done with the consent of all parties involved. This deed document has been properly registered as per the Stamp Act. On the basis of these investigations and records, the birth certificate itself has been changed. The birth certificate with the names of the adopting parents has been issued by the appropriate governmental authority recognising the rights of the adopting parents and the relation between the child and its adopting parents. In addition to the state machinery, the community has participated in the ceremony and the religious sanction is evidenced by the presence of the Priest at the ceremony. This above all confirms a final and valid adoption. In addition the child was given in adoption by the birth parents sometime in 1999, which was before the JJ Act even came into force in 2000 and much before the 2006 amendment creating rules for adoption. Therefore, it is clear that this is a valid and recognised adoption as per the laws of India currently in force.&#8221;</p>

When I was there N lived with me, sleeping in our room with us and spending all our time together. It was wonderful to have her in my life and to be called mummy. I loved every moment that I had with her; I remember that I would make chapattis whilst she crawled around and played, hiding from me and laughing. And then as she grew older I chose her clothes, her school, kept close touch with her teachers, knew everything she did at school, supervised her homework by phone and talked with her about her friends and everything that was going on. She told me everything and confided in me. We are very very close.&#8221;</p>

[The applicant] made all the financial arrangements for N and sent us money every month.  Since we didn&#8217;t have any girl child we took good care of our niece. In time she went to school with my son and we loved her very much. [The applicant] and her husband used to visit us in Bellary twice a year. N used to stay with them in their room in our house during their holidays. [The applicant] loved taking care of her daughter during their visits. Both of them used to treat N with great love. N loved them as well and she used to call them her mum and dad. We did not think to tell N about her adoption. Parents think these matters are not ones to discuss with children. N came to know of her adoption when she was about 13. After the death of S, [the applicant] returned to her work in [the] UK in October 2011 and said she cannot stay alone in the UK and will take N with her. As per the suggestion made by the lawyer, we told N that she would be legally adopted so that she could go to the UK and explained everything to her about her consequences.

The Entry Clearance Officer considered that the adoption is one of choice rather than necessity and that there is no apparent transfer of parental responsibility from the appellant&#8217;s biological parents to the United Kingdom sponsor. It is common ground that the appellant&#8217;s biological parents are alive and well and living in India. It is also common ground that the sponsor legally and formally adopted the appellant in India on 29 October 2011.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; In considering the evidence as a whole and on a balance of probabilities, I do not find that the appellant&#8217;s biological parents are unable to care for her. Nor do I find that the appellant has been informally adopted by the sponsor when she was young. I find that the official adoption was to facilitate the appellant&#8217;s entry to the United Kingdom. I find that the appellant is being well cared for both by her maternal uncle and by her parents. I find that they spend time both at the appellant&#8217;s maternal uncle&#8217;s house but also in the village. I find that the sponsor undoubtedly loves the appellant especially since she has no children of her own and is now a widow. She gave evidence that tragically she has no children and suffered a number of miscarriages during her marriage. In conclusion I find that the appellant does not meet all the requirements of paragraph 310 of the Immigration Rules HC 395. I find that there has not been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility to the adoptive parent.&#8221; </p>

He also suggests that as a general rule, in order to surmount the permission hurdle it should be necessary to show &#8216;something exceptional,&#8217; something over and above ordinary welfare arguments. That, Mr Greatorex urges, should be the proper approach when the court is considering whether to sanction an application which does not comply with the residence arrangements contained within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 42(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> as well as the requirements of the Immigration Rules. </p>

First, I see no proper basis for further refinements to readily understandable and appropriately workable guidance. Secondly, as a matter of judicial precedent, as a puisne judge, I am bound to apply the legal principles laid down by the Court of Appeal. </p>

A myriad of differing features will be of potential relevance whenever an application of this kind is confronted. Each and every case will turn on its own unique facts. In some instances there will be an extremely sound and realistic basis for exercising discretion so as to grant leave.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I interpolate at this point to explain why I made these rather unusual directions. While recognition of the Indian adoption might confer on N certain benefits and advantages under the Immigration Rules, it would <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>confer citizenship. An adoption order made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>have that effect, but only if the person being adopted is a minor (in other words under the age of 18) when the adoption order is made: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1(5)</ref> and 1(5A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61" uk:canonical="1981 c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">British Nationality Act 1981</ref>, as amended by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. So any adoption order, if it was to have this effect for N, had to be made before her eighteenth birthday on 4 December 2016. On the other hand, the applicant could not apply for an adoption order until the expiration of the period of three months referred to in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/44/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(3)</ref> &#8211; which at the earliest would be in early August 2016. To avoid any risk of the application for the adoption order being stultified by delays after it had been issued, it was, in my judgment, appropriate to make anticipatory directions.</p>

This is a non-agency adoption application and the local authority have completed an Annex A which supports the application made. No safeguarding concerns have been raised. I consider that the making of an Adoption Order is better for N than not doing so, given her primary attachment to the applicant and the negative impact it would have on her emotional well-being if it were not to be granted.&#8221;</p>

Her cross-examination by Mr Greatorex was directed in large part to three matters: first, to attempting to demonstrate the limited role in N&#8217;s life that the applicant had played prior to October 2011, and indeed thereafter until N arrived in this country in December 2015; secondly, to attempting to demonstrate that the applicant was primarily motivated by her wish to enable N to enter this country to be educated here and, by means of adoption, to become a citizen of this country; and, thirdly, to attempting to demonstrate that the applicant had been permanently settled here since 2003, or shortly thereafter, and was therefore no longer domiciled in India in October 2011.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Greatorex managed to make some headway in relation to the last point, demonstrating the roots the applicant had put down in this county well before 2011. And he somewhat dented the applicant&#8217;s credibility when she insisted that the assertion in her witness statement in the immigration proceedings that she and N &#8220;keep in touch <span style="font-style:italic">every</span> day and I speak to her <span style="font-style:italic">at least 3 times a day</span>&#8221; (emphasis added) was the literal truth. Yet the reality, at the end of the day, as I assess what she did or did not say in the witness box, is that the applicant&#8217;s case, as she had set it out in the various passages in her witness statements which I have quoted above, survived intact in all its essentials. In all its essentials I accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence. Even taking N&#8217;s interviews at their highest against the applicant, they do not, in my judgment, impact significantly upon either the applicant&#8217;s credibility as a witness or her reliability as a historian. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant sought to bolster her case by producing a list, running to 190 pages, of all the telephone calls she had made between 8 July 2013 and 16 December 2015, marked up to identify the very large number of calls she said she had made to N. An analysis of the records for the first six months undertaken by Mr Greatorex demonstrated, he said, (a) that during the period from 8 July 2013 to 31 July 2013 there were 13 days when there were only one or two calls a day, rather than the 3 claimed by the applicant, and (b) that during the first six months there were 23 days when there were no calls at all. The applicant&#8217;s telling riposte to the latter point was that 15 of these days &#8211; 18 October 2013 to 1 November 2013 &#8211; were during a period when the applicant was in fact in India with N (see paragraph 17 above). I was not provided with any further analysis of this material. What in my judgment, it demonstrated was that although the applicant was over-egging the pudding when in cross-examination she maintained her stance that she had spoken to N <span style="font-style:italic">every </span>day at least <span style="font-style:italic">3 times</span>, she was nonetheless speaking to her most days and often 2 or 3 times a day. At the end of the day, nothing, in my judgment, turns on this comparatively modest gap between the rhetoric and the reality.    </p>

Dyson LJ has set out the details and I need not rehearse them again. I merely add this comment, that these parents&#8217; practical involvement &#8211; never mind their emotional involvement &#8211; with their son is at least as great as that which characterised those many English officers of the Indian Army or the Government of India and their wives who, in the days of the Raj, left their infant child to be brought up in this country by some aunt before sending him off at an early age to boarding school, seeing him only at infrequent intervals when on furlough. There are many children who even in contemporary Britain for one reason or another see their parents only infrequently. We must be cautious before setting too high a benchmark for the existence of family life, certainly where there is the constancy and commitment which these parents have shown to a boy who is emotionally and psychologically their son.&#8221;</p>

Positioned at the date of death in February 2003 the court must look back at the whole of the deceased&#8217;s life, at what he had done with his life, at what life had done to him and at what were his inferred intentions in order to decide whether he had acquired a domicile of choice in England by the date of his death.

The issue in this case related to the right to share in the estate of an intestate who had died domiciled in England. The deceased&#8217;s next of kin for the purposes of the Statute of Distributions 1670 were the children of her two deceased brothers. The dispute was as to which of the five children of the deceased&#8217;s brother, LG, were &#8220;children&#8221; of his within the meaning of section 7 of the Statute. The question arose in this way. LG had three illegitimate children in England, where he was then domiciled, by CS. Subsequently LG and CS went to Holland, where LG acquired a domicile of choice. While there he had a fourth illegitimate child by CS, HP. Subsequently, and while still in Holland, LG married CS. English law did not at that time<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Accordingly, all four previously born children became legitimate according to the law of Holland. Following the marriage, LG and CS had a fifth child, AD. It was accepted that the three older children had no claim, LG having been at the dates of their births domiciled in England and English law, as I have said, not recognising the doctrine of legitimation by subsequent marriage. The question was whether AD alone inherited or whether HP was also entitled. </p>

This is a doubtless correct, but the question is, who are by the law of England recognised as legitimate.  It was urged in support of the decision of the Master of the Rolls that the law of England recognises as legitimate those children only who are born in wedlock. This is correct as regards the children of persons who at the time of the children&#8217;s birth are domiciled in England.

There is, of course, no doubt as to what the English Law as to an English child is. We have in this country form all time refused to recognise legitimation of issue by the subsequent marriage of the parents, and possibly our peculiarity in this respect may deserve all that was said in its favour by Professor, afterwards Mr Justice Blackstone, the somewhat indiscriminate eulogist of every peculiarity and anomaly in our system of laws. But the question is, What is the rule which the English law adopts and applies to a non-English child? This is a question of international comity and international law. According to that law as recognised, and that comity as practised, in all other civilized communities, the status of a person, his legitimacy or illegitimacy, is to be determined everywhere by the law of the country of his origin &#8211; the law under which he was born &#8230; The family relation is at the foundation of all society, and it would appear almost an axiom that the family relation, once duly constituted by the law of any civilized country, should be respected and acknowledged by every other member of the great community of nations.&#8221;</p>

Alastair was the life tenant under the settlement. The question arose, following his death in 1962, in this way. Alastair was at all material times domiciled in Southern Rhodesia. He and his wife had a son, S, in 1936. They adopted a child, C, by court order in South Africa in 1939 and another child, T, also by court order in South Africa in 1944. The question was whether the trust fund devolved on S or equally on S, C and T. Pennycuick J, treating the law of Alastair&#8217;s domicile as decisive, held that C and T were not his children for the purpose of the settlement.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Apart from international comity, we reach the same result on principle. When a court of any country makes an adoption order for an infant child, it does two things: (1) it destroys the legal relationship theretofore existing between the child and its natural parents, be it legitimate or illegitimate; (2) it creates the legal relationship of parent and child between the child and its adopting parents, making it their legitimate child. It creates a new status in both, namely, the status of parent and child. Now it has long been settled that questions affecting status are determined by the law of the domicile. This new status of parent and child, in order to be recognised everywhere, must be validly created by the law of the domicile of the adopting parent. You do not look to the domicile of the child: for that has no separate domicile of its own. It takes its parents&#8217; domicile. You look to the parents&#8217; domicile only. If you find that a legitimate relationship of parent and child has been validly created by the law of the parents&#8217; domicile at the time the relationship is created, then the status so created should be universally recognised throughout the civilised world, provided always that there is nothing contrary to public policy in so recognising it &#8230; But it is an essential feature of this principle that the parents should be domiciled in the country at the time: for no provision of the law of a foreign country will be regarded in the English courts as effective to create the status of a parent in a person not domiciled in that country at the time &#8230; I ought to say, however, that in order for adoption to be recognised everywhere, it seems to me that, in addition to the adopting parents being domiciled in the country where the order is made, the child should be ordinarily resident there: for it is the courts of ordinary residence which have the pre-eminent jurisdiction over the child: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re P (GE) (An Infant)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1965] Ch 568" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1965">[1965] Ch 568</ref>, 585 &#8230; The child is under their protection and it would seem only right that those courts should be the courts to decide whether the child should be adopted or not.</p>

Our law, however, develops in accordance with the changing needs of man. These have always been ascertained by experience rather than by the rigid application of abstract theory. Experience has shown that there are sound sociological reasons for recognising an adoption in circumstances such as these. Adoption &#8211; providing that there are proper safeguards &#8211; is greatly for the benefit of the adopted child and of the adoptive parents, and also, I think, of civilised society, since this is founded on the family relationship.

On a straight-forward reading of the judgements there are, as it seems to me, four, and only four, strands in the majority&#8217;s reasoning: first, the adoptive parents must have been domiciled in the foreign country at the time of the foreign adoption; second, there must be proof of the relevant foreign law, demonstrating that the child has been legally adopted in accordance with the requirements of the foreign law; third, the foreign adoption must in substance have the same essential characteristics as an English adoption; and, fourth, there must be no reason in public policy for refusing recognition. The first, second and fourth of these require no elaboration. The third is not spelt out explicitly but is, as it seems to me, implicit in Lord Denning&#8217;s description, in the passage quoted in paragraph 67 above, of what the foreign court is doing when it makes an adoption order. It was subsequently made explicit in the judgment of Johnson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Foreign Adoption: Consent) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 534" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 534</ref>, where he refused recognition of a Paraguayan &#8216;simple&#8217; adoption which, in contrast to a Paraguayan &#8216;full&#8217; adoption, maintained a link between the child and his or her biological parent and was, in certain circumstances, revocable.</p>

Thus, in his summary (840-841) of the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/29" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption of Children Act 1926</ref>, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/14/26" uk:canonical="1950 (14 Geo. 6) c. 26" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1950</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/5" uk:canonical="1958 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1958</ref> he makes no reference at all to, respectively, sections 3(b), 5(1)(b) and 7(1)(b) of those Acts, the predecessors to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> and to what is now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. Nor do I read his judgment as requiring that the <span style="font-style:italic">process</span> by which the foreign adoption was obtained should contain the same or similar safeguards as English adoption law would require. Read in context, his comment, set out in paragraph 67 above, about a foreign adoption &#8220;constituted in another country in similar circumstances as we claim for ourselves,&#8221; is a reference to substance and not to process. The natural reading of the passage, set out in paragraph 71 above, where he comments on Salmon LJ&#8217;s alternative view, is that he is describing what might be a <span style="font-style:italic">sufficient</span> condition if Salmon LJ is correct, not what is on his own analysis a further <span style="font-style:italic">necessary </span>condition. So, as I read Lord Denning&#8217;s analysis, whereas similarity as to the <span style="font-style:italic">substance </span>is essential to recognition, similarity in <span style="font-style:italic">safeguards </span>is not.</p>

He pointed out that since the adoption order had been made on the application of English adopters, that order raised questions of status under English law, whereas the abandonment order was in no way concerned with the English adopters or any question of status in regard to them.

It involved only Romanian persons and English law <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> recognise and give legal effect to it. The important part of this Order for present purposes is that under Article 4 of the Law 47/1993 the exercise of parental rights was granted to the orphanage. From the translation of this law before me, it appears that this extinguished the parental rights of the natural parents. Under Article 6, a natural parent can apply for the regrant to him or her of parental rights unless the child has been adopted in the meantime. That this is the legal effect of Article 4 is confirmed by the advice or a Romanian lawyer which has been obtained who states:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">As I have indicated, English law recognises and gives effect to this Order. This means, somewhat unusually, that the natural parents need not be considered in English adoption proceedings, because they have lost all parental rights. There is no real equivalent to law 47/1993 in English law. It has some similarity to a care order, which confers parental responsibilities on the local authority which obtains it. Such an order only limits the exercise of the natural parent&#8217;s rights and does not extinguish them.&#8221;</p>

But, apart from exceptional cases like these, it is submitted that the court should be slow to refuse recognition to a foreign adoption on the grounds of public policy merely because the requirements for adoption in the foreign law differ from those of the English law. Here again the distinction between recognizing the status and giving effect to its results is of vital importance. Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself.&#8221;</p>

Consequently, if the decision of the Court of Appeal was applied literally, recognition could not be granted.

In reaching this conclusion, Hedley J described how English law had materially changed since 1965. In the first place, it has since 1973 been possible for spouses to have different domiciles. In addition, the qualifying conditions for domestic adopters had long since changed, and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 49</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> now requires one adopter to be domiciled in the British Islands or both adopters to be habitually resident here.

The world has indeed changed since 1965, and with it the world of intercountry adoption. The ease of international travel has made adoption from overseas more available, with all its benefits and possible pitfalls. The Hague Convention and the overseas adoption procedure are mechanisms that increase confidence that standards are maintained. The same confidence cannot always be felt in relation to adoptions effected in countries that are not Convention signatories, and the importance for child welfare of following approved procedures in these cases is consequently the greater.   </p>

As to these, I conclude that the situation is not as clear-cut as the local authority contends. Making full allowance for M&#8217;s manipulation of the system, she is someone who had nine years previously been approved as one of an adoptive couple following a painstaking assessment process, which incidentally did not succeed in identifying her unsuitability to adopt. C was not smuggled into this country, but came here with the full knowledge of the UK authorities, and indeed those of the US.   Both countries granted her citizenship. </p>

The reality is that M took advantage of a loophole in the system whereby she was able to employ her status as a dual national of the US and the UK to her advantage. While this was reprehensible, I am not persuaded that public policy requires non-recognition in order to mark the court&#8217;s disapproval of a process in which the administrative authorities in both jurisdictions cooperated. I agree with the authors of Dicey, Morris and Collins that something more exceptional is required before public policy is used to deny recognition to an adoption that might be in the interests of an individual child. None of the children in this case is responsible for M&#8217;s actions and it is no part of the court&#8217;s function to penalise M or to enforce international adoption standards if that might be at the expense of their interests.</p>

While the primary focus of any consideration of public policy will be on events surrounding the adoption itself, that is not to say that subsequent events must be ignored. In this exceptional case, M&#8217;s behaviour rightly disqualifies her from adopting in this country and where her own rights are concerned might be said to make any endorsement of her parental status repugnant. There is a strong argument that recognition of the adoption should be refused as a matter of public policy. </p>

My reasoning is that recognition would scarcely be refused for policy reasons if C&#8217;s welfare demanded that it be granted. If, on the other hand, recognition does not serve C&#8217;s interests, reasons of policy add nothing to the outcome.&#8221;</p>

Her difficulties are due in no small measure to M, who has shown no sign during the course of these proceedings of any genuine change of attitude. Albeit she has not been named, her conduct is notorious. She remains a potentially dangerous and destabilising influence and cannot be trusted to promote C&#8217;s real interests at any foreseeable stage in the future. By her actions, she has set the children at odds with each other, and so far as I can tell she has done nothing to repair those wounds.  </p>

Her welfare now depends upon her being given the opportunity of forming new parental ties and in being protected from further harm from M. I have considered the effect of non-recognition upon the Art 8 rights of all the family members and find that the interference with those rights is solidly based upon considerations of child welfare generally and C&#8217;s welfare in particular.&#8221;</p>

Authority at the very highest level establishes that domicile is the defining principle in determining which personal system of law applies: see <span style="font-style:italic">Udney v Udney</span> (1869) LR 1 Sc &amp; Div 441 and <span style="font-style:italic">Mark v Mark</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2005/42" uk:canonical="[2005] UKHL 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] UKHL 42</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 98" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 98</ref>. Domicile is long-established as the defining principle in relation to a person&#8217;s status: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re Goodman&#8217;s Trusts</span> (1881) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="17 ChD 266" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">17 ChD 266</ref>, followed and applied in the present context in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Valentine&#8217;s Settlement, Valentine and others v Valentine and others</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1965] Ch 831" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1965">[1965] Ch 831</ref>. The effect of Hedley J&#8217;s analysis is to carve an exception out of this general principle in one context &#8211; recognition of a foreign adoption &#8211; because of changes in our domestic law of adoption. Why should that be so? Given that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Valentine&#8217;s Settlement </span>the court was following the general approach articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Goodman&#8217;s Trusts</span>, I doubt that the language used by Lord Denning MR upon which Hedley J relied can bear the weight of the argument. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the question of best interests. It is easy to understand why family lawyers, involved in cases such as those which have recently come before the judges of the Family Division, should slip easily into an assumption that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> applies, so that recognition of the foreign adoption must be shown to be in the child&#8217;s best interests. But we have to remember that the principle of recognition we are here concerned with may have to be applied in other and very different contexts, where what may appear obvious to a family lawyer is likely to be viewed very differently by others who do not have that advantage, and not always by a court. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can illustrate the point by considering how this might work out in the context of a succession case such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re Valentine&#8217;s Settlement</span>. It will be recalled that the question in that case was whether C, a child adopted by Alastair, was entitled to take under a residuary trust in favour of Alastair&#8217;s &#8220;children or remoter issue&#8221; under a settlement made by Alastair&#8217;s mother. When the question arose for determination, C was still alive. But let us change the facts a little, and assume that C was adopted in 1949 at the age of 12, that he died in 1987 aged 50, leaving a son D, and that the last intervening life interest came to an end in 2015 when D was aged 54, so that the question becomes whether D takes as &#8220;remoter issue&#8221; under the residuary trust. This will still depend upon the answer to the original question, is C&#8217;s adoption recognised in English law? If the test of best interests has to be satisfied, a number of very obvious questions arise. Are the relevant best interests those of C, who was adopted in 1949 and died in 1987 aged 50, to be evaluated, presumably, in 1949, or those of the now 55-year old D? Law and logic would suggest the former but neither inquiry has much to commend it, whether from the point of view of principle or pragmatism: what, for example, is the point of exploring in 2016 the question of whether an adoption in 1949 was in the best interests of someone who died in 1985, and how, being sensible, could such an inquiry be pursued? By reference to which version of the statutory best interests test is the inquiry to be pursued? That in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> (presumably not: cf Peter Jackson J&#8217;s use of the phrase &#8220;at the time&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v M</span>, para 61(3)) or that in the very different legislation in force in 1949? And how is this approach to be accommodated to the fact that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> applies only to decisions taken by a &#8220;court&#8221;, for there may be no need to take the case to court at all? Is the outcome in our hypothetical example to depend upon whether the recognition decision is taken by the trustees of the settlement or by a judge in the Chancery Decision? This last point is an example of a wider problem, for in an immigration context, for example, the recognition decision will initially be made by the Secretary of State or an official and may never reach a court.             </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This last example points the way to what, in my judgment, is the correct view, namely that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, like all its predecessors, has nothing to do with the question of whether a foreign adoption should be recognised, whether by a court or by anyone else.

In much the same way, it seems to me that, read in context, including the context provided, for example, by the other provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>, the language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> &#8211; &#8220;whenever a court &#8230; is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child&#8221; &#8211; is looking to the situation where the court is considering whether or not to make an adoption order and simply does not apply to a case where all the court is doing is deciding whether or not to recognise an adoption which has already taken place abroad. </p>

If Peter Jackson J is correct in his assertion that what we are concerned with is the process &#8220;at the time&#8221;, and, as I have already said, law and logic would suggest that on this point he is correct, the same question arises in this context as in relation to best interests: what is the point of exploring in 2016 the question of whether the foreign process in 1949 was substantially the same as the process in this country in 1949, and how, being sensible, could such an inquiry be pursued? It is the kind of inquiry which, being realistic, would tax the abilities of family lawyers, familiar, no doubt, with the process and practice of adoption in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> but wholly unfamiliar with adoption process and practice in the utterly different world of 1949; I hope I do no disrespect to anyone if I suggest that the exercise would be even more taxing if it had to be conducted in the Chancery Division.</p>

Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but <span style="font-style:italic">public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself</span>.&#8221;</p>

The implications of this ruling remain to be explored in an English context, but at the very least it opens the door to a challenge of the existing common law rule on recognition, should an adopter have established family ties with a child as the result of an enforceable foreign adoption, but is unable to satisfy the domicile requirement. In <span style="font-style:italic">Wagner</span> an enforceable Peruvian adoption order was denied enforcement in Luxembourg on the grounds that it did not comply with Luxembourg choice of law rules; the latter designated Luxembourg law, which in turn permitted adoption only by married couples. The strict application of the choice of law rules was held to be a violation of Article 8. The European Court of Human Rights, noting that the best interests of the child were paramount in such a case, held that the Luxembourg courts &#8216;could not reasonably disregard the legal status validly created abroad and corresponding to a family life&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

However, the decision cannot in my view be so broadly read as to extend to the sweeping away of all procedural rules in favour of an approach that decides each application on a case-by-case basis. The factual situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Wagner and JMWL v Luxembourg</span> was quite particular. The jurisdictional obstacle was that Luxembourg law did not allow adoption by a single person, and in consequence the child&#8217;s adoption could never be recognised, regardless of merits. In contrast, English law would have allowed a domestic adoption on the same facts. Additionally, in <span style="font-style:italic">Wagner and JMWL v Luxembourg</span> the practical daily disadvantages for the child of non-recognition were real; the position is significantly different in C&#8217;s case.  </p>

It is quite clear, and not disputed by her, that in an important sense of the expression the applicant had decided to settle and had indeed settled in this country in or around 2003. But that fact, though telling and, I accept, of great importance, is not conclusive. I have to look at the full picture of the applicant&#8217;s life, as it was in 2011, &#8220;understood backwards&#8221;, to adopt Kierkegaard&#8217;s illuminating phrase. The reality, and this is based not merely on the applicant&#8217;s assertions as I have quoted them in paragraph 23 above but more particularly on the facts as I have found them, is that in 2011 the applicant retained many connections with and was a frequent visitor to India. As Ms Cronin put it, the applicant&#8217;s history shows a manifest attachment to India&#8217;s personal law, including her role in arranging the marriages of her siblings, her own marriage and, not least, N&#8217;s customary adoption in India. Throughout the period down to 2011, the applicant&#8217;s focus was India, where N &#8211; her daughter as she thought of her &#8211; was living and being supported by her financially and emotionally, almost daily over the telephone and twice yearly staying there. Ms Cronin submitted that this is a case, like many, where someone has left their home country to provide for their family and their time abroad has been directed in large measure to providing financial support for close and extended family in the home country. That is so, but what is so important, at the end of the day, is the fact that N &#8211; the applicant&#8217;s daughter, and a citizen of India &#8211; was in India, the place where she had been informally adopted by the applicant in 1999 and where the formal adoption was to take place in 2011.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two passages in Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s speech which need to be set out in full. In the first, 141, he said this:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 6</ref> requires the judge to have regard to &#8216;all the circumstances&#8217; and to treat the welfare of the child &#8216;throughout his childhood&#8217; as the first consideration. I do not see how, consistently with this language, the court could simply have ignored the considerable benefits which would have accrued to T during the remainder of her childhood. That the order would enable her to enjoy these benefits was a fact which the court had to take into account. No doubt the views of the Home Office on immigration policy were also a circumstance which the court was entitled to take into account, although it is not easy to see what weight they could be given. Parliament has not provided, as I suppose it might have done, that the adoption of a non-British child should require the consent of the Home Secretary. On the contrary, it has provided that the making of an adoption order automatically takes the child out of the reach of the Home Secretary&#8217;s powers of immigration control. The decision whether to make such an order is entirely one for the judge in accordance with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref>. In cases in which it appears to the judge that adoption would confer real benefits upon the child during its childhood, it is very unlikely that general considerations of &#8216;maintaining an effective and consistent immigration policy&#8217; could justify the refusal of an order. The two kinds of consideration are hardly commensurable so as to be capable of being weighed in the balance against each other.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The cases &#8230; justify two &#8230; propositions. The first is that the purpose of an adoption is, as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> says, to give parental responsibility for a child to the adopters. The court will therefore not make an adoption order when the adopters do not intend to exercise any parental responsibility but merely wish to assist the child to acquire a right of abode. This is what Cross J. in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A (An infant)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1963] 1 WLR 231" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1963">[1963] 1 WLR 231</ref>, 236, called an &#8220;accommodation&#8221; adoption. The second proposition is that the court will rarely make an adoption order when it would confer no benefits upon the child during its childhood but give it a right of abode for the rest of its life. In such a case there are no welfare benefits during childhood to constitute the &#8220;first consideration.&#8221; The court is in effect being asked to use adoption to confer citizenship prospectively upon an adult. This is a power which Parliament has entrusted to the Home Secretary and the courts are reluctant to trespass upon the area of his authority.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the second, 142, he said this:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I think it is wrong to exclude from consideration any circumstances which would follow from the adoption, whether they are matters which will occur during childhood or afterwards. This &#8230; would be contrary to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref>. Such benefits may include a right of abode or a possibility of succession. But benefits which will accrue only after the end of childhood are not welfare benefits during childhood to which first consideration must be given. And if a right of abode will be of benefit only when the child becomes an adult, that benefit will ordinarily have to give way to the public policy of not usurping the Home Secretary&#8217;s discretion. It is perhaps a curious feature of this case that if the Home Office had been willing to allow Ms B to remain in this country for the two years during which a residence order was in force, the case for an adoption, conferring a right of abode for life, would have been very much weaker. It would not have given Ms B any benefits during her childhood which she would not have been able to enjoy anyway.&#8221;</p>

Ms Cronin submitted that I should make an adoption order because, by conferring British citizenship on her, N will be assured of her right to go on living with the applicant in this country, thereby giving her security in the full enjoyment of her family life which is not assured merely by recognition of the Indian adoption. As Ms Fottrell put it, an adoption order is necessary to safeguard, now and into the future, the established and central relationship &#8211; legal and factual &#8211; between N and the applicant, her mother.
