Indeed, the parties would agree on the appropriate headline approach. Take the pot, and, following this 37 year marriage, with really no &#8216;magnetic&#8217; features of any kind, divide by two and distribute accordingly, thereby well able to meet the broadly equal needs of these parties. </p>

Why was a bundle of around 3000 pages necessary? (I might venture to suggest that, in fact, it was not) Why had this case come to a week long trial on the basis of a fight with no quarter spared? </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in">The separation was evidently acrimonious. There has been a Section 37 freezing injunction in place throughout and a non-molestation injunction during the currency of these lengthy and heavily delayed proceedings. Originally made ex parte and then continued by consent. On the basis of the undertaking by the Wife&#8217;s team to issue an application for an extension before this judgment is handed down, I have been prepared to consider her request for an extension of the non-molestation injunction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I deal with this issue now. The order has been in place since September 2019, nearly three years ago now. It is presently due to expire in December. I had initially thought that that would be an appropriate approach, simply to allow the order to run its course and expire. There is a further issue in this case, however. The Husband is due to stand trial in the Crown Court for, effectively, exerting coercive control over the Wife during their relationship. This trial will, doubtless, cause tensions to heighten, even after the implementation of my order has (hopefully) been resolved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the employment history of the parties through the marriage, the Wife&#8217;s position is straightforward. She works for the County council, as she has for many, many years now, and is a &#8216;reablement officer&#8217;. The Husband&#8217;s career progression is a little harder to plot. He has recently worked as a taxi driver, albeit asserting so modest an income that one would wonder why he would carry out such work. This, in any event, ceased when the parties separated. He receives a carer&#8217;s allowance, I believe, for V, although this will also be modest. I do not find that such responsibilities as he has for V (taking the Husband&#8217;s own case that V was well able to hold down employment at McDonalds for many years) preclude him from earning an income. </p>

I had far from a clear impression of him, his vulnerabilities, difficulties and ultimately his needs. He, it seems agreed, has physical difficulties (the Husband expressly rejected in his evidence, use of the word disabilities) and learning difficulties, operating, I am told, at a mental capacity akin to a child of 11 years. </p>

Fortunately, this issue being no longer pursued by the Husband, that particular concern abated. But V is a relevant factor and circumstance in the case. I am satisfied that my order provides for his needs, in the sense that each of his parents will be able to purchase a home that can accommodate him within it. It was plainly a source of great sadness to the Wife that she has not seen V for so long (the Husband used the language that she had &#8220;abandoned&#8221; him) but whilst I am unable to make any orders that in any sense determine where V&#8217;s welfare interests might lie, I am content that my order provides for all options. </p>

But it rendered the case absolutely &#8216;unsettleable&#8217; until the final hearing had started, because the assertion, prior to its abandonment, removed c. &#163;500,000 - &#163;800,000 from the matrimonial pot. If half a million pounds is standing in the way of an agreement about the size of the matrimonial pot then it is, with assets of the size of this marriage, virtually impossible to &#8216;bridge the gap&#8217; without risking a significant injustice. </p>

That is the very latest that this abandonment should have occurred, in my judgment, but it is noteworthy that since February 2020 the parties had been in receipt of the handwriting report of Evelyn Gillies, handwriting expert, who had concluded that the signature of one of the alleged witnesses to the loan agreement between the Husband and S had &#8216;probably&#8217; been written in fact by the Husband. So one might think that, in the absence of any alternative expert evidence, or evidence from S, or any other evidence helpful to the Husband&#8217;s case, it should have been apparent to him then that this was a point that was &#8216;going nowhere&#8217; evidentially for him.  </p>

She refused to negotiate. She has spent in excess of &#163;48,000 on legal costs. However, to spend in excess of &#163;14,000 on my legal costs and I will have to spend further monies in order to defend these proceedings. She does not appreciate how difficult it is to save money. That is why she is intent on raising some pointless enquiries, as in this document, where she is asking about transfers of sums as little as &#163;1.22. If she appreciated the amount of sheer hard work that has gone into making and saving money as the respondent has done, she would understand how painful it is to see that money being wasted on unnecessary legal costs.&#8221;</span></p>

His case was that he was always expected to transfer the land to his brother, that this was his late Father&#8217;s wishes (he had died some years previously) and that is why he transferred it. He does not explain why his Father did not simply arrange to leave the said land to the said brother and he does not explain why he (the Husband) waited until just after separation and the issue of this application to effect the transfer. I find that in fact&#8221; he acted in full knowledge and in deliberate breach of the injunctive orders of this Court. His answer to questions on this topic was that he had not understood the terms of the order, since he was representing himself. I do not accept that, and I am confident that HHJ Williams would have made the obligations quite plain to the Husband, as a litigant in person, at the hearings. </p>

She was not a sophisticated witness, she used simple and plain terms but they were, time and again, consistent in the life that she described whilst in a relationship with the Husband. She had no great understanding of financial affairs and absolutely no control whatsoever. I unhesitatingly accept her evidence about this. I was almost open mouthed when it was put to her (as this is indeed the Husband&#8217;s case) that the reason that the FMH was in her sole name was because she had, several years back, insisted that this should be done and the Husband, effectively, &#8216;gave in to her&#8217; giving her what she wanted. This seemed so unlikely given the very convincing evidence that I had heard from her by this point that I was particularly struck by it as a proposition. </p>

It seems plain that the Wife sought to give the impression to the person on the helpline for the benefits agency that she was in the same room as V when she was not (for he was in hospital) I don&#8217;t think, however, that this places the Wife in the category of &#8216;master manipulator&#8217; in such a way that it renders the rest of her evidence unsafe. That time was, I have no doubt, deeply traumatic. She had just left a relationship of 37 years that featured, she says, extreme control, and her son was in hospital and she was trying to put matters in place for him to return to live in her care. It is a great shame that she has not seen him now for over two years, and a source, I have no doubt, of utmost sadness to her. Her actions at this time of immense stress and strain do not, I find, render the rest of her evidence unreliable. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Husband was subjected to very lengthy and skilful cross examination. It is really very difficult to know how to begin to describe his evidence. He was awkward throughout, starting with the exchange: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Anything you want to correct in the statements? I can&#8217;t read your mind, when questions come I can answer</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">them</span>&#8221; and ending the first day by referring to Counsel&#8217;s &#8220;crap&#8221; questions and expressing his frustration with having to answer them. He also, in a low moment of his evidence, refused to acknowledge that he knew the Punjabi word for &#8216;land&#8217; and &#8216;rent&#8217; (he was born there and that is his first language) </p>

Almost every factual dispute between the parties was the subject of ever changing, and fundamentally inconsistent (sometimes opposite) versions by the Husband in the written explanations that he has provided within his statements, replies to questions and the like.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">To take just one example. It is the case that the Husband transferred the sum of &#163;19,000 to G in April 2018 (there were other transfers made at the same time). The Husband was, naturally, asked some questions about this. His replies to the schedule of deficiencies, dated 28.5.21 (so some considerable time after the separation of the parties) was: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This was repayment of a loan to a friend in India. The respondent has requested historical bank statements to show the original loan monies being received by me some years prior, to further evidence the subsequent repayment to which this relates</span>.&#8221; His replies to a document called &#8216;additional questions&#8217; (also dated a long time after the parties separated) was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">&#163;19,000 was transferred&#8230; to be sent to G. He borrowed it and never returned it. I have chased him for the outstanding monies and he says he just doesn&#8217;t have it yet, as his circumstances have changed post-pandemic. My fear is he may never repay now</span>.&#8221; Thus, the loan repayment has morphed into a loan that may never be repaid. In his third witness statement (November 2021) he states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">my 2018 bank statements show transfers made by me in April 2018 which relate to repayment of family debts</span>&#8221;. It is not until May 2022 that there is the first admission of any land in India having been purchased (this is in the Husband&#8217;s section 25 statement) and in respect of <span style="font-style:italic">the same &#163;19,000 </span>he now says <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;This monies (sic) was used to buy the land in India with the Applicant&#8217;s consent&#8221;</span></p>

The answers are, moreover, provided with a degree of detail and specificity, and the promise of documents &#8216;to follow&#8217;. They are not just contradictory; they give <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">opposite</span> versions of events. There are, very unfortunately, a reasonable number of examples such as this, where the forensic trail is impossible to follow. It would not be proportionate or appropriate to set them all out in this judgment, but I have them well in mind, due to the careful and thorough case preparation on behalf of the Wife. </p>

He started by saying that at the time of the original statement that he made to the Court (the Section 37 response statement) in December 2019 (3 months after the parties had separated) he was so distraught at the end of the relationship that he was unable to focus on any level of detail. I would note that this is not born out by the level of detail that is in fact provided within that statement. </p>

He suggested that he had completely failed to read documents before signing them, he then suggested that the solicitor had only sent him the signature page, so he had never had the opportunity to read the contents.

Iv) Handwriting evidence &#8211; the report that was commissioned by the Wife demonstrated that the purported signature of the witness to the loan agreement was probably in fact written by the Husband. The Husband did not put questions to the expert, obtain his own opinion, or witness evidence from either the witness (or for that matter from S) to confirm the truth of the agreement; v) A letter was purportedly sent from a solicitor on behalf of S seeking payment with proceedings being issued if no payment (30 days from November 2021) There have been no proceedings; vi) probably most damning is the evidence from S himself, obtained from him in India via the Wife and the Wife&#8217;s solicitor. He was clear that he had never seen so much money, never mind loaned it to the Husband, and he was angry and upset that the suggestion had been made in this case. He was &#8216;barely making ends meet&#8217; in India. He referred, moreover, to paying rent to the Husband with respect to his land that S was farming. </p>

I consider that it demonstrates that the Court has before it a party who will stop almost at nothing in order to achieve the outcome he is aiming for, which is significantly to deny the other party their fair share of the assets upon divorce. I can see no other way of characterising this whole episode and it renders the Husband&#8217;s credibility almost absent in this case. </p>

The parties disagree about the appropriate values to be ascribed to their modest secondhand cars. I am going to give these issues the broad-brush approach that they warrant. Secondhand furniture (and televisions) are never worth what parties imagine. Cars don&#8217;t matter in the scheme of assets such as there are in this case. To consider these issues too closely risks being utterly disproportionate.

The answer, in my view, is that, when faced with uncertainty consequent on one party's non-disclosure and when considering what Lady Hale and Lord Sumption called "the inherent probabilities" the court is entitled, in appropriate cases, to infer that the resources are sufficient or are such that the proposed award does represent a fair outcome.

The reasons that I make this finding are: i) the land report may not have found any additional pieces of land currently in the Husband&#8217;s name, but it is not completely reliable, since it is known as an admitted fact that the Husband certainly owns a share of his late Father&#8217;s house (for which he is paying the whole of the electricity charges I note) and this did not show up in the report; ii) S said that he pays rent to the Husband for land in India that he farms (and, indeed, he caused (provably) &#163;5k to be paid to the Husband, via V) on one occasion within the course of these proceedings that the Wife was able to prove; iii) The Husband transferred &#163;122,000 to G (an agent, effectively, in India) in April 2018 and to his Uncle&#8217;s children and for these transactions he has given diverse, flatly contradictory explanations, finally admitting that the money was used to buy land in India; iv) The Husband boasted to the Wife (I accept her evidence unhesitatingly) that he had managed to purchase land from the said uncle; v) the </p>

As a result, she has been entirely unable to make any enquiries, or to obtain evidence in rebuttal. Why would the Husband &#8216;sit on&#8217; such utterly crucial evidence, going to such a significant issue in the case, whilst meanwhile &#163;330,000 are being spent on costs in arguing such issues? vii) As already observed, I find that the Husband is a wholly unreliable and untruthful witness. </p>

It is not that I didn&#8217;t believe the Wife when she claimed to have a (somewhat vague) recollection of the Husband talking about having received inheritance and purchasing land in India. Indeed, we know that he did receive at the very least his admitted share (he says 1/18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>) of his Father&#8217;s property (the house that he pays all of the electricity bills for).</p>
