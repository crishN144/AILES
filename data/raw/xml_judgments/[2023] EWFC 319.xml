Assuming, as commonsense dictates we must, the swelling noticed by F2 was the subgaleal haematoma, subsequently diagnosed, for the injury leading that to have occurred in the care of F2 and M2, it must have been caused in the three-quarters of an hour or less between Q&#8217;s parents leaving and F2 making the search.  Not only must the fracture have been caused but the swelling would have had to come up in that time.

He concluded that the explanation given about a fall in hospital from standing was unlikely to have caused Q&#8217;s injuries.  As to the possibility of P having caused the injury when the siblings were left playing together, he thought it very unlikely that the two-year-old would be able to generate the force required to cause the injuries which would, he said, require a significant force from falling onto the head or a direct blow to the side of the head. </span></p>

He would expect the swelling to start within the first hour but to take a little time, perhaps four to six hours to become obvious to someone unaware of the injury.  He said that he would expect the child to have been miserable and in pain at the fracture site the day after the injury, probably drowsy, with associated vomiting and to have been irritable, likely with a headache, possibly drowsy and reluctant to feed &#8211; possibly vomiting &#8211; in the 48 hours following the injury. </span></p>

The initial pain, he said, was caused by the fracture being caused.  If the part of the scalp overlying the fracture site were lightly pressed when there was swelling over it, it might not make the baby cry.  He did consider, however, that a child with a recent skull fracture and underlying subdural haemorrhage would not be expected to be acting in a normal manner.  As to mechanism, an explanation would require a fall onto a hard surface, the head striking a head surface or a blow from an object or fist. </span></p>

If the fall, as described, had caused his injuries, this would be the first time in 40 years in paediatrics that Doctor Elias-Jones had come across such a thing. </span></p>

I cannot say for sure, but it may well have been by a fairly narrow margin, that HHJ Hillier sanctioned (if that is the right word) the return of the children at that point in the process.  (I am far from persuaded that I would have done so.)  On any view, this was a risky rehabilitation, the Local Authority being entirely ignorant, at that point, of the true cause of potentially life-threatening injuries to a child.  It is shocking then that the Local Authority did not deliver on its promised visiting of the children until the Children&#8217;s Guardian flagged up their failure.  I would like, and will direct, an explanation for this failing from the appropriate manager, probably the Assistant Director of Children&#8217;s Services. </span></p>

During her evidence, I took this social worker through a host of references in the medical bundle to medics expressing real concern that the Local Authority was not imposing any supervision on the parents&#8217; access to Q in hospital and notwithstanding (a) the unexplained, very serious, and possibly inflicted injury, and (b) the fact that an infant admission to hospital in no way replicates supervision.  For example, the social work manager was told in terms by the hospital that there would only be one overnight check on Q, who was otherwise in the care of the parents who may &#8211; it was not, of course, then known &#8211; have caused a very serious injury.

The consequence of her description being, broadly, accurate &#8211; of which I will say more below &#8211; is that either that Q simply did not respond to his injuries, as many children would (or as Doctor Elias-Jones would expect most children to; and there is always huge scope for variation between human beings) or, second, that Q&#8217;s injury was not caused on the Friday but sometime earlier. </span></p>
