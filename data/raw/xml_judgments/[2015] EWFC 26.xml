Their photographs and film clips in which they feature have been published and re-published widely. Filmed police interviews of the children have been uploaded on to publicly accessible websites; so, too, intensely personal information relating to both children. As at 10 March 2015, more than 4 million people worldwide had viewed online material relating to this case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I considered but ultimately rejected the suggestion that the children&#8217;s names should appear within the judgment. My priority is to protect them from further harm of whatever kind. Those who have posted material identifying the children have done so with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests. I see no good reason for adding to the damage already done. Only those with prurient or unhealthy curiosity will take steps to identify the children. My faith in humanity indicates that the overwhelming majority of individuals will do nothing because they, like me, have no interest in inflicting further harm.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the period before 13 January 2015, there had been some relatively limited online publication of court and other relevant material. It had been my hope that after discussion with the mother and her McKenzie Friend on 13 January, there would have been withdrawal of material from the internet. Since about 26 January the volume posted in a variety of formats on different sites has increased markedly; and the claims made  against the father, the children&#8217;s former head teacher, other teachers, professionals and a very large number of parents at the children&#8217;s former school have proliferated.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. Lives have been disrupted.  Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating &#8216;phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Hey cock. We&#8217;re coming for you. You scum paedo.</span>&#8221; </p>

Prospective parents have wondered whether to withdraw their children from allocated places. Existing parents have been uniformly supportive of the school and every member of the teaching staff.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2014, lurid allegations of the most serious kind were drawn to the attention of the Metropolitan Police. In a variety of ways, it was suggested that P and Q were part of a large group of children from north London who had been sexually abused, made to abuse one another and that they had belonged to a satanic cult in which there was significant paedophile activity. </p>

They were bought, injected with drugs and then sent by TNT or DHL to London. The assertions were that babies had been abused, tortured and then sacrificed. Their throats were slit, blood was drunk and cult members would then dance wearing babies&#8217; skulls (sometimes with blood and hair still attached) on their bodies. All the cult members wore shoes made of baby skin produced by the owner of a specified shoe repair shop. </p>

East Finchley swimming pool was identified as one of the other meeting venues for the paedophile ring. Rituals were performed, so it was claimed, in an upstairs room at the McDonald&#8217;s restaurant where the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">boss</span>&#8221; allowed child sacrifice because he was a member of the cult. Human babies were prepared, cooked in the ovens within a secret kitchen and then eaten by cult members.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the indications are that over a period of some weeks last summer, P and Q were forced by Mr Christie and Ms Draper, working in partnership, to provide concocted accounts of horrific events. The stories came about as the result of relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse. Torture is a strong word but it is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children were made to take part in filmed mobile &#8216;phone recordings in which they relayed a series of fabricated satanic practices. Subsequently, at the instigation of Abraham Christie and Ella Draper, the children repeated their false stories to Jean-Clement Yaohirou, Mr Christie&#8217;s brother in law, in a late night discussion. It lasted for about three hours; Mr Christie and Ms Draper did most of the talking.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P and Q were ABE (Achieving Best Evidence) interviewed on 5, 11 and 17 September 2014. On the first two occasions, they supplied information about events they claimed had occurred, similar in their overall content to the mobile &#8216;phone video clips and audio recording. On 17 September, in ABE interview, both children withdrew their allegations. Each stated they had been made to say things by Abraham Christie, the mother&#8217;s partner, which were not true; and they gave very full details of the way in which he had secured their compliance.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Draper and Mr Christie have not participated by being present in court. I am as sure as I can be that their absence has been deliberate. They have chosen to remain away; but the internet campaign has continued. Countless online articles have been posted in which the truth of the satanic abuse claims is asserted repeatedly. Notwithstanding injunctions restraining Ms Draper and Sabine McNeill, one of her supporters, from publishing information from the proceedings on the internet or elsewhere, such material continues to be uploaded. Efforts to persuade internet servers to remove material have been of only limited value.  As soon as information is removed by one provider, it emerges elsewhere.</p>

I read thousands of pages of written material and watched six ABE interviews. I viewed a dozen or so short film clips of the children being questioned by Ms Draper and Mr Christie and listened to the very lengthy audio recording.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The forensic inquiry has been full and thorough. It has made little difference that Ms Draper has been absent. I have been actively assisted in my investigative role by Ms Markham, Counsel for the local authority, and Mr Ageros who represents the guardian. Each has asked questions designed to explore those matters which, in all probability, the mother would have raised. Close attention has been given to the claims she&#8217;d made in her written material so as to ensure her case was put to all relevant witnesses.</p>

Countless returns to court achieved very little. If there was an attempt to achieve judicial continuity it failed miserably. Between November 2010 and August 2014 when the case was pending at First Avenue House, High Holborn it drifted between no fewer than seven different judges. None of the nine hearings resulted in a considered judgment on the basis of oral evidence. The essential cause of the problems was never the subject of judicial determination.</p>

He was loud and aggressive, accusing the teachers of poisoning the children by giving them the food supplied at the school. By the middle of June, according to Ms Draper, Mr Christie was staying over at her home on two or three nights each week.</p>

In our legal system if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He has to find for one side or the other. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to the rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the very first indication of possible sexual abuse, Mr Christie&#8217;s account to Mr Yaohirou is both extraordinary and significant. To entertain suspicions about Mr Dearman from the tone of his voice over a Skype call defies reason. Moreover, senseless assumptions would seem to have been made by Mr Christie and the mother if, in fact, the children had touched the dog and were &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">touching each other</span>.&#8221; To believe that children who demonstrate curiosity about and touch their own, the dog&#8217;s and their sibling&#8217;s genital areas must have, or probably have, been sexually abused is plainly ridiculous. It either shows alarming ignorance about normal childish behaviour or, as is much more likely here, wilful determination to distort innocent activities into something sinister and depraved.</p>

In the context of what P and Q later describe was done to them by Mr Christie in that four week period, it is clear that they were effectively persecuted so as to compel them to tell false stories.</p>

Over time, more and more detail was supplied to the central core of the fabricated story. &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Brainstorming</span>&#8217; brought about expanded versions of events. More and more individuals were named as participants within the cult. Venues for abusive activities grew in number, spread across Hampstead and Highgate. Ever more sexually explicit details were woven in to the fabric of the fantasies in an attempt to make the children&#8217;s accounts believable and seemingly authentic.</p>

Firstly because the children describe a number of detailed allegations of ritualistic abuse; and second because they do so articulately, with good eye contact and without a trace of distress. P can barely wait for the next question before she is chipping in with an answer. Both children are entirely &#8216;matter of fact&#8217; about what they say has happened.

She repeated her physical findings and then comments upon the retraction in these terms &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Until a study in 2007 it was mostly thought that recantation rates were related to the certainty with which child sexual abuse is substantiated and that retraction of true allegations is rare and that when retraction occurs the allegation is likely to be false. Lindsay et al found a recantation rate of 16.9% in 257 substantiated cases of CSA which had relied on formal interviews by police and social services. This is four times higher than previously reported in the most often cited study by Bradley and Wood in 1996. Analyses of their data found predictors for recantation included younger age child, a parent figure being the perpetrator and a lack of support from the non offending care giver</span>.&#8221; In summary, said Dr Hodes, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">recantation does occur in a significant number of cases especially with the predictors that are present in both children</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was dismayed to find, twenty seven years after the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 that Dr Hodes adopted so definite a view as to the likelihood of sexual abuse to which she then adhered notwithstanding several noteworthy contraindications. One of the cardinal messages from Cleveland was as to the importance of multi agency collaboration so as to understand amongst many other things the context in which suspicions arose. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her very last report, Dr Hodes said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the current evidence is that prolonged reflex anal dilatation (the finding in P) is associated with anal abuse;</span>&#8221; and cited the Royal College of Paediatrics 2008 Review. The Review also reflects, I would observe, that there continues to be a debate about the significance of RAD. It is a sign seen in up to a third of children with a history of anal abuse although it can also be seen in small numbers of children selected for non abuse (the evidence base is very limited and unclear on this). </p>

I regret that Dr Hodes was not asked exactly what she hoped to gain by the second examination positioning the children differently. The 2008 Review suggests, arising out of Myrhe&#8217;s 2001 study, that there are differences in the muscle tone in the two positions. </p>

It is Ms Draper&#8217;s case that between 11 and 17 September the police and the children&#8217;s foster carers placed pressure upon them to change their story. DC Martin said that prior to collecting P and Q from the foster home he had not met either foster parent. DC Martin was accompanied by DC Carl Savage, who had not previously met the children. Neither of them had any conversation with the foster parents relating to the allegations. If anything of note had been said by anyone prior to the ABE interviews it would have been recorded.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have no doubt but that the physical injuries described by the children as having been inflicted by Abraham Christie were, indeed, caused by him. I reject as baseless Ms Draper&#8217;s suggestion that instead Mr Dearman was responsible. A straightforward conclusion given that neither child had seen him for about three months at the time of Dr Hodes&#8217; examination and subsequent police photography. Those photographs clearly show recent rather than healed injuries.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is good evidence to find, as I do, that in the three months leading to their reception into care both children ingested cannabis. Scientific analysis revealed that both children had metabolites of the drug (THC) in their hair &#8211; a finding which could not be explained by ingestion of &#8216;hemp based products&#8217; because none would contain sufficient levels of cannabis to produce the metabolite. It is impossible for the analysts to say whether the children had ingested the drug whether by passive smoking or oral ingestion. However, the children were clear in interview when describing the way hemp was made into soup using the juicer.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The amounts found in the children&#8217;s hair samples suggested their ingestion had not been, as Ms Cave of Lextox described, a &#8220;one-off&#8221; but regular over the period. It is hard to imagine how any parent could deliberately expose a child to an illegal drug. But it may have been part of Mr Christie&#8217;s and Ms Draper&#8217;s plan so as to gain the children&#8217;s compliance. I need hardly say now profoundly damaging it was to administer illegal drugs to a child.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The posting of film clips featuring the children speaking about sexual matters has exposed P and Q to the potential for very serious embarrassment and humiliation in the years ahead maybe, even, throughout the whole of the rest of their lives. Doubtless they will grow and develop so that their visual appearances will alter. But it may be difficult to shield them from unwelcome interest and reputational damage unless radical steps to divert attention are taken. </p>

It is always necessary to take account of all the material not just a selection. Those who arrived at their own early conclusions on the basis of partial material were woefully misguided.</p>

There are many campaigning people, sadly, who derive satisfaction from spreading their own poisonous version of history irrespective of whether it is true or not. </p>
