The application came into the urgent applications list at short notice.  When it was made, the medical view was that LM might not survive for as long as a day in the absence of a blood transfusion and that even if one was given, she might still die.  A decision had to be taken there and then.  I took the view that it was not practicable or necessary for a litigation friend to be appointed.</span></p>
