At that time, I made orders for direct contact between B and her fathers, granted a 12 month supervision order in favour of X County Council, and made a 15 month-long order under <span style="font-style:italic">section 91(14)</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> directed to all lay parties.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16 February 2015, X County Council applied to extend the supervision order for a further period of six months, initially in respect of both A and B, but in the event only in relation to B.  Directions for that application were given on 3 March 2015.  At a subsequent hearing on 4 June, the mothers and the fathers both indicated their intention to launch cross-applications for further private law orders as soon as free to do so (i.e. once the <span style="font-style:italic">section 91(14) </span>orders which I had made on 20 March 2014 lapsed). They set out their positions fully at that hearing, and with the concurrence of the parties, I proceeded as if the applications had been formally made, and determined some of them summarily.  Specifically, at the June hearing:</p>

Specifically, they did not seek any variation or enforcement of the contact order, did not press for any direct contact with either girl, and did not invite any further consideration of a suspended residence order; they indicated that they had resigned themselves to take away from this litigation the modest expectation of continued indirect contact with their daughters.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To recap, I should briefly explain that the case concerns A and B; they are sisters and are now aged 14 and 10.  Litigation in the High Court concerning these two young people began seven years ago, in June 2008, when they were respectively 7 and 3, and has continued almost uninterrupted since that time. A and B are the two biological children of F1 and M1; both F1 and M1 are in permanent civil partnerships (respectively with F2 and M2).  I propose to refer to F1 and F2 as the &#8216;fathers&#8217; and M1 and M2 as the &#8216;mothers&#8217;.  All four are effectively parents to these two children.  The fathers have not had any routine contact with the children for many years.</p>

The litigation had already been ongoing for many years, there had been virtually no judicial continuity, different strategies had been attempted and multiple experts instructed in an attempt to unblock the impasse between the parties.  Prominent among the steps which I took between July 2013 and March 2014 in an attempt to resolve the dispute were:</p>

The fathers told me in their position statement that they were impressed by A&#8217;s articulacy and presentation.   A attended the follow-up review meeting on 1 June 2015, believing that the fathers would be likely to be there, but they had not in fact attended as they were concerned about the emotional context of a meeting with A so close in time to the forthcoming court hearing. </p>

Although the supervision order and the abeyance of court process helped to shift attitudes to some extent, this regrettably had little actual impact on stimulating the relationships which I, and my predecessor judges, have all considered to be important to the childrens&#8217; well-being.  The social worker reported that B at one time expressed a wish to see her fathers in &#8220;a controlled environment&#8221;, and visits were therefore set up in May 2014 and February 2015; these were cancelled shortly before the appointed days when B expressed herself too distressed to attend (M2 described B as getting &#8220;cold feet&#8221; about seeing her fathers).  B has since remained steadfast that she does not want to see the fathers.  Both A and B have prepared a &#8216;chart&#8217; which has until recently been kept in the family living room, which bears the title: &#8220;Why we don&#8217;t want contact&#8221;; on this &#8216;chart&#8217; B sets out her reasons for her views, making complaints which refer to events significantly in the past. </p>

Both girls speak of contact, and the litigation, &#8220;ruining&#8221; their childhoods, and consider the fathers to be solely to blame for the protracted litigation and its impact on M1&#8217;s mental health.  These views represent a recognisable echo of those expressed by the previously appointed Guardian, reporting nearly four years ago (and long before my first judicial involvement) that:</p>

This comment was subsequently disowned by the Local Authority, but plainly in my view it has legitimacy.  That the girls express themselves with ever-increasing levels of passion cannot be in doubt; in her recent witness statement, the social worker referred to an occasion in April 2014 when she met B speaking in an &#8220;excitable voice&#8221; about her fathers, standing on the dining room table, proclaiming that &#8220;the child makes the decisions in this home, they are in control here&#8221;.  B is described as having become &#8220;quite vocal and able to assert her views in an independent way&#8221;; she is also reported to have said to the social worker that &#8220;she has told her views to so many professionals and felt she has not been heard&#8221;.</p>

He also reports that the mothers have been seeing a family therapist, which has been assessed as helpful.  Dr. R maintains his opinion that M1 has a bipolar affective disorder which is largely in remission, but has more specifically experienced episodes of acute stress disorder; his latest report concludes:</p>

The other parties to the litigation responded briefly, each acknowledging &#8211; genuinely in my view &#8211; the sincerity of the fathers&#8217; wish now to relieve the children of the burden of ongoing litigation, and the courage and pain involved in making this decision.  Unsurprisingly, X County Council defended its involvement over the last two years, and the work which it has been able to effect with the family, including the facilitation of one actual contact between B and the fathers (December 2013) and some mutual indirect contact, the completion of life-story work, and the engagement of the children.  The mothers refuted the apportionment of blame for the current situation and pointed to the positive independent reports of the children&#8217;s development from the school and others, reflecting a satisfactory home life and upbringing; it was observed that the cessation of the proceedings would be bound to have a positive effect on M1&#8217;s mental health.  Ms Baxter confirmed on instruction that M2 (M1 was not at court) would &#8220;encourage&#8221; the children to participate in the indirect contact, and will &#8220;encourage&#8221; direct contact in the future, and &#8211; on enquiry from me &#8211; confirmed her &#8220;support&#8221; for this if the girls, or either of them, want it to happen.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian and the children&#8217;s solicitor acknowledged that the fathers have always acted out of concern for the girls, and in what the fathers believed sincerely to be in the children&#8217;s best interests.

Moreover, as things stand it seems to me that no court order is likely to achieve any change in the current situation.  I am wholly unpersuaded that it would be principled or proportionate to impose an order which would last for another six years as the mothers initially proposed.  Given the obvious interference with these parties&#8217; fundamental access to justice, I recognise that I ought to impose an order for the minimum period necessary, having regard specifically to the harm which it is intended to avoid (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span>, Guideline (10)).
