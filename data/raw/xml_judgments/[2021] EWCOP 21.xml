The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in </p>

At the moment she is living in a care home (F House), having moved there in March 2020 when she was granted bail in the criminal proceedings.  The arrangements for her accommodation have previously been found by me to amount to a deprivation of liberty and no party disputes this.  At the last hearing I noted that the agreed aim was for AB to return home (9CC) and a recital on the Court order reflects this (D171).  The detailed dispute that I need to determine about AB&#8217;s care is which of two proposals designed to support her returning home should be pursued in her best interests. </p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient&#8217;s point of view.  That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail.  We cannot always have what we want.  Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient&#8217;s wishes are.  Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament.  In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8216;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless.&#8217;  But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient&#8217;s wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221; </p>

All parties agree it is in her best interests to return home and F House was never intended to be where she resides permanently.

That is not at all surprising given the progress that she has clearly made since she has been in F House.  The social work manager&#8217;s evidence confirmed the amount of progress that AB has made, and the Official Solicitor through Mr Chisholm&#8217;s submissions has also highlighted how far AB has come.  The earlier evidence about her wishes and feelings in the Bundle is that she found 2:1 supervision intolerably restrictive and that it led to her violent outbursts (for example, see F4, G1228, G1230, G1231).  Mr Parkhill on behalf of the Applicant emphasised how negative AB was about the possibility of returning home with support when discussing her experience of returning to 9CC after her first period of incarceration in 2018 (G1260 statement of the social work manager dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020).  The views relayed by AB in that statement are undoubtedly striking since AB also told the social work manager that she had more freedom where she was in February 2020 than she had had at home.  At the time the social work manager spoke to her, AB was in prison.  The earlier wishes and feelings expressed by AB do seem largely consistent about how difficult she finds supervision, that she is not a &#8216;people person&#8217; and that she views restrictive supervision by care workers as a trigger for her violent outbursts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">However, the most recent evidence about her wishes and feelings about supervision comes from the attendance note of her solicitor&#8217;s meeting with her on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020 (G2066-2069).  At G2067 and G2068 it is common ground that for the first time AB demonstrated some acceptance of the possible need for 2:1 support in order to allow her home sooner.  It is clear from AB&#8217;s earlier comments in that meeting (G2066-G2067 para 4) that overall her preference would be for 1:1 support but, as the discussion developed, her solicitor explored the option of 2:1 support at least at first followed by a possible reduction (G2067 para 6).  AB&#8217;s response to this discussion is very positive, I find, compared to her earlier strong views against higher levels of support.  AB commented &#8220;so it would be a sideways move.  I&#8217;d be going where I want to be, but going back in the sense of having less freedom than at F House&#8221; and &#8220;2:1 at home will only not work if I don&#8217;t have any freedom.  I need a little bit of time to myself.  I need to go out a bit to have time to myself&#8221; (G2067-G2068 paras 6 and 7).  This is quite a mature and reflective view that AB is conveying, I find.

Again, I do not think that is really in dispute, although Mr Chisholm for the Official Solicitor did raise a concern about the absence of any activities or volunteering for AB whilst in FH.   All of the professionals involved in AB&#8217;s care agree that she benefits hugely from engagement in activities and from volunteering.  Mr Chisholm summarised those benefits as enhancing AB&#8217;s self-esteem and enabling her to burn off energy. It is abundantly clear to me that AB derives enormous positive benefit from engaging in activities and from volunteering.  In turn it is equally clear to me that these positive benefits help AB handle other stress factors, based on the evidence of Dr Prangnell, the social work manager and AB&#8217;s mother, BB. </p>

It is accepted that she is currently residing outside of her local area and is reliant upon public transport.  It is also accepted that, as recommended by Dr Prangnell, activities and volunteer work opportunities for AB should ideally be where her home is.  He very clearly told me in the course of this hearing that someone with the sort of brain injury that AB has will struggle to generalise what she learns in one context to another and that her learning will be incremental, and that she will struggle with changes in her environment.  By extension therefore she would struggle to adapt to carrying out activities in one location only to have to move them to another location with different people involved.  Again, no party really takes issue with that.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">The constraints of Covid-19 have added a layer of complexity to the practicalities around organizing activities for AB, something that is sadly inevitable for many people not just AB.  This will no doubt include AB learning to adjust to the current necessities of physical social distancing and hygiene measures in public spaces and on public transport.  The Trust&#8217;s consultant psychiatrist also noted that AB is going to need to adjust to these when he gave me his evidence.  Given the geography concerned, using public transport to and from FH to activities or volunteering based closer to AB&#8217;s home at 9CC was also going to be a limiting factor as well, even before COVID-19.  It would be also be unfair to criticise the Applicant for AB not wanting to engage with any offered activities.  There is also the complicating factor that the outstanding criminal proceedings will have contributed to a level of uncertainty about what volunteering opportunities may be available for AB to consider, and even a disposal by way of discharge at the forthcoming sentencing hearing in the Crown Court may limit which voluntary opportunities may be open to her.  The further period of national lockdown will also have contributed to delays in identifying both activities and volunteering opportunities.  BB told me that one of the options in the past which AB has really enjoyed was volunteering at the church foodbank but that is not currently operating due to COVID-19 restrictions.  However, I think that it is a fair point to make that the Applicant and any care agency involved in the provision of AB&#8217;s care do need to plan for activities and volunteering opportunities for her when she goes home and there must be a clear plan in place about that.  The current care plan at H279H280 (which dates from August this year) does record various activities that AB enjoys and also that she likes volunteering.  However, it doesn&#8217;t give any detail about what specific options may be explored for AB and more detail about this in fact appears in the Working with Risk Plan (dated October 2020) which appears at G1983-G2003 and explicitly covers a period of 5 weeks.  It is validly raised by Mr Chisholm that, whilst it may be inherent in the plan that it will be reviewed at the end of each week and that the plan for week 6 onwards won&#8217;t simply be repetition of earlier weeks, this should be made explicit in the plan.  Mr Parkhill conceded this point and I am grateful to the Applicant for accepting that &#8211; it can only help in a case of this sort of complexity and when we remember that AB has input to the plan and needs to understand what is proposed, I find. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">I also have to consider the evidence of the consultant psychiatrist about the plan to enable AB to have community access.  It was very clear that his opinion was that a slower and more cautious approach than in the current plan was appropriate.  He gave me evidence about this being based on his considerable clinical experience and concerns about moving too fast to enable AB to adapt.  However, the consultant psychiatrist accepted that he was not didactic about this view and was prepared to work with the rest of the professionals involved on a multidisciplinary basis.  He also accepted, when questioned by Mr Chisholm, that the plan was robust and had reviews built in at the end of each week which could function as firebreaks if required. It is perhaps pertinent to note at this point that the consultant psychiatrist&#8217;s ability to work on multi-disciplinary basis has undoubtedly not been helped by his absence or the absence of the Trust&#8217;s care coordinator from the weekly planning meetings.  In saying this, I am not criticising the consultant psychiatrist who told me very clearly that he only works part-time and clearly would struggle to attend the meetings as well as manage his clinical appointments.  I am less clear why there has not been more involvement from the Trust and the care coordinator in particular, though the consultant psychiatrist did tell me that there have been issues with one suffering a period of illness and a change in care coordinator too.  Regardless of the reasons, it seems that all of the evidence before me makes it very clear that it would be a huge help to AB if the care coordinator were to be more involved in those regular meetings.  Presumably that would also help the care coordinator with the co-ordination aspect of their role.</p>

Her evidence was clear that, in her view, 2:1 staffing is a trigger for AB&#8217;s challenging behaviour and was more likely to provoke a &#8216;meltdown&#8217;. AB is also currently subject to 2:1 staffing in F House but, as the social work manager told me, the size of F House compared to 9CC allows for staff to be less obvious, and the only recent incidents of challenging behaviour from AB were in the last week and were directed towards inanimate objects rather than people.  As a result, the Applicant proposes that there should be a plan to gradually reduce support to 1:1 over the next 3 months and that AB should then go home with 1:1 support. </p>

His report at I331 para 78 had indicated that he agreed with the independent consultant psychiatrist Dr Lohwala&#8217;s opinion and rationale about the level of staff support that AB would require on returning to 9CC.  Dr Lohwala&#8217;s opinion about this was in his report dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019, I270 para 1.1.

The social work manager also gave very clear evidence about her concerns in terms of the physical limitations created by the size of 9CC and I have seen the property plan (G2048) with dimensions.  Despite BB telling me that staff members could simply spend all of their time in the second bedroom (which she deemed a &#8216;staff room&#8217;), she did accept when I clarified this with her that they would need to leave that room to use the toilet and to access the kitchen.  It is also a very small room in a small property so wholly unreasonable to expect even one staff member to spend the majority of their time in that room.  As  the social work manager told me, F House is larger and allows staff members to be more unobtrusive.  This would clearly be more difficult at 9CC, I find.  There</p>

This support was 24 hours per day within her home and consisted of a support worker present at all times, increasing to two workers during the night.  The ISW was also very clear that AB required input from a neuropsychiatrist and that her complex mental health needs as well as her other needs required a more considered approach combined with the input of wider mental health services.  The ISW had noted that the presence of staff within AB&#8217;s home may be a contributing factor towards her agitation and aggression and her overall conclusion that AB did not require 2:1 support is part of the evidence relied upon by the Applicant in seeking to establish that 1:1 support is in AB&#8217;s best interests.  However, the view of the ISW is more nuanced than this, I find.  She noted that AB had complex needs and would require a multi-disciplinary approach as I have mentioned, and also noted that it was not just frustration at the presence of staff in her home that led to escalations in AB&#8217;s challenging behaviours: &#8220;there are similar reports of public order offences with AB displaying violence and aggression whilst in the community&#8221; (I81). </p>

Against this background, I can see why the social work manager has reached the conclusion that it is better for AB to return to 9CC.  That is not the same as saying that this means 1:1 support is in AB&#8217;s best interests, though. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">Both Dr Prangnell and Dr Lohawala were of the opinion that AB requires 2:1 support on her return to 9CC.  Dr Prangnell made the very compelling point that returning to 9CC is going to be a change that AB will find stressful and need to adapt to, and this will require a settling in period.  He was clear that he advocated a multi-disciplinary approach (much like the Trust&#8217;s consultant psychiatrist) and also that it was very difficult to predict how AB would cope so he recommended frequent reviews to counter this.  He also recommended spending some blocks of time at 9CC before she returned there permanently, as well as time to get to know her care givers.  I was very struck by his evidence in answer to questions from Mr Chisholm about weighing the risk of AB refusing to return to F House at the end of the trial periods at 9CC. He pointed out that it was important to involve AB in planning her return to 9CC and for her to be able to see a clear and agreed timeline over which events were taking place.  He was of the view that the resulting buy-in from her would be itself a mitigating factor about that risk of refusing to return to F House.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Prangnell also gave me very clear evidence about the way in which AB will struggle to generalise skills across different contexts, and this may pose problems for her in transferring what she has learnt at F House to 9CC.  He was equally clear that it is very important for AB to get to know her carers before she goes home, and that consistency will be important for the care agency staff in their approach to providing AB with support once she is home.  Partly as a result of her difficulty with generalisation across different contexts, he recommended getting her involved in activities closer to 9CC so that she can continue those once she returns there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">He was equally clear that, in his view, 1:1 care for AB whenever she goes home will not be safe for either her carers or for her, given her difficulty with generalisation and the stress of returning home and even though this is her home and somewhere she has lived before.  I do note that when she lived there before and the 2:1 support was last in place this was not long after she had experienced the undoubted trauma of being in prison.  It was also without the period of stability that she has had at F House and without input from a neuropsychologist to help identify what her needs may be, and how those may best be met.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">The social work manager&#8217;s evidence about the two most recent incidents involving AB at F house was also striking.  She was very clear that these showed AB directing her frustration towards inanimate objects rather than people and, whilst they are clearly still of concern, they are not at the same sort of level as has previously been the case.  Mr Chisholm noted that their timing so close to this hearing may also not be a coincidence and I agree with that observation.  These incidents underline rather than contradict the evidence about AB being in a much better place as a result of her time in F House, I find, and makes it less likely that she would react as strongly to 2:1 support as she has done in the past.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">I have also been mindful of the likely impact upon AB of failing to acknowledge her clear wish to go home sooner rather than later and find that this is also a factor which will potentially impact upon her ability to cope with any support.  Put simply, it seems very clear from the all of the professional evidence before me that the longer AB has to wait to go home the greater the risk that she will become frustrated by that, and that this will contribute to challenging behaviour.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">There are also some practical potential benefits to 2:1 support which Dr Prangnell and BB set out in their evidence.  Dr Prangnell mentioned that, from a safety perspective, it would provide an additional person to help respond to and manage any outbursts from AB.  BB notably described it as having &#8220;two sets of wits&#8221; to bring to bear.  In fairness, I don&#8217;t think the Applicant disputes that these are potential benefits to the 2:1 ratio, it is simply that their analysis of the balance between these benefits and the risk of the staffing ratio itself causing outbursts from AB means that they conclude the greater risk lies with outbursts being triggered and that counters the potential benefits. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">I have given careful consideration to the evidence from the social work manager about the potentially negative impact upon AB of having a period of time when she is going out unescorted in the community and periodically going home only to face more restriction in the 4 week period when she returns to 9CC.  She also very properly highlighted that 2:1 support will represent a more restrictive option for AB, therefore.  Her evidence about this was careful, considered and I think genuinely from the standpoint of someone who was trying to understand things from AB&#8217;s perspective and to try to identify the least restrictive option for AB.  As someone who has clearly had considerable involvement in the case it was therefore important evidence.   However, the evidence from Dr Prangnell about the risk of AB going home with 1:1 support and a further incident resulting in her being subject to even greater restriction was compelling, I find. </p>

The Applicant therefore also accepts that it is necessary to commission a care agency and the social work manager told me that this could be done within two weeks.  AB&#8217;s parents are clearly very dissatisfied with the actions of the Applicant around identifying and commissioning a care agency and had originally sought to ask me to give some indication about which agency may be approached.  However, through Mr Lewis, they now accept that this is outside of my jurisdiction given the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">N v A CCG</span>.  Mr Chisholm on behalf of the Official Solicitor also expressed some concern about the stage the Applicant has reached in commissioning a care agency in light of their plan for AB to return to 9CC in 3 months.  Again, it is not within my jurisdiction to be able to do much more than note that, whilst this is a clearly a very complex case involving a very finely balanced decision about the care and support that AB will need when she goes home, AB can only be assisted by all of those involved in her care working together (as both Dr Prangnell and the Trust&#8217;s consultant psychiatrist pointed out) and doing so in good time so that everyone including AB has time to absorb the plan.  I include AB&#8217;s parents in this, since in my view AB&#8217;s best interests at this stage are better served by a greater focus on helping AB move forward working with the agencies involved rather than what has happened in the past.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">On balance, I find that that AB best interests require that she have a care plan for 2:1 support for the initial period of her return home to 9CC.  I find that 1:1 support on her initial return home would not be sufficient to deal with the risks associated with the stress of her returning home and would potentially mean that AB would very quickly be subject to even more severe restrictions.  2:1 support for a short period whilst AB transitions to 9CC is therefore the least restrictive option overall. Whilst 2:1 support at 9CC does have some risks associated with it, I find that these risks are mitigated by ensuring that AB has a clear target date to work towards for going home, that she has a detailed care plan both before and after going home which includes therapeutic support for her and access to activities and available volunteering opportunities, that there is neuropsychological input to her care plan, that regular and frequent reviews take place, and that before she moves </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">preparation is undertaken to introduce her to her carers and to give her trial periods at 9CC.  The Official Solicitor also recommends that AB should be given specific psychological support to help her understand why 2:1 support may be necessary, and that this is in addition to more general psychological support.  I would endorse that suggestion as in AB&#8217;s best interests. Combined with the more positive place that AB is clearly in at this point, I find that this will reduce the likelihood of 2:1 support alone acting as a trigger to challenging behaviour.  For the avoidance of doubt, during the period that AB remains in F House the plan offering AB options to undertake activities (including any available voluntary work) should cover the whole of the period that she remains there and not just 5 weeks, and will also need to note that this is subject to ongoing review and will be lead by AB so may be subject to change. </p>

Whilst I can understand the concerns of the Official Solicitor and AB&#8217;s parents, in my view neither of these directions are necessary.  It is open to any party to apply to bring the matter back to court by simply filing a COP9 and, whilst I agree that a long-stop review date is required (which all parties in fact agree) in light of the issues in this case, I am not persuaded that an interim review hearing will do more than reinforce reliance upon the Court when what AB requires is collaborative and constructive working amongst the parties.  It is clear to me that the proceedings have themselves placed a toll upon AB and that also has to be taken into account when considering whether anything more than a long-stop review is required. </p>
