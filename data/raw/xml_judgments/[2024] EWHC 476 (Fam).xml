They are Child A (a boy born on 23.12.2012, so now aged 11), Child B (a girl born 18.01.2016, so now aged 8) and Child C (a boy born 10.04.2018, so now aged 5).

The parents had separated in 2017, before C&#8217;s birth, but had managed up to the summer of 2022 to facilitate arrangements whereby the children evidently had regular and positive visits with the father. On one occasion in 2020, the mother left them in his care for up to a week whilst she travelled to England. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There is a dispute about the circumstances of their departure. The mother says that the father consented for a removal to X, which is a barely recognised autonomous region within Y, and where the mother has extended family, for a period of 2 -3 years. The father says that his permission was limited to a holiday trip, and that a specific date for the removal was never agreed. What is clear is that the children left with her for X on a date in early July 2022. They were not returned by the beginning of the new school term in Sweden in late August 2022, soon after which the father began expressing concern, and indeed the children&#8217;s school contacted him after hearing from the mother that she then had a plan to take the children to Canada. X is not a signatory to the Hague Convention 1980. Unable to pursue an application for a summary return order, the father did seek assistance to secure the return of the children to Sweden via the Swedish authorities.</span></p>

She did not return for them until late September 2023, and during that time, they were cared for by maternal family members. In April 2023, the father had commenced court proceedings in Sweden, seeking an order that the children be placed in his care, and after making an interim order on 6 July to that effect, the Swedish Court made a final order on 13 September 2023, providing for the children to live with the father, in circumstances where they were at that stage living with neither parent. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Swedish Court found that the father had not consented to children&#8217;s removal in 2022, that the mother was retaining the children in X against his will, and that the father could be expected to provide appropriate care for them. The Court pointed to a Swedish Welfare report prepared in 2021 which had recorded the mother as being comfortable when the children were at the father&#8217;s house, that she did not have any concern about his ability to care for them, nor think that the children had witnessed violence there, and that the parents could communicate with each other over the children, a position echoed by the children&#8217;s then school. They were critical of the mother&#8217;s actions in leaving the children with her relatives in a new country.</span></p>

Whilst awaiting that decision she returned from England to X to rejoin the children. On 11 October 2023, the Swedish Appeal Court refused her application for permission to appeal. On 20 October 2023, she returned to England, this time taking all 3 children with her. On 25 October, the Swedish District Court decided to arrest the mother in her absence for what is described as &#8216;a serious case of child abduction&#8217;, and the prosecutor filed for an international arrest warrant. Subsequently, the family were stopped on arrival at the airport, as the children&#8217;s immigration status was unclear. The mother notably sent a message to the father inviting hm to come to England to collect the children. </span></p>

Weekly video contact was directed. He also required the mother to address any issues which she had not yet dealt with, including the status of any police investigation pursuant to her arrest on arrival. He directed the father to file a full bundle of documents in the Swedish proceedings, and that an officer of the Cafcass High Court team meet with the children to prepare a wishes and feelings report. That report, prepared by Allison Baker, who has given oral evidence to me, was dated 31 January 2024. She saw the children on 26 January 2024. </span></p>

He rejected an adjournment application made by Ms Papazian, counsel for the mother, and an application on her behalf for a Settlement Report in respect of the children. He recorded the father&#8217;s position that in default of a summary return order under the 1980 Hague Convention, he would seek a return under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction. He also asserted a wrongful removal to the UK in October 2023, at a time when the mother denied that the children remained habitually resident in Sweden. Both parties expressed an intention to engage in mediation, but unfortunately, there has been no time for that to commence before the listing of this final hearing. Permission for further statements was given.</span></p>

During this hearing, I was told by Ms Papazian for the mother that as an adjunct to those proceedings, (1) a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> report had been ordered on 24 November 2023, to be provided by 2 February 2024; and (2) the mother&#8217;s criminal solicitor had &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">commissioned a psychological assessment of the mother and the children</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8217; to consider the impact of a possible separation if the extradition took place. Apparently, the assessment of the mother had taken place by a Dr Donnelly on 19 January, and an assessment of the children on 2 February 2024. None of this information was passed by the mother to her counsel by 6 February, and so was not shared with the court at the PTR on that date, nor with the Cafcass reporter</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

I was told that the psychological report is expected to be available on 19 February, and that the extradition proceedings are coming back before the court on 26 February &#8216;to assess the outcome of the Hague Convention proceedings&#8217;. The final hearing is apparently fixed for 22 March 2024, at which an extradition order could be made in respect of the mother.</span></p>

The first and last of those interviews had not been revealed to this court before this hearing began, but both are pursuant to the mother&#8217;s attempts to avoid extradition. Before the hearing commenced, Ms Papazian for the mother indicated that she sought an adjournment of the hearing to enable a Settlement Report to be prepared, notwithstanding that the children had barely been in this jurisdiction for a month when the application for a return order was made. This would of course have required further questioning of the children from Ms Baker. Neither Ms Baker nor I then knowing of the full extent of the questioning that had already taken place, Ms Papazian asked Ms Baker whether she felt that further questions on that topic would be required to provide a fair picture. Ms Baker was very clear that they would not, and that this was not as far as she was concerned a settlement case.  </span></p>

It was surely too on that basis that the mother engaged in those proceedings, filed 3 statements, raised both the issue of consent and her allegations of domestic violence against the father, and then appealed the court&#8217;s final decision, but on the basis of the welfare analysis performed, and not on the basis that the Swedish Court lacked jurisdiction. None of the various Swedish judges themselves raised their jurisdiction as a possible question. Further the Swedish Court has gone on to issue an arrest warrant based on the mother&#8217;s failure to comply with its orders. I can therefore see no basis upon which I can question or reconsider the Swedish court&#8217;s position on jurisdiction in these proceedings &#8211; if the mother takes issue with that determination, then she can take it up with the Swedish court.  </span></p>

In those circumstances, the child&#8217;s new environment might well have superseded the old as the place of the child&#8217;s habitual residence, and further significant roots and connections may have been established that render the summary process conducted under the 1980 Hague Convention no longer appropriate, such that the child is now settled. </span></p>

It has to be kept in mind that the settlement exception is intended to reflect welfare. The Article 12 settlement exception of all the exceptions is most welfare focused. The underlying purpose of the exception is to enable the court in furtherance of the welfare of the child to decline a summary return because imposing a summary return (i.e. without a more detailed consideration of welfare) might compound the harm caused by the original abduction by uprooting a child summarily from his by now familiar environment.</span></p>

There is no suggestion from her that such a move was ever discussed with or proposed to the father. It is also clear that she did not wish to remain there herself for any sustained period. Probably in December (in her Swedish appeal she suggested not until March), she left the children with her extended family and came to England. That was their position throughout the Swedish court proceedings in 2023. </span></p>

Then, after a period of 9 months without the regular care of either parent &#8211; almost entirely indirect contact only &#8211; their mother returned in late September 2023, and took them away from her mother and sister, to whose care they might have by now become accustomed, and brought them to this country, where they had never been before, and where the mother does not suggest that she has any previous roots or connections, prior to her arrival in December 2022. At the time when the father&#8217;s application was made, the children had not yet attended school in England, nor is there any evidence of social integration prior to that point.</span></p>

In all that time they had had no direct contact with their father, with whom they had, according to the Swedish court papers, previously had regular visits. Their immigration status remains uncertain. I am therefore confident that, when the father&#8217;s Hague application was made on 22 November 2023, these children could not in any real sense be described as &#8216;settled&#8217; in this jurisdiction. I have of course considered that just as with any consideration of habitual residence, settlement need not be complete as at the date of assessment, but only sufficient for the court&#8217;s broad assessment to be such that a discretionary welfare determination could now override what would otherwise be the principles of the Convention. However, I am clear that in this case, the mother does not come close to establishing the requisite degree of settlement for these children as at the date of the application. </span></p>

But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt;color:#000000">It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.</span><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8221; </span></p>

It is also the case that the mother raised the issue of consent in the Swedish proceedings in 2023, and that court rejected her arguments and found that the father had not consented to the children&#8217;s retention in X, based on evidence such as their continued registration as living at their former address in Sweden.

Her case is rather that he had agreed to allow her to take the children with her to X for a period of 2-3 years.

Text conversations which the mother has produced lack context, and could be consistent with the limited permission which the father says was given, just as much as her case. I also take into account the father&#8217;s consistent opposition to the children staying in X after their removal and throughout 2023. That he told the Swedish social services in 2022 that he was not concerned for the children&#8217;s safety then, when their mother was still with them, does not amount to acquiescing in their retention out of Sweden.</span></p>

In addition, they are also reported by their mother to have witnessed domestic abuse.  A reports having been hit by his father and he and B complained about their father screaming at them. Given their ages, I believe that A and B may now be experiencing some anxiety about their future. [40]</span></p>

Their objections as expressed are not so much objections to Sweden, but objections to being separated from her. A&#8217;s remark that he would go to Sweden if his parents reconciled was eloquent.  I remind myself that to give rise to a discretion, the objection must be to being returned to the country of the child&#8217;s habitual residence, not to living with a particular parent; although as explained in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, an objection to returning to a particular parent may, in some cases, be inextricably linked to a return to a particular country.</span></p>

Then the children were living with the mother&#8217;s family in X, and neither parent was offering their children daily care, as the direct result of choices and decisions made by the mother to which I have found that the father had never consented, and about which he consistently sought to take issue through the Swedish courts. </span></p>

She has also told the Swedish Court during its process that she would comply with its ruling, and later told Poole J in court on 11 December 2023 that she had been in the process of returning the children to Sweden when she was stopped entering England with them on 20 October 2023, although she did not now wish to return them. However, from the children&#8217;s perspective, which must be the Court&#8217;s focus, the circumstances are now very different from those which presented themselves to the Swedish Court in September 2023, when the substantive decision was made.</span></p>

Asked about this, Ms Baker expressed the view that all 3 children presented as being typical of their respective ages in terms of those characteristics. In that regard, I consider that certainly in respect of A, who is 11, and also, more marginally in respect of B, who is 8, I should give careful consideration to taking those objections into account. For C, aged 5, this would not be the case, but he falls to be considered together with his siblings for these purposes. </span></p>

In those circumstances, I am ultimately satisfied that the better assessment of the issues presenting themselves in this case is not in relation to the children&#8217;s objections, but rather in respect of the grave risk that they could suffer harm or be put into an intolerable situation if their return leads to their mother&#8217;s removal from them and incarceration. I have come to this view in part because of the children&#8217;s clearly expressed views about wanting to remain with her, which is not the current determination of the Swedish Court. I will deal with the detail of the Art.13(b) defence below. When the Swedish Court made their determination, of course, the children were not living with the mother. I make it clear that there are no sufficient objections to a return to Sweden otherwise that would meet the threshold, and that what I say below about protective measures under Art.13(b) will subsume any residual concerns about the children&#8217;s expressed views.</span></p>

It would be indeterminate because the court has no information as to when or how the mother and the children would be together again. These children, aged five and three, would be leaving their lifelong main carer without anyone being able to tell them when they will see her again. In my view it is not difficult to describe that situation, in the circumstances of this case, as one which they should not be expected to tolerate. I acknowledge that the current situation has been caused by the mother&#8217;s actions, and that she was herself responsible for severing the children from their father but, as referred to above, the court&#8217;s focus must be on the children&#8217;s situation and not the source of the risk.&#8221;</span></p>

But the court in the requested State cannot make orders that would exceed its jurisdiction or that are not required to mitigate an established grave risk. It should be noted that voluntary undertakings are not easily enforceable, and therefore may not be effective in many cases.

Is there any process whereby the children can remain with their mother pending their return to Sweden and the matter coming before the District Court for at least a summary reconsideration in light of the changed circumstances since the original order was made? Is the mother&#8217;s Swedish lawyer right to say that the father can take no steps to enable that to happen? If he cannot, then how is a situation to be achieved whereby these children can be returned to Sweden without avoidable trauma to allow the Courts there to decide where their welfare interests lie?  Finally, what if the mother refuses to comply with a return order, with the consequence that the extradition process goes ahead? From the tenor of the reports being prepared, she is evidently intending to use the children&#8217;s attachment to her as a shield in those proceedings.

I stress that I am very clear that the Swedish Court is the court that should be taking welfare decisions about these children, but their vulnerabilities, which have been exacerbated, if not created, by the mother&#8217;s behaviour over the past 18 months, in removing them from Sweden, abandoning them in X, returning to collect them after her arguments were rejected in Sweden, and finally removing them once again to a new and unfamiliar environment in England, are there, and fall to be addressed.</span></p>

However, I have to consider the children&#8217;s current state of mind and sense of allegiance to their mother, which Ms Baker notes. If arrangements could be put in place which would enable the mother and children now to return to Sweden, without risk of her arrest on entry, and to remain with her until the first hearing could be convened of the court in Sweden charged with dealing with welfare issues in relation to the children &#8211; I assume the District Court in Umea &#8211; then there may be no sufficient grounds on which the court could exercise its discretion to decline to make a return order. </span></p>
