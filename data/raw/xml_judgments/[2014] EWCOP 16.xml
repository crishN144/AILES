	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 July 2014, I read documents, heard submissions, oral representations from N&#8217;s former husband and evidence from the jointly instructed independent expert. At the end of the process, there was complete agreement between the parties as to what, in N&#8217;s best interests, the treating clinicians should and should not be permitted to do. I expressed my complete satisfaction with the course outlined, commenting that Dr Barry Jones, consultant gastroenterologist, had given immensely impressive and utterly compelling evidence. Subsequently, an order was submitted and approval given.</p>

A further attempt to site a RIG was made on 26 June 2014 with the same outcome.  An endeavour was made on the same day to site an intravenous line into one of the large veins of her arm, for the purpose of delivering total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but N pulled it out immediately.  </p>

Nevertheless, she succeeded in removing the NG tube within around 40 minutes by hooking her finger around the tube adjacent to her nose (above the attachment point of the bridle, thereby circumventing its anchoring effect) and removing it from her stomach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She is considered to be unsuitable for the administration of TPN (intravenous nutrition), because this must be done through a large vessel in either the neck or the arm. It is considered very likely or almost certain that she would pull out the line, as occurred on 26 June 2014; this would be potentially hazardous because of a significant bleeding risk.  It is not possible for TPN to be administered through the smaller vessels in the foot.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 June 2014 N was reviewed by a consultant neurologist, Dr H, who concluded it was very unlikely that there would be significant neurological recovery, the sub-arachnoid haemorrhage having occurred 12 months previously.  In his opinion, N&#8217;s physical resistance to intervention is more likely to be the consequence of an aversion to sensory stimulus than meaningful action because she responds in a similar way to any physical contact on her left side, even light touch.</p>

If she were to pull it out this could result in small bowel perforation and leakage of feed and intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity, which would be life threatening and very painful.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr K, consultant surgeon, considers that N&#8217;s physical resistance practically prohibits the replacement and maintenance of the usual options for artificial feeding, unless N were to be physically restrained or so heavily sedated as to require a lifelong High Dependency Unit bed, which he does not consider to be in her best interests.  He is concerned that if N were to pull out the tube inserted by way of jejunostomy there would be a high risk of leakage of bowel content, with consequent peritonitis and life-threatening sepsis.  N already has intra-abdominal adhesions, which would increase the risks of surgery somewhat, and has a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in place (for hydrocephalus) which creates a risk of encephalitis &#8211; a severe neurological complication &#8211; if there is abdominal infection.  </p>

On balance, Mr K does not consider it appropriate to attempt jejunostomy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2 July 2014 a second gastroenterology opinion was sought from Dr R, consultant gastroenterologist at the Trust. She considered that N is unsuitable for total parenteral nutrition (TPN - intravenous feeding), because she is likely to pull out the line; and that further attempts at a NG tube are unlikely to be successful. If she were to pull out the tube whilst a feed is running there is a risk of aspiration.  Dr R considered that a jejunostomy placed on the right side was an option, but that there was still a high risk that N would pull it out, which could have significant consequences.  A PEG was also considered possible, but there were similar risks if it was pulled out.</p>

It is possible, said Dr Jones, that there is &#8220;some very minimal level of cognitive function. But if she is able to perceive her present situation, that would make it even more painful. If she cannot, then the result is the same.&#8221; Dr Jones&#8217; belief is that to impose a possible feeding treatment regime upon N would not be in her best interests.</p>

The question is not the same as, &#8216;Is it in Anthony Bland&#8217;s best interests that he should die?&#8217;  The latter question assumes that it is lawful to perpetuate life: but such perpetuation of life can only be achieved if it is lawful to continue to invade the bodily integrity of the patient by invasive medical care.&#8221;</p>
