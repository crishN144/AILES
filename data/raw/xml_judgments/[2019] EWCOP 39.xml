	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">JB is a young man who is now 36 years old.  Since May 2014<span style="font-style:italic"/>he has been living in a supported residential placement where he is subject to a comprehensive care plan which imposes significant limitations on his ability to function independently.  In particular, there are restrictions on his access to the local community where he lives, his contact with third parties, and his access to social media and the internet. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">The restrictions on JB&#8217;s ability to socialise freely with whomever he chooses have been imposed primarily in order to prevent him from behaving in a sexually inappropriate manner towards women.  The primary thrust of the evidence is that JB lacks the insight or ability to communicate appropriately with women to whom he is attracted.  On occasions his advances have lacked appropriate social inhibition and, whilst he has never been charged with (let alone convicted of) any criminal offence, there is a concern that his behaviour, if unrestrained, may result in his exposure to the criminal justice system and risk to potentially vulnerable females. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">Throughout the course of this litigation, JB has made it very plain that he desperately wants to find a girlfriend with whom he can develop and maintain a relationship.  He is anxious to have a sexual partner and believes that the current restrictions represent an unfair and unwarranted interference in his basic rights to a private and family life.  Those rights are, of course, reflected in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which confirms the respect given to autonomy in matters of private life.  It is accepted that JB&#8217;s current needs make it unlikely that he will be able to live independently without support in the context of a future family life with a partner of his choice.  The principal issue at this stage is whether he has capacity to consent to sexual relations.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">There are other aspects of JB&#8217;s care plan which will be subjected to judicial scrutiny on a best interests basis in a forthcoming hearing which has been listed later this year in October (2019).  This hearing was originally listed as a split hearing to deal with several issues of law in relation to a raft of declarations sought by the parties in relation to JB&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about different aspects of his care.  Many of those issues have now fallen away on the basis of agreement in relation to the legal tests which fall to be applied.  The principal issue which I am asked to determine relates to what is said by both parties to this litigation to be a lacuna in the existing law in relation to the test for capacity to consent to sexual relations.  Notwithstanding the plethora of authority on the subject, including the very recent judgments of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">B (by her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor) v A Local Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/913" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 913" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 913</ref> and Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">London Borough of Tower Hamlets v NB and AU </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/2" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 2</ref>7, the local authority contends that there remains &#8220;a hard-edged legal question&#8221; in relation to what information is relevant for the purposes of assessing the issue of capacity to consent to sexual relations. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;The critical point is that, unless an understanding that the other person must be able to and must in fact consent is required for capacity in relation to sex, the criminal law would not be sufficient to protect P; and that, if the criminal law is left to regulate such conduct, it will mean that sexual offences will be committed by incapacitated people (assuming they have criminal responsibility) before the law will intervene to prevent such damaging conduct by the imposition of criminal restrictions.  To permit such a situation to continue would be a derogation of responsibility by the Court of Protection.  Also, criminal law would only impose a time-limited level of restriction in any event.  It will be appreciated that, for people like JB, understanding that the other party must be able to and must in fact consent is a highly relevant factor to protect him from committing a criminal offence for which he could be imprisoned or, more likely, hospitalised under the MHA in circumstances where, due to his mental impairment, he cannot comprehend or acknowledge the concept of consent.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">The Official Solicitor submits that if capacity to consent to sexual relations is only established in circumstances where a potentially incapacitous individual can demonstrate an understanding of, with the ability to retain, use and weigh, these multiple elements of consent, the test becomes overburdened with unnecessary technicalities.  It would raise the bar from the deliberately low level at which it has been set in order to avoid discriminating against vulnerable adults with learning disabilities and other cognitive challenges who, despite those challenges, should be entitled nevertheless to exercise one of the most basic and instinctive functions of a human existence.  As a matter of policy, the Official Solicitor submits that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> cannot, and should not, be used as the means of imposing on a protected party restrictions which are designed either to avoid the risk of criminal offending or for the protection of the public at large.  Whilst these may well be proper considerations in the context of a best interests decision for such a party, including JB, they should not feature as an integral and essential element of the test for capacity per se in the arena of sexual relations.  The fundamental submission made on behalf of the Official Solicitor is that the consent of others is not relevant to the question of whether JB, or any other protected party, has capacity to consent to sexual relations. </p>

In this context, I have been asked to consider whether the decision of Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v TZ </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/973" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 973" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 973</ref> can be applied outside of the factual matrix of that particular case.  </p>

It is not an irrelevant consideration: indeed (as we have emphasised) the statute mandates that it be taken into account, but the notional process of using and weighing information attributed to the protected person should not involve a refined analysis of the sort which does not typically inform the decision to consent to sexual relations made by a person of full capacity.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.09in;text-indent:0.21in">We agree.  Perhaps yet another way of expressing the same point is to suggest that the information typically, and we stress typically, regarded by persons of full capacity as relevant to the decision whether to consent to sexual relations is relatively limited.  The temptation to expand that field of information in an attempt to simulate more widely informed decision-making is likely to lead to what Bodey J rightly identified as both paternalism and a derogation from personal autonomy.&#8221; </p>

That case concerned a married couple who had enjoyed what appears to have been a close and loving relationship which was essentially monogamous over the course of twenty-five years or more.  The wife became a protected party in the context of the litigation which flowed from concerns about her capacity to consent to ongoing sexual relations with her husband.  Hayden J found that all the evidence pointed to her having retained capacity to give such consent.  The capacity assessment in that case was undoubtedly driven in part by its particular factual matrix. In this case, JB has a very strong desire to have sexual intercourse with a woman or women who, as yet, remain unidentified.   Much of the focus of the local authority&#8217;s argument in relation to an expanded test for capacity has been on the protective aspects of such a test.  The protective reach or ambit of its proposed extension goes not only to JB himself (in terms of reducing, if not eliminating, the risk of a criminal prosecution for assault or, at worst, rape) but to the wider protection of potential victims of any such assault.   <span style="font-style:italic">The statutory principles </span></p>

There is no suggestion in the simple test formulated by Hedley J that an understanding of this choice extended beyond the contemplation of the person whose capacity is in question.  In other words, P&#8217;s own subjective choice was an important factor which must be factored into an assessment of capacity over and above a basic understanding of the mechanics of the act of intercourse itself.    </p>

In the criminal law it arises most commonly in respect of a single incident and a particular person where the need to distinguish between capacity and consent may have no significance on the facts.  In a case such as the present, however, capacity has to be decided in isolation from any specific circumstances of sexual activity as the purpose of the capacity inquiry is to justify the prevention of any such circumstances arising.  There is of course no absolute distinction between capacity in civil and capacity in criminal law, it is merely that they fall to be considered in very different contexts and often, perhaps, for different purposes.&#8221; Later, at paragraph 26, Hedley J reached this conclusion: </p>

This analysis is what drives the evaluation of capacity to consent to sexual relations.

Additionally he acknowledges not being able to judge women&#8217;s reactions to him and that he is unwilling to directly ask for clarification of these issues.  In these and similar situations the risk is of [JB] sexually touching these women without consent.  In terms of vulnerable women who do not have the capacity to consent to sexual relations, there is a risk of [JB] not recognising or respecting this fact, resulting in the potential for rape to occur.&#8221; </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">D Borough Council v B </span>(see paragraph 25 above), Mostyn J had considered the attempt by the SJE in that case to introduce greater specificity into the relatively simple test proposed by Munby J which then reflected the appropriate level of capacity required.  Part of the refinement which that expert had proposed was an additional requirement that &#8220;both (or all) parties to the act need to consent to it&#8221; (para 23).  In that case, counsel for the local authority had argued that a new general test should properly include a partner-specific dimension which required an individual to understand the reasonably foreseeable consequences of having sex with someone else. For these purposes, it was argued that regard must also be had to the characteristics and personality of the other person which must also be factored into the test (paragraph 27). </p>

In the case of NB where there was unlikely to be an issue as to the protected party having sexual relations with anyone other than her husband in the context of a long and monogamous marriage, issues relating to an understanding of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections carried little, if any, particular weight given the context of her particular circumstances. </p>

The latter is a primal expression of our humanity and existence as sexual beings.  It is an essential part of our basic DNA as reproductive human beings.  As Hayden J and, before him, Sir Brian Leveson P have confirmed, sexual relations form a fundamental aspect of our humanity, common to all regardless of whether an individual suffers from some impairment of the mind.  The whole process of decisionmaking in this context &#8211; even in the case of persons of full capacity &#8211; is &#8220;largely visceral rather than cerebral, owing more to instinct and emotion than to analysis&#8221;.   </p>

If judged incapacitous because he or she has no comprehension that his or her consent is required before engaging in acts of a sexual nature, he or she is potentially consigned to celibate abstention unless capacity is established at some point in the future.  In my judgment, to argue that a full and complete understanding of consent (in terms recognised by the criminal law) is an essential component of capacity to have sexual relations is to confuse the <span style="font-style:italic">nature </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">character </span>of a sexual act with its lawfulness.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.09in">If these conceptual issues are difficult enough for the capacitous to grasp, it seems to me that very great care is needed before imposing on the potentially incapacitous the need to understand these quasi-criminal principles and the potential for consent to be withdrawn by the other party at any stage.  In my judgment, importing into the test for capacity and/or the information which informs that test a requirement for an understanding of parallel and continuing consent in a sexual partner imposes a test which is set too high.  I do not accept that it is appropriate to increase the bar for the potentially incapacitous and thus potentially deprive them of a fundamental and basic human right to participate in sexual relations merely because the raising of that bar might provide protection for either P himself or for any victim of non-consensual sex when those consequences are viewed through the prism of the criminal law.   Whilst the ability to use and weigh information remains relevant to a capacity assessment in the domain of sexual activity, it should not involve a refined or nuanced analysis which would not typically inform any decision to consent to sexual relations made by a fully capacitous individual.  The law in this context strives to assist a potentially incapacitous individual to participate in the fullest experience of life.  JB has already made it abundantly clear that he wishes his experience of life to include sexual relations and the ability to find a partner.  To require him to demonstrate as an aspect of his fundamental capacity in this context a full appreciation of both his own and a partner&#8217;s initial and ongoing consent throughout the course of that sexual activity would be to impose on him a burden which a capacitous individual may not share and may well be unlikely to discharge.  It is true that knowledge of the absence of consent might expose either to the risk of criminal prosecution but in both cases each is entitled to make the same mistakes which all human beings can, and do, make in the course of a lifetime.    </p>

That will inevitably involve an appreciation on the part of P that sexual activity without the other party&#8217;s consent may well result in serious consequences in terms of what is considered acceptable behaviour.

In essence, Mr Patel has argued that, whilst it is permissible to weigh the risk of P entering the criminal justice system and/or being the target of some form of vigilante violence as part of a best interests analysis, what is not permissible is the imposition of a restriction on his liberty in order to prevent the possibility of offending insofar as it purely risked harm to those other than P.

These are essentially &#8216;best interest&#8217; decisions.  Dr Thrift concluded that JB lacked capacity as to the contact he had with women.  When these proceedings were commenced, the local authority was seeking a declaration to that effect.  Its position as the authority responsible for JB&#8217;s care has now changed.  It is conceded that in relation to contact with others, the test is act-specific and cannot be gender-specific.

At the present time, his aspirations may not be grounded in reality because of his particular vulnerabilities.  It seems to me that it is not for this court now to determine whether or not his aspirations may ultimately be capable of realisation. </p>
