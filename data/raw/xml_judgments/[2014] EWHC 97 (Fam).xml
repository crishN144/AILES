The only route by which F can be placed permanently with her aunt and uncle is by them adopting her. The US immigration will not permit F to enter the USA to live permanently with her maternal relatives unless all the rights, duties and obligations of her surviving parent are finally terminated. In this jurisdiction that outcome can only be achieved by the making of an adoption order. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">In most child care cases a choice will fall to be made between two or more options. The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option. </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">The linear approach, in my view, is not apt where the judicial task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for the child's future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare. </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">A further concern about the linear model is that a process which acknowledges that long-term public care, and in particular adoption contrary to the will of a parent, is 'the most draconian option', yet does not engage with the very detail of that option which renders it 'draconian' cannot be a full or effective process of evaluation. Since the phrase was first coined some years ago, judges now routinely make reference to the 'draconian' nature of permanent separation of parent and child and they frequently do so in the context of reference to 'proportionality'. Such descriptions are, of course, appropriate and correct, but there is a danger that these phrases may inadvertently become little more than formulaic judicial window-dressing if they are not backed up with a substantive consideration of what lies behind them and the impact of that on the individual child's welfare in the particular case before the court. If there was any doubt about the importance of avoiding that danger, such doubt has been firmly swept away by the very clear emphasis in Re B on the duty of the court actively to evaluate proportionality in every case. </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">In mounting this critique of the linear model, I am alive to the fact that, of course, a judgment is, by its very nature, a linear structure; in common with every other linear structure, it has a beginning, a middle and an end. My focus is not upon the structure of a judge's judgment but upon that part of the judgment, indeed that part of the judicial analysis before the written or spoken judgment is in fact compiled, where the choice between options actually takes place. What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options. </span></p>

He concluded, &#8220;RO&#8217;s insight into the needs of F is limited and in my opinion is based on a belief that the natural biological link of a father and daughter, combined with his love will be enough to provide F with the care she will require in the future. RO&#8217;s involvement in the majority of F&#8217;s life for whatever reason [has] been inconsistent and does not demonstrate enough evidence of a father that is able to promote his daughter&#8217;s needs ahead of his own in the short term or long term. F needs absolute certainty about the ability of her care providers in the future, and the security of her care providers in the future. I am of the opinion that kinship care, by way of adoption is the best possible outcome for F and will provide her with long term stability and security that she desperately requires. Nothing short of adoption will do, as the identified placement with her maternal aunt and uncle is in America and F will have to be adopted to meet the requirements of their immigration law. This is a placement that will allow F to be brought up within her own family and will benefit from having contact with both her maternal and paternal family members, and half siblings.&#8221; [D128-129]. </p>

She needs stability, unconditional care and a loving family. Some of that you can deal with but not to the level that F needs&#8221;. </p>
