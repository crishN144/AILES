The fact-finding hearing, however, is not directly related to C but rather to the tragic death of C&#8217;s young sister, Elsie Scully-Hicks on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  </p>

Initially, I made a Reporting Restriction Order pending the completion of the criminal trial for murder of Matthew Scully-Hicks.   I could not permit the criminal trial to be derailed if my judgment had come into the public domain too early.  I make it quite clear, however, that the Reporting Restriction Order would only last until the conclusion of the criminal trial.  I indicated that, at that point, I would give permission for this judgment to be reported in full although there would have to be some anonymisation, if only to protect C.  </p>

Matthew was born on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 1986 and is therefore aged 30.  Craig was born in 1981 and so is 35 years of age.  They met in 2006 in Swindon and commenced a relationship in January 2008.  They began to cohabit in June 2008.  Craig comes from the Cardiff area.  They decided to relocate to South Wales in late 2010.  Craig moved first in December 2010 and was joined by Matthew in March 2011.  Initially, they lived in Wellwright Road, Fairwater, Cardiff.    They became engaged in May 2011 and married in August 2012 in Portugal.  They very much wanted to have a family and became approved as adopters.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">C was placed with Matthew and Craig by the Vale of Glamorgan Council in the same year that C was born.  It was agreed between Matthew and Craig that Matthew would give up work as an employer services consultant and become C&#8217;s full-time carer, although he continued as a part-time fitness instructor.  Craig continued to work full-time in responsible employment that required him to work away from home on a regular basis.  It is clear, however, that he too played a significant part in caring for C.  Absolutely no problems were identified with the placement such that an adoption order was made in favour of Matthew and Craig.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, Elsie sustained an injury to her right leg.  Craig was at work.  Matthew said she was quiet but did not seem to be in pain.  Medical advice was sought from the GP on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 as she did not seem to be able to weight bear.  Dr Marina Arulanandam says she was told that Elsie had fallen off a baby walker.  She was given an appointment at the hospital and was X-rayed on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015.  The report from the hospital also says that she was pushing a walker and twisted her leg as she was leaning backwards.  A minimally displaced fracture was found to her distal right tibia, just above her ankle.  She was placed in a polymer cast and advised that she should remain non-weight bearing for the next three weeks.  It is clear that it was considered that the injury was entirely consistent with the description of the fall given by Matthew.  Moreover, it healed well.  Matthew says, however, that the description of the fall from a baby walker is incorrect.  He says she was supporting herself on a child&#8217;s work table in the kitchen and turned to see what he was doing.  She twisted and fell backwards onto the wooden floor.  I will return to what was found when the X-ray was re-examined following her death.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following an incident on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015, Elsie developed a bruise to the left side of her forehead over her left eye.  Craig was again at work.  It appears that a text message was sent to Laura Neal, a social worker at the Vale of Glamorgan the same day telling her of the injury, although she did not reply to the text message until the following morning.  Later that morning, there was an adoption review at Wellright Road.  It was delayed from 10 am to 11 am as C was in a Christmas Concert that morning and both Matthew and Craig understandably wanted to attend.  The adoption review was attended by Cheryl Longley and Laura Neal, social workers and Eryl Bowers, the Independent Reviewing Officer, all from the Vale of Glamorgan.  Initially, all three did not recall seeing the bruise on that occasion.  Indeed, Cheryl said she believed she saw the bruise on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 although she has since said it must have been 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  She did, however, say that she was told the Health Visitor had seen the bruise but it is clear that it was not until 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2015 that the Health Visitor attended.  Equally, all three Vale employees said they could not recall Craig being present at the adoption review, although his case is that he was there for around 45 minutes until he had to go to collect C.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2015, the Health Visitor, Jodie Golten attended at the home.  She saw the bruise on Elsie&#8217;s forehead and over her left eye.  She says she was given no explanation and advised medical attention for Elsie but Matthew told her he had already done so.   This is heavily in dispute.  It is also alleged that, on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016, Matthew said Elsie had fallen forward onto a plastic toy in the kitchen.  He denies this.  In his statement dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016, he says that Elsie was playing with a toy kitchen and a magnetised door of the play kitchen swung open causing her to lose balance and bang her head on the edge of the kitchen worktop.     There are two aspects to this.  First, how was this injury caused?  Second, why was it not brought to the attention of the adoption court?   </p>

He says he was upstairs at the time dealing with the washing.  Elsie didn&#8217;t cry but lay very still with her eyes open.  She started to cry by the time he rang 999.  She vomited twice by the time the paramedic arrived.  One vomit included some blood.  It was suspected she had a head injury.  She was taken to hospital and observed for four hours before being discharged.  No CT scan was taken as she was not sufficiently unwell. It is said that, thereafter, she was not herself and vomited on a number of occasions although this appears to have lessened as the days past.   </p>

Ten days later, on 26th April 2016, Elsie developed a &#8220;unilateral convergent squint&#8221;.  Craig says her left eye appeared to be turned inwards towards her nose and it became worse.  It was noted by an Aunt on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2016.  This was not brought to the attention of the adoption court either.  The adoption order was made on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.   </p>

Matthew spent the day with both children and his twenty-seven year old niece, Kerry Richards.  She left at 5.20pm.  Nothing remarkable occurred.  Elsie fed normally and played quite happily.  She had sausage and vegetables for her tea which she finished at 5.45pm.  Matthew walked her into the front room holding her hand.  She sat watching TV with C.  Matthew changed her nappy at around 6pm and put her into her baby-grow.  She was normal and not unsettled.  He left her lying on the floor whilst he took her dirty nappy for disposal.  When he returned, he says she was unresponsive.  Her eyes were open but she was staring blankly and not breathing.  He called 999.  It was difficult to get through to the ambulance service so he says he started CPR himself which was later continued by professionals when they arrived.  Elsie was suffering from cardiac arrest.  There was no evidence of cardiac output for seventeen minutes, a very long period of time.  Elsie was taken to the Children&#8217;s Hospital for Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff and, in due course, to its Intensive Care Unit.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She was clearly desperately unwell.  On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016, she died after life support was withdrawn.  Initially, C returned to Matthew and Craig.  There is no doubt that C has a warm and affectionate relationship with both of them.  The medical evidence, however, began to be assembled.  The pathologist, Dr Stephen Leadbeatter&#8217;s first report is dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016.  He found a faded bruise 0.4 cm in diameter; 4cm above and 1 cm to the left of the left eye.  Dr Nia John, a consultant paediatrician, reported on 15th June 2016.   She said that a scan on admission to hospital revealed that Elsie had extensive bilateral subdural haemorrhages with evidence of acute and chronic bleeding.  There was also severe hypoxic ischemic brain damage.  She considered this was indicative of recent injury (less than ten days old) and consistent with a shaking type injury.  The X-ray of the injury sustained on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 was re-examined.  A second fracture was detected, namely a metaphyseal fracture of the distal femur.  She said it was unusual but not impossible to fracture two bones in the same minor fall.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016, the Local Authority, the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff, which is the Local Authority responsible for the area where Matthew and Craig live, asked them to agree to C being voluntarily accommodated pursuant to section 76 of the Social Services and Well-Being Act (Wales) 2014.  The parents declined.  Subsequently, Matthew left the home for 24 hours and C remained there with Craig, supervised by Tricia and Nigel Hicks (the parents of Matthew).  The Local Authority was not in agreement with this position and applied for a care order on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016. The case was allocated to me the same day by Carson DJ given the very serious issues involved but the Local Authority&#8217;s application for a care order was heard by HHJ Edwards on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016.  Notwithstanding the opposition of the parents, she made an interim care order with a plan for removal as a &#8220;holding position&#8221;. C was removed and went to foster carers.  Subsequently, the parents asked for C to be placed with either Matthew&#8217;s parents or Craig&#8217;s sister and her husband.  I refused the application on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2016, although they were subsequently approved by the fostering panel as kinship carers.  </p>

The sickness stopped around the time her eye started to turn inward but she seemed much happier and back to her normal bubbly self.  She suffered from a nose bleed on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016.  The turn in her eye became more prominent thereafter.  He was contacted by Matt by telephone on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  Matthew was crying on the telephone.  He added that he never heard Matt shout at Elsie or C.  Matt never appeared angry with the children.  He had heard Matt raise his voice to tell them off but, in general, he is quiet and mild-mannered.  Matt never swore at them and was very patient and calm.

First, I wanted to know whether or not Elsie&#8217;s birth mother had been informed of her death.

The Vale indicated that it was unaware of the birth mother&#8217;s whereabouts save that she had been released from prison.  I therefore made orders against the Department of Work and Pensions to obtain her address.  Rightly, it was felt that it would not be right to tell the birth mother in the week before Christmas.  I adjourned any further consideration of the issue to the end of the fact finding hearing but indicated that an application should be made for a reporting restrictions order.   </p>

I have also received the post-mortem report of Dr Stephen Leadbeatter dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2016.   He concluded that Elsie had suffered recent and previous bleeding below the dura mater each side of the brain as well as bilateral retinal haemorrhages with perimacular folds.  There had been a recent fracture of her right lambdoid skull, which is a consequence of an impact to the head.  There were microfractures of the inner aspect of the posterior end of each of the left third and right fourth and fifth ribs.  He cannot exclude the possibility that there was a subdural haemorrhage from the fall down stairs with a possible re-bleeding but examples of this happening are not associated with acute clinical changes, nor significant neurological decline.  Moreover, the fractures were recent.  The cause of Elsie&#8217;s death was hypoxic/ischaemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest in a child with acute chronic subdural haemorrhage and a blunt head injury including fracture of the right lambdoid suture.  </p>

The first to report was Dr Karl Johnson, a paediatric radiologist whose report is dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016. He re-examined the X-ray taken on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 and found two fractures, namely one of the distal right tibial metadiaphysis (just above the ankle joint) and a second of the distal right femoral metadiaphysis (thigh bone).  Both were no older than 11 days at the time of the X-ray and such fractures have a strong connection with non-accidental injury.  They would require a significant amount of force and would cause pain and distress.  Whilst he could not exclude the description given of the events of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 as a possible cause of either one of these injuries, he was of the view that such a fall would typically result in a single isolated injury.

He concluded that the head injury occurred at the point of Elsie&#8217;s acute collapse and that death was from hypoxic/ischaemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest with acute chronic subdural haemorrhage.  There was evidence of blunt head injury including a fracture of the right lamboid suture.  There was fresh subdural bleeding over both cerebral hemispheres and hypoxic/ischaemic changes as well as retinal haemorrhages.  These would not be expected to occur spontaneously.  Such changes require a traumatic event such as an acceleration/deceleration injury.  A re-bleed of an earlier injury would not explain the acute collapse.  Moreover, if there was a fractured skull, it would only be explicable by trauma involving impact.  It was implausible that Elsie could have been injured prior to her normal feed at 5.45 pm.  The point of collapse was the point of injury. </p>

The description of the fall on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 is not consistent with the two fractures sustained.  It was highly unlikely the fall described could have caused either fracture.  The evidence indicates that Elsie made a full recovery from the fall down the stairs on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2016.  It is highly unlikely that the squint on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016 was as a result of raised intracranial pressure as such pressure would have been demonstrated by other signs.  On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016, Elsie was shaken violently causing flexion and extension of her head to the point which resulted in the bilateral retinal haemorrhages and the subdural haemorrhages.  She would have been rendered unconscious due to the interruption of blood flow to the brain.  He speculated that there was blunt trauma to her head as the final event such as if she was thrown to the floor or against a wall.  Micro-fractures to the ribs would have been caused by significant compression forces which are uncommon during resuscitation.  Moreover, when they occur, they tend to be anterior not posterior.  No metabolic cause had been found to explain the injuries.  It was highly unlikely the squint related to the fall down the stairs as she was otherwise entirely normal.  Jumping on a trampoline had no relevance to the injuries sustained.  </p>

There were bilateral retinal, optic nerve head and optic nerve sheath haemorrhages which could be explained by severe head injury which occurred when Elsie suffered an acute collapse three to four days prior to her death.  No accidental cause for such trauma has been identified.  In addition, there was a bilateral optic nerve sheath haemosiderin deposition which might indicate a component of older bleeding.  This was all highly consistent with non-accidental injury in the absence of severe accidental trauma.  In addition to the recent extensive haemorrhage, some of the haemosiderin present might represent an earlier episode of bleeding which might be consistent with it occurring at the time of the fall down the stairs.</p>

There was no evidence of underlying bone disease.  The left tibia showed the presence of periosteal haemorrhage and an associated minor periosteal reaction which appeared to be between three to five days old at the time of death.  There were tiny cortical metaphyseal fractures to the left femur, again estimated at between three to five days old at death.  There were corner fractures of the costovertebral metaphasis of the posterior elements of the left third, right fourth and right fifth ribs, also estimated at three to five days old at the time of death.  Finally, there was the presence of a complex fracture through the lamboid region of the skull which had propagated through bone and along a fissure.  Again, he would age this as between three to five days old.  All this was very strongly indicative of non-accidental injury as Elsie had sustained metaphyseal injuries to five different bones at three different sites (the left femur; three posterior ribs and the skull).  </p>

I remind myself, however, that the controversy in this area, advanced by a very small number of experts, relates to cases where there are no other injuries other than the triad.  On any view, that is not the case here.  I accept, of course, the reasoning in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Harris</span> that, whilst the triad is a strong pointer towards non-accidental injury, it is not possible on its own to find that the triad must automatically and necessarily lead to such a diagnosis.  All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account.  As Gage LJ said, such cases are fact specific and will be determined on their individual facts.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Two doctors dealt with the injuries to Elsie&#8217;s leg in November 2015.  Dr Karl Johnson, a consultant paediatric radiologist reviewed the X-rays taken at the time.  He was quite clear that there had been two fractures not one.  The first was just above the ankle and the second was just above the knee but only one had been recognised at the time.  As I have not heard from those responsible for reviewing the X-rays at the hospital, I intend to make no findings as to whether or not it was reasonable that the second fracture was not discovered in November 2015.  It will be a matter for an Extended and Concise Child Practice Review.  The failure to spot the second fracture did, however, have significant consequences at the time as Matthew&#8217;s explanation was accepted without question.  As there was no evidence of bone healing, Dr Johnson said that the injuries were no older than eleven days at the time of the x-ray. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He could not quantify the force required but it was significant.  He was of the view that an accidental fall by a toddler, as described by Matthew, would typically result in a single fracture but not two fractures.  Indeed, often it would not result in any fractures.  If Elsie had turned over on her ankle, the fracture would have been slightly lower down whereas this fracture was above the ankle joint.  Ms Crowley suggested that the twisting fall might have caused the ankle fracture with Elsie falling on her knee to explain the second fracture.  Dr Johnson did not accept that this was possible, repeating that any such fall would at worst result in one fracture due to the different mechanisms required to cause two.</p>

He said it would be &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; if two fractures occurred from the same minor turn and fall.   He told me such falls happen every day to toddlers who are very unstable.   These fractures are not associated with such a fall, whereas they are associated with trauma and can be caused by shaking as the legs flay wildly around in the course of such an incident.   I accept the evidence in this regard of both Dr Johnson and Dr Rose.</p>

It has to be said that, despite the very best efforts of Ms Crowley on behalf of Matthew Scully-Hicks, the expert evidence provided a very strong body of opinion that Elsie had suffered trauma immediately before her collapse on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  The five experts remained firm as to their written conclusions during their oral evidence, notwithstanding a very thorough and comprehensive challenge being put by Ms Crowley on Matthew&#8217;s behalf.

As so often with court to court links, it was impossible to establish a connection.  This happens so regularly with court to court links that I have got to the point that I do not look forward to cases involving such connections.  In the end, the Professor gave evidence by telephone and I am satisfied that this did not affect the quality of his evidence or the weight to which I can give it.  In cross-examination by Mr Tillyard for the Local Authority, he was of the view that there had been trauma to the left tibia that was insufficient to cause a fracture.  He postulated that it was a blow of some sort. Having said that, when asked about this by Ms Crowley, he told me that the insertion of a line into Elsie in the Intensive Care Unit in that area could well explain the tissue damage.  I have no evidence that there was a line inserted in that area at some point but, equally, I have no evidence that there was not.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He was clear that there was a fracture to the bottom of the left femur, adjacent to the knee joint.  The fracture was into the growth plate and into the bone at the interface between the bone and the cartilage.  A twisting mechanism could cause such damage at or around the knee.  It was close to the tibia and, subject to the point about the line, he could envisage a mechanism by which both injuries occurred at the same time.   Turning to the ribs, he told the court that each of the main vertebrae has a little wing sticking out at the back and, as a result, the rib is hidden away from direct impact by this little wing of bone.  He said that the fracture would not have been caused by a direct blow but by a levering force delivered to the rib just outside the wing.  He considered the classic way of causing such fractures is by pressure from fingers exerting point pressure such as when gripping around the chest with the child looking at the person who has done the gripping.  The grip would have to be very hard.  If a child is being shaken, it is necessary to grip hard to ensure the child does not come away from your grasp.  He was clear that these injuries could not be caused in CPR as this does not exert that kind of leverage.  Finally, he was clear that there was a skull fracture<span style="font-weight:bold"/>slightly behind the right ear on a horizontal line going towards the back.  As it crossed a suture, it required the application of direct force.  It was a banging type injury.  As the skull of an eighteen-month old child is quite thick, it would have needed a blow to the head or an impact with something very hard.  He said it would be like a blow from a hammer or hitting a solid structure with the same force and was very strongly indicative of non-accidental injury.  Indeed, overall, Elsie had a number of different fractures where the indication of non-accidental injury is high.  In his view, taken altogether, they could only be explained by non-accidental injury.  He did not consider the physiotherapy to clear secretions and mucus could have caused the fractures.  Although fractures could be caused by physiotherapy, it would usually only be to the front and side of the chest.  He had never seen any evidence that physiotherapy can cause fractures right the way at the back of the ribs.  Moreover, physiotherapy was closer to the time of death than his dating of the fractures at three to five days old at the time of death.  There was no evidence of brittle bones.  All he saw was a lot of normal bones.  He saw no evidence at all of a reduction in bone sufficient to make this child fracture more easily. </p>

He was clear that she had made a full recovery by 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  Indeed, he said that she was reported as behaving entirely normally that day.  Apart from the squint, there was no concern as to her developmental progress or anything else.  When asked by Ms Crowley about the episodes of vomiting prior to the squint emerging, he said there may have been a small subdural bleed and swelling at the time of the fall but the swelling would resolve over time.  It would settle down in a few days.  The brain would not continue to expand.  Although vomiting and a squint are signs of raised intracranial pressure, it could not be an explanation in this case as she was behaving normally between vomiting episodes whereas increasing intracranial pressure does not wax and wane.  It just gets worse and worse in an alarming way and causes other problems such as headaches.  Moreover, it doesn&#8217;t suddenly resolve.  </p>

In relation to brittle bones, if Elsie was susceptible, she would have broken something when she fell downstairs.  He rejected both jumping on a trampoline with an adult and being placed in a car seat which then moved when the chair it was sitting on was moved as having anything to do with the injuries Elsie sustained.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The fourth expert to give evidence was Mr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neurosurgeon.  He told me that Elsie died from a head injury at the time of her collapse.  He had not seen any evidence of external hydrocephalus as it can only be picked up on a head scan when a child is well but there was nothing here to suggest it.  Moreover, it would enlarge the head to the 90<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile so the increase in head circumference between February and March from the 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile was of no consequence.   He told me that a sudden change from complete normality to profound collapse is very rare without a clear explanation.  It is very rare to get a cardiac arrest in children but, even if there was, it would not explain the multi-compartment subdural haemorrhage, the retinal haemorrhage or the skull fracture.  He was asked if this could be a re-bleed from an earlier injury.  He said the volume of membranes of old subdural blood seen was very small and there was fresh blood in one compartment that had no previous blood.  Although re-bleeds do occur, they do not lead to collapse without something else.  Equally, a re-bleed would also not cause retinal haemorrhages nor the skull fracture.  Ms Crowley asked why the bleeding could not move to another compartment of the brain not previously affected.  He explained that there are the equivalent of curtains between the compartments that usually prevent such transfer but, if it did occur, he would expect the watery old stuff to flow more easily than the fresh gooey stuff and there was no watery old stuff in this particular compartment.  He could not see how resuscitation could have caused the skull fracture.  It would only happen if someone slammed the child down in panic and there was no evidence that had occurred at all.  His conclusion was that the fall on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March had nothing to do with the collapse on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  Finally, Ms Crowley asked him about a report that Elsie had experienced excess bleeding when an attempt was made to put a line into her at the hospital.  In fact, this was subsequently dealt with by Dr Michelle Jardine but his evidence was that nobody had identified a major clotting abnormality and that severe head injury can cause transient clotting disorders.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The final expert witness was Dr Richard Bonshek, consultant ophthalmic pathologist.  He told me the bleeding he found to the eye was most likely caused by severe head injury.  From the information provided, he could not find anything that would cause that degree of bleeding in those locations other than trauma.  He dated the bleeding to three to four days or so before death.  It was unlikely to be caused by CPR, given the extent, pattern and combination of the bleeding.  When asked by Ms Crowley, he said he was not aware of anything involving ventilation causing retinal haemorrhages.  Research at Great Ormond Street Hospital showed retinal bleeding either as a result of severe trauma or some other explained cause.  Severe clotting defects could cause retinal haemorrhages, so it was important to exclude that but it would be unusual to have such massive bleeding of this nature as the first manifestation of such a condition.  In any event, this was irrelevant as he was satisfied Elsie had no such clotting disorder.  He was asked about other conditions, such as patholoedema or Terson syndrome.  He responded that Elsie only had mild patholoedema and she did not have Terson syndrome.    The only other explanation, he said, was severe trauma caused, in this age group, by non-accidental injury. The swelling in the brain did not cause retinal haemorrhages.  It could have caused some of the bleeding around the eyes but not the retinal folds which were crater shaped bleeds.  </p>

She confirmed that all the clotting results were normal and, although she was taken to various abnormal test results from the time in hospital by Ms Crowley, both Mr Williams for the Guardian and Mr Tillyard were able to get her to confirm subsequently that the initial results on admission to hospital were normal.

Where he had found evidence in two children of re-bleeding in the same area, it was attributed to re-injury not spontaneous re-bleeding.  Although a re-bleed could result in cardiac arrest, an explanation had to be found for the re-bleed and, in particular, the skull fracture.  It is right to say that he did say that it could be caused by a lesser degree of force than otherwise, which could be within the range of normal handling.

She was clear that Elsie had suffered a prolonged period of cardiac arrest, amounting to at least seventeen minutes, which meant that she was unlikely to survive.  She was brought to court primarily to deal with her comment that she had found Elsie to bleed extensively when at least one of the lines was put into her in the hospital.  She was clear that following Elsie&#8217;s long cardiac arrest, the blood can become thicker and the patient can bruise easily.  The blood clotting tests were undertaken and they were normal.  It was therefore not appropriate to make a judgment based on what she had said at the time she was inserting the line.  I take the view that this is the end of this aspect.  She was also asked about the need for physiotherapy and aggressive ventilation.  She told me that the physiotherapy was necessary to clear the fluid on Elsie&#8217;s chest.  She described it as &#8220;gentle&#8221; massage at the front and side which could look distressing but was performed by very experienced nurses.  I reject any suggestion that this could have caused rib fractures to the posterior ribs.  She accepted it was difficult to ventilate Elsie but Elsie did not go onto the very heavy oscillator.   It was hard work but the only deleterious consequences would be to her lungs, if it continued for days or weeks.  There would certainly not be damage to the brain.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is right to say that both Matthew and Craig Scully-Hicks passed the rigorous selection process to be approved as adopters with flying colours. I have seen numerous references from family and friends as to Matthew&#8217;s fine character.  These include references from his parents; an instructor at the gym where he used to train; one of his teachers at school; parents of two of his school friends, one of whom is a foster mother of thirty-two years standing; two other neighbours in Wellwright Road; a Woman Police Constable and the Manager of a gym where he worked.  All say that he was a man of the utmost respectability and good character who showed kindness, love, patience and care to anyone in whom he came into contact, including children.  I have seen an album of photographs showing very happy children with their careful and doting parents, enjoying activities and life in general, with happy and sunny dispositions.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also heard oral evidence from three such witnesses, namely Lisa Hill, Craig&#8217;s sister; Helen O&#8217;Gorman, Craig&#8217;s best friend, who also knew Matthew before Matthew and Craig met; and Kerry Richards, Matthew&#8217;s niece.  All three were equally complimentary about Matthew.  For example, Lisa Hill told me he was a &#8220;brilliant Uncle&#8221; to her three sons, now aged 5, 4 and 2.  She had no reservations about him and Craig starting their own family.  He wanted to give up work to look after the children, as his mother had done for him.  She regularly went out with him and the children whether it was to a toddler playgroup midweek or outings at the weekend.  He was besotted by the children and C and Elsie adored him.  She had no anxieties about Elsie who was a joy.  Matt treated them equally and loved them both.  Elsie showed no reservations at all about Matt. Indeed, Ms Hill spent some time with the family on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  They went to the toddler playgroup together.  Elsie was happy and in good spirits, playing normally.   </p>

He was wonderful with Lisa&#8217;s children.  Both Matt and Craig equally wanted children.  It was the final piece of the jigsaw for them.  She was so close to both men that she even had a key to their house.  She detected no stresses or complications with the children and she was there a lot.  Elsie was very well settled.  She was a happy nosey beautiful little girl and C is a wonderful little child. There was nothing that concerned her at all.   </p>

This was a poignant day as it would have been Elsie&#8217;s second birthday.  She was present on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and the day was typical.  She loved them.  They were her family.  They were amazing kids and Matthew was an amazing parent, so caring and considerate.  He always put the children first.  They idolised him and looked up to him.  Their eyes lit up when he walked in.  Indeed, Elsie would look for him if he left the room.  He is the most patient man she had ever met in her life.  The children never once &#8220;pushed his buttons&#8221; and they were his everything.  There was nothing striking at all on Wednesday 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  It was a normal day. C was like any sibling to Elsie.  C would give her a kiss.  They loved each other.</p>

I am satisfied that all three knew exactly why they had separated but the witnesses found it almost impossible to tell me and they were equally incredulous as to the suggestion that Matthew could have harmed Elsie.  Whilst this detracted from their objectivity, it does not lessen their observation evidence as to Matthew and the children which I accept was given genuinely and reflected what they saw.  It is the puzzle of this case.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also heard from three Vale of Glamorgan employees, Laura Neal, the social worker for Craig and Matthew; Cheryl Longley, Elsie/Shayla&#8217;s social worker and Eryl Bowers, the Independent Reviewing Officer.  All three primarily gave evidence in relation to the bruise sustained by Elsie in December 2015 but they confirmed the evidence given by the character witnesses.  Laura Neal told me that both Matthew and Craig were open minded and sensible in their approach to parenting.  It was a very positive assessment. C had some developmental delay but they had followed up on that delay.  She had no reservations in recommending them as adopters for Elsie.  The foster carer who had looked after Elsie before placement was very positive as to how they were parenting both Elsie and C.  In answer to a question by Ms Henke for Craig, she said that there was nothing to suggest Elsie would be injured.  Ms Longley told me that they met her high expectations and she was not disappointed.  Eryl Bowers said they were meeting Elsie&#8217; needs and a very positive situation was reported. Her observations were consistent with the reports.   I will, of course, have to deal in due course with the three serious injuries sustained by Elsie prior to 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  At this point, I am merely noting the position as it presented itself outwardly to all those who came into contact with the family.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I did, however, hear of another side.  I accept that this side did not surface until after the death of Elsie when the Police took witness statements from neighbours.  Susan Bevan of Wellwright Road, Fairwater confirmed her statement given to the Police on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016.  She said that she was not close to the Scully-Hicks but relations were perfectly friendly with the exchange of Christmas cards.  She said that it is possible to hear sounds between the two houses but you can only hear specific words in the room at the back, now occupied by her son, James that adjoins what was the kitchen of the Scully-Hicks.   Initially, she only heard the normal sounds of having a child, such as occasional crying and general comments such as &#8220;don&#8217;t do that&#8221; which did not cause her concern but that was until Elsie came along.  Elsie cried a lot.  When she was in the back room, she heard swearing that she didn&#8217;t particularly like.  She accepted that &#8220;shut up&#8221; is not swearing.  It was a baby cry not a little child cry.  It is right to say that she thought that C had been fostered and had left although she then later saw C.  She told me she only knew what she heard.  She did say that it was only an assumption as she could not see through walls but she had said what she believed she had heard.  She once heard what sounded like an adult gasp.  She wondered if someone needed help or urgent attention.  She then heard normal talking, so she relaxed.  She did not hear blows or thumps or the sound of a child being hit.  The responses she heard to C had been all very caring.   She did accept that nothing she heard caused her to be concerned for the safety of either child.  In answer to Ms Henke, she said it all appeared normal when Craig was there.  She confirmed in answer to Mr Williams, for the Guardian, that everything she said in her witness statement was true.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although I accept she was a slightly hesitant witness, I found her son, James Bevan to be far more positive.  He told me he heard an &#8220;aargh&#8221; that was not delivered in a happy way.  Although he accepted that he could have misinterpreted it, he considered he heard a baby girl crying whereas the older child never seemed to make any noise but he did not know if the older child was in.   He accepted he was a bit &#8220;nosey&#8221; but it was intruding on his day.  The events that peaked his interest were the ones in his statement. He was sufficiently concerned to mention it to his mother.  He told me he heard the child screaming although he didn&#8217;t hear any smacking.  He heard &#8220;shut up you little fucking brat&#8221;.  It was pretty clear and he was rather taken aback by it.  On another occasion, he heard &#8220;shut up you silly little cunt&#8221;.  The music was then turned up loudly for a couple of minutes before being turned off, whereupon he heard the baby crying again followed by &#8220;shut up&#8221; a couple more times.  Although he did not know when, words like that &#8220;stick in your mind&#8221;.  He once heard what he believed potentially was a plate hitting the floor and a door being slammed.  He accepted it could have been the child causing the plate to crash.    </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ms Crowley submits to me that there are several unsatisfactory aspects to this evidence but I do not accept that.  She contrasted the evidence of both Matthew and Craig that they could not discern words said next door when voices were raised there.  I accept that but I am equally clear that the raised voices from the Bevan&#8217;s home involved another occupant of their home and did not emanate from James&#8217;s room which was the one room from where it was possible to hear the detail of what was happening in the kitchen next-door.  I accept that Mrs Bevan was not aware of Elsie&#8217;s arrival in September and thought that C had left around Christmas time.  Ms Crowley also draws my attention to alleged inconsistencies in their descriptions of what was heard and that James could not differentiate between the two children&#8217;s voices but I reject that.  He was clear that he was hearing a baby crying and I am satisfied he was correct.  I simply cannot see why either witness would make any of this up.  They heard crying and they heard an aggressive and intemperate response, including thoroughly inappropriate language from the adult carer.  I accept they did not hear violence although the turning up of the music is suspicious at the very least.  I accept they did not consider it sufficient to report it but they heard it and they were telling me the truth.  James was sufficiently concerned to tell his mother although he bowed to her experience as a nurse as to what should be done about it.  Ms Crowley submits that this is so out of character with what we know in relation to Matthew that I should reject it but I consider this actually goes to the very heart of the matter as to whether Matthew had two different personas, namely one for the outside world and another when he found himself stressed and out of his depth in caring for a difficult baby/toddler.  I accept the evidence of both the Bevans.  They are not lying and they are not mistaken.</p>

Laura Neal, Cheryl Longley and Eryl Bowers from the Vale of Glamorgan all dealt with the bruise to Elsie&#8217;s forehead that I am satisfied occurred on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  There cannot really be any doubt about it as Matthew texted Laura Neal that day to tell her about it and she replied early on the morning of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  There was an adoption review on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  Eryl Bowers kept the minutes.  I am satisfied that the record keeping of all three witnesses was not good.  They clearly have virtually no independent recollection of the meeting yet the minutes are not accurate.  I am satisfied that Craig was present for part of the meeting before he went to collect C but he is not recorded as being present in the minutes.  There is absolutely no reference to the bruise in the minutes.  This surprises me as all three social workers must have seen it.  It was a &#8220;real shiner&#8221;.  There is no reference to the explanation for it and it was not brought to the attention of the adoption court.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It follows that it is very difficult to know exactly what was said by Matthew.  Jodie Golten, the Health Visitor gave evidence about this.  She had visited on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2015.  She saw the bruise and she noted it.  Her record keeping is far better.  The note is divided into sections.  The first section is &#8220;S&#8221; which is what she has been told.  It reads that &#8220;Dad reported that Shayla had fallen as she is now trying to walk and she is into everything.  Dad reported he sought medical advice after this accident.  Dad reported that her plaster cast was off and she had been discharged from the hospital&#8221;.  The second section is &#8220;O&#8221; for &#8220;Observation&#8221; and records that she observed a large bruise to Elsie&#8217;s forehead and left eye.  It was put to her by Ms Crowley that the reference to seeking medical treatment referred to the previous fracture in November.  Ms Golten did not accept that and I accept her evidence.  There is previous reference in the notes to that injury and the fact that a plaster cast had been applied so the Health Visitor would have known already that medical advice had been sought in relation to that.  This reference was to the fall causing the bruise.  She did not record it wrongly.  She was therefore misled.</p>

She first said that she saw the bruise on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January but that cannot be right given the text message.  She then said that she now recalls it was 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  An entry by Jayne Carr, another social worker says that Cheryl had advised her that that parents had taken Elsie to the GP.  I did not hear from Jayne Carr but Ms Longley had originally said that Matthew had told her on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January that he had discussed this with the health visitor.  She then said this took place on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December but that cannot be right as the Health Visitor did not visit until the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also heard evidence as to the mechanism for the injury (or as we now know, injuries) caused to Elsie&#8217;s leg on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015.  There is no doubt that Matthew has told this court, Dr John and the Police that the injury was caused after Elsie fell while playing at an activity table.  I have even seen a photograph of her at the activity table.  Two witnesses told me that they had been told at the time by Matthew that Elsie had fallen whilst on a baby walker.  First, I heard from the GP, Marina Arulanandam.  I am satisfied that she had a good relationship with Matthew and has absolutely no reason not to be frank with me.  She records in her notes that, at a consultation on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, Elsie &#8220;fell off a baby walker&#8221;.  I accept it says one week ago, which was inaccurate but the note as to the baby walker is clear.  Elsie was referred to the hospital and Mr Andrew Miller wrote a letter dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 in which he said that she was &#8220;pushing a walker&#8221; but I did not hear from him and so cannot rely on that evidence.  Eryl Bowers also recorded that she had a discussion with both parents and was told that Elsie had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">taken a fall and had landed awkwardly whilst using her baby walker&#8221;</span>.  She told me she had recorded what she heard and I accept that.  I therefore have evidence from two witnesses and I accept that they were told that it was a baby walker.  If it had been one witness, I might have put it down to an error but two is too much of a coincidence.  I accept that the story has changed from a baby walker to an activity table.    </p>

I accept that different people react in a different way.  I further accept that a failure to demonstrate emotion is not an indication of guilt.  I do find it surprising, however, that he did not show any emotion during his oral evidence to me, apart from one brief occasion, in a case that is fraught with emotion.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Matthew gave his evidence first.  I accept entirely that, in his evidence in chief to Ms Crowley, he was impressive and presented, as I am satisfied he has presented throughout to friends and family, as a pillar of the community and a loving father.  He told me he has a lot of good memories of his mother being there for him as a child.  He wanted to provide the same for his children.  He was willing and happy to give up work to do so.  It met his expectations.  He was able to see the children develop and take their first words and steps.  He said he was able to help them achieve.  He said there was absolutely no truth in the allegation that he had inflicted serious harm on Elsie although he was very aware of why that was being said.  He said that, rather than that, it could potentially be a series of unfortunate events but he understood that the likely clinical picture was one of inflicted injury but he had not inflicted any injuries.  He said he did not struggle coping with two children and that, if that had been the case, Elsie and he would not have had the obvious bond they had.  He did not resent Craig being away at all.  It ensured the family had everything it needed.   They had noticed that C was not meeting milestones and had a very short concentration span.  C was not able to complete activities.  C is a very busy child for whom they had fought hard, working closely with C&#8217;s nursery.   Elsie was a lovely little girl who lit up a room and commanded attention wherever she went.  She waved at everyone and would come and find Matthew if he left the room.  He loved her very much.   He did not accept the evidence of the Bevans.  He has never sworn at the children.  Indeed, he generally doesn&#8217;t tend to swear very much and the words quoted are not anything he would seek to use.  He and Craig heard various arguments from the Bevans&#8217; home, with loud music at parties such that once they retaliated with loud music of their own the next morning.  They were once woken up by hearing shouting through the wall but they were never able to tell what was being said. The evidence of the Bevans had to be a mistake as he does not accept he ever swore at his children.  Finally, Ms Crowley asked him about the separation.   He said that Craig has asked him if there was anything Matthew needed to tell him and he said there was nothing.  Craig has been given a picture from the medical evidence that there is a high possibility that Matthew had done this and, unfortunately, he has accepted that.  It was Matthew&#8217;s word against their word.  He was devastated.  He has lost his daughter.  C is in care and his husband doesn&#8217;t believe him.  He had lost everything in the space of six months.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He was not nearly so impressive under sustained but perfectly proper cross-examination from Mr Tillyard.  It was put to him that it all sounded very idealistic and that life was nothing like that.  He said his view was realistic not idealistic and that it was a perfect life.  Everybody was telling him what a good Dad he was.  He said that life with the children had not been without its challenges.  He accepted he had been with other people quite a lot of the time.  He agreed that Elsie had had four serious injuries since being placed with them and that Craig had been away on each occasion but that was a coincidence.   Mr Tillyard then moved to 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  It was put to Matthew that he told the ambulance men that he heard a scream.  He denied that he said that.  As the ambulance men were not called, I have come to the clear conclusion that I cannot make a finding as to that aspect.  I can, however, consider the 999 call as there is an accurate transcript.  He said he was &#8220;just changing my daughter for bed and she went all floppy and limp and now she&#8217;s not; she&#8217;s not doing anything; she is lying on the floor.&#8221;  He denied that was different to his current account but I am satisfied it is different.  It is clear that he was telling the operator that it happened while Elsie was being changed by him rather than while he was out of the room.  He did not know how she got the bruising to the scalp/forehead or the skull fracture.  He could not recall an event but he was not watching her 24 hours per day.  He said she would not always cry if she fell over and bumped herself.  He cannot, however, sustain a suggestion that this happened when he wasn&#8217;t looking as it is clear that Elsie was fit and well when he changed her and she could not have had such an accident while he was taking the nappy away as she remained lying on the floor on his case.   Moreover, I am satisfied she would have cried profusely if she had fractured her skull.  He accepted that he did not have an explanation as to a traumatic event that enabled him to explain Elsie&#8217;s injuries but he is a very intelligent man.  He seized on the various possibilities put by his leading counsel to the doctors but I regret to say that I am quite clear that he was lying to me as to what happened on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.

I do not accept his evidence.  It is one of the difficulties when you lie about such events.  It is easy to forget what version you originally gave months before.

She was almost to the point of fully standing.  He accepted that to do so she would be pulling outward force on the door, which, of course, would explain why it might fly open.  It was put to him that she would then fall away from the kitchen but he said he didn&#8217;t know as he wasn&#8217;t an expert in physics and, regardless of what was being put, she fell towards the kitchen. It was put to him that, if she hit her head on the edge of the kitchen, it would be a horizontal not a vertical bruise.  He said that was not how the bruise came up.  He denied it was a plausible lie and said that Craig believed he was telling the truth at the time.   He said the Health Visitor told him to get it checked out but he did not do so as it was already five days later and she seemed ok.  He denied saying he had already done so.

I accept Mr Tillyard&#8217;s submission that leaving the gate open even briefly would not be &#8220;Mr Safety&#8221; in action given that Elsie was upstairs, even if she was in her bedroom initially.  When he returned upstairs, he pulled the gate behind him.  He accepted he didn&#8217;t hear a clicking sound, denying that the gate clicked on closing but it clearly did click when it was brought into court by the Police.  Indeed, he accepted it had failed to close on a couple of earlier occasions.  He said he saw Elsie leaning against the gate and it swinging open.  It was set up in such a way that it would swing out over the first large step and would go towards the wall.  My note says that he first told me that he didn&#8217;t see Elsie fall but he then said he saw her fall forwards.  I do not wish to be unfair to him as I may have got my note wrong.  He put the washing down taking his eye away from her such that he did not see her fall onto the top step.  By the time he got to the gate, she had tumbled down the stairs.  Mr Tillyard put to him that, if he had dropped the washing and immediately gone to catch her without taking his eye off her he would have been likely to get there in time but he did not accept that.  He accepted he didn&#8217;t see what happened but said he went as quickly as he could and feels he acted appropriately.  He said Craig asked him what had happened and he explained what he had told the court.  Craig was more concerned that Elsie was ok.  He accepted he wasn&#8217;t taking proper care.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Craig gave his evidence after Matthew.  I have already indicated that he was extremely distressed throughout.   He is now staying with his friend Helen O&#8217;Gorman as he told me he did not want to be alone in his home.  He is lonely and frightened.  The separation happened around the time of what would have been Elsie&#8217;s birthday.  It was his decision to part.  He did so as the medical evidence was telling him that Matt had hurt his daughter. He received Mr Richards&#8217; report and then that of Mr Rose which led to lots of discussions with Matt.  He was asking Matt what he had done and why was the report telling him something different.  Matt continued to deny that he had done anything but the reports were categoric.  He didn&#8217;t know what to think.  Over the following days, there were endless heated arguments. He accepts that Matt hurt Elsie and she is dead because of it.  He became even more distressed at this point.  He said it is a permanent separation.  He had taken his vows in 2012 very seriously but has removed his wedding ring.  He accepted Elsie&#8217;s skull fracture was caused by an impact and he accepted the medical evidence.  He also accepted the rib fractures and the fracture of the left femur were not accidental.  He did say, however, that nothing makes him think he should have picked up on it at the time.  No concerns were ever raised with him by professionals.  The children idolised Matt and he idolised Matt.  He became very distressed again.  He said he didn&#8217;t know this &#8220;monster&#8221;.   The explanations for the earlier injuries were plausible.  He was unable to say the explanations could not have caused the injuries.  He did not question them at the time.   He accepted that he was more concerned about Elsie&#8217;s health than the detail of the explanations.   He told me he will continue to &#8220;beat himself up about it&#8221;.    </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He was then cross-examined by Mr Tillyard and he confirmed that he believed Matthew had killed Elsie.  Matt must have fractured her skull as he had no idea who else could have done it.  There was nobody else there so it must have been him.  Matt had lied to him ever since.  He frankly accepted that he wanted not to believe it and he was numb and devastated.  He told me he didn&#8217;t feel anger towards Matt and he could not explain why.  He said it only occurred to him during the trial that it might have made a difference to Elsie at the hospital had Matthew told the truth.  In fact, given the terrible injuries that Elsie sustained, I find that it would not have done so but that is no excuse for a perpetrator as the perpetrator would not have known that at the time.  He said his sister is confused because he said he didn&#8217;t recognise the monster that did these things to Elsie and she has not read the medical reports. He told me it was his job to protect Elsie and he would want ongoing involvement with children&#8217;s services.  He accepted that he had described Matthew as &#8220;Safety Boy&#8221;. C had once fallen down the stairs in 2014 when Craig was there so he recognised that such a thing was possible.   In relation to the November 2015 incident, he told me he did accept that something happened that Matt is not telling us about. He said he did wonder why Elsie was having so many accidents when C was not having them but the professionals had accepted the explanations.   He said that he tried to make sure the stair gate was shut and he assumed Matt did so as well.  He accepted that Matt should not have left it open, even briefly, when Matt went downstairs.    He accepted that all this was awful as Elsie had been entrusted to their care.     </p>

I have already indicated that I accept the expert medical evidence.  Elsie had been entirely normal all day.  She had eaten a meal of sausage and vegetables for her tea which she finished at 5.45pm.  Sometime around 6pm, she suffered extremely serious injuries that resulted in her death.  I find that she had almost certainly been playing up.  I find that she had been crying and was very difficult to settle.  Matthew lost his temper with her as he had done before when nobody else was present.  He picked her up and shook her very hard.  Her head will have gone backwards and forwards at great pace causing cardiac arrest, subdural haematomas, hypoxic ischaemic brain damage, extensive multi-layered retinal haemorrhages and bilateral retinal folds.  He gripped her so hard that he fractured several of her posterior ribs.  He shook her so hard that she broke her left femur.  He then threw her to the floor such that her head impacted with something hard causing bruising to her forehead and a fractured skull.  There was nothing that could be done to save her.  These injuries resulted in her death.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I recognise that this behaviour would have truly shocked all those who gave me character evidence on Matthew Scully-Hicks&#8217; behalf.  It was not the man they knew.  It was not the man the social workers saw.  It was not the man Craig Scully-Hicks knew.   I have come to only one conclusion.  Matthew Scully-Hicks is a Jekyll and Hyde character.  In private, he was quite unable to control himself when Elsie played up.  He was able to cope without difficulty when there were others around.  The evidence of the Bevans shines a clear spotlight on the situation.  When Craig was there, they heard nothing.  When others were there, they heard nothing but when Matthew was there on his own, the little girl played up.  His reaction was not responsible.  He shouted at her such that the Bevans could hear.  He called her names.  He swore at her in unacceptable language, including some truly shocking words.  They heard this and they have not made it up.  He also assaulted her. We know this from 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that this explains why he turned up the music on one such occasion.  He could not risk the neighbours hearing Elsie&#8217;s distress.  After she calmed down, the radio could be turned off.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So I now turn to my findings as to the earlier injuries.  It is clear that Elsie suffered two broken bones on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015.  The description given of her twisting and falling could, just, explain one injury.  It cannot explain two.  I accept the medical evidence in this regard.  The reason for two broken bones was that it was not a fall.  It was another assault.  Again, I find that it was shaking with her legs flailing around such that two bones were broken.  There may well have been bleeding on her brain.  We will never know.  The assault did not, however, cause the catastrophic injuries that the assault on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 caused.  I hope that this did not embolden Matthew Scully-Hicks.  After all, he knew it had caused a broken ankle.  Assuming this was the first assault, he should have admitted it and told professionals he was not coping with two children.   He could not bring himself to do so and it eventually resulted in Elsie&#8217;s death.  </p>

I have already found that it did not play any part in Elsie&#8217;s death in May 2016 but it would not have availed Matthew Scully-Hicks if it had.  I am not satisfied by his explanation.  I was told he was Mr Safety by his own supporters.  He would not allow the stair gate to remain open.  I am not satisfied by his account.  I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that this was a third shaking injury.  This one did cause injury to the head.  I am satisfied there was subdural bleeding.  Elsie was almost certainly briefly unconscious.  She vomited, including some blood.  The shaking did not cause the same catastrophic injuries as occurred on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 but, every time she was shaken, it may have increased the likelihood that the next injury would be more serious.  I do not know if the Bevans heard this incident but it was the sort of incident they did hear only they did not realise it led to shaking.  </p>

I have had trouble with this injury.  I do not accept Matthew Scully-Hicks&#8217; account but I have decided that I can only find this incident unexplained.  A bruise is not an injury associated with shaking per se.  I have already found that it would be wrong for me to assume that Elsie would fall backwards from the play kitchen if the door swung open without further testing.  The door might have swung open and then closed again.  I have limited expert evidence as to this.  I have formed the clear view that it would be mere speculation for me to find that there had been some form of assault that had led to Elsie being seriously bruised.  It is trite law that a judge cannot make findings of fact based on speculation or suspicion.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I must now turn to consider the issue of whether or not Craig Scully-Hicks failed to protect Elsie.  The Local Authority (Cardiff) invites me to so find.  The Guardian does not.  I have to consider this in the light of the fact that I have already found that, to the outside world, Matthew Scully-Hicks presented as a model citizen and parent.  He completely convinced the Vale of Glamorgan that he was a suitable parent for C.  The court was equally convinced and made an adoption order.   Moreover, he did nothing in relation to C to challenge that assessment.  He convinced the Vale a second time that he was a suitable parent to adopt Elsie and she was placed with him and Craig.  No criticism could possibly be made of anybody up to that point.   </p>

I remind myself that my findings in relation to these previous incidents have been made with the knowledge of Elsie&#8217;s traumatic collapse and subsequent death on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 and with the benefit of expert evidence as to that and as to the second fracture on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015.  On the first such incident on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, only one fracture was spotted and the doctors told the social workers that, on that basis, the explanation given to them was consistent with this being an accidental injury, regardless of whether the fall was from a baby-walker or a play table.  I consider that, at that point, it was reasonable for the explanation to be accepted.</p>

I have been troubled by the fact that this was not noted in the minutes of the adoption review meeting.  It was not brought to the attention of the court that made the adoption order on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  There seems to have been a straightforward acceptance that it was an accident, possibly as a result of it being immediately reported to the Vale in the text message.  There was no investigation as to whether or not Matthew Scully-Hicks had indeed taken medical advice as he told Eryl Bowers and the Health Visitor.  I accept that this is all with the benefit of hindsight.  Moreover, I have been unable to find that this was non-accidental injury.  I am absolutely clear that, if the professionals were not concerned, it would be unreasonable for me to expect a parent who was not present at the time to be concerned.</p>

The number of serious incidents was climbing rapidly at this point but the doctors at the hospital accepted the explanation and so did the social workers.  Notwithstanding all these incidents, there remained an unequivocal recommendation to the court that there should be an adoption order.  It never crossed the mind of any professional that there was anything untoward.  Whether reasonable or not, Craig knew this and he was entitled, in my view, to accept that this was correct.</p>

One of the conundrums of this case is that, on the surface, Matthew and Elsie were bonding.  She showed no fear of him.  She was happy to go to him.  I am not a psychiatrist.  I have not heard expert evidence and I do not know why Elsie reacted in this way.  It was suggested by Ms Crowley that this is evidence that the assaults did not take place whereas I am clear that they did.  But all the other friends and family only saw this side of Matthew and Elsie.   I am clear that they were not all lying to me.  Was it different for Craig when they went home? I am satisfied it was not for two reasons.  First, I have the evidence of the Bevans that none of this happened when Craig, or anyone else for that matter, was present.  Second, I have heard Craig give evidence and be cross-examined with great care by Mr Tillyard.  I am quite clear that he was telling me the truth.  He did not have any idea as to what was going on.  It has deeply shocked and stunned him.  If that is not the case, he is a better actor than Lord Olivier but I am clear he was not acting in any way.  He is a devastated man who has found it almost impossible to accept what he now knows is true but he most certainly did not know it early on the morning of 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.  I also make it clear that the truthful and honest way in which he gave his evidence contrasted for me with the evidence of Matthew in which I had less and less confidence as Mr Tillyard proceeded to expose all the flaws and inconsistencies in what he was saying.  Mr Tillyard failed to establish any flaws or inconsistencies in the evidence given by Craig.  I have therefore come to the clear conclusion that I should exonerate Craig of any failure to protect Elsie.  There is nothing he could or should have done but I fear he may find that difficult to accept.</p>

I indicated at the beginning of my judgment that it is not my intention in any way to stifle any such debate or to prevent access to my findings in the long term, subject to the need to protect C.  Equally, however, I am absolutely clear that my findings cannot be allowed into the public domain prior to any criminal trial that may take place in this case.  All those involved must recognise that.  When Elsie&#8217;s mother is informed, it is important that she and her family recognise that as well.  Any attempt to put my findings into the public domain prematurely could well compromise any criminal trial fatally and, if that was to occur, potentially deny justice to Elsie one way or the other.  It is for that reason that I am clear that there must be a reporting restriction order although I will consider the detail of it in due course.  I cannot stress how important this aspect is.  I make it absolutely clear that it would be a contempt of court to break this order, including if any individual was to do so.  Any such contempt can be punished by imprisonment for up to two years.  I will have absolutely no hesitation in taking very firm action if any breach is proved before me.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">During the criminal trial, it emerged that various text messages had been sent by Matthew Scully-Hicks in which he described Elsie in terms such as &#8220;Satan in a baby-grow&#8221;.  These text messages were not brought to the attention of the Family Court in December 2016 and therefore do not feature in this judgment. </p>
