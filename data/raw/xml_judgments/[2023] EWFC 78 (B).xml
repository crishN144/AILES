They could not obviously predict that the parents would be dishonest throughout.  Both say there were difficulties in their relationship right from the start, the Mother alleging an assault when pregnant.There was an incident in January 2021 when the Mother was seen with the child and both lied to say the Father was in the bank at the time when he was not. Social services never knew the Mother had become the main carer unsupervised.</span></p>

The local authority had ended their involvement in April of 2020 believing the father remained as the main carer, and having seen nothing of concern.  Their agreement was clear that if the Father returned to work the child had to be in nursery and other arrangements about collection and return made.

An application for a cognitive assessment was made by the Applicant  authority, which recorded the Mother had a community assessment in 2019 with an unusual profile. It was granted, despite the mother&#8217;s solicitors thinking it unnecessary in these and previous proceedings. It was known the mother has some learning needs and difficulties with memory. The application said it was to &#8220;consider what additional support or intervention she may require.&#8221; Surely ensuring that a parent with known difficulties of this type understands all communications is a basic skill of all trained social workers? </span></p>

She accepted her assessment ought to have included the fact that the wider concerns about the older children were not evidenced to have reoccurred with this child and also there had been a period when the child was seen at nursery and no concerns raised.  She accepted in cross examination time can reduce risk in certain circumstances and might  reduce risk in terms of this child sustaining an injury.

Without a 24 hour monitoring service she did not feel visits and reliance on family would be sufficient to ensure safety by which she meant no further abusive relationship.</span></p>

Since she accepted she could not determine the truth this was a difficult fence for her to sit on I felt.   The number of call outs is obviously relevant. What her assessment showed however was minimisation of serious incidents and some limited understanding by him of how his behaviour could appear controlling. She had wanted him to self-refer to a perpetrators&#8217; programme and over all this time he had not done so.  He also would have benefited from attending a form of the Freedom Programme which she had also recommended.  He had not begun either.

Risk must alter after periods of time when nothing bad has happened and when a parent in most cases inevitably matures.  A risk assessment should be an opportunity for reflection about why things had gone wrong and what had changed to prevent them going wrong again or what might assist.  It should look proactively at what steps could be made by learning, monitoring and family example to reduce risk.  The Mother's stance in refusing still to accept responsibility for injuring her daughter, even after pleading guilty to it, is worrying I accept, and does prevent discussions about how that situation arose, but it is possible to look at obvious situations of stress and reactions, particularly at that time with two children in her care, and obviously struggling to manage in all areas.  Each aspect of her functioning that improves surely reduces risk ?  So, her no longer using drugs and improved mental health have to be taken into account. \the social worker&#8217;s understanding of the Mother might also have been added to by speaking to the maternal grandmother and the older children&#8217;s carer who could have given their own perspective.  She did not choose to do so. It is a professional&#8217;s life blood to assess risk but it needs to be done in a curious and holistic way. I would hope after being properly questioned in some detail about this she has reflected that she must do a more through and careful assessment of parents in future, as  the court expects an in depth thorough  fair and reasoned analysis.</span></p>

In the case of the Mother who said she was embarrassed about how she looked and who told the court she had her solicitor read her statements to her , whose cognitive report revealed some limits to her understanding and whose history revealed vulnerability, I do feel someone, whoever it was, could have made an appointment with her and taken her through the door of an agency.  If she chose not to go  after then it would be very much her responsibility but I am confident those first steps could be difficult ones to take for anyone in her position.  Someone to get feedback from about how the visit  was, such as a family support worker, would help too and encourage continued attendance.  Such groups can have a powerful effect on understanding and the group effect is, I am sure, helpful. So while the social worker agreed one to one training in this area will now be offered I am concerned this wasn&#8217;t discussed as part of the risk assessment work at least in October, although I accept her account the Mother had not mentioned any concerns about attending.  The Father, too, is likely to need a prod to get to the domestic abuse work he needs to undertake.</span></p>

I cannot be clear that under stress as a single parent or in a difficult relationship the Mother might not? again assault her child, though I am sure this would be a temporary reaction to stress and being overwhelmed.  The issue for me here is whether she could recognise this and ask for help before this arose.  That moves on to her ability to recognise poor partners and avoid them , given her nan told her to avoid the Father and &#8220;love&#8221; got in the way.  I feel without attending at the Freedom Project and maybe work that helped improve her self esteem (so she felt she was worthy of being treated well- also available at Womenswork) there is a real risk of this happening again.  I know both parents say they will stay single, but all humans seek out intimate relationships and I think this aim is unrealistic.</span></p>
