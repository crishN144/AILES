The Court accepted a submission by the Children&#8217;s Guardian (&#8216;The Guardian&#8217;) that a determination from the court was required about whether the father had used physical chastisement in the form of stress positions, in order that the court could better assess the risk that the father posed should the children spend extended periods in his care, progressing to overnights and holidays. The court also made directions at that hearing and at the pre-trial review on 29 January 2024 about what evidence was required at the final hearing and how certain aspects of the hearing should be conducted.</p>

After giving the parents time to reflect on the matter, both submitted that a QLR was not necessary and the judge decided that the case could be managed effectively by allowing permission for the Guardian&#8217;s representative to cross-examine the witnesses first and granting permission for the parents each to be able to put the questions they wished to ask one another to the trial judge who would consider how and what questions needed to be asked.  </p>

I made clear that I was asking those questions on behalf of the other parent and I gave time for further questions to be suggested as necessary, which the father did propose during the mother&#8217;s questioning and once he had heard the answers she gave to the Guardian&#8217;s questions.

The mother requested two further measures, namely that she could exit the court at a different time and location from the father and that the father would be screened during her evidence so that she could not see him.

The children were also joined as parties to the proceedings and the children&#8217;s Guardian was ordered to prepare a report under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> about the circumstances of E and F.  </p>

The Guardian explained that, in her view, there was a sincerity to E&#8217;s account of the physical chastisement, particularly when E clarified that she had been slapped once by her father and the mark went away quickly and the Guardian did not think that E was seeking to add gloss or sensation.  The Guardian also thought that there was some balance to E&#8217;s commentary about both parents when E told her how her mother had also upset her.  The Guardian had no sense that E came to the Cafcass meeting with an agenda of solely discrediting one parent above the other.  However, there was some indication from E that she sought to align herself with her mother&#8217;s narrative when she declared Nigerian men to be &#8216;quite stupid&#8217; and therefore E appeared to have been exposed to some of the acrimony between her parents.</p>

The benefit of that approach was that it would provide a settled factual matrix upon which future recommendations and decisions could be made.  Depending on the outcome of that fact-finding, it would either reassure the children that their voices had been heard, or might show that the mother&#8217;s capacity to meet the emotional and identity needs of the children was in question if she was proven to have encouraged the children to discredit their father.</p>

The Guardian made a number of recommendations about steps the parents could take to address E&#8217;s relationship with the father including engagement with an Improving Child and Family Arrangements (ICFA) intervention and a Planning Together for Children course which was a four-hour online workshop.</p>

E told the Guardian that she thought seeing her father every month was about right, but she would be open to more often so long as it meant she did not have to cancel any existing weekend plans.  It remained E&#8217;s opinion that her father needed to apologise for the breakdown of his relationship with G.  It was clear to the Guardian that the father&#8217;s relationship with G continued to impact on E&#8217;s wellbeing and it was disappointing that the father had not reflected further on the Guardian&#8217;s concerns in this regard and the importance of reparative work between him and G.

It was clear that the mother felt extremely frustrated by the lack of financial support from the father and the Guardian had observed the father being more adversarial in his approach to speaking to the mother than she had previously seen.  The father was &#8220;intransigent&#8221; that he should spend time with the children at weekends only rather than during the week when he might be able to help with childcare, which the mother thought was at odds with his report of being unemployed. The Guardian also reported an occasion when the father demonstrated a blaming attitude towards the mother stating &#8216;[she] made a choice (in separating) &#8211; that&#8217;s what she wanted &#8211; that&#8217;s what she gets&#8217;.

The Guardian encouraged the father to address this in more detail in his next statement to the court so that the court could better understand his proposals.  The Guardian noted that the time the father spent with the children was mainly activity-based e.g. going to a trampoline park and often out to eat or getting takeaways at home.  While these were nice experiences for the children the guardian thought that it was a significant step up to caring for the children for a week or more at a time, which would require more structured days including home-cooked food, help with schoolwork, bedtimes and all the other household tasks connected to caring for children.  The Guardian encouraged the father to reflect on what he could realistically propose in terms of these arrangements.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Above all it was the Guardian&#8217;s view that the children needed safe and consistent arrangements with their father and it was for that reason that the Guardian had recommended that a determination was required about the father&#8217;s use of stress positions in order to better understand the risk the father would present if the children spent extended periods of time in his care, progressing to overnights and holidays.  While the Guardian was satisfied that the father was able to meet the children&#8217;s needs for shorter daytime periods, the Guardian felt that there needed to be greater clarity as to how he would cope for longer periods.  This was particularly important given the age and stage of development of the children and given E&#8217;s additional needs.  It was the Guardian&#8217;s opinion that, if the children were to stay overnight with the father for longer periods this would be a big adjustment and the court would need to have confidence that the father would be able to handle any challenging behaviour without resorting to physical chastisement.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian also explained that if no findings of physical chastisement on the father&#8217;s part were made, the arrangements to progress to the father spending time over weekends with the children would need to be built up slowly, starting with one overnight and progressing from there.  However, the Guardian was not satisfied that the father was in a stable enough position to care for the children for half the holidays given the necessary practical and financial arrangements that would involve.  The father needed to provide more information about that aspect of his plans.  The Guardian&#8217;s view was that only a minimum holiday time was warranted at this stage (e.g. a long weekend or a week in the summer) which would have to be on the proviso that there was evidence of a realistic plan and if the monthly weekends had progressed well by that stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, if factual findings of physical chastisement were made against the father, the Guardian&#8217;s view was that there would need to be enhanced safeguards in place to protect the children from experiencing physical chastisement in the future.  In that event the Guardian would want to know how the father had responded to any factual findings and whether he was able to identify the concerns around his previous attitude and actions.  The Guardian noted that the father was adamant that he had not chastised the children in the manner alleged and she thought that this might make it difficult to work with the father effectively.  The Guardian suggested that if the father was willing to engage in a parenting course, he would need to show meaningful progress and evidence of a sustained change in his attitude and parenting strategy.  There would need to be a reassessment at that point as to whether the arrangements could safely progress beyond the existing monthly daytime arrangements.   </p>

The social worker met E on 29 December 2022 when she conducted the joint visit, together with two police officers, to the mother&#8217;s home (see paragraph 16 above).  The social worker confirmed that she and the two officers spoke to E on her own during the visit which took place in the dining room/living room of the house.  The police took the lead in the questioning of E and were trained in the questioning of children which involved asking open questions.  While the social worker  could not now recall all the detail of the interview, she confirmed that she had no concerns about the manner in which the interview was conducted.  She said that E came across as a very chatty, happy bubbly girl who seemed able to answer questions happily.  The social worker said that she and the police were aware in advance of the interview of E&#8217;s sensory and processing issues and therefore tried to keep all questions short and succinct.  The social worker confirmed that the notes of the interview with E correctly recorded what she had told them (see paragraph 16 above).  The social worker also had a specific recollection of E demonstrating the stress position she alleged her father had put her in during the interview when E &#8220;put her hand down on the table with her finger pointing down&#8221;.  </p>

Based on everything I heard from the mother and the way she interacted with the Guardian, as set out in the Guardian&#8217;s reports, it was apparent to me that the mother wanted the father to have a good relationship with his daughters and that she would do what she needed to do to help make that happen, despite the acrimonious history between her and the father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I considered carefully whether the mother may have given different accounts to the professionals about whether she herself witnessed the children being put into stress positions by the father and whether that might undermine the truthfulness of her evidence.  It is not clear whether the mother mentioned to the police and social workers in December 2022 that she herself had personally witnessed such behaviour.  The mother says she did mention this at the time, but there is no explicit record in the police or social worker notes to that effect, although the police notes are unclear in places about exactly what was being reported (see paragraph 15 above) and I do not feel able to conclude that she did not mention it.  Perhaps the more obvious discrepancy is that in her witness statement the mother talked about E and G complaining about this, without making clear that she herself saw it happen and yet in the interview with the Guardian the mother stated that she did witness it happening.  I bear in mind however that the mother has been acting throughout these proceedings as a litigant in person and that this may explain why her statement did not make clearer that she saw it happen.  I also accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that she saw herself as an advocate for her children once it was clear to her how aggrieved they felt about the behaviour and that may also explain why she used the language she did in her statement.      </p>

However, I accept her evidence that in the years immediately before they were divorced, the couple were drifting apart and spending less time together and that, in any event, she was standing up to the father more during that time.  I also note that the mother told the police that the relationship with the father ended in 2019.  The mother gave clear and compelling evidence that she witnessed the abuse happening. Thus, I do not consider that evidence to be undermined by her admission that she did not personally witness it happening in the 2 &#189; -3 years immediately before she was divorced from the father.  </p>

Mr Osborne pointed out that the Guardian had flagged the need for the father to provide further information regarding his holiday plans in the proceedings.  However, it became evident during the questioning of the father that he had done no such planning and did not know when the school holidays were other than a vague notion that they might be at Easter and in the summer.  The father&#8217;s answer to the lack of planning on his part was that he could not make any such plans until it was clear from the court whether he would be permitted to have the children for some holiday periods.  He said that he could not plan in the absence of certainty about that.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">E is 11 years old and has shown herself capable of clearly communicating her views to the Guardian.  While there were a number of negative aspects to her attitude to her father when she  first met the Guardian in April 2023, it is clear that there has been some positive progression in her outlook towards him since that time.  It is apparent from the Guardian&#8217;s second report that E would like to have a good father/daughter relationship.  It is also clear that while E thought that seeing her father once a month was about right, she was open to seeing him more often provided she didn&#8217;t have to cancel her plans.  I accept that she may well have told the father that she would like to sometimes stay over with her father.  However, it is also clear that E would like the father to apologise for the breakdown of his relationship with G and I accept the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that the poor relationship between the father and G is impacting on E&#8217;s feelings towards her father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both girls are now used to having the father in their lives and have been developing a good relationship with him through the contact which is currently permitted (4 hours per month).  I accept the evidence of the Guardian that any sudden increase in overnight contact with the father (particularly in light of his proposal about school holidays) would represent a very significant change for them and would be one which would need to be managed carefully given they are used to the full-time care of the mother.  At present the contact with the father is largely activity-based and there are no extended times when the children are spending time with him in a more normal family situation including, for example, eating home prepared meals, navigating bedtimes, or undertaking homework or other chores.  Accordingly, I accept that any move to overnight contact would represent a significant step-up for the girls which has the potential to alter the relationship with their father and introduce pressures not so far experienced.</p>

There was also a lack of any proper planning on his part which was not simply explained by the fact that these proceedings were ongoing and he didn&#8217;t have certainty about what the court would order.  The father was very na&#239;ve about what arrangements he needed to put in place for children over the holidays and was wholly unrealistic about how these could be managed, including financially, given his current circumstances.    </p>

That is likely to be particularly relevant to the father&#8217;s desire to have extended holiday time with the children which would require careful planning and the involvement of E so that she knew in advance where she would be, who she would be with and what she would be doing.  At present I do not think that the father has properly recognised those particular needs of E which would all need to be part of the necessary planning on his part.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an important factor in the current case.  I have found that the father has used stress positions as a means of physical punishment/chastisement of E.  If such conduct was to be repeated this could cause serious physical suffering and emotional harm to E and has the potential to significantly undermine the progress which E has made in her relationship with her father.  In my assessment there is a significant risk that such conduct could occur again given that the pattern was for the father to deploy this as part of his way of disciplining the children &#8211; it was &#8220;normal&#8221; behaviour for the father when he was living with the mother.  </p>

Any introduction of overnight or holiday contact would represent a significant change and one which will put more pressure on the relationship between the father and the children because the children would require more structured time and may well need to be disciplined in a way which doesn&#8217;t arise when the contact time is largely activity-based out of the home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that, before any change to overnight contact can occur, the father needs to demonstrate that there has been meaningful progress and evidence of a sustained change in his attitude and parenting strategy.  One way of demonstrating that would be to provide an undertaking around physical chastisement and for the father to attend a parenting course in which he demonstrated the necessary change in his approach.  There would also need to be a &#8216;safety plan&#8217; in place which E and F could follow which would provide a mechanism for them to raise any concerns about the time spent with their father.  There would then need to be a reassessment of whether the arrangements could safely progress beyond the existing monthly 4-hour contact.  </p>

What is in doubt is the ability of the father to care for the children for extended periods, including overnight stays.  Leaving aside the matter of physical chastisement, there has been a lack of planning and forethought on the father&#8217;s part. He has not demonstrated that he fully understands the complexities and pressures which would be involved if the children were to be with him for extended periods, and particularly during half of the school holidays.  There has been no sign of any financial planning for that nor any practical preparatory steps taken by him even to find out the dates of the school holidays and consider how he would care for the children in circumstances where he currently has no extended or weekday time with them.  While the main area of work the father needs to do is around his approach to disciplining the children, he also needs to demonstrate that he understands the practical and financial burdens which are required to care for them properly, and that he has a plan for how he will address those matters in the future.   </p>

While their relationship with their father is developing well and should continue to be encouraged, the risk that the father will subject them to stress positions as a form of punishment/physical chastisement is currently too high for overnight contact to take place.   As I have identified at paragraph 117 above, if any change to overnight contact is to occur there will need to be a number of safeguards in place and the father will need to demonstrate that there has been meaningful progress and evidence of a sustained change to his attitude and parenting strategy.   If the father undertakes that further work and agrees to those safeguards being in place, he can make a further application to court seeking to increase the amount of time he is able to spend with the children, including overnight stays and holiday time.   </p>
