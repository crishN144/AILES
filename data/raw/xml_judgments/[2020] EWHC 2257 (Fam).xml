I will refer to those orders as the Farkhad WFOs to distinguish them from a freezing order granted in July 2020 with respect to the Tenth Respondent, Temur Akhmedov [&#8220;Temur&#8221;]. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Farkhad WFOs were granted because of a real risk that Haddon-Cave J&#8217;s judgment dated 15 December 2016 and his subsequent order of 20 December 2016 would otherwise go unsatisfied. By that judgment and order, Haddon-Cave J had required the Husband to pay the Wife &#163;453,576,152 by way of financial remedy consequent upon the breakdown of their marriage. Despite the Farkhad WFOs, the Husband has not voluntarily paid a penny to the Wife and enforcement efforts to date have raised only approximately &#163;5 million. </p>

The Wife&#8217;s application has been prompted by recent developments in the proceedings suggesting that the Husband and third parties have been exploiting perceived ambiguities in the Farkhad WFOs to continue to fund the Husband&#8217;s own lavish lifestyle and that of (at least) Temur. The Wife therefore sought a variation of the Farkhad WFOs to make clear that they extended to the totality of the Husband&#8217;s assets, this extension being necessary to further their purpose. </p>

US$1 billion) which were previously held by the Third Respondent (Cotor) at UBS [&#8220;the Monetary Assets&#8221;]. Following an apparent recent dissipation of assets by Temur in May 2020 (in the face of these proceedings), the Husband is now also the ultimate beneficial owner of a valuable office property in central Moscow [&#8220;the Moscow Property&#8221;]. The Wife contends that the Husband had transferred the Moscow Property to Temur in 2018 to defeat her enforcement efforts.  </p>

This was supplemented by a specific paragraph which stated that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This order applies to assets (whether or not specifically listed) which are in the Respondent&#8217;s name and whether they are solely or jointly owned</span>&#8221;.

These include an account with Pasha Bank in Baku, Azerbaijan to which a total of US$100 million was transferred between 15 May 2018 and 4 October 2018; an account with ALFA Bank, Russia to which a total of US$232 million was transferred between 21 March 2018 and 2 October 2018; and an additional ALFA Bank account from which monies were paid in October 2019 to the Husband&#8217;s lawyers in Dubai.  </p>

The result is that the Husband and those concerned in his campaign of evasion continue to enjoy vast sums of money with apparent impunity. </p>

He admits receiving (i) US$25.5 million since the date of the 2016 WFO; and (ii) continuing but unspecified &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">generalised financial provision</span>&#8221;. He has confirmed that he believed the Husband to be the immediate payor of the US$25.5 million. Temur&#8217;s disclosure given in July 2020 shows that he has continued to receive substantial payments from the Husband, namely payments of a further &#163;500,000, US$10,249,971.57 and &#8364;5,389,260.13 euros. Thus, since the date of the Farkhad WFOs, Temur has received at least US$40 million from the Husband whilst the Wife has received nothing. </p>

A factor prompting the Wife&#8217;s application was Temur&#8217;s recent actions in relation to a valuable property in Moscow which was at the heart of the Wife&#8217;s claims against him and which now lies in the Husband&#8217;s hands. The Wife contended that this was just another part of the Husband&#8217;s campaign of evasion and underscored the need for the variations she sought of the Farkhad WFOs.  </p>

It is not necessary for me to set out in detail the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the Wife&#8217;s solicitors and Temur&#8217;s solicitors about this issue.

Given the matters outlined above I have no hesitation in concluding that this threshold is met in full.  Haddon-Cave J concluded in 2016 and 2018 that the threshold was met to grant these orders, and, notwithstanding those orders, the risk the orders were meant to guard against very quickly became a reality. Mr Gourgey QC submitted that the only thing that had changed since then was that - as a result of his successful dissipation of assets, contrary to this court&#8217;s orders - the Husband&#8217;s complex web of illicit transactions had expanded beyond the perceived scope of the Farkhad WFOs with the result that he and third parties had felt able to ignore this court&#8217;s orders with impunity.

This modification was first adopted in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov</span> [2009] 2 CLC 967 and operates to remove the usual permission to dispose of or deal with assets outside England and Wales provided that the total value of the Husband&#8217;s assets remains above the value of the freezing order (that is, &#163;565,906,935 including interest on the original sum). In this case, the difficulty with the standard form of order is that, if the total value of the Husband&#8217;s assets exceeds the specified sum, the Husband can move all his assets into a foreign country. Thus, for example, provided that the total value of his assets remained above the limit, he could transfer all of his assets from European jurisdictions (where enforcement is possible) to a nominee in Liechtenstein where enforcement is much more difficult. The Husband has already shown himself both willing and able to move assets into jurisdictions where enforcement is difficult and there is, accordingly, good reason to adopt the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ablyazov</span> amendment to achieve the purpose of the freezing order. </p>
