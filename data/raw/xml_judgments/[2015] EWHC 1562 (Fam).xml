	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.75in">Applications for summary return under the Hague Convention seldom involve a need to hear oral evidence. Where, as here, the parties&#8217; accounts of key events bearing on the issue of habitual residence as well as Article 13b defences of &#8216;consent&#8217; and &#8216;acquiescence&#8217; are hotly contested, it becomes altogether necessary. In this instance, in addition to considering a quantity of documentary material, I listened to four witnesses giving evidence over a period of three days.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">At the end of it all, it becomes a relatively straightforward exercise to decide as between the two versions of recent history; and my deliberations were greatly assisted, I should say, by Counsel on both sides. All three of them &#8211; Mr Norton ably assisted by Ms Cayoun, and Ms Fottrell QC &#8211; not only provided quite excellent Practice Direction documentation, they managed the process of examination in chief and cross examination in a time efficient, issue focussed and courteous fashion. In addition they produced succinct written submissions shortly after the conclusion of the evidence in a way that deserves commendation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">My overall conclusion in relation to the principal issue is that the child at the centre of this quite extraordinary dispute was not, as his mother suggests, habitually resident in Germany and, therefore, Article 3 of the 1980 Convention is not engaged. In the event that I am wrong as to that, I conclude that (i) the mother gave clear and unequivocal consent to the child leaving Germany for England and (ii) her subsequent actions as recorded on social media and voice mail amount to acquiescence to the child&#8217;s continued presence here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The mother, A, has lived in Germany for about 4 years. She is a national of a country in West Africa. She hopes to be able to secure the right to remain long term in Germany. A has 5 children who range in age between 8 and 19 months. The elder two live in West Africa. Two girls, aged 4 and 2, whose fathers are both German, live with the mother in Germany. Her youngest child, D, the focus of this application, was born in Germany in late October 2013. He travelled to England on 1 March 2014 and has lived here ever since.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The child&#8217;s father is B, a British citizen who lives with his wife, C, in London. C is a national of the same West African country as A. C has significant medical difficulties which have made it impossible for her to conceive and carry a child to term. In 2009 and 2010, the couple tried, unsuccessfully, to produce a child with the assistance of medical treatment.  They had also considered adoption and fostering.</p>

The way in which the arrangements were made for it to occur as well as the understanding as to where and with whom the child, once born, would live are significantly disputed; so, too, the identity of the principal care giver during the child&#8217;s four month stay in Germany following his birth.</p>

In addition to those matters already identified, the mother was, as Mr Norton and Ms Cayoun suggest, untruthful in the initial information given to Solicitors at the time the application for summary return was begun. There was significant inconsistency in her evidence about how the agreement to conception arose. The mother was dishonest in the account given about communications between herself and the father after 1 March 2014. Most startlingly of all, she was prepared to deny on oath that the voice heard on recordings played in court on the third day of the hearing was hers. It must have been entirely obvious to everyone who had listened to the mother&#8217;s lengthy evidence over two days that she was lying when she disowned the recording. I had no doubt at all &#8211; it was a further blatant attempt at deceit.</p>

There is a factual enquiry into the integration of the family unit to which he or she belongs, and that may well yield the conclusion that the child shares the habitual residence of that unit even if he has not yet achieved physical presence there, especially if he is being prevented by coercion or other force majeure from doing so. The decision of the Court of Appeal in (the A v. A) case involves a rule or general proposition because it necessarily excludes habitual residence without some past physical presence. The contrary approach, which to my mind is correct, involves no rule or generality at all, save for the advice to look, in the case of an infant, at the position of the family unit of which he is part. That does not involve a rule for dependent habitual residence. It merely asserts the possibility that habitual residence may exist in a State which is the home of the family unit of which the infant is part, and where he would be but for <span style="font-style:italic">force majeure</span>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">In this instance, D has lived in England with those he considers to be his parents and with whom he has undoubtedly forged attachments for 15 months. He is still only 19 months old and has been in the <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>care of C for all of his life. The major objective of the Convention, namely swift return, cannot be achieved. This is not and never has been a "hot pursuit" case. The application did not begin until &#8220;long after the trail had gone cold.&#8221; As Lady Hale observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (supra) &#8220;</span>It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors, which may well, as here, include the child's &#8230;integration in his new community.&#8221;</p>
