I am now of the view there is Fabrication of Illness. The reasons from moving from PP to FII has included definite situations where observations are falsified, observations discrepant from the history given by the mother and line tampering (actual harm to C). Symptoms reported are severe and long-standing and investigations and treatments performed (three endoscopies, surgical closure of infected gastrostomy site, surgical insertion of jejunal feeding tube) are likely to not be needed, are at significant risk to C&#8217;s health (operative death, bowel perforation or serious bleeding) and follow on from a history given by his mother that looks false&#8221;.</span></p>

Dr W reports that this is clear verifiable evidence of fabrication of illness as this sample of fluid containing faeces was evidenced by him not to be from C&#8217;s stomach area. Dr W reports that this faeces appears to have been the same faeces as was identified to be in C&#8217;s nappy, so it his conclusion that C&#8217;s mother has attempted to fabricate illness by taking the sample from the nappy.

When initially answering questions, Dr W seemed to be under the belief that the mother had been saying that C&#8217;s stools had been occurring at a frequency of 10 times a day, every day. He had to be taken to his own chronology to clarify the point. Both in that chronology, and within the medical notes, it seems clear that the mother was saying that C&#8217;s stools varied in frequency from 3-10 times a day. There is no record as to how often the mother would say that the frequency reached 10 times a day. Although the passing of 10 stools in a 24-hour period seems high, I have not heard any evidence to suggest that such a frequency could not be right, on at least a single episode. Nor am I satisfied that any criticism ought to be directed at the mother for using the term diarrhoea when, in my judgment, the description of the loose stools could reasonably be termed &#8220;diarrhoea&#8221; by an untrained lay person.

Further, the force that Dr Silvestrani suggests would be needed to dislodge a fully inflated balloon in the absence of infection, is likely not only to cause upset, pain and distress but also actual physical injury around the site.

For all the criticism that might be found within this judgment on the basis of the findings I have made in respect of the mother&#8217;s actions, there is nothing in the history of this case to suggest that this mother has ever taken an action so as to overtly physical harm either of her children.

I have also noted above the difficulty with being too critical in respect of descriptions of stools, in terms of frequency and consistency. The mother may have reported tarry stools as a reasonable description of what she saw before her.

The range of facts which may properly be taken into account is infinite. Facts including the history of members of the family, the state of relationships within a family, proposed changes within the membership family, parental attitudes, and omissions which might not reasonably have been expected, just as much as actual physical assaults. They include threats, and abnormal behaviour by a child, and unsatisfactory parental responses to complaints or allegations. And facts, which are minor or even trivial if considered in isolation, taken together may suffice to satisfy the court of the likelihood of future harm. The court will attach to all the relevant facts the appropriate weight when coming to an overall conclusion on the crucial issue.'</span></p>

In the context of the consideration of a wide canvas of material in reaching the factual decisions in the case, investigations of fact should have regard to the wider context of social, emotional, ethical and moral factors. The assessment of credibility generally involves wider difficulties than mere 'demeanour', which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he or she now believes it to be. With every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. The human capacity for honestly believing something which bears no relation to what actually happened is unlimited. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance.</span></p>

He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden. No judge likes to decide cases on burden of proof if he can legitimately avoid having to do so. There are cases, however, in which, owing to the unsatisfactory state of the evidence or otherwise, deciding on the burden of proof is the only just course for him to take.</span></p>

That state of affairs does not exist in the present case: to take but one example, the ship sank in such deep water that a diver's examination of the nature of the aperture, which might well have thrown light on its cause, could not be carried out.</span></p>

It requires a judge of first instance, before he finds that a particular event occurred, to be satisfied on the evidence that it is more likely to have occurred than not. If such a judge concludes, on a whole series of cogent grounds, that the occurrence of an event is extremely improbable, a finding by him that it is nevertheless more likely to have occurred than not, does not accord with common sense. This is especially so when it is open to the judge to say simply that the evidence leaves him in doubt whether the event occurred or not, and that the party on whom the burden of proving that the event occurred lies has therefore failed to discharge such burden."</span></p>

The court&#8217;s attention is drawn in particular to paragraph 4 of that list, which makes it clear that the court must consider the relevance of learning difficulties when considering the threshold test as well as at the welfare stage of proceedings:</span></p>

The concept of "parenting with support" must underpin the way in which the courts and professionals approach wherever possible parents with learning difficulties. The extended family can be a valuable source of support to parents and their children and the courts must anxiously scrutinize the possibilities of assistance from the extended family. Moreover the court must also view multi-agency working as critical if parents are to be supported effectively. Courts should carefully examine the approach of Trusts to ensure this is being done in appropriate cases. In particular judges must make absolutely certain that parents with learning difficulties are not at risk of having their parental responsibilities terminated on the basis of evidence that would not hold up against normal parents. Their competences must not be judged against stricter criteria or harsher standards than other parents. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Courts must be acutely aware of the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination and how this might be relevant to the treatment of parents with learning difficulties in care proceedings</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">. In particular careful consideration must be given to the assessment phase by a Trust and in the application of the threshold test.&#8221;</span></p>
