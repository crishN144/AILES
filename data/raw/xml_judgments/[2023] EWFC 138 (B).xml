The conclusion was reached that the mother was fabricating and exaggerating symptoms of illness in A, with the consequence that over many months and indeed years he had been subjected to unnecessary medical interventions, operations and regimes of feeding. This conduct had caused him and made it likely that he would suffer significant harm.</span></p>

As the hearing progressed, the Local Authority indicated that it did not believe that the evidence supported a finding of failure to protect against F and did not pursue this in the context of the fact finding hearing. That said his role within the household at this time was not irrelevant and may be the subject of closer scrutiny in the context of the welfare hearing should findings of fact be made in relation to the mother&#8217;s overall conduct in relation to A.</span></p>

Over the months that followed, he seemed to tolerate the regime well, although there were reports of him pulling out the tube several times, so a decision was made to introduce a more permanent feeding method.

It was also reported by the mother that A had not passed urine for 50 hours. This surprised the treating doctors since it did not fit with the clinical picture following investigation. Despite the history of vomiting, A appeared well hydrated and tests showed no signs of dehydration or kidney impairment. Investigation of the gastrostomy indicated it was in the correct position. Further, surprise was expressed by the treating doctors that it was being reported that he could tolerate feeding via the nasogastric tube but not by the gastrostomy . Both methods deliver feed straight into his stomach. During the admission it was recorded that the mother was described as &#8220;angry and frustrated and wanted to take him home as no one was doing anything&#8221;(G27).</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In November 2017, A was readmitted to Hospital B as a result of reported poor gastric feeding tolerance and vomiting. He underwent an upper endoscopy (use of a thin scope with light and camera to examine the upper digestive tract) and laparoscopy (keyhole surgery to allow access to the abdomen) . No obstruction was found. His balloon retained gastrostomy was changed to a Mick Key button (Low profile balloon retained gastric tube which sits at the level of the skin and allows the child to receive nutrition directly into the stomach). Since the investigation showed no mechanical reason for poor gastrostomy feeding the Consultant Paediatric Gastroenterologist at the Hospital B Dr R, suspected that A may be suffering from gastroparesis (a disorder in which the stomach does not empty food or liquid as quickly as it should). As result, it was decided to employ a Naso-Jeunal Tube (NJT) which again is introduced through the nose past the throat but bypasses the stomach and delivers nutrition into the small bowel. The theory is that if it avoids the stomach, it should reduce the level of vomiting.</span></p>

She told us he was uncomfortable with this but there was no vomiting. I clarified that she continued to give him 75 mL of milk for a few hours at least the night, this was despite knowing the fact that the jejunal to was likely in the stomach. She said he was a little bit unsettled but had not had any significant vomiting.  On examination in the clinic, A appeared well in himself. He was happy, bright and alert despite the history of being fed 75 mL an hour into his stomach. We confirmed the nasogastric jejunal tube was in fact in the stomach</span></p>

This is extremely concerning behaviour as mother has knowingly fed him despite thinking the tube was discharged in the stomach. This is on a background of her previously not allowing us to reinstate gastric feeds or antibiotics and obstructing medical staff during admissions when the plan is to do this. I was concerned at the time that this represented evidence of fabrication of illness and possibly attempt at induction of illness. The only explanations are either mother knows that he can tolerate gastric feeds and therefore continue to give it overnight until she came to clinic or mother was trying to induce illness as she did not think he could tolerate gastric feeding but continued to give the feed despite knowing the tube was likely to be in the wrong place.</span></p>

He could not swallow safely so needed a nasogastric tube replacement. It is not unusual for a toddler to pull out a NGT on numerous occasions. As a result, a gastrostomy was placed. Subsequent video fluoroscopes indicated that his dysphagia had resolved. The mother was not prepared to allow his feeding to progress to oral intake. By refusing to do so, the mother has hindered the normalisation of his nutrition and on balance has not acted in his best interests and cause him harm.</span></p>

Gastrostomy site infections are rare in children with a normal immune system, when the site is appropriately cared for. The advice is to clean the site daily. If infection is active, the gastrostomy site widens and therefore leaks gastric content onto the surrounding skin. The decision to progress to a surgical jejunostomy was driven by recurrent dislodgements and site infections. The procedure could have been avoided entirely if A better gastrostomy site care. As a consequence, A suffered significant harm, namely pain and discomfort, numerous antibiotic treatments, some of which were intravenous as an inpatient and an escalation to direct jejunostomy</span></p>

Following the diagnosis of his unsafe swallow, he was NGT fed for three months. There was no evidence of significant vomiting. In October 2017 he was sick due to a viral infection. The mother appeared to ascribe the gastrostomy as the cause. The delivery of gastric feeding with NGT or Mic Key button should make no difference since both feed into the stomach in the same way. During this first hospital admission for vomiting, the symptoms reported by the mother of persistent vomiting, lack of urination for 50 hours was not observed by treating staff. Dr Salvestrini suggests that the decision at Hospital  A at this time to pass a NJT may have reinforced the mother&#8217;s view that PEG feeding was the problem.</span></p>

There was no strong evidence of this and other things should have been tried first. The decision at Hospital  B to escalate to jejunal feeding also corroborated the belief of the mother in relation to the use of the gastrostomy. From this point, episodes of reported vomiting escalated despite jejunal feeding. Such symptoms were not witnessed in hospital (p.10 of the addendum report lists the non witnessed incidents of vomiting). Due to these reports, he remained on jejunal feeding for a long time and was subjected to a Mick J placement. On balance, the vomiting episodes were overreported, exaggerated or fabricated on most of the occasions, and the high gastric losses were exaggerated or fabricated. The poor feeding tolerance was therefore fabricated exaggerated. As a result, he has been significantly harmed by being subjected to invasive procedures, radiological exposure, hospital admissions and being delayed in oral intake reintroduction.</span></p>

Even during the admission in October 2017 he was eating some food while NGT and gastrostomy fed (F1519 and onwards bundle 20.09.22) The unsafe swallow was diagnosed in July 2017 and he was found to be safe to have thickened fluids by April 2019. During the admission at Hospital  A in May 2018, A was eating well, appropriate for age foods despite receiving substantial amount of enteral nutrition.(F1634- bundle30.9.22). Already at this stage he should have been having only water through the gastrostomy and be challenged to eat the required amount of food for him to thrive. Unfortunately, the reported vomiting has convinced the medical professionals escalate his enteral nutrition. At the very latest he could have been tube free-by the end 2019. At this stage he could have been moved to thickened fluids, reducing gradually the need for tube feeding support. I would have expected for him to take a maximum of six months to(re) learn to drink. A has been fed via tube with supplemental formulas (replacing the need for food intake) despite his ability to eat foods. The nursery meal logs showed that in September 22 he was able to eat and drink age appropriate food textures.&#8221;</span></p>

Both methods deliver food directly to the stomach and thus his ability to tolerate one and not the other was hard to reconcile. The reference to A not passing urine for up to 50 hours, (which I find is an accurate recording of what was being reported), was something which was physiologically unlikely if not impossible. Also, the reports of excessive vomiting but the contra indication from the clinical picture that the child was well hydrated and showed no signs of dehydration or kidney impairment. </span></p>

The cause of this I find was two fold, the fact that the site was not properly cared for by mother on a consistent basis and the fact that gastrostomy feeding was in all probability not required for the duration that it took place, thus opening up the opportunity for ongoing problems.</span></p>

She also stated A who was this time was being fed by NJT and not via gastrostomy was vomiting milk. In a conversation on the same day, with the Paediatric Day Unit (PDU), the notes record that the mother made no mention about A vomiting or being in discomfort. Her sole concern appeared to be that the NJT had been &#8220;pulled&#8221;. As has been emphasised time and again by all the doctors, feeding via NJT cannot result in vomiting of the type described unless there is an evidenced defect in the gut which there is not in this case.

The suggestion is that her anger was driven by worry and concern in relation to A&#8217;s medical situation. This assertion is particularly ironic since many of the problems have been created for the treatment of A by the mother&#8217;s failure to provide a clear and accurate history of A&#8217;s problems over time, the necessary bedrock of any treatment decisions.</span></p>

However, the court is entitled to look at the case in the round and take account of the unanimous views of those medical practitioners who were asked for an opinion about this issue. On any version of events the frequency of the requirement to replace the Mick J was very high in A&#8217;s case as compared to other patients. As is argued by the Local Authority in the course of the written submissions the court must look at the background to the case and the mother&#8217;s acknowledged difficulty with managing tube sites. Against the broader history of a willingness to exaggerate and fabricate symptoms, I must confess to being concerned about the possibility of deliberate actions on the part of the mother in connection with the damage to this equipment. That said I must not speculate and only draw proper inferences from the evidence. On balance I am prepared to accept the contention made by the local authority that the mother&#8217;s frustration and inability to manage the tube feeding and its&#8217; associated equipment effectively, is more likely to explain the issues complained of.</span></p>

Dr Salvestrini commented that the majority of patients do not experience balloons bursting. The most common cause is a yeast infection weakening the structure of the balloon. Another explanation could be the over inflation of the balloon with water. The doctor accepted defects in the balloon could not be ruled out, but it was hard to explain so many balloons bursting. I think the number was 12 or 13. Although once again I have my concerns about deliberate actions set against the broader history, I am inclined to conclude on balance that it was lack of competence on the mother&#8217;s part allied to some rough handling that is the most likely explanation for the unusually high level of balloon failures.</span></p>

In paediatrics, we are used to the fact that children with serious medical conditions inevitably have to go through investigations and treatments and we try to make wards as pleasant as possible with play therapies and clinicians are aware of the importance of being kind and stimulating to children, but you cannot get away from the fact that the ward is a hostile environment. Prevents the child from being at home and experiencing normal social interaction &#8211; family, parks etc. Then the child experiencing pain, discomfort, and uncertainty of not knowing when the next painful procedure is to take place. For A this was enhanced by the fact that he has GDD (Global Developmental Delay) so that his understanding and ability to rationalise what was happening to him was limited. The level of emotional distress was significant for him. Even on the wards, he wasn&#8217;t able to access a lot of the activities &#8211; spent a lot of time in his wheelchair so he wasn&#8217;t accessing available activities. I would say that for a child to experience the prolonged admissions and amount of investigations that I would see it as significant toxic stress and trauma which we know has an adverse impact on all aspects of development and brain development.&#8221;</span></p>

The court has yet to determine the ultimate welfare outcome for the children but his role could well be a pivotal one in the context of any suggestion that a plan of rehabilitation should be pursued for M and F as a couple insofar as A is concerned and also if the plan is for the other children to remain in the joint care of the mother and F.

It only came out in Feb 2021 in fairness to the clinicians. If you turn the clock back, one of the difficulties with fabricated illness where it is not like induced illness where you can do a test and see that the child has been given a substance. This is much more subtle and difficult. We depend on what we are being told by parents and it is our nature to accept that the parents are the expert in their child and it takes a shift for professionals to disbelieve something that has been stated. I am yet to come across a case where I haven&#8217;t thought &#8216;if only&#8217; and I&#8217;m sure the clinicians have thought &#8216;if only&#8217;, but there is a certain amount of gathering of evidence that was necessary. One could argue that with hindsight it wasn&#8217;t necessary. Looking at the notes, nursing staff had suspicions early on. The guidelines are not helpful in getting the collaborative opinion of health professionals. Whether it would have speeded up the outcome for A or prevented some of those interventions is difficult to say. One would like to think that it would but when one is dealing with subtleties &#8211; I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time going through the chronology and I had the benefit of hindsight. It is much more difficult as a clinician when you are working with a child and there is another hospital involved with the child as well. The practicalities are quite difficult. As we begin to understand the nature of this problem, we will be able to engage parents in a more meaningful way.&#8221;</span></p>
