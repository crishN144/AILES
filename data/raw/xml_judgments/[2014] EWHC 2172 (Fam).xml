	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are care proceedings brought by the London Borough of Ealing (the local authority or LA) in respect of A, who is 18 months old; she was born on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2012. As the child suffered brain trauma found to be &#8220;suspicious for abusive head trauma&#8221; on original examination (which has required treatment at Ealing Hospital and at Great Ormond Street Hospital by specialists in paediatric neurology) and for which her parents were unable or unwilling to identify a causative event, it led to the local authority issuing an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2013. At the outset of this fact finding hearing on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 the medical opinion that the child had suffered injury as a result of being shaken was not substantially challenged therefore the major decision to be reached, if possible, was the identification of the perpetrator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset parents said that A was in their care at the time of the injury however in October 2013 the mother said she had left A with her child-minder D. D was joined as intervener on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013. A fact finding hearing had been listed before District Judge Harper at the Principal Registry of the Family Division on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013, when it emerged at that hearing that it was likely A had not been in the sole care of her mother the morning of the 7th May when she was admitted to hospital the case was adjourned. On the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013 it was transferred to the High Court Family Division to be heard because of the complexities of the medical evidence (including the possibility that the child may be suffering from West syndrome), the recent joinder of the intervener, and an application for disclosure by the police. On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013, Mr Justice Keehan fixed the case to be heard on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 with a time estimate of 10 days. The case was then allocated to me.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All three of the principal actors in this case, the child&#8217;s parents and the child-minder, have admitted to lying; to the court, to the local authority social workers when they were investigating the background to the case, and to the police during their investigations. Their lies go to the heart of the case, concerning as they did who was caring for A at the time the brain trauma occurred and are central to the issues to be tried. However I have kept in mind that people lie for many reasons and the provisions of a <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas </span>direction (<span class="Emphasis">R v Lucas</span>&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref>). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the trial the unanimous medical opinion as to the likely mechanism of the trauma to A&#8217;s brain has not been subject to challenge. Instead the focus of the questioning of the experts has been the timing of the event which caused the injury and whether that would assist in identifying the perpetrator. In the absence of any contrary medical opinion and accepting that that opinion is based on the current state of medical and scientific knowledge any current analysis of the medical evidence and the possibility of an unknown cause would point towards an incident of shaking as the mechanism which caused the injuries to the baby&#8217;s head. The evidence is considered below, however, given the extensive investigation by the treating physicians of differential diagnoses and in the absence of any history of trauma from the parents there is no alternative mechanism on the balance of probabilities to that of acceleration-deceleration, with or without impact, given the nature and extent of the trauma to the baby&#8217;s brain and its sequelae. All the expert witnesses quite properly left the final decision as to timing and causal mechanism to the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The lay witnesses including the three people who are in the pool of perpetrators identified by the local authority gave oral evidence with the assistance of interpreters. Two others present in the house on the morning of the baby&#8217;s collapse gave evidence, as did the employer of R regarding her work that day. The former two were originally called to deal with whether or not the baby had been left with D in the past, but during the hearing the focus of their evidence was turned to timing, who was present in A&#8217;s home that morning and what they observed about the baby.</p>

A was brought in by her mother (R) and child-minder (D). R told the medical staff at triage that she had been looking after the baby; the notes read &#8220;? Convulsion lasting 10 minutes at 8.30 hrs this morning. Unresponsive afterwards. Brought to A + E on the bus &#8211; irritable o/A taken to resus [sic]&#8221;. The first part of that very short history formed the basis of the time of the onset of the baby&#8217;s symptoms as considered by all the medical staff, clinical physicians, radiologists and other medical experts who have written reports and provided evidence and opinion in this case. The timing of a collapse of the baby of 8.30 am was repeated by R and is recorded in the hospital notes.</p>

A had been left there about once or twice a week to be cared for by D since she was just over 3 months old, an arrangement that had then been in place for 6 to 8 weeks. D is a distant relative by marriage of the father M, and had known him prior to his moving to the UK as she had met him at his parents&#8217; home. D had visited A&#8217;s parents where they were living before and after A was born. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the first eight to ten days after A was born D had given some practical support to R for she had a baby of her own in February 2012 and had experienced motherhood herself. I shall return to the parties&#8217; backgrounds below. Everyone agrees that A had been a happy and a good baby, a baby that was full of smiles, who slept well, cried little and was easy to look after. Indeed D said that she was easier than her own daughter, and, because she thought it would be too much to look after two babies, that she had agreed to look after A principally because she was so easy to look after.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The morning of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013, according to R, she took A, as arranged previously by phone, to D&#8217;s home and left her there some time after 7 am. The baby was awake, alert and happy when she arrived and she left her there and took the bus to get to work in Kingston before 10 am. R says that when on her bus journey she had a phone call from her husband who told her he had had a phone call from D, A was crying a lot was not well, D sounded scared, that she (R) should call D and that she had better go back as D sounded worried, something was not right. R says that she thought that the baby may be hungry. R got off the bus and took another in the opposite direction, she called D. R says that D told her that A was having trouble breathing, she was rolling her eyes, she was clenching her teeth and to come back very quickly. R says that she told D to call an ambulance but D said she could not as she could not speak English. R told her to come quickly to Southall Broadway. D said that she would have to come to Southall to get a bus to the hospital, so R thought they could meet there and travel to the hospital together. R arrived at the Broadway before D. There is a dispute as to how D transported A and her own child, R says it was in a double buggy D says that she had A in a buggy and carried her daughter on her hip. Both agree that R then took A into her arms.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both agree that they travelled to the hospital by bus while A&#8217;s mother held her and that there was little conversation between them. R says she asked D what had happened and D told her A was having some kind of fit. R says that on arrival at the hospital D asked her not to tell the doctors that A had been with her that morning. R saw the doctors in A &amp; E on her own and says she repeated what D told her about what had happened with A. R says that the doctor told D to stay in the waiting room; it is agreed that she stayed there with her little girl and that she was joined first by AS (who lives with the parents) and then by M, the baby&#8217;s father. It is also agreed that D stayed there for some time but left as she needed to feed and care for her daughter, then aged 15 months.</p>

Dr Bhate recorded that A had changed in her behaviour and was no longer as responsive and interactive; she no longer giggled as much and had stopped vocalising and using her hands to grab toys and objects. She was generally floppier. A&#8217;s visual behaviour was said to be unsatisfactory as she did not seem to fix and follow appropriately. She showed no interest in toys and appeared sleepy. In a video that he watched A was observed as shaking her head in a manner that seemed to be of self-stimulatory behaviour as a result of visual impairment rather than seizures. As result an urgent EEG was arranged during the clinic which showed that A had very abnormal EEG with very frequent and with persistent epileptiform discharges which Dr Bhate said were compatible with an EEG of evolving infantile spasms. Dr Bhate concluded that the increased sleepiness and reduced responsiveness was likely to be related to the onset of infantile spasms (West syndrome) and started her on a course of treatment. He explained to the family that this would have a further impact on A&#8217;s developmental outlook as children with infantile spasms tend to have developmental stagnation and in the longer term neurodevelopmental problems. </p>

Further directions were given for the instruction of a consultant paediatrician (Professor Tim David), consultant paediatric ophthalmologist (Mr W D Newman) and a cell site expert (Mr Baxter) to assist in evidence about the involvement of D; and for the filing of medical records and other evidence. Orders were also made for the disclosure of mobile phone records.

Despite the recitals on the face of the order of Keehan J D remained without public funding or representation. By the time of that hearing some attempts had been made by counsel to arrange pro bono representation as the solicitors who had originally been instructed by her had failed for months to secure funding; despite seeking an explanation I am no clearer as to why that was the case. In May D had changed solicitors and the court contacted the Legal Aid Agency who assisted in putting funding in place.

The parties agree that there are only 3 possible perpetrators despite the presence of other adults in both houses at the material time.  There is no challenge to the medical opinion that the mechanism for the injury is acceleration-deceleration with or without impact, which, in the absence of any other explanation, is most likely to have been the result of shaking. There is no challenge to the overall medical view that within the broader parameters of time supported by the medical records the timing of the incident which caused the injuries to the baby&#8217;s brain and head is a matter for the court. The time originally given of 8:30 am was not inconsistent with the observations on admission or the rest of history given at the time. The law, which is not in dispute, is summarised below.</p>

Much of what they seek to prove, namely that the injuries and consequent brain damage, seizures, fits or brain spasms and seriously compromised development of A is not challenged. Nor is the causal mechanism challenged. The pool of perpetrators is agreed to be the two respondent parents R and M and the intervener, D. It follows that the parties have all accepted that injuries were inflicted by one of those adults. Where there is a factual dispute it remains for the local authority to discharge their burden of proof; however, in this case the local authority has submitted that the untruthfulness of all the principal and other lay witnesses present on the morning of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May means that the court cannot find any one of the three perpetrators responsible on the balance of probabilities.</p>

Of particular concern for her future well-being is the effect on her development; Dr Bhate describes her, at 16 months, as crawling, saying two words, possibly with meaning, but not making eye contact or demonstrating any visual interest.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a factor that I shall take into account along with the other factors in the case. In this case none of the parties have described or set out at any time since A was first admitted to hospital on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 any history of accidental trauma to the child, either at that time or earlier. The exploration and investigation of differential diagnoses was thorough and met with best practice requirements, if not exceeding them. They included abusive head trauma (acceleration/deceleration injury) and rare conditions such as glutaric aciduria type 1 and rare coagulation disorder. In respect of the former A had urine organic acids tested along with a carnitine profile, which were normal; a skin biopsy report, produced on the result of cultured fibroblast sent to Sheffield, excluded a diagnosis of Glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in A. She did not have glutaric aciduria. In respect of the latter A had normal results for Von Willebrand antigen, Factor XII, Factor XIII, Von Willebrand factor RiCof, Von Willebrand factor collagen binding and alpha 2-antiplasmin. A&#8217;s vitamin D levels were normal. In September 2013 Dr Bhate was able to say he could exclude rare conditions such as glutaric aciduria type 1, coagulation abnormalities and Menkes disease, as well as rickets as a causes for A&#8217;s presentation. While it remains possible that there was an unknown cause of A&#8217;s brain and head injuries it is unlikely that possibility of an unknown organic cause was overlooked in such thorough and apparently open-minded investigations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013 A was seen at GOSH as she had developed episodes of &#8220;what appeared to be flexor spasms occurring in clusters&#8221;. The spasms lasted for 5 to 10 minutes and she appeared very distressed by them. Her had behaviour changed and, as referred to above and she stopped being as responsive and interactive, no longer giggled as much, and stopped vocalising and using her hands to grab toys and objects. Her visual behaviour was described as unsatisfactory; she did not fix or follow appropriately. Dr Bhate was shown a video of her repeatedly shaking her head with her eyes closed, which he said was self-stimulatory behaviour in the presence of visual impairment rather than seizures. It must have been distressing to see. A had an EEG which was very abnormal with very frequent and persistent epileptiform discharges occurring from the posterior regions bilaterally. She had lost interest in toys and appeared sleepy. As she was sleepy A underwent a CT scan which was reviewed by Mr Tisdall, Consultant Neurosurgeon. The letter that Dr Bhate wrote after this consultation said it was likely that the increased sleepiness and reduced responsiveness was related to the onset of infantile spasms (West syndrome) and although the EEG was not characteristic there was enough evidence to treat it as infantile spasms. Treatment (Prednisolone) was started and A was to be reviewed a week later. As set out above, Dr Bhate said he had explained to the family that this would have a further impact on her developmental outlook as children with infantile spasms tend to have developmental stagnation and, in the longer term, neurodevelopmental problems. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December Dr Bhate saw A again. Since she had started taking Prednisolone she had been seizure free for 4 or 5 days, which was accompanied by some recovery in her development, as she was able to sit up and make some babbling and cooing noises, but her visual behaviour, along with other behaviours, suggested visual impairment. There was improvement in her EEG. She was to be seen again in January 2014. Dr Bhate recommended her referral to the Child Development Team as it &#8220;is very likely that she will have significant delay in development and long-term difficulties.&#8221; He recommended the appointment at Moorfields Eye Hospital was brought forward. Dr Bhate followed up with a further letter to the local authority dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013; in it he reviewed the investigations and treatment carried out in GOSH and gave his opinion which was that A had developed a form of epilepsy characterised by flexor spasms occurring in clusters accompanied by developmental stasis and regression with a highly abnormal EEG. This was in keeping with her having developed infantile spasms (West syndrome). He went on to say that West syndrome has a number of causes including developmental brain abnormalities and neurometabolic conditions, chromosomal disorders and <span style="font-weight:bold">brain trauma </span>[his emphasis]; and that the occurrence of epilepsy and brain spasms in A &#8220;is likely to be the consequence of the previous brain injury in May 2013. Epilepsy and infantile spasms are recognised complications following brain injury and have also been reported following abusive head trauma.&#8221; </p>

At that meeting they said that they thought the opinion of both an ophthalmic and a paediatric expert was necessary in the case. When asked whether the seizures suffered by A were caused by anything other than non- accidental injury, Mr Jayamohan&#8217;s response was &#8220;There are 72 causes of subdural haemorrhaging other than NAI. Not all have been tested for and not all need to be tested for in each child. Great Ormond Street Hospital have done a fairly extensive collection of tests and it is my understanding that they have come back as normal. I am not a paediatric expert but I do not think there was any evidence in this child that there is any underlying cause of subdural haemorrhaging but I am not a paediatrician and would therefore defer to the paediatrician at GOSH.&#8221; Later he said &#8220;this child has abnormal brain imaging and I would say that we are way over the balance of probability that the seizures were caused by a brain dysfunction. I believe they were caused by the same event which has caused the subdural haemorrhaging.&#8221; Both he and Dr Sprigg stressed the need for further expert opinion. Both said there was no evidence of bacterial infection. Mr Jayamohan said he could not fully exclude viral infection but relied on Dr Bhate&#8217;s investigation and exclusion of any other cause in his letter in September. </p>

He reviewed A&#8217;s case, the medical notes and the other evidence thoroughly and considered the possibilities or likelihood of the retinal haemorrhages observed in A being caused by something other than a shaking or shaking with impact. It was his opinion that the retinal haemorrhages, described as being bilateral and too numerous to count, were not related to birth trauma, minor trauma, seizures, vomiting, resuscitation, or isolated raised intracranial pressure. In the absence of an episode of major trauma (there is no history of significant trauma), or an underlying medical condition (none were found or disclosed) the retinal haemorrhages remain unexplained and were, in his opinion, consistent with shaking or shaking with impact. A continued to have poor vision 4 months after her initial presentation and he said that it was likely her visual ability will be significantly reduced compared with normal. H went on to exclude various conditions as a cause of the haemorrhages, including West syndrome, confirming that he was unaware of haemorrhages such as those found in A being caused by West syndrome and that, in any case, the condition had been found some time after the retinal haemorrhages were identified.</p>

Dr Cartlidge sets out the prognosis in his report; the seizures at the acute phase of her illness which were difficult to control; the hypoxic- ischemic brain injury visible on neuro-imaging; the delay in development already apparent by August 2013 when her gross motor development was that of a 5 month old (she was premature so her chronological age was put at 8 months); the onset of infantile spasms (sometimes called West syndrome) in November 2013. These spasms were caused by the brain injury and not the other way round (as the question he was asked posited) and are described by Dr Cartlidge as an ominous form of seizure since they are very frequently associated with developmental regression; an opinion shared with Dr Bhate.</p>

He concluded that the brain injury, the subdural bleeding, subdural effusions and retinal haemorrhages were caused by shaking (with or without an impact against a semi-yielding object) immediately before A became unwell at about 08:30 hours on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. Dr Cartlidge, as with the other experts, bases this opinion on the history which was given at the time, saying as much and that he thought the injuries were sustained immediately before A became frighteningly unwell at 08:30. He says of any person present at the time the injuries occurred, that A would have been unwell immediately after the causal event and an observer would have realised she was unwell, and that any competent person observing the action that caused the injuries would have recognised it as excessive and sought to intervene. In his oral evidence Dr Cartlidge said that he was unable to assist as to timing if the history which was given was not reliable except that the timing could be narrowed if lots of people were saying the baby was normal, it would have had to occur after those observations. Dr Cartlidge did assist as to timing by reference to the Ealing Hospital admission notes which referred to the baby being well hydrated, pointing to the causal event being that morning rather that the previous evening or night. There was, in his words, no evidence that the baby had not been fed or been without fluid for some time beforehand which suggests that there had not been an untreated head injury for some time.  It was more likely than not to have occurred within the past 24 hours.</p>

There was some difference of opinion as to whether, if the baby&#8217;s consciousness was compromised, it would be capable of being mistaken for sleep; Mr Newman was of the view that if a child had that demeanour it would be apparent that something was significantly wrong. Dr Cartlidge said that he could not distinguish between a child that was asleep or semi-conscious. However he later said that during a possible latent or &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; period, when symptoms could abate after the causal event and immediate aftermath when symptoms would be obvious, the child would still be obviously unwell, but not as frighteningly so. The immediate symptoms would be quite alarming and could include floppiness, an inability to feed or a marked reduction, an impairment of consciousness, being very pale, and an impairment of breathing. Fits can happen at the time but are more usual later. The symptoms are quite alarming and anyone present or responsible would require &#8220;a remarkable ability to ignore them and not to present the child for medical attention or treatment.&#8221;</p>

There was considerable discussion during the meeting of a child in the paternal family who had apparently suffered seizures. This had been raised by the parents as a possible sign of genetic or family predisposition to epilepsy. The notes in respect of the child were very limited and all the experts felt they could not make any diagnosis on the very limited amount of information which was, in any event, limited to that available in an email from a family member, and which itself did not contain any diagnosis. In the event this was not pursued by those representing the parents. </p>

The experts were careful and thorough, none of the experts or treating clinicians sought to stray outside their own disciplines and were meticulous at leaving to the court factual issues to be decided; there was no speculation on their part. The investigations which took place at GOSH after A&#8217;s admittance were wide ranging and disclosed no organic explanation for the trauma to her brain. There has been no report or description from any source of a previous incident or event which could have caused chronic subdural haemorrhages. The description of the baby&#8217;s buggy tipping over in the bus and being caught before it fell to the floor is innocuous and incapable of explaining a previous brain injury. I find that the time frame for the injury can only be narrowed by medical evidence and opinion to a limited extent. On the basis of that evidence including the fact that the baby was still well hydrated at 10:15 am on the morning of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 the earliest the injury could have occurred was the evening of the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013. I find that the causal event on the basis of current medical opinion was of acceleration &#8211; deceleration, with or without impact. The absence of any scalp swelling and skull fracture and the presence of retinal haemorrhaging is consistent with a shaking mechanism but precludes extreme violence.</p>

Her parents live in India and her family connections in Britain are few, if any. M has told the social worker carrying out the assessments of the extended family that he entered the UK illegally via Italy and has been here for 10 or 11 years. He came here because of inter-familial conflict about land and property. He makes his living as a construction worker. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R went to live in Southall and shared a house with other people from the same region in India and it was there she met A&#8217;s father M. They married within a very short time of meeting in a religious ceremony in a Sikh Temple on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011; this is in keeping with the cultural norm of not forming an intimate relationship outside marriage. M&#8217;s family did not approve of the match, despite what he later told the local authority. A was born in November 2011 at Ealing hospital. I am told, and have no reason to doubt it, that both parents were happy to have had the baby. R does not appear to have attended college after she became pregnant and when A was just over 3 months old she started to work as a beautician in a hairdressers&#8217; in Kingston. She arranged with D that she would look after A when R was at work during the day and M would often pick the baby up on his way home. R and M continued to share their home with people with whom they had previously been living, two men JS and AS. They are particularly close to AS. There is another man, P who has lived with them occasionally about whom I know very little. JS and AS were there on the morning of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 and both gave evidence about what they saw at home on that day to the court, I shall return to this below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Members of both R and M&#8217;s family have been assessed in India as possible alternative placements, as a result of those assessments the court has been given a deal more details of the parents&#8217; backgrounds than was available in their own statements. They both come from the Moga district in India. R speaks Hindi, Punjabi and a very little English, M only speaks Punjabi. R&#8217;s family is Hindu, as she is herself; M is from a Sikh background and family and worships at the Gurdwara in Southall. There is independent evidence of the lack of support of the couple&#8217;s marriage from the paternal grandmother and great aunt, and from R&#8217;s parents who say that they are scared of the paternal uncles who disapprove of the marriage. There is suggestion that A may not be safe in India because of the family&#8217;s attitude. Both the paternal grandmother and aunt told the social workers who carried out initial kinship assessments that A would be at risk from the male members of the family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M told the social worker that he came to the UK about 11 or 12 years ago. His statements contain little detail of his background and I am inclined to agree with the Guardian&#8217;s comment in her case analysis dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 in which she said that M had not been forthcoming during the court proceedings which had the effect of leaving R isolated. This impression was not diminished during the currency of the hearing. M initially said that he came to the UK at the same time as R but in July 2013, when the kinship viability assessments were being prepared, he told the social worker allocated at that time that he had been in the UK for 10 or 11 years coming via Italy because of inter-familial disputes about land and money. He said he came to the UK by truck and that he has no passport or other travel documents in the UK. There is no record from the UKBA or Home Office of him entering the country. In contrast to the assessment of the maternal grandparents which was comprehensive and included interviews conducted in Dharamkot, Moga in India, the information in relation to the paternal family is sparse. After hearing his oral evidence (to which I shall return) I was struck by his lack of openness and reluctance to be forthcoming about himself and his family and observe that he has often, if not invariably, left his wife to deal with most of the questions that had arisen during the case, which, in turn, added to the impression that he had not been as supportive as he could or should have been. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of D even less is known and like M her statements and oral evidence was scant when it came to information about her background and family. D has her family name, K, with which she signed her first statement in November 2013, in addition to which she uses her husband&#8217;s family name. The statement signed K in November 2013 was a very short and in it she denies ever having had A in her care. The use of the two family names seem to have caused some confusion as she has been referred to by both, by others and used both herself . Her first name has also been confused; R and M say this is because they have always known her by her private short name which is different to her given one, and I accept that is more likely than not to have been the case. Most of the information about her is contained in the social work assessments, in respect of her daughter, then 2 years old and of her unborn baby. The assessments were carried out over February and March 2014. Their contents were not challenged and are of relevance because they contain D&#8217;s explanation of the events surrounding A&#8217;s admission to hospital in May 2013. Mr and Mrs D&#8217;s marriage was not approved by the families and is described by them as a union that is looked down on by their respective communities. D says she came from India to the UK with her husband in about June or July 2011. There has been no information from the Home Office about their entry to the UK put before this court. According to D they had fled a situation in which her husband had been subjected to violence. D had known M in India as a relative of hers was married to his brother. Like R and M she lives in a shared house in Southall. She told me that she and her husband and their 2 year old daughter share the house with 5 other adults. They told the social worker they knew little about the other adults and had little to do with them. I learnt no more when she gave her evidence to the court. The author of the assessment had no immediate concerns about D&#8217;s care of her daughter. D&#8217;s husband was described as being depressed and as he cannot work legally the family rely on the support of his sister who lives Hounslow. D is due to have her second baby imminently. D does not speak English and her first language is Punjabi. I make the assumption that she comes from the same region in the India as R and M, however that may be erroneous. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">D has not engaged with the court process to the same extent as R and M. This is in part caused by an inordinate delay in her being granted public funding, which was not confirmed until the week prior to the hearing after this court contacted the LAA directly. However D had instructed solicitors by January 2014 who, for reasons that are far from clear, had failed to obtain public funding and on numerous occasions failed to respond to the local authority and the court as to the filing of evidence and D&#8217;s instructions. The court is very grateful to the solicitors now acting for D and to both counsel who prepared the case at short notice. Fortunately as the court did not sit full days on every day of this trial it gave counsel the opportunity to use the time to take instructions.  In addition to which because of the late instruction of counsel and because D has been pregnant through her involvement in these proceedings I allowed extra time for counsel to take instructions. </p>

D denied having A in her care on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and said she received a phone call around 9 &#8211; 10 am from A&#8217;s mother saying that A had been playing that morning and had just stopped moving. R asked D to attend hospital with her; and when asked by the social worker why she did not tell R to call an ambulance she said R was scared and pleaded with D to meet her, also R does not understand English so would not have been able to explain anything over the phone. She said she met R in Southall Broadway and they travelled to hospital on the bus. D is reported as denying having asked R to say she was not there with her. D told the social worker at that time that after A was in hospital R stopped talking to her and she had not seen R. D said there had been one occasion she bumped into her in Southall when shopping but that R had ignored her and they had no contact since.</p>

R&#8217;s leave was curtailed without right of appeal on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2013. It is not clear when she became aware of the curtailment; in July 2013 she is reported to be telling the social worker that she had entered on a student visa and had leave to remain to 2014. M entered the country illegally. All three say that their immigration status has had no effect on the evidence that they have given or forms part of the reason that they all lied about D caring for A on the morning she was taken to hospital with brain trauma, or why they continued to lie afterwards. They were all specifically asked about this but say it did not form part of the reason for their misleading the court for the first five months of the proceedings. Nonetheless it forms part of the backdrop to the proceedings and the events leading up to them and it would be surprising if it had not affected the parties&#8217; dealings with the authorities to some extent. This is borne out by what M told the first social worker allocated to the case; that he had initially lied about when he came to the UK because he was frightened about how he had entered the country. </p>

R told me that once she had started the lie she felt that she must continue with it, until she understood the implications for her of saying A had been in her care. D told me in her oral evidence that she had lied because R and M had told her to but did not say when this request was made and in what circumstances other than it had been on the occasion she and R bumped into each other in Southall and because she thought it would help them to get their baby back but did not attempt to explain why the lie would have this effect. </p>

However, the causal relationship with A&#8217;s injuries will have to be explored by the medical experts.&#8221; This was based on a misunderstanding of the genesis of the infantile spasms (or West syndrome) which is the brain injury rather than the other way round however it is unsurprising that because of the approach to the case at that time R continued to believe that there was an alternative to inflicted brain injury being considered; and I keep in mind that she had been told when A was first in Ealing hospital that the baby was to be treated for an infection and not possible inflicted brain injury.</p>

AS said that he recognised D (indeed she referred to him in her own statement) and knew she had looked after the baby. In further cross-examination, this time on behalf of the child, he was asked about lying to the police about knowing D.

She did not see A&#8217;s face, although it was not covered. D was evasive about why she could not see the baby&#8217;s face, saying she was in the sleeping position but without a clear description of that position. D accepted that although the hood was up there were clear sides to it of transparent plastic. She says that R arrived later than R said in evidence but was not clear when it was. According to D&#8217;s evidence after about 30 to 45 minutes she went to feed A who was unresponsive. In her evidence in chief D told the court that &#8220;she was not moving&#8230;her eyes were half open and rolling, a little, but rolling. She was like dead.&#8221; Later, in cross-examination she said that saw the baby&#8217;s eyes were half open but denied that they were rolling back. D said that she tried to feed the baby milk (this was not in her statement) but that A would not take any feed. The evidence that D gave was consistent with the evidence given by Dr Cartlidge and Mr Jayamohan as to what would occur after the causal event (as set out above).</p>

D said she then called M and she spoke to the baby&#8217;s dad and told him that A was &#8220;not moving she was not responding at all&#8221;. She asked M to call the baby&#8217;s mother. D said that when she spoke to R she told her the same things she had already told M. D said in evidence that R asked her to bring A to Southall Broadway. D then said that she told R to call an ambulance but R did not respond. D also said this in her statement, but it contradicts what she had told the social worker earlier in the year when being assessed. I note that it was not put to R on D&#8217;s behalf in cross-examination. D said that R was upset and cried a bit when she saw A, she picked her up out of the buggy. D said she only has a single buggy which the baby was in with D&#8217;s daughter on her hip. D told the court A was so floppy and unresponsive she could not have had the baby on her hip.</p>

She said could not hear what R was saying. D denied asking R not to use her name and not to say the baby was with her that morning. She told me that she lied later because R and M said that she should lie and was sorry for them. D said she was really sorry for the lies. D did not give any details at any time in either her written or her oral evidence of the circumstances or content of this important conversation with either R or M or with both of them. Her statement makes no mention of D asking her; just R when she bumped into her in Southall Broadway; earlier she had told the social worker that R had ignored her on that occasion. </p>

I knew it was serious because I had already seen the condition the baby was in and I was trying to cover up that the baby was left with me that morning.&#8221; D accepted that it had taken her almost 15 minutes to try to call A&#8217;s mother from 08:30 to 08:42 and said it was because she was really scared, but she called straight away when she realised A was lifeless. This evidence would confirm the time of the baby&#8217;s collapse as about 08:30, the time that R says D told her that morning and which she then told the doctor. </p>

She denied her eyes were rolling back as she had said earlier in her evidence in chief but said that the baby&#8217;s eyes were weird, strange and were &#8220;back, not in the right place&#8221;. She described to the court trying to feed A and said the baby would not take the feed; that A would not take the nipple in her mouth and that she could not insert the nipple into the baby&#8217;s mouth; but she denied that the baby was clenching her teeth or gums. It is difficult to imagine what else the baby could be doing to stop D inserting the nipple into mouth. D agreed that A was a good and quiet baby and that it was easy to care for her. D said to me that M had not phoned to ask her if she had shaken the baby, or made an offer for his wife to take the blame.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of the parents and the two witnesses who live with them all point to the baby being well until 7 am. It is highly unlikely that had the baby had been shaken and suffered the almost immediate collapse and frightening symptoms as described by the medical witnesses that the two other tenants had both remained unaware of it; and if aware that they would do nothing about it. The evidence of the medical experts as set out above [49] suggests it would require a most unusual person to ignore such an obviously unwell baby; that four people could do so at once is simply not feasible, likely or believable. In particular AS came across in his evidence as very fond of A and of enjoying the baby being present in the house. When he saw A her father had already left for work and so had JS who had seen and described a happy responsive baby earlier. I can and I do rule M out as a possible perpetrator.</p>

M&#8217;s evidence was, I find less than frank and I do not accept that he made that extraordinary phone call to D offering his wife as willing to take the blame. I consider it likely he is less than forthcoming in some aspects of his evidence, because, as he said himself he is frightened of the consequences in respect of his immigration status. Nonetheless I can accept the evidence of AS and JS about how they observed the baby to be that morning for the reasons I set out above. I do not consider it to be likely that M shook the baby who then exhibited the frightening symptoms described by the experts, which were ignored by AS, JS and R. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When considering the evidence of AS and JS I find that they lied in a misguided attempt to support their friends and to try to help them get their baby home. It is believable in part because it is both misguided and somewhat na&#239;ve and because it does not serve them in anyway: there is no discernable advantage to them to have done so. R&#8217;s evidence I found to be open: she accepted without flinching, that she had lied about A being left with D that morning and did not try to cover it up further, or demur about that or other aspects of her evidence nor was she defensive in her demeanour. I can well believe that she believed herself caught in a lie which she felt obliged to repeat. When considered in the context of the baby being initially treated for infection and no mention initially of inflicted injury it is more likely than not that she felt comfortable in acceding to her friend&#8217;s request to keep her out of it; particularly if R had not seen what had happened to A and played no role in the injuries her baby sustained.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn now to the evidence of D. I have set her evidence out in detail above; and of all the witnesses she alone describes a baby who has suffered some kind of trauma. The conclusion she asks me to reach is that R and/or M shook their baby, witnessed her collapse and then in a calculated act of cruelty and malice put the infant in her buggy and dropped her off leaving D to discover the results of the assault and ultimately to bear the responsibility for those injuries. Putting aside for one moment that a previously loving, caring and responsible mother would ignore the frightening sequelae of shaking and injuring her baby, it defies logic and any kind of probable motive that she would carry out a charade of cruelty only to then place herself firmly in the frame by deliberately lying to say the baby was in her care at the time. The only person that could, ever, have benefitted from the lies as to who had care of the baby was D. There is simply no other credible explanation or reason. D herself accepted in evidence that she lied to the police to cover up that she was looking after A because she knew it was serious as she had seen the condition the baby was in at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept D&#8217;s evidence that A was asleep or semi-conscious when she arrived. It maybe that D was not expecting A and had forgotten she was coming; for R&#8217;s evidence about going to work is corroborated by her employer. His evidence of a reliable and trustworthy member of staff, and the phone call R made to him to say she could not get to work on the morning of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013, all point to a person who took her work seriously and made suitable arrangements to get there. I find it more likely than not that R did tell D she was coming with the baby. I accept that she remunerated D for looking after A and that she would have wanted the arrangement to be on a proper footing. If D had forgotten she may well have been irritated at being put upon and felt aggrieved or taken for granted, which may account for her denying she had been paid. Feeling this way may have led her to being angered with the baby if she cried. Whatever the reason, and I do not know what it was, I find that D caused the injuries to A by shaking her in what was a momentary loss of control. After which she delayed for about ten or fifteen minutes before calling the baby&#8217;s mother: as she has accepted in her own evidence.</p>
