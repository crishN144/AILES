For the first three years of her life, she lived with her parents and older siblings in Zimbabwe.  In September 2010, she was taken by her father to the United States and, after many intervening events, to this country in November 2012.  Shortly after her arrival, she was removed from her father's care by the local authority and interim care orders have been in force since January 2013.  Amanda is now in foster care.  She has not seen her mother or siblings since she left Zimbabwe.  The parents, who are separated, each seek her return to their care.</span></p>

Her father had for most of that year disengaged from the proceedings but by December he had reinstructed solicitors and in February 2014 lodged an appeal, submitting that the English courts had been exercising jurisdiction improperly and that at the time the proceedings began in December 2012, Amanda had been habitually resident in the United States.  On 19 May 2014, the Court of Appeal allowed his appeal.  It held that the issue had not yet been properly considered and, making no finding about the matter, remitted the issue of jurisdiction to this court see </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re F (a child)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/789" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 789" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 789</ref>.</span></p>

On top of that, none of the four parties before the court wants her future to be decided by the courts of any other country.  The local authority, the mother and the Children's Guardian submit that this court has jurisdiction.  The father does not accept this, but he opposes any court anywhere exercising jurisdiction.

I find that once the father arrived in America, he reneged on what was expected of him and set about taking total control of Amanda's life.  The mother did not even receive a photograph of her daughter from America, nor did she know that the father and Amanda were in South Africa for two months in the autumn of 2012, nor did she hear of the grandmother's death until three months later from one of the father&#8217;s sisters.</span></p>

In paragraphs 11 and 12 of its judgment in this case, the Court of Appeal stated that the starting point in every care case where there is a foreign dimension is an inquiry as to where the child is habitually resident.   The court must be satisfied by evidence.  I approach matters on the basis that the evaluation of the evidence is a matter for the court with the assistance of the parties' submissions.  No party bears a burden of proof.  Moreover, the evaluation is a neutral one.  Although the overwhelming majority of adults and children have a habitual residence, and probably an obvious one, a small minority will not, as the existence of Article 13 recognises.    </span></p>

She has a US passport and identity card, she attended church and once a week he took her to a one hour meeting at the library.

A child of that age has a degree of independence in the day-to-day, but is otherwise dependent on her carer.

This is particularly the case where there are two parents with different intentions and philosophies of life.  It is true that the father had created a preeminent position for himself, but this was not a secure or stable state of affairs: he himself saw the mother as a risk.  </span></p>

The evidence establishes that she had two important family connections in the United States: her father and her grandmother.  She never met her three aunts because of the state of their relationship with her father.  Her connections with the outside world were extremely thin.  She did not attend preschool and had only the smallest contacts with others outside the home.  She had no friends.  Furthermore, it would be a mistake to regard this as a one parent family.  Amanda had a mother and three siblings that she was being kept apart from: this is not a zero, it is a minus when considering her social integration.</span></p>

In normal circumstances, it would be a surprising proposition that a child living at a single address between the ages of three and five does not become habitually resident there.  It is certainly arguable that Amanda was habitually resident in the United States up to April 2012 but, having considered the extremely specific and anomalous situation that she was in, I find on a narrow balance that she did not acquire a habitual residence during that period.  Her overall position was a precarious one, reflected in the degree of exclusive control that had to be asserted by one parent.  Amanda's time in the United States did not amount to a genuine integration in any sufficient degree to satisfy the requirements of habitual residence.</span></p>

However, if I am wrong about that, nothing hangs on it in the light of my further clear conclusion.  This is that Amanda was not habitually resident in the United States from the time that she left her grandmother's home in April 2012.  At that point, the father effectively went walkabout.  The only return to the United States of any length of time was necessitated by the death of his mother &#8211; it is significant that despite her state of health the father was out of the country for the entire summer.  When he and Amanda were in the United States, they had no home and following the grandmother's death, no family ties.  From Amanda's point of view, what might be described as the badges of habitual residence were entirely lacking.</span></p>

A more telling indication is that Amanda was living in a tent in a strange country in winter.  So far as I am aware, she knew not a single soul in this country apart from her father.  I think it highly unlikely that he would have remained here for any length of time, even if he and Amanda had somehow achieved the right to do so.  It is far more likely that his incessant peripatetic existence would have continued, with Amanda in his wake.  There is no indication of any degree of integration in a social or family environment in England and Wales at the relevant time.  </span></p>
