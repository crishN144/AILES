	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In this matter the question before the court is whether it is in the best interests of P, born in 2014 and now aged 6, and T, born in 2016 and now aged 4, to be vaccinated in accordance with the NHS vaccination schedule.   The application for a specific issue order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> of Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> requiring the children to be vaccinated is made by the father of the children, M.  The father appears in person.  The application is resisted by the mother of the children, H.  The mother also appears in person.  The children are represented through their Children&#8217;s Guardian by Mr Hunt of counsel. The Children&#8217;s Guardian supports the father&#8217;s application.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The father&#8217;s application initially concerned the MMR vaccine but ahead of this hearing the question before the court has widened to include each of the childhood vaccines that are currently included on the NHS vaccination schedule, the vaccinations that may be required in relation to future travel abroad by the children and vaccination against the coronavirus responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection.  Notwithstanding that the ambit of the father&#8217;s application has widened in the lead up to this hearing, I have decided that it is appropriate at this hearing to confine my decision to whether it is in the children&#8217;s best interests to receive each of the vaccines that are currently included on NHS vaccination schedule, including the MMR vaccine.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">With respect to vaccinations for possible future travel, I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate today to make an order with respect to travel vaccinations that may or may not be required at some unspecified point in the future.  The court has no information regarding when and to where such future travel by one or both of the children will take place and therefore, axiomatically, no information on the then extant requirements for vaccination in the destination identified (if any) or the then state of each child&#8217;s health at the point at which such vaccinations are proposed should a dispute between the parents arise.  Within this context, the mother stated during crossexamination by Mr Hunt that she would be happy to consider travel vaccinations as and when the need arose and was &#8220;not ruling them out&#8221;. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am also not prepared at this hearing to make a specific issue order with respect to the vaccination of the children against the coronavirus responsible for causing the COVID19 infection.  I wish to make <span style="font-style:italic">abundantly</span> clear to anyone reading this judgment that my decision to defer reaching a conclusion regarding the administration to the children of the vaccine against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> signal any doubt on the part of this court regarding the probity or efficacy of that vaccine.  Rather, it reflects the fact that, given the very early stage reached with respect to the COVID-19 vaccination programme, it remains unclear at present whether and when children will receive the vaccination, which vaccine or vaccines they will receive in circumstances where a number of vaccines are likely to be approved and what the official guidance will be regarding the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine to children.   As I make clear at the conclusion of this judgment, having regard to the principles that I reiterate below it is <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> difficult to foresee a situation in which a vaccination against COVID19 approved for use in children would not be endorsed by the court as being in a child&#8217;s best interests, absent peer-reviewed research evidence indicating significant concern for the efficacy and/or safety of one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines or a well evidenced contraindication specific to that subject child.  However, given a degree of uncertainty that remains as to the precise position of children with respect to one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines consequent upon the dispute in this case having arisen at a point very early in the COVID-19 vaccination programme, I am satisfied it would be premature to determine the dispute that has arisen in<span style="font-style:italic"> this</span> case regarding that vaccine. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The father&#8217;s application is made on ongoing private law proceedings.  Those proceedings are listed for further hearing before District Judge Brown on 21 December 2020 on the question of a child arrangements order.  Having regard to the issues raised by the father&#8217;s application, and in circumstances where the Children&#8217;s Guardian was clear that it would be of considerable benefit for this discrete issue to be determined prior to the final hearing of the substantive proceedings, the Designated Family Judge referred this matter to me in my capacity as Family Division Liaison Judge for the Northern Circuit.  On 1 December 2020 I agreed that the application for the specific issue order should be reallocated to me for early hearing prior to the final hearing of the substantive private law proceedings.  On 2 December 2020 Her Honour Judge Bancroft gave directions setting up a hearing before me to determine the application for a specific issue order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the foregoing context, at the outset of this hearing the mother made an application to adjourn this hearing to enable her to secure legal representation.  Having heard submissions from the parties I refused that application.  Whilst it is a significant step to deny to a party an adjournment for the purposes of obtaining legal representation, I was satisfied that the mother would not be prejudiced by the court taking that course in this case.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue in this case is which of two competing courses of action is in the children&#8217;s best interests and is not an issue that is legally complex.  Within this context, as evident from her two comprehensive statements, the mother has a detailed and intricate knowledge of the facts and matters she relies on in opposing the father&#8217;s application.  In those circumstances, I was satisfied that the mother was well able to argue her own case without the assistance of counsel.   In addition, the mother made clear to the court that the primary motivation for wishing to be represented by counsel was because she was concerned about being in court with the father in light of previously alleged conduct on his part.  However, this case proceeds as a remote hearing and, whilst required to see the father on the screen, the mother was accordingly not required to be in the same room as the father.   Finally, the issue of vaccination has now hung over the substantive proceedings since March 2019. As I have noted above, the Children&#8217;s Guardian is clear that it would be of considerable benefit for this dispute between the parents to be determined prior to the final hearing of the substantive proceedings.  Within this context, I was satisfied that the delay caused by an adjournment of the application would be inimical the children&#8217;s best interests, leaving as it would this dispute outstanding as at the date of the final hearing on 21 December 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As I had anticipated, the mother conducted the hearing in a way that demonstrated <span style="font-style:italic">complete</span> mastery of the evidence and principles on which she relies in opposition to the father&#8217;s application, including cross-examination of the father (undertaken by addressing her questions to me, with the father then providing his answer to those questions) and of the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The mother also made carefully structured and detailed oral closing submissions summarising her arguments before the court.  During the course of the hearing I also allowed the mother time, when requested, to collect her thoughts with respect to the questions she wished to ask of the father and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In determining the father&#8217;s application for a specific issue order I have had the benefit of two statements from the father, two statements from the mother and the Position Statement of the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  As I have alluded to, I have also had the benefit of hearing evidence from the father, the mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian and closing submissions from the parents and from Mr Hunt on behalf of the children.  The mother also invited the court to consider a number of pieces of information gleaned from the Internet, including videos posted on YouTube featuring an American paediatrician called Larry Palevsky and an American nephrologist called Suzanne Humphries, and I have done so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother has made no application for a jointly instructed expert pursuant to Part 25 of the FPR 2010.  Whilst the mother did, at the start of this hearing, raise the issue of expert evidence, it was plain that she was contemplating instructing her own expert in support of her case rather than seeking permission for a jointly instructed expert report on the issues in dispute before the court.  In any event, having regard to the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/664" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 664" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 664</ref> at [54] that I deal with in more detail below, I am satisfied that absent new peer-reviewed research evidence indicating significant concern for the efficacy and/or safety of one or more of the vaccines that is the subject of the application or a well evidenced contraindication specific to that subject child, it is not necessary for the court to have the assistance of expert evidence in cases where the question in issue is whether a child should or should not have vaccinations that have been approved and recommended by the relevant public health authorities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother and father were in a relationship from 2004 to 2017.  Subsequent to the breakdown of the parties&#8217; relationship earlier proceedings in relation to the children were stayed for the purposes of mediation.  The father issued his present application for a child arrangements order and a specific issue order on 4 March 2019.  Within the application for a specific issue order the father sought an order requiring that the children be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.  Notwithstanding this, it is clear that the primary focus of these proceedings since they were issued in March 2019 has been on the issue of a child arrangements order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Shortly after the issue of those proceedings the mother asserted that the children had made statements that she understood to be allegations of sexual abuse by the father.  This resulted in the father being arrested and interviewed by police.  No further action was taken by the police.  In addition, allegations of domestic abuse in the parents&#8217; relationship were also raised against the father by the mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In light of allegations made by the mother, the matter was listed for a finding of fact hearing, which hearing took place on 22 to 24 January 2020 before District Judge Brown.  Whilst a large number of allegations had initially been placed before the court, in the event only two findings were pursued before the court.  Findings of sexual abuse were not pursued against the father. Within this context, in a judgment delivered on 11 February 2020 the District Judge found that on one occasion the father struck the mother, causing her to fall to the floor in front of P, and on one occasion, attended the mother&#8217;s home, banged on the door, was verbally abusive, threatened not to return the children and drove his car in a dangerous manner, striking and damaging a gate post.  The District Judge considered that those findings did not constitute a bar to direct contact between the children and their father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Contact has not progressed smoothly since the finding of fact hearing.  At a hearing on 27 March 2020 the Children&#8217;s Guardian recommended that the children should gradually spend more time with the father, moving ultimately to an arrangement akin to the care of the children being shared between the parents.  Mr Hunt informs the court that the recommendation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian at this point in the proceedings was informed by their stated wish to have a relationship with their father.  Little progress was then made following the hearing on 27 March 2020 but a further limited and gradual re-introduction and increase in contact was agreed between the parents at a further hearing on 13 May 2020 with a final hearing to deal with still contested matters listed on 19 and 20 August 2020.  At that final hearing a further agreement was reached on the issue of child arrangements, with a comprehensive plan for increasing contact being put in place.  As I have noted above, the further final hearing with respect to child arrangements for P and T is listed on 21 December 2020. </p>

He is concerned that the illnesses against which the children can be vaccinated by reference to the NHS schedule of vaccinations can have debilitating outcomes for children if caught by them.  The father points to the fact that measles can be &#8220;life threatening&#8221;.  The father contends that he has never been in agreement with &#8220;antivaccination&#8221; and asserts the position with respect to vaccination of the children has been controlled by the mother.   The father submits that it is appropriate for a parent to be guided by the recommendations of the NHS and Public Health England (hereafter PHE) in deciding whether vaccinate the children in circumstances where he is not an expert in immunology and infectious diseases. </p>

It is clear that those statements represent, in part, the product of what the mother described in evidence as six years&#8217; worth of extensive &#8220;research&#8221; into the question of vaccination.  In circumstances where the mother readily conceded during cross-examination by Mr Hunt that she had no scientific qualifications beyond school level biology, it was also clear that the mother used the term &#8220;research&#8221; to describe the process of information gathering online that had provided her with the material which underpinned her arguments against the vaccination of the children.   </p>

In her second statement the mother cited a paper said to demonstrate that refined sugar reduces a child&#8217;s immunity for up to five hours, a paper said to demonstrate the health outcomes for unvaccinated children are better than for vaccinated children and a YouTube link to a video from Dr Suzanne Humphries, an American nephrologist.  Once again, it is apparent from this material that Dr Humphries is also very vocal advocate against vaccination engaged in advancing a very specific anti-vaccine agenda. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the context of the foregoing information, the mother&#8217;s objections to the children receiving the vaccinations specified on the NHS vaccination schedule can be distilled into the following grounds. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the mother repeatedly asserted that &#8220;vaccination is not immunisation&#8221;.  As noted by Lady Justice King in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination) </span>at [3], &#8220;Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease. Immunisation is the process of becoming immune to the disease following vaccination.&#8221;  Within this context, by her submission the mother appeared to mean that a given vaccination is not 100% effective and will result, in some children, in no antibodies being produced and, therefore, in no immunity against the disease in question.  In this context, the mother cited information she contends demonstrate that vaccinations result in no antibodies being produced in between 2 and 10% of cases.  This of course means that, if those figures are correct, antibodies <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> produced in between 90 and 98% of cases. Thus the mother&#8217;s first argument is perhaps more accurately expressed as &#8216;vaccination is not inevitably immunisation&#8217;.   Further, the mother asserted that the MMR vaccine does not offer lifelong immunity, by contrast to contracting the diseases which the MMR vaccinates against, which the mother asserted confers lifelong immunity. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, the mother contended that vaccination does not prevent a person from &#8220;carrying&#8221; the disease.  By this submission, I took the mother to be suggesting that this undermines the assertion that vaccination reduces the incidence of disease in a given population. </p>

	  <num>24.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Third, the mother contends that the diseases against which the NHS vaccination schedule provides for vaccination are childhood illnesses which, in healthy and wellnourished children, are generally mild, with serious complications being uncommon in that group of children and fatal complications being even less common in that group of children.  Within this context, the mother submitted that, in circumstances where P and T have a mainly organic, vegetarian diet high in nutrients and minerals and low in refined sugar (the mother contending that the latter lowers the effectiveness of white blood cells in their immunological role), she boosts the children&#8217;s immune systems appropriately.  As a result, the mother contends that P and T have strong immune systems and that, accordingly, should they contract the diseases against which vaccination is recommended by PHE they would not suffer complications (some of which, such as the danger or rubella in pregnancy, are in any event not relevant to the children) and would recover easily.  The mother also relies on the fact that the children&#8217;s &#8220;wellness&#8221; is kept high, they spend a good deal of time outside and therefore &#8220;absorb lots of vitamin D&#8221; and that immunity can be genetically inherited, the father in this context having had mumps.  In these circumstances, the mother asserts that the children are not in any of the &#8220;at risk&#8221; categories for complications in childhood diseases and do not require vaccination.  As evidence of this, the mother asserts that the children have been in contact with diseases such as Chicken Pox &#8220;as well as lots of other viruses, colds&#8221; but have not become ill.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Fourth, the mother contends that further research is required into question the efficacy and probity of vaccinations for children generally.  In particular, the mother concentrated on concerns she asserts exist regarding the <span style="font-style:italic">ingredients</span> in the MMR vaccines.  The mother provided a detailed breakdown on the ingredients she contends such vaccines contain, and makes clear her objection to those ingredients being injected into the children, the crux of the mother&#8217;s submission in this context being that this is wrong to do so without studies being done into the long term effects of the ingredients in the vaccine, with further studies required to &#8220;confirm that this is a safe delivery method of vaccines and the long term effect [of] the ingredients entering the brain.&#8221;   Within this context, the mother articulated her fear that decisions will be made in favour of vaccinating children before the evidence comes to light to demonstrate it is dangerous and detrimental to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Fifth, at the same time the mother asserts that recommendations of PHE regarding the vaccination of children are falling behind the developing science.  Within this context, the mother asserts that new research undermining the probity and efficacy of vaccination is not being taken into account by the Government or Public Health England.  In particular, the mother told the court that, having &#8220;listened to the experts who know about these things&#8221;, there are signs of vaccines possibly being responsible for long-term health issues in children more serious than the childhood illnesses they aim to prevent. In particular, the mother relies on what she contends are studies that increasingly show that the health outcomes of unvaccinated children are better than those for vaccinated children. The mother further asserted, without referring to any peer reviewed research, that there are studies being done on some of the ingredients of MMR vaccine, such as the MSG and neomycin, which are starting to prove links between vaccination and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Sixth, the mother contends that the side effects of vaccines are more detrimental to children than the effect of the diseases they vaccinate against.  In this regard, the mother submitted that payments made by the UK Vaccine Damage Payments Unit confirms that &#8220;vaccine damage is real&#8221; and that the balance of harm falls in favour of refusing vaccinations. The mother sought to demonstrate this by comparing what she contended have been only two deaths of children under ten years of age from measles in the last 10 years (relying on ONS data) with the far greater number of claims that have been to the UK Vaccine Damage Payments Unit.  Further the mother contends that, if vaccinated, there is a high chance that the children will develop a mild form of the relevant diseases (although this is not necessarily consistent with the mother&#8217;s assertions regarding the strength of P and T&#8217;s immune systems) without the guarantee of immunity and without achieving lifelong immunity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Seventh, the mother argued that, in any event, the children should be tested for &#8220;natural immunity&#8221; before the court moves to authorise the vaccination of the children.  By this submission the mother appeared to be contending for testing to show whether the children had already had the diseases in question asymptomatically and therefore were immune to the same without the need for the administration of vaccines in accordance with the NHS schedule of vaccinations.  As I have noted, the mother contended that contracting the disease for the children would result in &#8220;lifelong natural immunity&#8221; for them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Eighth, the mother submitted that, in circumstances where vaccinations are not compulsory in the United Kingdom and she is not alone amongst parents objecting to the vaccination of children, any specific issue order made by the court requiring the children to be vaccinated would amount to an unnecessary and disproportionate breach of the children&#8217;s right to private and family life under Art 8 of the ECHR.  Indeed, the mother went further and asserted that, in this context, to order the vaccination of the children &#8220;would constitute assault or even grievous bodily harm&#8221;.  In this context, the mother relied on an assertion that, when together, she and the father had agreed between themselves not to have the children vaccinated after discussing the issue in detail and after a nurse had been unable to answer their questions satisfactorily at one of the appointments at which vaccination was due to take place.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ninth, and finally, the mother argues that this case is distinguishable to those reported previously in the authorities, and in particular can be distinguished from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span>. Prior to the hearing, and in circumstances where the mother and the father appear in person, I caused a copy of that authority to be circulated to the parties in circumstances where it was an authority that the court would be required to consider and an authority that helpfully summarises the law in this area.  With respect to the principles articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>the mother submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span> was a case concerning public law proceedings and that, in this case, there are no wider concerns regarding the children&#8217;s welfare, both children being well cared for and, for the reasons advanced by the mother that I have rehearsed, having robust and well maintained immune systems.  Within this context, the mother urged the court to determine this case &#8220;in isolation&#8221; from previous decisions, including that of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Children&#8217;s Guardian submitted that in light of the background to this case, the protracted litigation and the difficulties with the parents being able to compromise, the Court needs to determine the issue of vaccination without delay in order that the parents can concentrate on resolving the issue of child arrangements.  Within this context, the Children&#8217;s Guardian is clear in her recommendation that, taking into account public policy, the recommendations of PHE and the NHS and the decision in  <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (A Child: Parental Responsibility: Vaccination)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>it is plainly in the children&#8217;s best interests to be vaccinated in accordance with the NHS schedule of vaccinations.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian contends that having regard to these matters, the court is able safely to conclude that the risk to T and P&#8217;s health in respect of not receiving any recommended vaccinations would be far greater to their health than the risk of T and P receiving vaccinations.  Within this context, the Children&#8217;s Guardian urges the court to make the specific issue order with respect to vaccination sought by the father in this case with respect to both P and T. </p>

On each occasion the court has concluded that the child concerned should receive the recommended vaccine (save that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C and F (Children)</span> Sumner J decided that the older child, aged 10, should not have the HIB vaccine, because the danger for her had past, or the Pertussis vaccine, because there was no approved vaccine for a child of her age).

The mother contended that, when together, she and the father had agreed between them not to have the children vaccinated after discussing the issue in detail and after a nurse had been unable to answer their questions satisfactorily at one of the appointments at which vaccination was due to take place. For his part, the father demurred with respect to this assertion. Whatever the true position, and as I observed on a number of occasions during the course of the hearing, it is now abundantly clear that there exists a frank dispute between parents who each hold parental responsibility as to whether the children should be vaccinated, which dispute is not capable of compromise between them and that, in the circumstances, accordingly requires the court to determine by way of a specific issue order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>
