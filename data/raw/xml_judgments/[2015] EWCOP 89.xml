Our meeting was recorded and his solicitor made a note which it was agreed would be shared with the Respondent. He spoke about those issues which have been addressed in the documents and, in particular, in his meeting with his solicitor, Ms Gidoomal (see her attendance note of their meeting of 9 November 2015 exhibited to her witness statement which appears at G6 onwards in the bundle).

At F40 she says that having consulted his consultant psychiatrist and the section 12 psychiatrist she has concluded that, "... <span style="font-style:italic">no one is able to say with any certainty that [the Applicant] does not have capacity. It was suggested by both the clinical psychologist and deputising manager that [the Applicant] has fluctuating capacity because he keeps making the same mistakes and does not learn from them Given that [the Applicant] has been detained by the state for the last 14.5 years I do not find this a particularly convincing argument. I also found very limited written evidence to support this supposition, other than a few incident reports relating to him becoming angry and upset when planned activities were cancelled. Changes to planned activities have occasionally resulted in him becoming verbally abusive and challenging of his care and detention. It should be noted that [the Applicant] has a diagnosis of ASD and it is likely that he finds the emotions generated by such disappointments difficult to manage. Given the sensitivities of his previous offences and the overriding imperative to protect vulnerable children, it is understandable that there continues to be significant anxieties amongst those charged with his care. I was also unable to confidently state one way or the other whether in my opinion [the Applicant] did or did not have capacity to weigh the risks to self ".</span> It was for that reason that she arranged a repeat assessment.</p>

However, [the Applicant] continuously puts his own consequences before that of his hypothetical victim and when questioned further about the effects of unlawful molestation on the victim, was unable to demonstrate any empathic understanding for the victim ... [The Applicant] continues to refuse to engage with the professionals that would be able to help him move toward greater independence, this refusal in my opinion indicates that he is unable to weigh the risks to self and use the appropriate support mechanisms that are made available to him.

His response was, <span style="font-style:italic">"No I'm angry frustrated in the house, but staff think I will be angry frustrated in the community if I am on shadowed leave and might sexually offend. I am clashing with staff in the house because I am so frustrated at the lack of progress, how long everything takes.

I accept the submission advanced on the Applicant's behalf that there is and that is for the Applicant to continue to reside at The Placement without being subject to the standard authorisation. I am told that there are others at The Placement who reside there without authorisation and that it would not affect his ability to stay there. It is accepted that the Applicant wants to remain. In fact he is quite positive about that. He enjoys living there but does not want to be subject to be current restrictions.</p>

He was keen to be ableto go out on his own but quite clear that he saw that freedom in the context of telling staff where he would be going and when he would be back. He would like to move on at some point but at the same time he spoke of the need to have someone around at that stage, even if was no longer living at The Placement.</p>

In particular, I am not satisfied that it is necessary in order to prevent harm to the Applicant for him to be a detained resident or that his being a detained resident is a proportionate response to the likelihood of him suffering harm. On that basis I will direct the supervisory body to terminate the standard authorisation which had been continued until the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>
