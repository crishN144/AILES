His father is SH (&#8216;the father&#8217;). The father applies to the court for a residence order. I heard the application on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">st</span> December.

All parties agree that during the last four years the court has left no stone unturned in trying to re-start direct contact. The court&#8217;s best endeavours have been unsuccessful. The last substantive order was made in July 2009. In that order I endeavoured to arrange some direct contact between S and his two half-brothers, L and N. Those attempts failed. S refused to engage. I concluded that further attempts to make that order work were futile. I therefore suspended that order.  </p>

So far as contact is concerned, if this case is to be disposed of today, then an order for indirect contact only would, I am satisfied, be the appropriate order. If I were to make such an order, then it is right to say that, for my part, in the light of my knowledge of this case, I have no real hope that such an order may in time lead on to direct contact. I have set out my detailed assessment of the mother in two judgments and in the light of that assessment I do not believe that once these proceedings are ended S&#8217;s beliefs and attitudes are likely to change.&#8217; </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The father issued his first application for a contact order in June 1999. Proceedings have been ongoing for the greater part of the last decade. In my first judgment I reviewed the history of the father&#8217;s application. I noted positive comments made about his relationship with S made by some of the professionals who had been involved (see, for example, paragraphs 24 and 28). I also noted criticisms (see, for example, paragraphs 31 and 85) I summed up my own assessment of the father in these terms: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;141. Having listened to the father as he gave his evidence, he impressed me as a devoted father who is committed to his son. At times during his evidence he was quite tearful. He is clearly devastated at the breakdown of his relationship with S. He said, movingly, that this present situation isn&#8217;t just S&#8217;s tragedy or his tragedy but is a tragedy for S&#8217;s siblings, his grandparents, his cousins, his aunts and uncles. He said that &#8216;if ever we go out for a meal there is always an invisible guest there&#8217;.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;142. However, it is also clear that the father has great difficulty in foreseeing the consequences of his actions. For example, whilst I have no doubt that his decision to seek DNA tests was, as he says, intended to underline to the mother the fact that he is S&#8217;s father, with all that that implies, I equally have no doubt that he gave no thought to whether that step might be perceived by the mother as a hostile step implying a slur on her character. In other words, he was unable to foresee that a step which he hoped would have positive consequences might in fact have very negative consequences. Similarly, his applications for permission to change S&#8217;s name and for him to be educated in the independent sector, no doubt both worthy aspirations in his mind, were likely to have and did have a negative impact on his relationship with the mother. Given that contact was at last progressing reasonably well at the time he made those applications, it is unfortunate that the father did not have the foresight to contemplate the damage that might be caused by making those applications.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;143. The events of early January 2006 provide the most powerful testimony to the father&#8217;s inability to foresee the consequences of his actions. Although the description of his conduct as being &#8216;over-zealous&#8217; still rankles with him, I am satisfied that it is an apt description. The repercussions have been profound. Having over the years put so much effort into successfully establishing a meaningful relationship with his son, all of that good work was undermined by his over-zealous response to S&#8217;s apparent disclosures. &#8216;144. That said, it would not in my judgment be either fair or appropriate to conclude that in terms of the complete and utter breakdown in the contact arrangements the father is wholly responsible.&#8217; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">My second written judgment was handed down in June 2009 and followed attempts to reintroduce some contact between the father and S. Those attempts had failed. Two particular events &#8211; a visit by the father and his wife to the place of worship and attending to watch S take part in a cross-country race at school &#8211; had not only required me to make findings of fact in respect of those events but had also provided an opportunity for me to review my assessment of each parent. So far as concerns the father, these are the findings I made: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;170. &#8230;So far as the father is concerned, I have already expressed the opinion that in terms of his ability to put himself in S&#8217;s shoes, his ability to show empathy, he does not appear to have moved on. I do not for a moment doubt the sincerity of the father&#8217;s desire to re-establish contact between himself and S. His motives are entirely honourable. However, it appears to me that the father&#8217;s single-minded pursuit of that end is blind both to the risk of failure and to the potentially adverse impact on S of continuing the fight. I noted earlier the difficulty judges encounter in coming to the conclusion that the end of the road has been reached. This father has not even begun to consider the possibility that the end of the road is in view.&#8217; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In reviewing the background history in the course of my first judgment in December 2007, I noted a consistent theme of concern about the mother&#8217;s hostility towards the father&#8217;s pursuit of contact with S (see, for example, paragraphs 12, 20, 26 and 67). I also noted some positive comments (see, for example, paragraphs 29 and 33). Although for a time there had appeared to be some improvement, at least in the sense that contact took place regularly and successfully, since the breakdown in contact in February 2006 the earlier concerns about the mother&#8217;s attitude towards the father&#8217;s contact with S have resurfaced.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In my first judgment in December 2007 I came to the following conclusions about the mother: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;146. In January 2002 Judge Deeley expressed some very strong views about the mother&#8217;s attitude towards contact. After that hearing there was considerable improvement. Alternate weekend staying contact and holiday contact (including holidays abroad) took place. It is clear that the mother did, as she says, take to heart the criticisms made by Judge Deeley. As I noted earlier, in January 2004 Judge Fisher formed a much more positive impression of the mother. I have taken time to reflect on the evidence before arriving at my own assessment of the mother. I am not able to be as positive as Judge Fisher. In a number of respects the evidence before me, including my own observation of the mother giving evidence during this hearing, leaves me with some concerns. &#8216;147. I have no doubt that the events of early January 2006 were traumatic for the mother. Not only the alleged disclosure but also the father&#8217;s failure to return S to her care must have been very deeply upsetting. There had undoubtedly been some positive changes in the mother&#8217;s underlying attitude to contact following the hearing in January 2002. I have no doubt that the events of early January 2006 put those changes into reverse.  </p>

Although the mother says that she is open to contact resuming when S is ready, I am not wholly convinced that she means what she says. In some respects, her conduct and her past comments tell a different story. The following issues, in particular, lead me to that conclusion: </p>

Even if S were more open to the possibility of contact, the impact of a reintroduction of contact would be likely to have some negative side effects in S&#8217;s mind, given that he would have to reduce some of these activities. </p>

S said his mother had given him the choice whether he read the letter or not. As Ms J said &#8216;Sometimes the &#8220;tough love&#8221; of a parent it not to give an 8 year old child a choice if we believe what we are doing is in their best interests.&#8217; The same point could be made in respect of S&#8217;s failure to acknowledge presents received from members of the father&#8217;s family and his unwillingness even to send a postcard to his half-brothers when on holiday. </p>

There is a difference between a parent allowing contact to happen and a parent encouraging contact to happen.

She engages in brief weekly telephone conversations with the father. Although at one level all of this is very positive, it could equally be construed less favourably as the mother accepting a level of inconvenience for herself as a price worth paying in order to maintain the present status quo of no contact. In this context it is appropriate to recall the note in the guardian&#8217;s report that when discussing S&#8217;s disclosure with the mother she had said that she would never have abused S in this way &#8216;because she loves her son more than she hates RG&#8217;. </p>

As has been noted on behalf of the father, the effect of this was that Dr N was providing a report from the standpoint of a treating consultant rather than that of an independent medical expert coming fresh to the case. In the event, Dr N was not formally instructed in a medico-legal capacity until after she had recommended that contact cease and at a time when she had not spoken to the father or appraised herself of the long and complex history. The concerns about what I have described as a &#8216;curiosity&#8217; become more acute when one considers both the rapidity with which the mother made e-mail contact with Dr W once she knew he was being proposed as a possible expert witness in the case, and the lack of candour in the content of that e-mail. </p>

The amount being paid was not an insignificant sum &#8211; around &#163;450 per month. It was being paid regularly. This father is not one of those feckless fathers often referred to by way of justification for the existence of the Child Support Agency. I cannot recall ever before, whether in practice or on the Bench, having come across a mother suddenly turning her back on child support that was being paid regularly and without demur. I regard the mother&#8217;s excuse for discontinuing child support as being specious. Even since contact stopped, this father has at all times been willing to provide financial support for his child and yet the mother has shunned his contribution. </p>

I did not accept those recommendations. Instead, I gave permission for the case papers to be reviewed by Dr W, a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist with a special interest in high conflict contact disputes.

He said that in his experience again and again he has found that alienation &#8216;doesn&#8217;t arise out of a particular event. It often arises just out of nothing.

However, it was clear that the father&#8217;s consent to that order was, in one sense, tactical in that he hoped that by making it clear that he was not intending to disturb the residential status quo S and his mother would feel more secure and that S&#8217;s approach to contact may soften. In her evidence the mother herself had said that the making of a residence order would &#8216;go a huge way to help S to feel secure&#8217; (paragraph 112).

The father lives in the South East with his wife, LH, their two sons L and N, and the father&#8217;s parents who are both retired professionals. LH does not work. She is the children&#8217;s primary carer. She is responsible for undertaking the school run each day. The children are privately educated. Both attend the Z School. The Z School is a co-educational day preparatory school for children aged from 2 to 13. In the event that S should join the household the father proposes that he, too, should be privately educated. He proposes that S attend the Z School until the end of the academic year 2010/11. The father says that a place is available at the Z School, subject to S undergoing an interview with the Head Teacher. Term starts on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">th</span> January.  </p>

The normal school day ends at 4.15pm. If S were attending an after-school club then the father may be able to collect him from school. More often than not it is likely to be LH who would collect him from school. In the short term, whilst S settles in, the father would be able to work from home. The father has an option to leave his present employers in May. His employers are keen to retain his services. The father believes that his employer&#8217;s desire to retain his services will enable him to negotiate terms compatible with the demands on him as S&#8217;s father.

They may be summarised, briefly, as follows: that the mother is more culpable than the father for the breakdown in contact and the failure to restore it; that whereas the father has lacked insight the mother has been well aware of the likely consequences of her actions and has behaved wilfully; that the mother&#8217;s behaviour has created antipathy and coloured S&#8217;s thinking about his father; that although in recent months there have been some signs that the mother may have been attempting to change course, the reality is, as she herself admitted in evidence, that she has now lost control of S; that the consequence of all of this has been that S has become alienated from his father; that S has been emotionally affected by being at the centre of parental conflict and is at risk of future harm if he is unable to enjoy a meaningful relationship with his paternal family; that the court is pessimistic about the mother&#8217;s ability to change. </p>

In contrast, she submits that it is plain from the court&#8217;s findings that the mother is very unlikely to enable S to have a relationship with his father during the remainder of his childhood. Miss Ball referred to S&#8217;s reference to his father as a &#8216;monster&#8217; and submits that that suggests S is already suffering emotional harm. The consequence of the mother&#8217;s continuing failure to enable S to have a relationship with his paternal family will be that he will continue to suffer emotional harm; that he will be deprived of a relationship with his brothers; and that he will continue to live in an environment where part of his identity is the subject of disrespect and hatred.  </p>

References in the case law to, for example, the fact that the children of separated parents are entitled to know and have the love and society of both their parents or to the fact that the mutual enjoyment by parents and child of each other&#8217;s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life, may assist the court in its determination of what is in a child&#8217;s best interests but nonetheless remain secondary to that overriding principle. </p>

A headline in the Daily Telegraph on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">st</span> November announced &#8216;Judge orders boy to live with father against his wishes&#8217;. The reference to the case is In the Matter of R (A Child) [2009] EWCA Civ 1316. That case bears some striking similarities to the case with which I am concerned. For example, at the time of the order for transfer child R was of almost the same age as S; there had been a long period in which the father had had no contact with child R, that period (six years) being even longer than the gap in contact between the father and S; child R was thriving in his mother&#8217;s care and appeared to be doing well at school, just as in this case; child R was hostile to the prospect of moving to live with his father, again, just as in this case. There are also two significant differences between that case and the case with which I am concerned. Firstly, although there had been a six year gap in contact, during the period of eighteen months leading up to the order transferring residence to the father, the father had been having contact with child R even though the circumstances of that contact were far from ideal. Secondly, the order made by the judge transferring residence from mother to father was an order recommended by both child R&#8217;s guardian ad litem and by the psychiatric expert, Dr M. </p>

The second point leads directly from the first, and that is that every case is fact-specific. In the case before me I am concerned with the question of what is in S&#8217;s best interests. In determining that issue I must have regard to all of the findings I have made about these parents and about this child in the course of these very lengthy proceedings. Notwithstanding the similarities, S&#8217;s family history and circumstances are different from those of child R. </p>

In more than fourteen years on the Bench, that is my experience too.  The step of transferring residence from one parent to the other in a high conflict contact case is, as Lord Justice Ward observed in Re C (Residence Order) [2008] 1 FLR 211, a step more often threatened than carried out. Whether that step is the appropriate step for me to take in this case is the question I now turn to consider. </p>

His behaviour when Dr W visited his home (see paragraph 16 of my judgment of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">th</span> June 2009) was grossly abnormal. His behaviour when told that his father would be attending the cross-country race and his subsequent behaviour on arrival at school (see paragraphs 54 to 69 of my judgment of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">th</span> June 2009) was equally concerning. During one of the attempts to engage S in meetings with his half-brothers in the summer of 2009 &#8211; an event that can only be regarded as completely non-threatening &#8211; he ran off. I mention this abnormal and disproportionate behaviour since it is likely to be an indicator of his response to the change in his circumstances now proposed by the father. On behalf of the mother, Miss Meyer asks how the court could ensure that a handover took place given the kind of extreme reaction one might reasonably expect from S. Indeed, she goes further than that and suggests that even if the physical transfer of care could be achieved there is a strong likelihood that the problem of dealing with a distressed and unco-operative child would be likely to recur every time there is a move from the care of the mother to the care of the father at the end of contact visits. </p>

I remind myself of the views expressed by Dr W in his report of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">nd</span> October 2008. In that report Dr W responds to a number of specific questions put to him, one of which was an invitation to express an opinion on &#8216;the impact of a permanent move on S and what support could be put in place to manage such a move&#8217;.

That distress would be greatly reduced if his mother was able to co-operate with the procedure and help in the transfer from one home to another. It would be reduced if there were reasonable arrangements for subsequent contact and if the mother was able to behave in a way which supported the change. She is an intelligent professional woman working in the area of human psychology. She should know what she has to do to help S, but I have no doubt she would benefit from support in dealing with her own feelings, and possibly to a lesser extent in knowing how to help S. </p>

On the one side must be placed those factors which should be counted in favour of maintaining the status quo. On the other side must be placed those factors which should be counted in favour of changing the status quo. Only when the relevant factors have been assigned to their appropriate place in the scales can the court come to a judgment as to where the ultimate balance lies. I therefore begin this part of my judgment by considering what factors should be weighed in the balance and on what side of the scales. In a case with a history as long and complex as this case I accept that there is scope for difference of judicial opinion as to which factors should be placed in the scales and on which side. In the next two paragraphs I set out the factors which appear to me to be the most important though I make it plain that in isolating those factors in this way I do not lose sight of the totality of the evidence before me. I do not rank them in any kind of order. </p>

Those difficulties could conceivably require the use of some degree of force in order to achieve the transfer.

However, I have found that S has already suffered emotional harm and ultimately it seems to me that the decision comes down to a balancing of the risk of future harm since S is entitled to expect that those responsible for his care (including the court) will seek to protect him from the risk of harm. There is a risk, though not a certainty, of S suffering psychosocial harm by remaining in his mother&#8217;s care where it is likely that he will continue to harbour distorted views of his father and paternal family with all the consequences that will have for his self-identity and self-esteem. There is also a risk, though not a certainty, of S suffering emotional harm by being removed from the only home he has known, from the care of a mother to whom he is strongly attached and from his maternal family and friends.  </p>

Although I have been critical of the father for his lack of insight and empathy, the reality is that the mother has been equally guilty of a lack of insight when it comes to the risk of harm to her son as a result of his alienation from his father. If S remains in her care and that risk of harm materialises, I would be concerned that this mother may find it difficult to acknowledge the problem and take appropriate steps to address it. To acknowledge the problem would require her to face up to the truth that she bears some responsibility. I have no doubt that she would find that immensely difficult.  </p>

Miss Meyer invited me to consider recalling Dr W. I declined to do so. In arriving at the decision not to adjourn to enable Dr W to be recalled I had in mind a number of factors. In particular, I have received a substantial amount of evidence from Dr W, both written and oral, upon which I was satisfied that S has suffered harm and is at risk of future harm (as discussed, for example, at paragraphs 80 and 81 of this judgment). I was satisfied that Dr W&#8217;s evidence also enabled me to come to a conclusion about the distress that S would be likely to suffer if I ordered that residence be transferred to the father and as to whether that distress was likely to be of a magnitude that would cause him harm (see paragraphs 76 and 82 of this judgment).
