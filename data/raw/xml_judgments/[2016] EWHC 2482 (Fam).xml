	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 January 2016 I handed down my judgment in relation to the applicant husband&#8217;s substantive set aside application issued in July 2012.  The case is reported as <span style="font-style:italic">AB v CD </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/10" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 10 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 10 (Fam)</ref>.  This is my judgment in relation to the costs of that application.  As before, I intend to refer to the parties as &#8216;the husband&#8217; (&#8216;H&#8217;) and &#8216;the wife&#8217; (&#8216;W&#8217;) notwithstanding the fact that their marriage was dissolved some years ago.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not propose to rehearse the background to this case.  The facts and my findings are set out at some length in my previous judgment which should be read in conjunction with my decision in relation to costs.  In essence, I found that the wife&#8217;s failure to disclose the existence of a substantial injection of cash from an external investor into a fledging technology company which she had incorporated prior to their marriage amounted to material non-disclosure.  That non-disclosure resulted in the setting aside of a consent order dated 10 April 2012.  The terms of that consent order had been approved by the court on 21 March 2012 following negotiations between the parties the previous month at the First Appointment of cross-applications for financial remedy orders in the divorce proceedings.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I absolved W of any deliberate or fraudulent intention to deceive H in terms of the disclosure she had provided in her Form E, I was highly critical of her failure to deal openly, promptly and comprehensively with his subsequent enquiries about the cash injection from Odey Asset Management.  He had become aware of the investment following the publication of an article in the national press in May 2012.  In particular, I found that her failure to alert him to what I found to be an equity investment in B Ltd was <span style="font-style:italic">material</span> non-disclosure on her part since his decision to accept the terms of the compromise they reached was made in ignorance of a fact which, in other circumstances, would have been highly influential on any view he might have taken as to the global terms of that compromise. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now have to determine where the burden of costs should lie following the set aside hearing and those which preceded it.  The combined bill of costs which the parties have together run up is a fraction less than &#163;1.32 million, an astonishing figure after a very short marriage of little more than two years (or no more than months, on H&#8217;s case).  Whilst W&#8217;s costs have been contained to a limited extent by her recent status as a litigant in person, she has nevertheless incurred costs of almost &#163;478,000.  H&#8217;s costs are now &#163;841,700.  It is a particular tragedy for this couple since, whilst H&#8217;s shoulders may be financially broader than W&#8217;s, neither can afford to have spent these sums on their legal teams in what should have been a relatively straightforward financial remedy case.  Perhaps the final irony is that W has now had to liquidate her shares in B Ltd in order to meet pressing debts.  This was the  very entity over which they were in dispute.   Notwithstanding her resignation from the board of directors and subsequent (or impending) cutting of all ties with the company, H maintains his claim to ownership of his shares in B Ltd (a 4.6% minority interest).  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In compliance with my decision in relation to set aside, W has recently executed a share transfer form by which her legal and beneficial interest in 19,738 shares in B Ltd is to be returned to H.  That document was sent to H&#8217;s solicitors on 15 July 2016.  There is an ongoing issue between H and the company as to whether or not those shares are subject to the Article 12 rights of pre-emption which are set out in the company&#8217;s Articles of Association.  Counsel for B Ltd, Mr Edward Davies, attended part of the costs hearing on behalf of the company.  I have already expressed my provisional view that, as a result of my set aside order, it is not open to the company to argue that H is not the beneficial owner of these shares.  However, that debate &#8211; if it is to continue &#8211; is a matter between the company and H and I propose to say no more about it in the context of my judgment in relation to the current costs application.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the parties&#8217; present positions, H seeks an order for costs against W.  On 18 March 2016, his solicitors wrote to W seeking a total of &#163;538,873 in respect of his costs incurred in both the original ancillary relief application (just under &#163;90,000) and the set aside proceedings.  That letter also contained his proposals in relation to the substantive financial proceedings.  To obviate the need for a full rehearing of the cross-applications for financial relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, he made an open proposal to accept a lump sum of &#163;200,000 (in effect, the return of the sum he had paid over in part satisfaction of the original lump sum order).  On the basis that he would retain his shares in B Ltd, the property which they had bought together in the Oxfordshire countryside would be sold with H receiving reimbursement for all mortgage payments made since the 2012 consent order and any balance remaining would be split equally between the parties.</p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between March and June 2016, there were various attempts to settle the matter in the round.  On 16 May 2016, in accordance with my direction, a settlement meeting was convened at the offices of Stewarts Law LLP.  That meeting did not conclude matters despite the earnest encouragement which I had given to both sides to stem the haemorrhage of costs which their ongoing dispute was continuing to generate.  By his most recent proposal on 22 June 2016, H offered to accept a liquidated sum of &#163;450,000 from W towards his costs.  On this basis, he proposed that there would be no further cash adjustment between the parties and he would retain the entirety of any net proceeds of sale from the country property in Oxfordshire.  Under the terms of this proposal, his shares in B Ltd would be transferred into a Blind Trust for the exclusive benefit of one of his daughters.  That Trust would be administered by a professional trustee thus ensuring that he could exert no influence over any future dealings with the shares.  Clearly he hoped that this would reassure W (and the company) in relation to the absence of any future involvement by him in the company&#8217;s affairs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That offer was not accepted and, on behalf of H, Mr Yates now seeks his costs from W on an indemnity basis.  He asks for a substantial payment on account of the costs order which he seeks. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of W, Mr Amos QC submits that, despite the fact that W lost the set aside issue, there is substantial mitigation for her position in relation to costs because of H&#8217;s own litigation misconduct in these proceedings.  On 25 May 2016 she made an open offer to contribute a fixed sum of &#163;50,000 towards his costs.  That, Mr Amos contends, should be the limit of her exposure in relation to any costs orders.</p>

In other words, as Butler-Sloss LJ had held in <span style="font-style:italic">Gojkovic</span>, the starting point is that costs follow the event.

In fact, objective analysis would suggest that overall the father was rather more successful than the mother.  A consequence of FPR 2010 r 28.2(1) and its incorporation of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (CPR) 44.3(4)(c) is that in relation to those proceedings excepted from r 28.3, protection in respect of costs can be achieved by making a <span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank v Calderbank</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] Fam 93" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] Fam 93</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1975] 3 WLR 586" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1975">[1975] 3 WLR 586</ref>, (1975) FLR 113 offer.

In one sense, the preliminary - but &#8216;stand alone&#8217; -  issue of set aside was always going to be binary in terms of outcome.  Either the original consent order would be set aside or it would not.  Regardless of any substituted order which the court might go on to make, one of these parties was always going to succeed or, alternatively, fail on that issue.  Here, says Mr Yates, H has undoubtedly succeeded.  Pursuant to my judgment handed down in January this year (2016), I have set aside the consent order made by District Judge Gordon Saker dated 21 March 2012.  The court has thereby relieved H of the consequences of an unfair order based on material non-disclosure.  In these circumstances, submits Mr Yates, my first consideration in determining the destination of any costs order should be that litigation success.</p>

Throughout the hearing, she was anxious to ensure that I had understood every aspect of her case and the emphasis she placed upon it.  Yet I found in paragraph 179 of my judgment that this statement, as recorded in Withers&#8217; letter of 22 May 2012, and the rearguard action which she fought over many months to suppress his challenge to the consent order could not, and did not, withstand the forensic scrutiny to which it was later subjected.  Even Mr Amos was obliged to concede the thoroughly misleading nature of this statement by short-hand describing this letter as &#8220;the lie-letter&#8221;.   The letter continued that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;hopes that Odey will make a proposal</span>&#8221; and stressed that there were no new documents which were relevant to the value of B Ltd since she provided her financial disclosure.

Despite that concession, H&#8217;s application for set aside continued to be opposed.  It was opposed by W notwithstanding the fact that, in response to the five direct questions formulated by Parker J at the conclusion of the May 2013 hearing, W had specifically confirmed the existence of the &#163;3.5 million investment in her company in October 2011.  She maintained her opposition to the set aside application throughout the ten months or so which elapsed between that hearing and the five day final hearing listed before King J (as she then was) at the end of March 2014.  Eminent leading and junior counsel were instructed on both sides for the purposes of that hearing.  For reasons which I have already explained, that hearing was ineffective but H&#8217;s application for set aside was still opposed when the case was listed for final hearing before me over a year later in June 2015.  It was not until that final hearing was up and running before me in June 2015 and Mr Fletcher was giving his evidence in the second week that the position emerged finally from Odey&#8217;s perspective.  It had made an equity investment of some &#163;3.5 million in October 2011 and had received a share certificate in respect of that investment.  Mr Fletcher could not have been more clear.</p>

Until very recently, H had been willing to compromise his claim for costs on the basis of a sum which represented a little more than 53% of his total costs bill to date (although his offer in June 2016 represented a higher percentage of closer to 75% as his global costs as at that date were somewhere in the order of &#163;600,000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

That offer represents a recovery of no more than 6% of his total costs bill and Mr Yates invites me to reflect both his client&#8217;s success and the absence of any reasonable offer from W as a sufficient foundation for an award of indemnity costs.</p>

Unlike H who has called on Mr Yates throughout to represent him armed, as he is, with his detailed mastery of the facts and law gleaned through an unbroken timeline in this litigation, she had to conduct the final hearing herself.  Mr Amos refers to the fact that W&#8217;s inability to put before the court evidence which she had (unilaterally) obtained as to the relevant value of the shares in B Ltd at the time of the consent order and as a result of an offer in April 2016 from UTC (which wanted to acquire the entire issued share capital in the company) should be considered in the context of costs alongside her failure to inform H about the true state of affairs vis &#224; vis Odey&#8217;s original investment of &#163;3.5 million.</p>

I found (at paragraph 173 of my judgment) that, had a forensic valuation been ordered by the court in default of settlement in February 2012, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in all likelihood Odey&#8217;s recent investment/injection of cash in B Ltd would have been a potentially material factor in any such valuation exercise&#8221;</span>.  I further found (at paragraph 191) that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the potential undervalue of both parties&#8217; shares in B Ltd is a fundamental obstacle to the integrity of the 2012 consent order&#8221;</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic"/>However, it is worth recording again what I found in relation to the materiality of her non-disclosure which went well beyond the question of the <span style="font-style:italic">actual </span>likely &#8216;paper&#8217; value at that point in time.  I said this:</p>

		    <p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in">I have no hesitation in finding that non-disclosure to be material.  First, the order was presented to the court as a consent order to which both parties had given their full agreement.  Its terms brought to an end significant legal rights which each had against the other to bring financial claims and seek orders.  Those rights were dismissed by the court in order to give effect to the clean break which each wished to achieve.  H was deprived of the opportunity of deciding whether or not to agree to the terms proposed on the basis of a fully informed decision.  He was not provided with the disclosure of information which he says would have been highly material to his decision to accept or reject the terms proposed, or to insist upon a renegotiation of those terms.  In such circumstances, it is difficult to see how he can be said to have given full consent. </p>

I accept his evidence on this point.  It seems to me that, in this context, it matters not whether the Odey investment in B Ltd had been &#8220;transformational&#8221; in the window between October 2011 and February 2012.  In his eyes, as an experienced venture capitalist, Odey&#8217;s involvement had the <span style="font-style:italic">potential</span>, if not the guarantee, to make his personal investment in B Ltd significantly more valuable than the notional figure he had presented in his Form E.  Because of W&#8217;s far greater holding of shares, it also had the <span style="font-style:italic">potential</span> to increase her personal wealth to a point where the net benefit passing from H to W under the terms of the consent order became an unfair adjustment to their respective capital positions.  That factor alone is one which would have had to be weighed by the court in deciding whether or not to make an order in the terms sought.&#8221; [my subsequent emphasis]</p>

I have absolved her of any deliberate attempt to mislead him in the disclosure she made in her Form E and I have already acknowledged the degree of dismay she is likely to have felt at the prospect of having to continue to engage with her former husband when she thought that all matters between them had been finally concluded.  I am conscious of the very detailed nature of the questions which Vardags had posed in their opening salvo on 21 May 2012.  Nevertheless, it is equally clear to me that, as H clung tenaciously to his enquiries, W&#8217;s responses became less helpful to the point of being thoroughly misleading.  The tragedy of these current costs is that most of them could, and should, have been avoided by a clear and transparent response from W at the outset.

He points to the manner in which he has approached this litigation which amounts, in effect, to a &#8216;campaign&#8217; which he has conducted against W in an entirely disproportionate and heavy-handed manner.  It is said that his repeated and consistent reference to her &#8216;fraud&#8217; is a matter of significant concern in circumstances where she was meeting that allegation as a litigant in person.  Mr Amos suggests that, as part of his vindictive &#8216;crusade&#8217; against his former wife, H was fully aware of the commercial consequences for her in terms of reputational damage were that charge to have been made out.  He contends that H has left no stone unturned in securing the result which he has now achieved.  Not only has their original agreement been set aside, but W has also lost everything which she invested into B Ltd over many years of hard and unstinting work and dedication to that company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Amos develops his submission in this way.  He points to the fact that H&#8217;s obsessive approach has resulted in a much wider enquiry than would, or should, have been necessary.  He identifies (quite correctly, in my view) the central question which required an answer in the set aside application:  <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Would H have entered into the deal he did, had he known about the Odey cash injection in 2011 ?&#8217;</span>.<span style="font-style:italic"/>The answer to that simple question, submits Mr Amos, became lost in a myriad of other questions and requests for much more detailed disclosure relating to the ongoing negotiations between B Ltd and the Ministry of Justice in its bid to secure the potentially lucrative Government contract.   I was reminded about the evidence which W had given me during the original set aside hearing as to the vast quantity of documentation which this bid had generated.  In circumstances where the company directors had specifically reminded her of the fiduciary duty of confidentiality which she owed B Ltd in the midst of these highly commercially sensitive negotiations, I can well understand how she felt herself to be in a very difficult situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is at this point that it becomes important to highlight an aspect of H&#8217;s own conduct which in my judgment has had a direct bearing on W&#8217;s reaction to his ongoing enquiries.  During the course of these proceedings, as H has accepted,  he initiated discussions with a journalist from the Daily Mail to whom he disclosed confidential information from these proceedings, including the disclosure of part of W&#8217;s Form E.  As I found in my substantive judgment, his reasons for this approach do him no credit at all.  I am entirely persuaded that his intent towards W was not innocent:  on the contrary, it was on any view spiteful and can only have been designed in some manner to harm her reputation or standing.  She is probably right in her description of his actions as the forerunner to a &#8220;smear&#8221; piece about her in the national press.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that both W and the board of B Ltd (who knew about his actions) had deep misgivings about disclosing highly sensitive commercial information into the litigation arena.  I heard during the substantive hearing in June and July 2015 from Professor Kay that there was a genuine concern that H would seek to disseminate any new information provided to the detriment of both W and the company.  I heard, too, about an unsolicited approach he had made to one of the former investors in B Ltd.  I have little doubt that this approach had been designed to unearth more information about W&#8217;s dealings on behalf of the company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This course of conduct on H&#8217;s part does not, and cannot, excuse W&#8217;s failure to disclose relevant information at an early stage of the enquiry but, in my judgment, it does go some way to explaining her unwillingness to engage fully in the weeks and months following his statement of intent to overturn the consent order.    Mr Yates seeks to persuade me that any &#8216;misconduct&#8217; on H&#8217;s part in this context was dealt with by the terms of the order made by Coleridge J on 19 July 2012.  On that occasion, the court was considering cross-applications for injunctive relief in relation to the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  The court made no order as to costs as between H and W.  The mutual undertakings given on that occasion are unlikely to have done anything to dispel the fundamental mistrust which W (and her board of directors) had in H and, to this extent, he has by his own actions been responsible for much of the climate of hostility which exists between them.  In my judgment, there is much in Mr Amos&#8217;s submission that, whatever reassurances W received from her lawyers at the time, these would not have alleviated her concerns as to his potential to damage through further &#8216;leaks&#8217; her reputation in the City given the commercial realities of life in that sector<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to bear in mind, too, that at no point in my judgment did I find that W&#8217;s disclosure during the course of the financial remedy proceedings had been fraudulent.  I found that her failure to disclose Odey&#8217;s investment in B Ltd was both material and a breach of her obligation to provide full, frank and complete disclosure of all matters which were, or might be, relevant to H&#8217;s decision to agree to the terms upon which the parties settled.  But, accepting as I did her evidence as to her <span style="font-style:italic">subjective</span> belief in its relevance to the valuation of the shares in B Ltd, I absolved her of any <span style="font-style:italic">deliberate</span> fraud in relation those stages of the litigation.  Where I did find fault, and deliberate fault, on her part was the failure to provide H&#8217;s legal advisers at a very early stage with a transparent account of Odey&#8217;s cash injection in the company.  Until a very late stage the only figure which was ever provided from W&#8217;s side was a figure of &#163;150,000 which was said to have been a loan made by Odey.  Details of the c.&#163;3.5 million cash injection only surfaced eventually after H&#8217;s legal team began to query the position when that figure emerged following publication of company&#8217;s 2012 annual accounts.  Whilst W may have had a number of serious concerns about the potential for the &#8216;leaking&#8217; of information which was put into H&#8217;s hands via these proceedings, those concerns cannot, and did not, justify the manner in which a series of misleading statements were made to H through his advisers, both in correspondence and in documents put before the court by way of evidence.</p>

He had initially started this line of enquiry before the 2012 consent order: its path was trailed in his first questionnaire.  W was cross-examined about this by Mr Yates on a number of occasions during the set aside hearing.  Mr Amos has identified from the transcript of proceedings  a number of references to &#8216;Zinc&#8217; over six continuous days of the hearing.

By the time she heard the parties, it must have become apparent that the four days remaining would be insufficient to complete the hearing and deliver judgment.  That much is clear from the recitals to the order of 26 March 2014 made by King J.  Her Ladyship then appears to have tried to assist the parties in their negotiations, albeit unsuccessfully.  Mr Yates tells me that the hearing was abandoned three days into the case on the Wednesday of that week.  </p>

I fold into my overall consideration the fact that W is entitled to say now, with some justification, that H was being unreasonable in continuing to pursue these particular issues of fraud and non-disclosure, at least insofar as I found that they had no substance.

	      </authorialNote>, it was necessary to cast the net widely in terms of establishing fraud or misfeasance on her part.  However, against her success on those peripheral issues, I have to bear well in mind that she had by that point in time been responsible for making &#8211; or at least allowing the release of  &#8211; several misleading statements as to the situation regarding Odey&#8217;s investment in B Ltd.  That was the basis of my criticism of her subsequent litigation conduct both before and during the set aside proceedings.  In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how she might have avoided an order in respect of at least a significant part of H&#8217;s costs incurred in the set aside application as they stood in March 2014.</p>

Thus, whatever view I may or may not have taken about the quality and reliability of the third party witnesses fielded by both sides, his success on that fundamental ground is a critical factor which I must fold into my deliberations in relation to costs under CPR r 44.2(4)(b), irrespective of his own conduct under r 44.2(4)(a).</p>

H&#8217;s legal costs were then in the order of &#163;214,000 (or &#163;234,000 by Mr Yates&#8217;s reckoning, depending upon the apportionment of the costs of hearings which had already taken place before Coleridge and Parker JJ).</p>

That &#8216;open window of opportunity&#8217; was extended to him unless and until such time as W was able to terminate his beneficial interest in the shares by paying to his daughter from a previous marriage a sum of &#163;659,446.  He had originally proposed his daughter as the intended beneficiary of his interest in the B Ltd shares and W, in this offer, developed that road to compromise by offering this liquidated sum.  It was calculated on the basis of the difference between the share price of &#163;11.59 per share proposed by H in his Form E and the price of &#163;45 per share reflected in that paid by the latest round of &#8220;angel investing&#8221; in 2013 (the Numis offer).  In all other respects she proposed that the terms of the original consent order should stand.  The offer was time-limited for two working days at which point it was withdrawn, no doubt with an eye on the costs which would then be accumulating in preparation for the forthcoming final hearing.</p>

Thus, the fundamental complaint he had made about the fact that he would not have parted with his shares had he known of the Odey investment was addressed.  In my judgment, this was a serious offer from W.  It was a sensible offer which should have received serious consideration from H.

He sought a sale of Fawler Farm.  Further additional proposals were put forward in relation to the top-slicing of the mortgage payments which H had made following which the net proceeds would be divided on a 50/50 basis.  There would be nothing further to pay in respect of the unpaid balance of &#163;150,000 relating to the lump sum order; neither would he seek to claw back the &#163;200,000 already paid.

When I enquired as to what reputational damage either W or the company had suffered as a result of this litigation, I was told that three of B Ltd&#8217;s main board directors had resigned as a result of my judgment and the findings in it.

He submits that his presentation of his case in relation to W&#8217;s alleged fraud reflects poorly on him given the personal nature of the attack upon her integrity and the familial relationships involved.  H&#8217;s brother is one of the senior partners in the firm which represented him throughout the substantive hearing before me.  Mr Yates informed me that H&#8217;s brother had been present throughout the hearing in April 2014 with a view to taking over the conduct of H&#8217;s case in the absence of a settlement at that hearing.  He tells me (and, of course, I accept) that it was common knowledge that H would be dispensing with the (no doubt more expensive) services of Vardags.  His presence at that hearing was intended to smooth the transition.  Given the level of costs he had incurred by that point in time, I do not accept that H can be criticised for electing to change &#8216;legal horses&#8217; in this way.  The move will undoubtedly have saved costs in the long run and I can see no basis upon which his representation since the change can be criticised apart from the fact that the case has not settled.  That outcome has been largely in the hands of the parties themselves for it is they who deliver their instructions to their legal representatives albeit on the basis of having reflected on the advice they have received.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the actual likely value of the shares in B Ltd at the time the original deal was brokered, that finding must await another day.  I am considering costs and the destination of that liability in this supplemental judgment.  At the heart of H&#8217;s set aside application, as I have found, was his own subjective impression of the future hope value in the shares once Crispin Odey had come on board.  As I said before, he (H) was particularly well placed as an experienced investor to weigh and consider that hope value.  Whilst his subjective appreciation of the potential for future value might have been different from W&#8217;s, he was nonetheless entitled to be told of that fact before he signed up to the deal which was struck in February 2012.  For her part, I am satisfied that W, by her offer of 9 February 2014, had sought to address that position.  But at the end of the day, I cannot ignore the fact that she lost in relation to the substantive issue of set aside.  Mr Amos submits that the costs which were wasted by the abortive hearing before King J cannot form any part of the financial penalty (or &#8220;punishment&#8221; as he put it) to be laid at W&#8217;s door.  That hearing was nevertheless a milestone in the chronology of the journey which this litigation has taken through the courts.  I accept that H did not succeed in his April 2015 attempt to adjourn the final hearing before me but I suspect that the costs of that appearance are a relatively insignificant element of the global bill which he now asks W to pay.</p>

However, in this context, H, too, has fallen short of what might be expected of him in terms of his conduct in relation to the litigation.  He approached the Daily Mail journalist and released to him confidential material emanating from these proceedings.  I have found that he did so with malign intent towards W.  Whilst he has never provided me with a clear explanation as to why he took this course, I cannot ignore the fact that the individual journalist he approached had previously written a critical piece about another (unrelated) female entrepreneur.  When W described this previous piece of journalism as &#8220;a smear piece&#8221;, her description was not challenged.

Absent agreement, there will inevitably have to be a detailed assessment of those costs, a process which in itself is likely to attract another significant layer of costs.    I am acutely aware of W&#8217;s current financial position which is such that any order which I make is going to have a significant impact on her financial wellbeing.  She has now cut her ties with B Ltd (or is in the process of doing so) and, aside from the equity in her London flat (a sum which is in dispute), she has limited resources and a number of debts.  Her future financial wellbeing is likely to be influenced in no small part by the outcome of the rehearing of the parties&#8217; claims for financial remedy orders in November this year and her ability in the ensuing months and years to re-engage the drive, commitment and sheer force of personality which have driven her success to date.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;Where I believe W&#8217;s conduct does properly attract censure is her response to the enquiries which were subsequently raised on behalf of H.  Much time and expense would have been avoided if she had responded openly and at an early stage to his solicitors&#8217; questions.  I accept that their initial letter sought the answers to a significant number of questions and required her to produce documentation which was confidential to the company.  Nevertheless, despite the constraints under which she was put by the demands of the B Ltd board and her obligations of confidentiality, her responses were, in my judgment, unhelpful at best and misleading at worst.   &#8230;&#8230; the rearguard action which she fought over many months to suppress his challenge to the consent order was, in my judgment, misplaced and gave rise to some exquisitely nuanced presentations which have not withstood the forensic scrutiny to which they were exposed.  I find that she placed undue reliance on the terms of her employment contract in order to avoid some of the more penetrating questions which were asked of her.  In this respect it is not without significance that her contract specifically provided for the provision of confidential information <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;where this is required by law&#8221;</span>.  Once Parker J had ordered her to provide the information, there could have been no justification for anything other than a full and frank exposition of the position.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some two years further on, I find myself in much the same situation in relation to this long-running litigation.  I have tried my very best to encourage the parties to settle. They have not done so and I do not now shirk from the decision which I must impose upon them in relation to the costs of the set aside application.   My order has to be fair and it must be proportionate.  I have taken on board and carefully considered all those matters which are contained in CPR 1998 r 44.2(4) and (5).   These factors have informed my analysis of the parties&#8217; conduct of this litigation and the offers which each has made in an attempt to settle the proceedings.  At the end of the day, W has lost on the substantive issue but H&#8217;s conduct is by no means beyond critical scrutiny and a degree of judicial opprobrium.  I have no doubt that his conduct in approaching a Daily Mail journalist in the early stages of the set aside application did indeed &#8216;poison the well&#8217;, to adopt Mr Amos&#8217;s terminology.</p>

I will be much better placed to determine the respective merits of the application which H makes for the costs of those proceedings once I have heard the evidence in November this year.  Those costs amount to some &#163;89,000 odd.  I am merely adjourning a decision in relation to those costs.  Mr Yates will be free to relaunch his application for those costs at the conclusion of the rehearing and I shall determine that application on its merits at that stage.</p>

There can be no argument but that H has primarily succeeded in his primary case in relation to that issue.  However, because of the view which I take in relation to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties&#8217; litigation conduct in these proceedings, I consider that W is entitled to a discount in respect of her liability for those costs.  That discount falls to be assessed by reference not only to H&#8217;s own litigation misconduct in approaching the national press during the currency of these proceedings<span style="font-weight:bold"/>but by reference to the additional factors that:- </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To an extent, each is the author of his/her own misfortune.  I take on board all that has been said on W&#8217;s behalf in relation to the early offers which she made and H&#8217;s response to them.  That response (including the approach to a member of the national press) has, in my judgment, significantly soured the relationship between them and their ability to co-operate in finding a practical and pragmatic way through this litigation.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that W has failed on the substantial issue of her defence to the set aside application.  That failure has to find reflection in my award of costs which is underpinned to a significant extent by the matters which I have set out at some considerable length in this judgment.   My conclusion taking all these factors into account is that W must pay to H 50% of his costs of the set aside application.  Notwithstanding the financial impact on her of such an award, it properly reflects all the facts and matters which I am obliged to take into account in these very long-running and hard fought proceedings.  Having given her the benefit of a substantial discount for the reasons set out above, I can see no reason why her 50% liability for H&#8217;s costs should not be assessed on an indemnity basis.  In my judgment, to do otherwise would be to penalise H unfairly and to accord too little weight to the consequences of her own litigation misconduct.</p>
