It would be surprising if the degree of mental capacity that is needed to execute a will is in fact less than the degree of mental capacity that is needed validly to contract a marriage.  However, I will address the question of his capacity to contract a marriage independently a little later in this judgment.   </p>

The right to form a marriage is a fundamental right and has been so for centuries.  If one was to draw up a hierarchy of human rights, one would have the right to enter into a marriage and found a family as being near the top of the list because the right to form a marriage has been in play in our society since the very dawn of time.  So important is it that it has made its way into the European Convention of Human Rights, Article 12 of which states: </p>

A man cannot marry his mother or his daughter or his sister.  Children cannot get married, although it is relevant for the purposes of determining the threshold of capacity, for me to note that many of the relevant authorities were decided at a time before the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/19-20/36" uk:canonical="1929 (19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5) c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Age of Marriage Act 1929</ref>, which set the current age of marriage.  Before that, the age of marriage was 12 for a girl and 14 for a boy, which perhaps gives some indication as to the level of intellectual capacity that is needed in order to contract a valid marriage.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.42in">&#8220;I may say this much in the outset that it appears to me that the contract of marriage is a very simple one which does not require a high degree of intelligence to comprehend.  It is an engagement between a man and a woman to live together and love one another as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others.  This is expanded in the promises of the marriage ceremony by words having reference to the natural relations which spring from that engagement, such as protection on the part of the man and submission on behalf of the woman.  I agree with the Solicitor General that a mere comprehension of the words of the promises exchanged is not sufficient.  The mind of one of the parties may be capable of understanding the language used but may yet be affected by such delusions or other symptoms of insanity as may satisfy the Tribunal that there was not a real appreciation of the engagement apparently entered into.&#8221; </p>

It has been followed in case after case, of which, perhaps the most prominent are the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Park v Park </span>[1954] Probate 112 and the typically comprehensive decision of Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v E and S</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 WLR 953" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 WLR 953</ref>.  In the latter case, Munby J emphasised that, in making the decision in question, the Court was emphatically not exercising a best interest jurisdiction and it was making a decision as to the capacity of the person in question to marry anyone objectively and not a relative decision as to whether he could or should marry the particular person whom he was proposing to marry.   </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.42in">&#8220;The duties and responsibilities that normally attach to marriage can be summarised as follows: Marriage, whether civil or religious, is a contract, formally entered into.  It confers on the parties the status of husband and wife, the essence of the contract being an agreement between a man and a woman to live together and to love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others.  It creates a relationship of mutual and reciprocal obligations, typically involving the sharing of a common home and a common domestic life and the right to enjoy each other&#8217;s society, comfort and assistance.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">That was written in 2004 interpreting a body of jurisprudence that stretched back centuries.  However, in 2019, it is questionable whether the duties and responsibilities as stated by Munby J in 2004 apply as fully as he then believed.  I do not believe that it is the essence of a marriage contract that the parties should live together, let alone that they should love one another.  There are plenty of examples, both in the distant past and more recently, of marriages being created where the parties like each other but could not be said to love each other: where their relationship is one of platonic friendship rather than one of passion.  Moreover, there are plenty of examples in this modern age of parties marrying where they do not share a common home or a common domestic life but, nonetheless, their marriage is well and truly a marriage.  </p>

In short, the marriage is a marriage.  The fact that it is platonic, and without a sexual component, is, as a matter of long-established law, neither here nor there and in truth no concern of the judges or of the State.

I am not satisfied that the evidence placed before me, as developed by the oral evidence from the witness box, comes close to giving me reason to believe that (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">name 1</span>) does not have the capacity to enter into marriage on Saturday.  The application is therefore dismissed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">I would say this, however: if this marriage happens and then later breaks down and a financial claim is made, then the scope of any claim by (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">name 2</span>) is necessarily going to be extremely limited, given that the entirety of (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">name 1</span>)&#8217;s means derive from a personal injury compensation payment which will have been calibrated by reference </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.02in">to his needs.  There are numerous authorities in the books which have effectively emphasised the near-immunity of personal injury awards from a financial claim.  So, the extent of any claim that were to be made on the breakdown of this marriage, were it to happen, would be limited, in my provisional prognostication at this point, to alleviating serious financial hardship and no more.   </p>
