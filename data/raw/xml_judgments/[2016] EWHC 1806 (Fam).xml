By separate application (14 August 2015) she further sought a lump sum for outstanding legal costs (by then &#163;67,934.42) and a further sum (&#163;42,372) in relation to prospective legal costs, all incurred (or to be incurred) in proceedings concerning F under <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> and <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> </span>of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  By cross-application (17 August 2015), the father issued a notice to show cause why an agreement as to financial provision for F, reached between the parties in June 2009, should not be made into an order of the court.  The substantive issues are due for trial before me in February 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relevant background can be stated shortly.  The parties met in 2006, and for a period of time they lived together.  F was born in 2008.  The father is extraordinarily wealthy, with capital measured in &#163; hundreds of millions.  His net annual income is measured in &#163; millions. The mother has no financial resources or income of her own.  It is the mother&#8217;s case that their relationship petered out at some point in 2013; the father&#8217;s case is that their relationship had in fact ended before F&#8217;s birth, although I am advised (and this is, I believe, undisputed) that the mother fell pregnant by the father in 2009, albeit that pregnancy ended in miscarriage.  Between 2008 and 2009, the mother and father, each assisted by matrimonial solicitors of the highest calibre (not, as it happens, those currently instructed), entered into a comprehensive agreement for financial provision for F.  The agreement was predicated on the basis that the mother would provide F&#8217;s primary home, and that F would spend as much time with the father as the father&#8217;s working schedules would allow, and would be in F&#8217;s interests.    F&#8217;s housing needs were covered in the agreement, it being recorded that a property of a value of c.&#163;2.5m would provide a reasonable home for him; it was further recorded that the mother was occupying a more expensive property (with a value three times that recorded as meeting F&#8217;s reasonable needs) for which the father would grant leases to the mother which would be surrendered (at the latest) when F reached 25 years old.  Provision was made in the agreement for F&#8217;s income needs (at the annual rate of &#163;30,000, index linked); the cost of education, and childcare support was also covered.  Notwithstanding the agreement, the father provided significantly more generously for F; as mentioned above, the mother and F occupy a property, provided by the father in early 2008 which is significantly more valuable.  From the date of the agreement until 2014, the father made financial provision at a level many times more than he had formally agreed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2014, relations between the father and mother soured; problems associated with a relationship which the father had formed with a friend of the mother contributed to this.  Three children have been born to that relationship.  There was a dispute about a holiday in the summer of 2014; the father reduced his financial support to the mother to the level set out in the agreement.  The mother hoped that this was a temporary reduction in reaction to the dispute between them.  It was not.  The mother rapidly spent on living expenses a large proportion of a sum of &#163;300,000 which she says that the father had previously given to her (he says it was a loan).  In the circumstances, the mother made this <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1 </span>application.  In parallel with these proceedings, the parties have been litigating over child arrangements (under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> </span>of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>).</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;The court cannot make an order unless it is satisfied that without the payment the applicant would not reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services for the proceedings. Therefore, the exercise essentially looks to the future. It is important that the jurisdiction is not used to outflank or supplant the powers and principles governing an award of costs in CPR Part 44.  It is not a surrogate <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> costs jurisdiction.  Thus a LSPO should only be awarded to cover historic unpaid costs where the court is satisfied that without such a payment the applicant will not reasonably be able to obtain in the future appropriate legal services for the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 February 2016, the proceedings were listed before Holman J for consideration of the mother&#8217;s application for interim financial relief; he ordered (on the mother&#8217;s subsidiary application) a further sum of &#163;20,000 as a contribution to her future legal expenses in relation to proceedings between the parties which had resurfaced under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref></span> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;&#8230; the level of outstanding costs has now gone far beyond what was anticipated or provided for by the order of 20 October 2015.&#8230; My firm has had no realistic choice but to continue acting for [the mother] while these substantial costs liabilities to my firm have remain (sic) outstanding, and increasing, but this places [the mother] in a prejudicial position in comparison with [the father]. That is both because she is beholden to her solicitors to continue acting in circumstances of very significant unpaid costs and because her level of debt and absence of provision impacts on the way in which we might wish to represent her. We are a small firm and cannot provide interest-free credit at this level, and without security, simply because our client is not able to borrow from any bank or litigation funding provider.  It would have been prejudicial to our client for us to have ceased acting, as she would have been extremely unlikely to obtain alternative representation given her outstanding costs. There is however a limit to the extent that we should be asked to continue to provide credit and we now ask for provision to be made to meet this debt and to allow our clients to be represented on an equal footing to [the father]."</p>

She made an award of prospective costs in the amount (&#163;38,000) which had (more or less) been requested by the mother, and she listed the hearing on 12 July for the court to deal with the questions of whether the father should fund in whole or in part (a) the mother&#8217;s outstanding legal costs and/or (b) her future legal costs.  In that judgment, Roberts J referred once again to <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span> and went on to say this:</p>

Alternatively, the phrase &#8220;historic unpaid costs&#8221; in [13(iv)] has been widely misinterpreted or misapplied (including by Mr Chamberlayne QC here), and/or that Mostyn J&#8217;s comments in paragraph [13(iv)] should not be regarded as even persuasive, given that Mostyn J was not dealing in <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span> with the situation which obtains here &#8211; namely where the costs are being and have been incurred in ongoing proceedings.   Mr. Turner asks me to identify no logical distinction between allowing <span style="font-style:italic">prospective</span> costs under this jurisdiction (about which there is no challenge to the principle), and <span style="font-style:italic">outstanding</span> costs which may have been incurred (in an identical way to the way in which the prospective costs will be incurred) from the date of the application, including those arising immediately prior to the hearing.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My concern is to ensure that the mother and father have equality of arms, and equal access to justice in this case.  I do not, as Mr. Turner sought to persuade me, treat equality of arms as &#8220;equality of payments&#8221; &#8211; a suggestion that, &#163; for &#163;, the father should ensure that the mother is more or less equally provided for in relation to her costs as he is.  However, for as long as any client has incurred significant outstanding legal costs with his or her solicitor, there is no doubt but that they become bound (&#8220;beholden&#8221; per Mr. Harker, see [9] above) to each other by the debt; this may well impact on the freedom of, and relative strengths within, their professional relationship.  Further, the solicitor may feel constrained in taking what may be important steps in relation, for instance, to discovery, or in relation to exploring parallel non-court dispute resolution.  The debt may materially influence the client&#8217;s stance on possible settlement, and the solicitor&#8217;s advice in relation to the same: a client &#8211; without independent resources &#8211; is in a vulnerable position, and may be more inclined to accept a settlement that is less than fair simply because of the concerns about litigation debt.  This would not be in the interests of this, or any, child in <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1 </span>proceedings.   A level playing field may not be achieved where, on the one side, the solicitor and client are &#8216;beholden&#8217; to each other by significant debt, whereas on the other there is an abundance of litigation funding.  Though there is an increasingly familiar and commendable practice of lawyers acting <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> in cases before the family courts, particularly where public funding provision previously available has been withdrawn, legal service providers, including solicitors and barristers, are not charities, nor are they credit-agents.   It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect solicitors and the bar to offer unsecured interest-free credit in order to undertake their work; there is indeed a solid reason for lawyers not to have a financial interest in the outcome of family law litigation.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the significant point of principle in issue in this case, my view is as follows.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span>, Mostyn J was not considering legal costs funding in ongoing proceedings; he was dealing with truly &#8216;historic&#8217; costs which had arisen in two separate sets of proceedings (i.e. divorce and child abduction), which had, importantly, <span style="font-style:italic">concluded</span>.  The financial proceedings had been stayed (proceedings were now ongoing in California), and the mother and children had returned to California, pursuant to orders made by Hogg J under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention 1980</span>.  There was, as Mostyn J observed, no further litigation in this country, and no litigation in prospect.   I consider that Mostyn J was right to reject a legal costs funding application as a vehicle to recoup the costs of either or both of these concluded claims.  But that type of application is distinguishable from the type of situation here, where the legal costs funding claim arises in relation to costs reasonably and legitimately incurred within ongoing proceedings prior to the determination of the legal costs funding application.  I draw support for this distinction by the following:</p>

The outstanding costs liability was then c.&#163;40,000, incurred since the discharge of the wife&#8217;s legal aid certificate (which had only occurred when an order for maintenance pending suit had been made by the husband to the wife in that case); counsel for the husband in that case, as Mr. Chamberlayne in this, had argued that solicitors should be willing to wait for their costs and run the risk of not recovering them, as many other solicitors in their position have had to do.  Holman J rejected that argument, observing that &#8220;we live in times of high overheads and a close eye on cash flow. There is a real risk that if wives (for it is usually wives) cannot obtain some funding as they go along, solicitors simply will not be willing to act for them at all&#8221;; that is the obvious risk here too;</p>

Mr. Turner sensibly abandoned his first head of claim (to recover the 30% balance of the costs award not previously allowed by Roberts J: October 2015) during the course of argument in the hearing before me.  From the costs claimed (whether prospective or outstanding), I propose to make a deduction of 15% to reflect a notional standard basis of assessment; in doing this, I have taken a broad view about whether the costs are reasonably incurred, reasonable in amount and proportionate to the matters in issue, recognising that any costs which are disproportionate in amount may be disallowed or reduced, even if they were reasonably or necessarily incurred (<span class="Emphasis">CPR 44.3(2)(a)</span> and <span class="Emphasis">PD 44.6.2</span>), and on the basis that the court would resolve any doubt in favour of the paying party (CPR 44.3(2)(b)).   Holman J in this case and Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">MG &amp; JG v JF</span> discounted their awards by 20% (in relation to prospective costs); Roberts J deducted 30% from her award of outstanding costs, but made no deduction from prospective costs. Having reviewed the schedules, which on the whole appear realistic, I consider that 15% is the right discount, and that it should be applied across the board. </p>
