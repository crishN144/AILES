That this is not a pure issue of principle is demonstrated by the fact that the parties agree the wife should receive part of this wealth and disagree only about the amount which she should receive.  It is, therefore, a fact specific decision based on the circumstances of this case.  </span></p>

In total, the wife seeks approximately &#163;9 million, based on total resources estimated by Mr Johnstone at approximately &#163;18.4 million.  He submits that this represents a fair share of the family&#8217;s wealth and also reflects the wife&#8217;s financial needs.  </span></p>

He also seeks the creation of (i) a fund of &#163;500,000 to meet future school fees and, (ii) a housing fund for the parties&#8217; youngest child.  Subject to these deductions (of &#163;800,000) the husband offers the wife, broadly, half of the wealth, including that which reflects bonuses paid and to be paid to the husband for the years up to and including the year of separation.  Thereafter, he proposes that the wife should receive amounts equal to 25% of the bonus earned by him for 2008 and to 12.5% of his bonus for 2009.  In addition, the husband agrees that his pension should be shared equally between the parties.  On the husband&#8217;s figures this would provide the wife with a total of approximately &#163;6.5 million and the husband with just under &#163;11 million, based on the total resources being an estimated &#163;17.5 million after, as I have said, the deduction of &#163;800,000.  </span></p>

The wife is aged 41 and the husband is aged 43.  They have three children aged 5, 6 and 11.  The youngest child has special needs, and whilst both parties are positive about her future there is uncertainty about the extent to which she will be able to live independently.  The parties separated in July 2007.  The wife and the children have remained living at the former matrimonial home, with the children spending significant amounts of time with their father.  </span></p>

They both continued to work for this employer and gradually worked their way up the organisation.  In 1998 the wife moved to part-time work and she then left her employment in the late 1990&#8217;s or early 2000&#8217;s.  She has not returned to paid employment since then.  The husband&#8217;s position changed significantly when he had what he describes as a &#8216;lucky break&#8217; and became a trader in 1998 and particularly from 2001 when he moved to a senior role.  He was also given greater responsibilities in 2008.  </span></p>

I do not consider that this principle has any relevance to this case as the award which the wife will receive, even under the husband&#8217;s proposals, easily eclipses what the wife herself accepts she would have been earning if she had remained in full-time employment.  </span></p>

This might be the result of more predictable factors, such as benefitting from work done and experience gained during earlier years, but can also be the result of less predictable factors, such as external and economic changes, or the particular trading circumstances or results of one year as against other years.</span></p>

There was a step change from 2001, and again from 2005, but the annual amounts in the years since 2005 have fluctuated very significantly.  His income consists of a relatively modest basic salary and a discretionary performance linked bonus paid in part in cash in the following year with the balance deferred.  The dramatic increase in the husband&#8217;s income can be seen from the fact that in 1997/1998 he earned approximately, &#163;40,000 gross, and in 2006 (for 2005) he earned approximately &#163;4 million gross.   The husband describes 2004 as a &#8220;watershed&#8221; year, in the sense that he earned a very substantial bonus for that year.  He has continued to earn significant but variable bonuses, including for 2008, which was the husband&#8217;s best year ever, when he earned a bonus of approximately &#163;9.2 million gross.   </span></p>

The husband&#8217;s entitlement to payment of the deferred instalments is not entirely clear.  The terms under which his bonuses have been paid have varied and their effect was the subject of some discussion during the hearing.  The amounts the husband will in fact receive in 2010 and especially in respect of deferred instalments due thereafter, is, to some extent, uncertain.  Both parties have proposed that any award reflecting these resources should be based on the wife receiving this part of her award by reference to a specified percentage of the actual sums received by the husband.  There is, in respect of the instalments due after 2010, the added complication that if the husband leaves his employment before the sums are payable, and negotiates a leaving package, it may not be possible to identify what amounts have been paid in respect of each or any of the deferred bonus instalments.  </span></p>

Having regard to the resources available to the parties, and having seen them give evidence, I am confident that there will be sufficient funds available to meet school fees without the creation of a specific fund for that purpose.  I am not persuaded that it is necessary or appropriate for me to deduct such a sum from the parties&#8217; resources before determining what award to make in the wife&#8217;s favour, or at all.  Further, I accept the wife&#8217;s submission that the husband should continue to pay the children&#8217;s school fees, certainly for so long as he remains in employment, subject, of course, to the level of his earned income, and thereafter subject to what I say later in this judgment.  </span></p>

The issue for me is whether the measure proposed by the husband is an appropriate exercise of my powers under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, or is a factor I should take into account when determining my award in the wife&#8217;s favour.  I see no sufficient justification for a part of the family&#8217;s wealth, albeit a relatively small part, being deducted for this purpose before I determine what award to make in the wife&#8217;s favour, or indeed at all.

This is not a case in which such an approach is justified as it would, in my judgment, give insufficient weight to the fact that a substantial part of the wealth has accrued directly as a result of the husband&#8217;s endeavours since the parties separated.  I also do not consider that such an award is justified by Mr. Johnstone&#8217;s alternative reliance on the wife&#8217;s needs.  </span></p>

The combined total is &#163;15 million.

I do not consider it appropriate to assess the latter, that is her income needs, by reference to Duxbury, but rather by reference, in the circumstances of this case, to a relatively modest assumed rate of return.  I propose therefore to award the wife capital resources of &#163;7 million out of the total resources of &#163;15 million.

In my judgment, if the husband does receive significant additional capital in respect of these deferred instalments, the wife should receive a further capital sum in order to ensure that my award overall continues to provide her with a fair share of the total resources in this case.  I propose, therefore, to award the wife a further sum, or sums, equal to 15% of all sums (net) received by the husband in respect of deferred instalments for the years up to 2009 and currently payable from 2011.  If the husband were to receive the full amount due the wife would have total resources of &#163;7.5 million and the husband would have &#163;11 million.  In my judgment, this division gives proper weight to all the relevant factors in this case, including the contributions each party has and will make to the welfare of the family and to the fact that a significant part of the wealth has accrued from income earned in 2008 and 2009.</span></p>
