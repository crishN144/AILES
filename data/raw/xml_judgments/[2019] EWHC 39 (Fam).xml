	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">These are public law proceedings brought under s 31 of the Children Act (CA) 1989 by a Local Authority (LA) in respect of two boys (A and B now aged 10 &amp; 8). The children now live with their father (F) following protracted private law proceeding pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> which are set out below. In March of 2017 following a trial in the Family Court at Nottingham the circuit judge made findings in those proceedings and removed the boys from their mother (M) placing them in foster care; they were subsequently moved to live with their father (F) and his then partner after they were re-introduced to him, having had no contact with their father or paternal family for three years. In his judgment the circuit judge given on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017 he found that the allegations made by M in 2014 that F had sexually abused the children having administered sedative drugs in order to do so, were without foundation and that either she or her mother (the maternal grandmother: MGM) had drugged the children herself. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Later, in March 2018, M appealed a subsequent order of the judge refusing permission to re-open the case based on a further analysis of the drugs which she had obtained surreptitiously, that is to say without permission of the court or the knowledge of the other parties. She was refused leave by the Court of Appeal to adduce the &#8220;new&#8221; evidence in respect of who had administered the drugs found in the children&#8217;s hair. At an oral hearing in London on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018, the Court of Appeal gave judgment having heard full argument and granted permission for it to be cited under paragraph 6.1 of the Practice Direction on the Citation of Authorities of 9th April 2001; under the title <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children)</span>; Neutral Citation Number <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/607" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 607" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA (Civ) 607</ref>. It is of note that despite M&#8217;s continuing insistence that F has abused the children, she had not, as was observed by the Court of Appeal, and still has not, appealed the decision in respect of the finding that no sexual abuse had ever taken place; instead M has continued to make attempts to re-open the findings in respect of the finding that she or her mother had given the children drugs in order to support her case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">During the hearing in the Family Court in March 2017, at which the judge was giving judgment, M left the court-room as he was doing so and absconded with the children, abducting them to a holiday resort the location of which she had deliberately withheld, along with her intention to take the children there for a &#8220;holiday&#8221; as she later described it. Her actions resulted in a nation-wide search. After about two weeks the police located the children in a holiday lodge or chalet; the boys were placed in foster care; the Local Authority (LA) applied for care orders in respect of A and B within care proceedings issued on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017. Some months later, after reintroduction, the children moved to live with their father and have remained living with him since. The children have had contact with their mother, either directly, albeit supervised, or indirectly since their removal from her care but it has proved to be difficult and with significant problems, because not only has M refused to accept the findings of the court she has enlisted the assistance of others in campaigning to have the children returned to her care (of which more below) in addition to which there has remained the risk of further abduction. Nonetheless the children have always wanted to go on seeing their mother and expressed their wishes to continue to do so; they had </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">It was shortly after this contact session on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2017 (during which the elder child inadvertently let slip details of the location and identity of his new home) that at some time on the night of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2017, at a time M knew the children and their father were on holiday abroad, that the home of his partner, where the children were then living, was burnt down and largely destroyed in an arson attack by D. D, who was later convicted of this and another arson attack, was a friend or associate of M&#8217;s with whom she had had an adulterous sexual relationship. In February 2019, D was found guilty of the arson by a jury in the Crown Court and his sentence is unknown. The location of the children&#8217;s home was, and has continued to, kept confidential and had been withheld from M because of the arson, the risk or fear of abduction and/or other interference by M with the children or with F. After the fire, and for understandable reasons, direct and physical contact between the children and M was suspended. In any case the children were forced to move with F to another address away from where they had been living and going to school. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In a composite document based on the evidence filed and contained in the court bundle, the LA has set out further findings of fact which it seeks in respect of s31 CA1989 threshold, primarily to inform future planning for the children, most specifically regarding any future contact with M. These findings include events which have taken place since the findings made and set out in the Family Court judgment of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017 (upon which the LA relies) and the date on which the care proceedings were issued, to include the extent of M&#8217;s involvement in, or knowledge of the arson attack on the children&#8217;s home. As already observed, M continues to refuse to accept the findings made and has made repeated attempts to re-open the case, specifically the finding that she (or her mother) were responsible for administering the sedatives found in the hair samples taken from her sons.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">This court has no longer any need to hear or determine the evidence or to make findings in respect of D&#8217;s responsibility for the arson because of his conviction to a higher standard of proof in the criminal court. F supports the LA&#8217;s position in respect of the findings sought and, because of the risks to the boys&#8217; physical safety and emotional well-being, supports the very limited indirect contact between the children and M as proposed by the LA. This plan is supported by their guardian, notwithstanding the boys clearly expressed wishes to see her.  </p>

C is another associate of M&#8217;s who has repeatedly posted messages on Twitter and social media supporting M, these messages or posts included some explicitly expressing C&#8217;s view that the judge should recuse himself. Amongst his activity on social media, C posted messages on social media and pictures that he said he had taken at night of the judge&#8217;s home and property.  </p>

However, in December 2014, the mother and maternal grandmother made allegations to the NSPCC and to the police that the boys had been severely sexually abused by their father, by members of his family and by some of his male friends over a considerable period of time.

That provided no supporting evidence.  The children were also interviewed, but in a manner that the judge considered to have no evidential value.  Additionally, at the insistence of the mother the police arranged for hair strand tests for drugs to be taken from the boys in January 2015.  These were not sent for analysis until May 2016.  In June 2016, Ms Kirsten Turner, a consultant forensic toxicologist then employed by ChemTox reported to the police the presence in the hair of the sedatives benzodiazepine and nordiazepam.  In September 2016, Ms Turner, by now working for Alere Forensics (&#8216;Alere&#8217;) produced a further report identifying the presence of nordiazepam, temazepam and zolpidem, in all cases in very low quantities. </span></p>

In response, the father issued proceedings to locate them and to restore his contact.  It was those proceedings that came before the judge in March 2017.  He heard nine days of evidence, including from Ms Turner, who was called by the mother.  Her evidence was that the tests indicated that the boys had received the same substances in similar timescales and concentrations.  The low levels were not suggestive of administration on a regular basis.  They could theoretically be explained by accidental ingestion or environmental exposure.  In respect of timing, she concluded that it was not possible to state the exact period covered by the hair samples and that it was possible that some traces of the drugs were from exposure prior to August 2014.  However, the results could also be explained by a single tablet of diazepam being administered to each child in mid-December 2014.   </span></p>

In his judgment in March 2017, the trial judge exonerated the children&#8217;s father and other adults of sexual abuse; finding instead that reported statements made by the children were the result of pressure from their mother and the MGM, both of whom, he found, genuinely believed that the children had been sexually abused, but that that their belief was irrational. The judge explicitly rejected the mother&#8217;s allegation that F had administered drugs to facilitate abuse, and he found in respect of the drug test results that M and/or the MGM had administered the substances found to the children; his findings were, he said supported in part by the striking determination on the part of M to have the boys tested.</p>

There is no substantive evidence in support of an alternative plan &#8220;A&#8221; for a holiday and I find that the abduction (for that is what it was) was planned with the sole purpose of evading the authorities in an attempt to circumvent the decision of the court, as she had taken their passports and stopped paying for utilities. The plan can only have been for the children to remain hidden or be removed from the jurisdiction. It is likely that M did not expect the high level of publicity and the extent of the search for the children by the police and the authorities that ensued. In this, as in her later activities designed to retain or regain custody of the children, it would appear that M did not think through the likely consequences of her actions. </p>

Police officers seized another handwritten note, hidden behind a plastic bag in an office at the home of S and L, listing M&#8217;s direct debits with the dates that they had been cancelled, with instructions for those direct debits that had not been cancelled along with a number of utility bills and other documents pertaining to the cancellation of utilities at M&#8217;s home. The children&#8217;s disappearance was publicized and there was a great deal of interest on social media including by activists and campaigners such as C who posted numerous items and messages in support of M. Both M&#8217;s sister, L, and her close friend (J) responded positively to the posts.  </p>

The children were removed and placed in foster care and M was arrested. The car paid for by S&#8217;s accountant was found parked outside.

At that hearing there was no opposition to the children remaining in foster care and F, who wanted the children to be placed with their paternal family as soon as was possible, accepted that he could not have contact with the children at that stage; an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34 (4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> permitted the LA to refuse contact between the children and their mother.   </p>

This period in March and April 2017 must have been a very distressing and frightening time for these children, who were removed from their mother and placed with strangers after the police found them hidden in the holiday chalet. I shall return to the effects on these children of the precipitate loss of their home, school and friends and family and harm suffered by the children later in this judgment. The court made orders for Dr Gwen Adshead, an eminent consultant adult forensic psychiatrist to undertake an assessment of M and for Ms Jean Sambrooks, an experienced clinical psychologist, to undertake an assessment of the children. The matter of contact returned to court on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017 when an application by M for direct contact was adjourned until she had served a statement setting out the circumstances of surrounding the disappearance of the children in March and April 2017.

M was accompanied by S (her sister&#8217;s partner who the police were still seeking in connection with a perjury charge). M accepted in her oral evidence before me that she had known the police were looking for S and had done nothing to alert the authorities of his whereabouts. I find this to be an example of M deliberately choosing to flout authority and act outside the law, this finding is supported by the fact that M had obtained the evidence from the laboratory contrary to common law, procedure and statute, specifically Part 25 of the FPR 2010 r25.4 and s 13 of the Children and Families Act 2013, as she had done so without permission of the court.

Dr Adshead&#8217;s expert opinion was that M did not suffer from any mental illness but that there was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;some evidence of psychological dysfunction in terms of [M&#8217;s] fixed beliefs about [F] being an abuser of her children. These beliefs have a delusional quality, in that the record indicates that she holds to her beliefs rigidly and does not admit any contrary evidence which would weaken her position. She not only excludes disconfirmatory material, she preferentially includes and seeks out material that supports her position; and it is now established as a matter of fact that she gave her children sedatives to support her position. She does not consider that she may be doing harm to her children by being so hostile towards their father, and she has told professionals that she believes that her children have psychiatric diagnoses (e.g. PTSD) which are further evidence for the validity of her beliefs. She does not appear to be able to take in any new information or different perspective; and she seemed to struggle to conceive that the situation might be other than she would like.&#8221;</span></p>

These types of harm can include false allegations against a parent, encouraging parental alienation and, in rare cases, directly killing the children to stop the other parent having contact.

Although the psychologist&#8217;s assessment of M was markedly more positive than that of Dr Adshead as Dr Hellin considered M to be capable of co-operation with the LA as she had finding M to be accepting of what she described as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the reality and validity of other&#8217;s perspectives to a considerable degree&#8221;, </span>the assessment has limited value and weight as evidence in the view of this court not least because this is not the case, as is evident from M&#8217; s own statement of evidence, and the fact that the report is not relied on by M for the purposes of this hearing. It is abundantly clear from M&#8217;s own evidence that it is no longer an accurate reflection of M&#8217;s views. In her report<span style="font-style:italic"/>Dr Hellin went on to make various recommendations about therapy for M, apparently satisfied that M had modified the beliefs identified by Dr Adshead. </p>

Neither M herself, as can be seen from her statement of evidence filed with the court for use in this hearing, nor those that represent her claim that Dr Hellin&#8217;s description of M&#8217;s position can be relied on, but the psychologist&#8217;s observation that M found the finding made that M (or her mother) had given the children sedatives to be the one that troubles M beyond all others is consistent with both with M&#8217;s evidence to this court and the manner in which she has chosen to pursue her case. Reference has already been made in this judgment to the fact that M has not sought to appeal the findings regarding the allegations of sex abuse, rather she continues to seek a to re-opening of the finding regarding the administration of sedatives.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Even at the time it was filed with the court in November 2017, before the arson attack and the dismissal of M&#8217;s appeal, Dr Hellin&#8217;s report was of limited forensic assistance as (unlike the other expert witnesses) she did not approach the case based on the findings made in respect of the administration of sedatives. Wrongly, Dr Hellin was asked to consider the case and assess M on the hypothetical basis that her appeal would be successful. In this, as in all family cases, the parties, experts and other professionals must and can only plan for the subject children on the basis of findings made by the court not on a hypothetical factual matrix based on a putative success on appeal. Dr Hellin should not have been asked by M&#8217;s solicitor to speculate in this manner their letter of instruction should not have been agreed by the other parties&#8217; representatives. As a result, at least in part of that question that Dr Hellin strayed far outside her remit, effectively undermining her objectivity; moreover, any suggestion that the findings should be overlooked or put to one side to help M collaborate with the LA was wholly misplaced and incompatible with the need to put the children&#8217;s safety and welfare first as is required by statute. Findings of fact are matter for the judge as decision maker and not for any expert witness. </p>

Nonetheless, Dr Hellin considered that M was more likely to cause the children emotional harm and agreed with Dr Adshead that M held delusional beliefs which were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not the product of a psychotic illness but had a psychological basis.&#8221; </span>There is no doubt that M is a personable woman who can give the appearance of being susceptible to reason, as I saw when she gave her oral evidence, but, as was also apparent during her evidence, this receptiveness is superficial and ceases as soon as she is challenged about her beliefs.  </p>

The report is notable for its failure to consider the boy&#8217;s experiences from their point of view, concentrating instead on M; but, as Dr Adshead had earlier, Dr Hellin identified the considerable difficulties in finding the appropriate therapy, saying that there were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no specific, established therapeutic methods by which to ameliorate these risks&#8221;</span> and describing it as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;quite an unusual therapeutic endeavour&#8221;</span>, and saying that finding a therapist to work with M, not least because the work would have to include members of her family who apparently share M&#8217;s delusional beliefs would be difficult. Indeed, she<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>was unable to identify any resource or professional capable of delivery the therapeutic intervention she posited for M rendering any suggestion of therapeutic intervention otiose. Moreover, the recommendations were based on the false premise that M had begun <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to loosen her cognitive rigidity and was more open to perspectives other than her own delusional one</span>&#8221; which further undermined any recommendation of therapeutic intervention. In addition, the likelihood of therapy being successful in the face of M&#8217;s family and friends&#8217; stance is further reduced; they all remain as opposed to the findings of the court now as they were both before and at the time the report was prepared.  </p>

Further, without the support of her immediate family and close friends, who currently share those delusional beliefs and have refused to participate in the proceedings, it is almost certain that any therapeutic intervention would be constantly undermined further reducing any possibility of its success or efficacy. It is a notable feature of this case that none of the maternal family, even after an express invitation to do so, have seen fit to engage with the court in these proceedings, to cooperate with the LA or to support M by giving evidence or take up the opportunity of providing reassurance and support to the two children about whom this court is ultimately and primarily concerned.  </p>

It is of considerable concern to the court that the children have not yet directly engaged in therapy and that little or no life-story work has or is being done with them (which would be preceded by therapeutic intervention) to support them and assist them in making sense of what has happened to them; this despite a clear recommendation from a court appointed expert. Ms Sambrooks set the need for this therapy and support clearly in her second report after the arson attack had taken place and when the boys and their father were forced to move for a second time. This work is essential for these children and must be put in place without any further delay.  </p>

M denied that she had had to go to any trouble to locate the relevant Twitter account of this young person, but that simply cannot be true as it is not a public Twitter account. She sought to defend her actions by, again, protesting that, as a concerned parent, it was entirely reasonable to use any method to access information about her children. M was well aware, as she told the court, of the court orders in place to stop her finding out about the whereabouts of F and the children and of further intrusion into F&#8217;s privacy so it is reasonable to infer that it is more than likely that she considered that the daughter of his partner fell outside the ambit of court orders and could safely use this as an avenue to gain access to information about F and his family. The fact was and remains that this young person was not responsible for the children&#8217;s care and most unlikely to be involved in their day to day welfare; there was no justification whatsoever for any intrusion by M into her life.    </p>

Although she continued to deny participating in the planning of the attack there can be no doubt, on her own account, that D carried out the attack directly because of his association with her and with her knowledge. There could be, and is, no other reason why he carried it out as he has no other connection with F or his partner, and was fully aware of M&#8217;s antipathy towards F. On the balance of probabilities, the timing of the arson alone cannot be a coincidence; and it is more than fortunate that no-one was present in the house at the time as neither M nor D could have been certain that the house would be unoccupied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">On 29th January 2019, when the children were visited by the consultant psychologist, Ms Sambrooks, one year on, the fear that they suffer brought about by the arson attack and its aftermath was still apparent. The older child asked her if someone could be watching them and said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;nowhere is really safe, people could be everywhere, I could go anywhere in the world and they would still be watching us.&#8221;</span> He asked if people would follow them on holiday; he spoke about his mother kidnapping them and, although he said he thought it unlikely, it was something that he had clearly thought about and which was on his mind; and he spoke about his mother putting tracking devices in presents should she send any. As a direct result of the actions of </p>

It is an undisputable matter of fact that his anxiety has been brought about by his mother&#8217;s actions. In respect of the arson alone it was her decision to conduct an affair with a dangerous and vindictive man that led to the attack. These boys and their father are compelled to live their lives perpetually on the alert and required to take precautions, as advised by the police, which are intrusive and clear interference with their day to day lives, a constant burden and likely to cause further emotional harm.  </p>

Everything in the house was burnt. He told the psychologist that some of mummy&#8217;s friends are bad people, that the police had put alarms in their house as his mummy could try and get us, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;they could take us away&#8221;, </span>and that<span style="font-style:italic"/>they could be taken by his maternal aunt, the MGM and S. If his mother turned up, he would be a bit scared. Like his older brother he wanted to see his mother but said she was confused and had confused ideas which he thought came out of her head.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">It is not exaggeration, nor hyperbolic, to observe that elements of what has happened, and is happening, to these two children are akin to the trauma experienced by children during war or armed conflict; their home was destroyed in an attack by other people for no justifiable or lawful reason, they were forced to flee and go into hiding, they were and remain in fear and feel that they may not be safe anywhere. The long-term effects on them both is likely to be profound. I find it necessary to repeat they are long overdue the provision of therapeutic support and direct work to enable them to make sense of their situation as they grow and to assist them in coming to terms with it in a manner that will not inhibit their growth and development, their sense of identity (she is and will remain their mother) and self-worth. </p>

From the absence of an application to see or have contact with her children I can only conclude that she did not consider it to be a priority and was more concerned with D; she was still in the throes of her liaison with D and her campaign against F. On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018 she sent D a document by email which had been filed in the proceedings by F, which they then discussed. In doing so without the permission of the court not only was she in breach of the existing court orders and the rules of procedure (as D that was not a party to the proceedings) it is amounts to further incontrovertible evidence of M directly involving D in this case, and of M&#8217;s approach to the litigation in general. She has in the past, and it is more likely than not she will in the future, disclosed court documents to whomsoever she considers will further her case regardless of court orders. Moreover, and of greater concern is the fact that she put the children after her relationship with D and to her case against F. </p>

The court was told that all contact between the children and M had been suspended by the LA. Throughout her time at court M spent much, if not most, of it texting and exchanging messages with D, who was present nearby and whom she met straight after the hearing; this can be seen in the available retrieved electronic communication. From the evidence contained in their text messaging (which M has accepted to form only a part of their communication) I find that there can be no doubt that M and D were discussing the case and that she was keeping him fully informed as to what was going on; as, for example, two days after the hearing, they were texting each other and discussing whether an analysis of the children&#8217;s teeth could assist in further drug tests. Not even a passing mention is made of how this might affect the children. </p>

It was then, by court order, that all three were invited to intervene in the proceedings; they have never done so. The judge decided that the allegations made by the LA and F that M had been involved with the arson was a matter that could properly be brought to trial.

M told the court that, as a Christian she knew that it was wrong to participate in an adulterous relationship and felt ashamed, and that she was going to bring it to an end, but, even after D&#8217;s wife found out there is no message from M to D which comes close to terminating or ending the relationship.  </p>

M was not to be allowed directly to receive or keep the video messages from the children to ensure that it did not get disseminated, to be used to trace the children&#8217;s whereabouts, or appear online (as had happened with the Mother&#8217;s Day cards).

He had exhibited similar distress when his teacher referred to a topic or subject from an earlier year which he missed because his mother chose to keep him at home, for no good reason other than her self-delusion manifested in an irrational belief that the child suffered undiagnosed learning difficulties. Fortunately, he has caught up by working hard and applied himself at school and at home with help from his father; his educational attainment has improved, and he is described a different child when compared to earlier reports. As the psychologist said in her final report, there was a direct impact on this child resulting from his mother&#8217;s factitious belief in his educational needs which have had a negative impact on him and contributed to him being in a different year group (he has been held back a year) and seeing himself as different. I find that M caused significant harm to L&#8217;s education and impeded his ability to reach his educational potential as well as negatively affecting his self-image and self- confidence.   </p>

While some of the people who choose to involve themselves in the personal tragedy and trauma of others no doubt do so for good reason, there are those such as D and C who clearly have their own agenda and who, if this case is any example, bring more misery and criminality to bear. Both D and C justify their behaviour by claiming respectively &#8220;to seek out paedophiles&#8221; or &#8220;expose injustice&#8221; in the courts.   </p>

From his written and oral evidence N believed at the time, and still believed when he gave evidence that he has been granted some kind of mandate to undertake far-reaching and grossly intrusive enquiries. His use of language was both instructive and illuminating in that he used a kind of officialese based on the vocabulary of the police. There was no evidence before the court that he held or had held a licence from Security Industry Authority (SIA) and none indicating that there was any independent professional oversight of his working practice; it would seem that N operated outside any proper professional or legal regulatory framework. </p>

This behaviour is minacious, there were incipient and more obvious features of stalking which could have escalated into something much more serious; particularly if, as seems likely given his &#8220;cross referencing&#8221; of information, information about F and the children was shared with his other clients such as D. I found N to be an unreliable witness; I have no reason to doubt that he has suffered abuse but consider that he treats it as a qualification to act as an investigator apparently freeing him from the restraints that would apply to professional licensed investigators, authorised to carry out such inquires. His qualifications as an investigator are sciolistic at best. I am unable to rely on his assurances that M had given him only limited instructions and do not accept that it was only his plan to approach the children&#8217;s foster carers which M was in ignorance of, I do not accept he would have do anything she did to explicitly expect him to do; it is more likely than not that he was and is motivated by a desire to further their joint cause, to investigate &#8220;abusers&#8221;.  </p>

The abiding impression was of a woman who has long lost sight of the wellbeing of her children and who is wholly unable to put their interest before her own obsession.

They did not know they would not be going home again, they had to spend the best part of two weeks confined to a chalet or holiday cabin, as she soon became aware that they were being sought by the police following orders made by the court. They had inadequate food for the three of them, M told me she went without food so that the children could eat, and while I accept she fed them first they must have been running out of supplies and on her account had no fresh food during this period. She told me that the boys did not feel confined and were happy as she kept them amused; and that they were unaware that anything was seriously wrong. I do not accept her evidence, she is either oblivious to the ability of children to pick up on what is going on around them, or wilfully choses to ignore it; it is much more likely to be the latter given her intransigent reaction to what the children have said for some time about the alleged &#8220;abuse&#8221;. She, and they, were confined in a small space and M told me that she had become aware that the authorities were looking for her and the children on seeing and hearing broadcasts about it; the children must have been aware of some of what she had heard being broadcast and it is likely that knew the police were looking for them.  </p>

I have little doubt that they would have been unsettled, bewildered and very probably frightened; there is little she can have given them by way of plausible explanation which would, in turn, have done little to allay any fear. As M had taken their passports with her it is more than likely that she had some plan or idea to take the children into more permanent hiding, probably out of this jurisdiction to avoid the orders of the court. That this was more than a mere notion on her part is evinced by her having terminated the utility bills as well as taking their travel documents with them, and of covertly obtaining a vehicle through S. From her evidence about this episode and from her inability to reflect, even when giving evidence, on the extent of emotional harm and abuse she has caused these children during their abduction, it is inevitable that this court must reach the conclusion that she is unable or unwilling to consider their feelings or to empathise with them as to the full effect of any of her actions on them.  </p>

It is not only that these children have had to face the fact of their own mother&#8217;s immutable insistence that they have been abused by their father and others at his behest contrary to what they themselves are saying over a considerable period of time, it also that they have been put in danger&#8217;s way either because she knowingly allowed it to happen at the very best, or actively colluded in the action of D and C at worst, that can must cause considerable concern to this court. Added to this is that fact that, from the children&#8217;s point of view (as described by the psychologist), they have been faced with their mother&#8217;s intransigence for so long that on one level they are just tired of it and on another they feel close to despair and fear that it will never end. The children&#8217;s lives and their right and ability to live their lives freely and without fear has been repeatedly curtailed, compromised and undermined by M&#8217;s actions and those of her family and associates.  </p>

She dismisses their insistence that that they have no memory, at all, of being abused as the children being brain-washed or put in fear of saying anything else by their father because they are living with him. This is a vicious circle which she uses to justify her position. I am bound to accept the previous findings of the court, upheld by the Court of Appeal, but, even if that were not so there is no independent evidence before the court including the evidence of child protection professional witnesses and experts which would come close to suggesting that the findings of the circuit judge were erroneous or ill-founded. Many of the facts and background to this case and this trial, as set out above, in my rehearsal of the proceedings and the evidence that has emerged since are not in dispute, what remains is the inferences that I can properly draw based on the totality of that evidence.  </p>

M has also tried more orthodox routes by going to the police and the NCA none of which have had the desired result. She has for some time, at least since March 2017, enlisted the support of others who operate on the periphery of, or outside, the law. She told me that C&#8217;s document, in which he purports is evidence of abuse, emerged and was passed on by C contacting her sister (L) in an unsolicited and spontaneous offer of support, and that L had then put C in touch with M&#8217;s solicitor.  </p>

Furthermore, after the curtailment of N&#8217;s investigation when it had become clear it could be considered harassment of F, M would have been well aware that the emergence of the covert observation of F and the children at what is supposed to be a confidential address, had to be seen to be at arm&#8217;s length and apparently unconnected to her.   </p>

The people that she would have the court believe are acting outside her knowledge and beyond her control, including C and D, are actors in this case that have been connected with her for some time; in D&#8217;s case the connection was personal and intimate. D knew and had met L and MGM; he had the pictures of M and her family as the background to his Facebook page. I have seen M give evidence and in court, she is neither passive nor detached, I find on the balance of probabilities based on all the evidence before the court, that she was aware of and involved in the actions of D and C.

These types of harm can include false allegations against a parent, encouraging parental alienation and, in rare cases, directly killing the children to stop the other parent having contact. These rare cases are particularly problematic because they are so rare and unusual; the risk is hard to assess, and perpetrators rarely show any signs of psychiatric disturbance.&#8221;</span></p>

Notwithstanding her admission, on the evidence before this court as reviewed and set out above, I find that it is more likely than not, that M had colluded with D in planning the arson and that she had hoped and intended that the arson attack would lead to the boys being removed from their father&#8217;s care.

It is most unfortunate if that is the view of the social worker and the LA, as it somewhat na&#239;ve, and the court would be concerned if the children were ever to feel at all, even indirectly, responsible for the location becoming known by M or D.  Regrettably, the information about the location of the boys and their home with F and his then partner was likely to been available to D and M by investigation through the internet and other means, as can be seen from the extensive information revealed by C in the documents he sent to M&#8217;s solicitor. It would be foolish indeed and careless of the safety of F and the children to proceed on the assumption that M is not aware of that information herself, it is more likely than not, she has seen the information in C&#8217;s documents, that her sister is aware of it and inevitable that others have shared that knowledge.  </p>

This is not a criticism of the SW, it can be seen from Dr Hellin&#8217;s report that the challenge that M would pose for any counsellor or therapist, and not just in assisting M to send appropriate messages to the children. It is, nonetheless, a criticism of the LA&#8217;s conduct of the case, the social worker&#8217;s managers who should not have left her to deal with such a difficult situation without adequate and appropriate specialist support. It is to be hoped that the LA will provide such professional support of a more apposite and detached nature if they are to act as a conduit for video messages between the boys and their mother in future. These are children who love their mother but have found her constant declaration of love and the reminders that she misses them oppressive, and to use the vernacular, her &#8220;neediness&#8221; is a burden to them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I have considered the evidence included in analysis and discussion above and have not set out or referred to every matter raised as it was neither necessary nor proportionate. For clarity the findings in this judgment are that M planned and carried out an abduction of the children in March 2017 and that it only came to an end because they were located and retrieved by the authorities; that she was directly involved in the planning of the arson attack on the children&#8217;s home; that she used a private investigator N to make enquiries including about the children&#8217;s foster placement and that as a result there was gross intrusion into the lives of the children and their father putting them at risk of further significant harm; the children have suffered significant emotional and psychological harm and have been placed at risk of physical harm, because M and her supporters have used social media and Internet groups to pursue and publicise her campaign against F this has directly resulted in the children living in a climate of secrecy and in fear of a constant threat to their safety and private family life. </p>

Some of information on these sites, which supported M in the abduction, and accused the police and Family Court of failing to protect the children from sexual abuse, could only have come from M directly or indirectly from her family and friends. M herself contributed by posting on the site after her release from custody (she was in custody after the children were retrieved) thanking people for their support. In addition, M&#8217;s allegations have been prominent in a Facebook page; this includes on the internet pages that can only have come from the M in the first instance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Contact</span>. Statute and case law reflect the widely held view that it is in the best interests of children to have contact with their parents. The children&#8217;s welfare remains the courts paramount consideration and that must and does include the need for them to be safe from further significant harm. The decisions I must make are governed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and the Children and Families Act (CFA) 2014.  The standard of proof, to which I have already alluded above, in all cases involving the welfare of children is the balance of probabilities as set out by the House of Lords in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof)</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>, confirmed by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2009/17" uk:canonical="[2009] UKSC 17" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKSC 17</ref>. In addition, as the court will be making private and not public law orders in respect of the children, it is once again <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> that will apply to the arrangements made for the children in future; the court is has in mind the amendments to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> of the made by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CFA 2014</ref> and that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> now includes the presumption that <span style="font-style:italic">unless the contrary</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">is shown</span> (my emphasis) involvement of a parent in the life of a child will further that child&#8217;s welfare. In short the presumption is subject to the requirement that the parent concerned may be involved in the child&#8217;s life in a way that does not put the child at risk of suffering harm.  </p>

This case is unusual as there is a high risk of further serious physical and psychological harm posed by M. As I have previously observed, while it is a fact that no one was in the house when the arson attack occurred there was nothing in the evidence that would support a finding that the risk of serious harm was eliminated by M&#8217;s assumption that the occupants, including her own children, would be absent; she could not have been sure that was the case. In considering future contact between the boys and their mother I am acutely aware (as is their father) that they both want to see her and have repeatedly told their guardian so. The local authority and the guardian submit that that even supervised direct contact would bring too much risk with it; the risk of abduction, the risk of disclosing the children&#8217;s location and the risk that would lead to physical harm. Their submissions have considerable force based as they are on the previous action, including serious criminal acts perpetrated by M and her supporters.  </p>

It is open to M, of course, to take proactive steps to deal with her delusional beliefs and fruitless systematic attempts to prove herself right; but the evidence, both of expert opinion and factual, is that she is unlikely to change and that there is limited if any effective intervention available without change.

There is a need to strike a balance between the need to protect the children from further litigation and the distress it would cause, the limited likelihood of success and the right of M to have access to the court in the circumstances of this case the balance is just and proportionate. Should M avail herself and use her some of her considerable determination to learn to understand and support the children in what are saying, to accept the findings of the courts and to reduce the risk she poses any application she may make in the light of such change would be likely to receive a favourable hearing.    </p>
