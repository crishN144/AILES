	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(1) The terms of Article 13(b) are by their very nature restricted in their scope. The defence has a high threshold, demonstrated by the use of the words "grave" and "intolerable".</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(2) The focus is on the child. The issue is the risk to the child in the event of his or her return.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(3) The separation of the child from the abducting parent can establish the required grave risk.</span>
 </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(4) When the allegations on which the abducting parent relies to establish grave risk are disputed, the court should first establish whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then establish how the child can be protected from the risk.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(5) In assessing these matters, the court must be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Article13(b) and so neither the allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(6) That does not mean, however, that no evaluative assessment of the allegations should be undertaken by the court. The court must examine in concrete terms the situation in which the child would be on return. In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance to give rise to the grave risk, the judge will have to consider whether the evidence enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that they do.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(7) If the judge concludes that the allegations would potentially establish the existence of an Article 13(b) risk, he or she must then carefully consider whether and how the risk can be addressed or sufficiently ameliorated so that the child will not be exposed to the risk.</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(8) In many cases, sufficient protection will be afforded by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(9) In deciding what weight can be placed on undertakings, the court has to take into account the extent to which they are likely to be effective, both in terms of compliance and in terms of the consequences, including remedies for enforcement in the requesting State, in the absence of compliance. </span>

She also fulfils criteria for generalised anxiety, with symptoms of palpitations and feelings of fearfulness. The mother had experienced episodes of emotional dysregulation and self harm in the relationship with the father. During the summer 2021 she had experienced severe depression and some suicidal ideation. Since that point the mother&#8217;s condition has improved so that she is now more stable and her level of depression was moderate. Whilst treatment with anti-depressants and anxiolytics will aid the resolution of her symptoms it is unlikely that full resolution will be achieved whilst there are ongoing stresses, as her depression is affected by psycho-social factors. </span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">In her opinion, set out in her report and oral evidence, Dr. Ratnam considered that a return to France would impact adversely on the mother&#8217;s mental health. Adequate treatment is available in France (and the mother is motivated to seek treatment) but other factors are also important in recovery from mental illness. Although she was not able to say exactly how the mother would fare if a return was ordered, she was clear that her situation would not be ameliorated and it could deteriorate. She noted that in France the mother did not have access to the significant support from her parents in the way that she does here, and her career prospects would be limited, at least for a while. The mother&#8217;s work is very important to her, for her sense of self and independence. Dr. Ratnam further said that the relationship with the father was triggering for the mother and that exposure to him would be likely to lead to the sort of difficulties she had earlier, especially if she was to live with him. </span>

He was of an age where he was totally dependent on his mother. Her roots in this country were very deep, and between December 2020 and May 2021 in France she was in a situation of distress, instability and uncertainty. If it had not been for Covid they would have only remained for a few weeks at the longest. The child had to have immunisations in France because appointments here could not be attended. The child was registered with a GP and had his eight week check in England in December 2020.</span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt"> May. The situation had undoubtedly been affected by Covid, but the situation was that the child and mother were living in France for five months between December 2020 and May 2021. Indeed the mother moved to France for the first time in February 2019 and a declaration was obtained to confirm they were living together and cohabiting. After the child was born the mother arranged for his and her belongings to be transported to France, and the child was registered with healthcare services there. She opened a bank account, and obtained a French residency card allowing her to stay permanently there. It was in France that the mother had a home with the father, for in England her accommodation was tied to her work with a family. In France, the parties were living together as a family and caring for the child.</span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">As to Article 13b, Mr Jarman submits that the mother&#8217;s mental health problems are not of a sufficient degree or intensity as to give rise to a grave risk or intolerable situation for the child. The defence is not there to protect children from what may be called the ordinary &#8216;rough and tumble&#8217;, discomfort and distress or other vicissitudes of life. Dr. Ratnam is not able to say that the mother&#8217;s mental health will deteriorate to a serious level; all she could say was that her current state was unlikely to be ameliorated. The mother has insight and is able to seek assistance from professionals virtually, and also her parents, even if she is in a different country. </span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">Although I acknowledge that this was a situation affected by Covid, I have come to the conclusion that this young child was habitually resident in France at the time of his removal. Looked at from his perspective he was living in a home with his mother and his father, the latter of whom had very significant roots and family there. That was his day to day life. Belongings were transferred at the start of the stay and the mother obtained a residency card (albeit the timing was affected by the exit of the UK from the EU). The child may have been registered with healthcare services in England but he was also registered in France &#8211; the consequence of the length of his stay there. The relationship was certainly unhappy so far as the mother was concerned and she would no doubt have left earlier if she could have done, but it seems to me that the child had attained the necessary degree of integration into a social and family environment. I do not think it could be said of this child that he was either habitually resident in England at the date of the removal, or that he had no habitual residence at all. </span>

Most of the instances, taken by themselves would not be particularly serious, but what is being alleged is a clear pattern of abusive behaviour. The mother gives a range of examples of the father losing his temper with her and berating her for the most trivial of reasons. She gave an account of his pushing her aggressively and shouting &#8216;fuck you&#8217;. She also said that there were occasions when he shouted at her for keeping him awake (by breastfeeding with the light on, watching Netflix, or listening to music in the middle of the morning) and then when he berated her for failing to wake him up. Once he was angry her for not buying him croissants when she went to the shop. On another occasion he was angry with her and would not let her pass him in the home to get to the kitchen. At other times he has woken her up to shout at her. </span>

This argument appears to have taken place in front of the child. Her father tried to intervene but the mother became so distressed (because she said she misunderstood what her father was saying) that she deliberately hit her head against the door (causing injury) and then ran off into the woods with the intention of causing herself harm (her statement is not explicit but clearly suggests she was thinking of committing suicide). Fortunately she thought of the effect on the child if she did that, and rang her cousin. Then her father came to look for her. The police arrived at the home and arrested the father. </span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">Being cared for by a depressed parent is not that unusual. Many children grow up and are cared for perfectly well in such circumstances. In this case, however, the mother was so distressed and dysregulated that she inflicted physical injury upon herself in a bad moment in July 2021,and also thought of committing suicide. She pulled back from this with the assistance of her cousin, and also her father came to look for her. On other occasions when she said she was being verbally abused by the father she has become extremely distressed and has torn up her books, broken small items of furniture, and turned over a coffee table. She has insight and has sought appropriate assistance and treatment but the incidents have still happened. Her mental health has improved since July 2021, but it is in the context of her being well supported and away from the father. </span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">This is a very young child, not yet 18 months old. He is strongly dependent upon his primary carer, his mother. She has been able to offer him a good standard of care to date, most recently with the assistance of her parents, but as Dr. Ratnam states, depression can impact upon emotional interactions with a child, which can impact on the child&#8217;s emotional well-being. Also, the effects upon a child of seeing their own parent in a desperate dysregulated state (such as in July 2021) could be psychologically harmful. The risk to him of his mother becoming suicidal are obvious.</span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt"> In my judgment that whilst the more general effect of the mother&#8217;s depression upon the emotional interactions with the child are more likely to fall within the category of the day to day &#8216;rough and tumble&#8217; if taken alone, the effect upon the child of the mother suffering not only depression but also the sorts of emotional dysregulation she has been known to display in the past is different and much more intense. I do not consider witnessing the mother becoming so dysregulated that she is capable of harming herself and considering suicide is something this young child should be expected to tolerate or cope with. The same applies to the mother breaking items, turning over furniture, or become uncontrollably distressed and crying. </span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">Whilst the risk of this happening can be ameliorated by the mother having her own accommodation away from the father and continuing to engage with health services and supportive groups, a return to France would still place significant stressors in her way. She would not be able to do the job there that she does here without speaking French, so that for a while at least she would not be financially independent. Her parents would be some way away. These are not normal times and travel between England and France is not straightforward. There would be litigation in France which would be very stressful without any family support. Even though living separately and the undertakings offered (which include the father abiding by contact arrangements and refraining from harassing, pestering or intimidating the mother, threatening or using violence against her) should limit the risk of &#8216;triggering&#8217; interactions between the parents , there would have to be some making of arrangements and handing over of the child. There may have to be negotiations about finances. The mother&#8217;s case is that the father lacks understanding and empathy for her; indeed she believes that his behaviour has been cruel and provocative. As one example of a lack of understanding, Ms Renton points out that it was only on the morning of the hearing that the father was prepared to undertake to provide the mother with separate accommodation. Until then, his case was that she could return to the family home.</span>

 <span style="font-size:14pt">In my judgment, even taking into account the protective measures that are now offered by undertakings, the grave risk that a return order would expose the child to psychological harm or an intolerable situation still persists. On the expert evidence before me, this mother is vulnerable to further episodes of emotional dysregulation, particularly so if she has to return to France whilst there is further litigation about the child. There is properly no suggestion that the child could or should be separated from her. In all the circumstances the threshold for the exercise of my discretion is met. On the evidence as put before me, I have concluded that I should decline to make the return order sought. Accordingly, I will dismiss the father&#8217;s application. </span>
