An example given by Mrs Carty was a concern that [Emma] did not consider how it might have felt to [Felix] to be swaddled daily in such a tight swaddle that he was unable to move. It seems that [Felix] was swaddled much more often than just at night time, and that swaddling was used as a means of controlling and settling him, indeed [Luke] told the police that [Felix] seemed to have learned that placement on the blanket for swaddling was a cue for him to stop crying and stop wriggling.  [Felix] was responding to the demand of his carer to settle, because that is what his carer wanted.  His carer was not curious about what [Felix] might have needed;</span></p>
