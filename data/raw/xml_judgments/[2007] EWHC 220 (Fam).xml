	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been very grateful to all the advocates, not forgetting Mr Richard Harrison, and to their instructing solicitors for their help during a very well argued and very hard fought hearing.   I also thank the adult children, Mr Salem Mubarak and Miss Noor Mubarak, who have appeared in person and attended during parts of the hearing (and who are both present as I speak today), for their courtesy and intelligent clarity.      I temper my thanks to the advocates with the qualification that although there is much detail in this case, I do feel that at times there has been over concentration on detail and reliance on make-weight points.   There is a real risk in this case of losing sight of the woods for the trees.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has now become very well known and continuous litigation of great intensity now spans over seven years.   It has been before at least thirty different judges in England.    There are, in the present bundle, no less than twenty transcribed judgments (and there have been others).   Five of those judgments are now reported, or about to be reported, in law reports.   </p>

Some of those costs relate to issues concerning the children.   Of that total, &#163;1,580,000 has been incurred <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">since</span> the conclusion of the main hearing of ancillary relief in December 1999; and of that &#163;1,580,000 he has paid &#163;1,355,000 and owes &#163;225,000.</p>

In her case, the amount that has been incurred since the conclusion of the final hearing is less clear since I do not know what portion of the costs of Sears Tooth, who acted around that time, precedes, and what portion follows the final hearing.  But <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">at least </span>&#163;1,250,000 is since the final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her case, the amount already paid and the amount still owed is also shrouded in confusion.  She apparently owed altogether about  &#163;777,970 to her first three solicitors.    They collectively obtained and sold her jewellery and the proceeds were credited to the costs, but no-one now present before me seems to know how much those proceeds were and what she may still owe those firms.    What is certain is that she owes her present solicitors, Messrs Dean and Dean, over one million pounds, having so far paid them precisely &#163;14,960.</p>

I have the utmost sympathy with and understanding of their position  It  illustrates the terrible consequence of the war that has taken place in this case. </p>

That figure, of course, does not take account of any costs orders I may make at the conclusion of this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Now, the four children of the family are parties and the estimated  costs of the younger, minor, children are already &#163;30,750, if assessed at public funding rates; or &#163;54,380, if assessed on a privately funded basis, following any order for costs made against the other parties.   At the moment, the costs of the minor children are funded by the English tax payer.   That is exquisitely ironical since the parties, although resident here for tax purposes and liable to English taxation, manage to avoid paying any tax at all; a matter which the husband told me about with an evident sense of satisfaction.</p>

Other entities, including the family trust and some of the companies owned by it, have also participated from time to time in the struggle and have incurred costs, but I do not know how much.   I have not counted the total amount of court time, or days in court which this case has now occupied.  But it must be very great and it is disproportionate to the importance of any one family and is unfair to other, often more needy, court users, such as families whose children (unlike these) have been removed from them.</p>

And if the words &#8220;perfectly shocking&#8221; and &#8220;insane&#8221; were appropriate and justifiable in October 2004, I can only wonder at the appropriate description, two years, a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">further</span>  &#163;1,850,000 and a large number of court days later.    All these considerations may have relevance when, and if, I have to exercise discretions, but I stress that they do not in any way impact upon, or affect my consideration of the several points of law which I have to determine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will summarise the essential factual background as briefly as I can.   Fuller details may be found in earlier judgments, and in particular, that of Mr Justice Bodey in December 1999.   Although there was a decree absolute as long ago as 10 December 1999, I will, for convenience, call Mr Iqbal Mubarik &#8220;the husband&#8221;, and Mrs Aaliya Mubarak &#8220;the wife&#8221;.     They were both brought up in prosperous families in the Kashmir area of India, and each remains a citizen of India and India alone.     The husband was born in November 1958 and is now aged 48.    The wife was born in December 1959 and is now aged 47.    They first met in 1977 and theirs was a love affair and their marriage one of their own choosing.    Not only was it not arranged by their parents, but the wife&#8217;s family, at least, strongly disapproved of it.     The husband&#8217;s own father was a successful jeweller and the husband followed in the same business or trade.   In 1980 he moved to Kuwait and set up a jewellery business there.  They married in August 1983.  He was 24, she was 23.     She moved to live with him in Kuwait.     Their eldest child, Salem was born in July 1984.  He is now 22.   In 1986 the husband set up a further business manufacturing and trading in jewellery in Hong Kong, and the young family moved to live there for the next eleven years.  In 1988 a company owned by the husband, Checkers Ltd, bought a house in Hong Kong which became the matrimonial home.    Noor was born in July 1988 and is now 18 and thus adult.  Osman was born on 19 October 1991 and is now aged 15.    The business continued to expand.   In 1993 the husband formed another company which opened a shop in Paris; and in September 1993 he decided also to trade from a shop in London.   He incorporated a British company, Dianoor Jewels Ltd, which acquired the lease of premises in New Bond Street.    Thereafter, the husband (necessarily and quite appropriately) spent a considerable amount of time staying in London and attending to his new business here.    The wife and children remained in Hong Kong.   In March 1994 the husband incorporated a holding company, 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings Ltd, in Bermuda.    This came to, and still does, own all the shares in the relevant subsidiary companies of the business.     There is one exception, of relevance to some of the discretionary issues I may have to decide, that a business partner owns 35% of the shares in the Paris company.    The initial shareholders in 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings were the husband as to about 98% and the wife the remaining about 2%.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife says that there was some deterioration in the marriage from as early as late 1994.    The husband disagrees, but after hearing oral evidence from each of them on this topic I see  no reason to revise the finding of Mr Justice Bodey in December 1999 (now at bundle C page 8) when he accepted the wife&#8217;s case that there was deterioration, first, in 1994.     The wife told me, and I accept, that in about July 1996 she passed through London after visiting her brother in America.  She found her husband in what she described as &#8220;a disturbed state&#8221;.     When he returned to Hong Kong in the autumn of 1996 (in September or October) she asked him if there was another woman.    He said that there was, although he did not admit to any adultery, and indeed, I do not know whether at that stage he had committed adultery.  But the husband himself has said in evidence before me that he was indeed attracted to, and, he felt, in love with, this lady, whom I will call KS and who was then an employee of the company in London, and that he had been in a relationship with her for several months before he admitted it to the wife.<marker name="tab"/>I am satisfied, therefore, that this important relationship (whether or not then adulterous) was current throughout the summer of 1996.   The wife said that by December 1996 &#8220;things had improved in the marriage&#8221; and she thought the husband was &#8220;really making an effort to make it work&#8221;.    He gave her a special birthday party in December 1996.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was also during 1996 that the parties considered moving from Hong Kong to London to live.     There were several reasons for this.  It would enable them to be together more as a family, since by then the main focus of the husband&#8217;s work was here.   They liked the lifestyle in London, and they felt that education in England was superior to that in Hong Kong.     In October 1996 the husband bought a flat (not large enough as a family home) in Chelsea, and instructed estate agents to start looking for a home here.   The move was planned and consensual.    In the first week of July 1997 the wife and children left Hong Kong and moved for a summer holiday with the extended families in Kashmir.    The husband was not there.    In mid July 1997, as part of an overall scheme devised by a firm of solicitors, Paisner &amp; Co, the husband incorporated Dianoor Jewels International, as a holding company beneath 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings.  </p>

Mr Charles Howard QC makes the point that as part of this process the husband&#8217;s share holding in 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century actually diminished from about 98% to 90% and the wife&#8217;s increased from about 2% to about 10%, which he submits is not the mark of a man then bent on deceiving or removing assets from the reach of his wife.</p>

It seems to me that the date actually inserted may not necessarily be the date when the husband and wife actually signed.  It may be a separate date when the professional trustees, the Craven Trust Company Ltd signed; or a date inserted by Paisners, so as to make all the transactions co-terminous and to bear a date appropriate to the overall scheme of setting up the trust.</p>

He said he was turning 40 and did not know what to do.    There were huge rows.   Family members travelled from India to intercede; but on 20 March 1998 the husband left the home and they have never since cohabited.   Ten days later, on 30 March 1998, the husband first consulted a very well known matrimonial solicitor, Ms Gill Doran of Withers, about matrimonial matters.  But at that stage Withers did not write any letter, or take any other action directed to the wife or anyone on her behalf; and of course, I have absolutely no idea as to the content of any instructions to, or advice from, Ms Doran.</p>

By then, the wife&#8217;s solicitors were Messrs Sears Tooth and her barristers Mr Martin Pointer QC and Mr Justin Warshaw, who collectively represented a team of very great experience and distinction in this field.   The judgment of Mr Justice Bodey describes why and in what circumstances on Thursday 2 December the husband withdrew his instructions from his equally prestigious solicitors and counsel, and personally withdrew from the case and the court room.   Before they withdrew, the husband&#8217;s counsel, Miss Florence Baron QC, had placed detailed written submissions before the court.  In her text and schedules, Miss Baron (following the approach in Withers&#8217; letter) clearly treated all the trust assets as being, in reality, personal assets of the husband which she described as being &#8220;now held through the usual tax efficient off-shore structure&#8221;.

It seems likely, however, that the formal order had already been drafted, at least in part, by then.   On the Monday, Mr Justice Bodey gave a further judgment (of which an official transcript does exist) on certain further issues which were raised, in particular an application for an order for the delivery up of, and sale of, the jewellery stock of the businesses, and that is reflected in paragraphs 15 to 21 of the final order.</p>

But at all events, the order itself was sealed the same day, namely 13 December 1999, so if not drafted beforehand, it was drafted very rapidly after judgment on the Monday. I will, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to it simply as the order, or the principal order.   I mention that although sealed on Monday 13 December 1999, the order bears the typed date, 10 December 1999. That cannot be right, since much of the order (namely paragraphs 13 and 15 to 22) was only the subject of adjudication upon the following Monday, 13 December.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the seven years which have now elapsed since 13 December 1999, the husband has not voluntarily paid one single penny of that lump sum.  Under charging orders upon two flats owned by the husband, later made pursuant to paragraph 14 of the principle order, the wife has successfully obtained &#163;266,000, which must be credited to the lump sum (see the language at paragraph 4 of the later order of 20 January 2000, now at bundle A page 60, and paragraph 1 of the order of 14 June 2000, now at bundle A page 122, which each refer in terms to the proceeds of the sales being paid &#8220;in partial satisfaction of the lump sum&#8221;).   So, the husband still owes  &#163;4,609,000 of the lump sum.   The order also required the husband to make periodical payments both generally to the wife for the benefit of the children, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> payment of the lump sum; and also, specifically for the benefit of the wife herself, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">until </span>payment of the lump sum.   The husband has made some payments under the order for periodical payments, but, at the start of the hearing before me last month, there were arrears to that date of  &#163;493,519 (which will already have increased and will continue to increase at the rate of  &#163;14,733 per month, less anything he may pay).   So, the total indebtedness to date is &#163;5,117,252 namely, the balance of the lump sum of &#163;4,609,000 plus arrears of periodical payments of &#163;508,252.    <marker name="tab"/>During this judgment I may, for shorthand, refer to the husband owing the wife, or the debt as being, 5.1 million pounds, but I do not overlook, and in any order it must be expressed as being, the full and correct figure.   In addition, the husband owes the wife the net balance of costs which, as I have said, is estimated as now being of the order of 1.5 million pounds (subject to assessment) before provision as to liability for the costs of the present applications and hearing.    So, altogether, he now owes her around 6.6 million pounds.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between December 1999 and now, there has been a long and relentless history of attempts by the wife, both here and abroad, to enforce her order. Sears Tooth ceased to act in late December 2000.   Upon many applications since then, she has acted in person, having exhausted any funds of her own.   She has not always acted wisely.  Mistakes have been made, not only by her and her advisors, but indeed by Mr Justice Bodey.   On 13 December 1999 itself, Mr Justice Bodey said there was &#8220;no difficulty&#8221; in &#8220;piercing the corporate veil&#8221;, as I shall describe later.    In October 2000, he realised he had been wrong to do so, and discharged his previous order (viz paragraph 15 of the principal order).  In October 2000 Mr Justice Bodey made a suspended order for the committal of the husband to prison, which was later set aside by the Court of Appeal because of procedural errors.  So, orders for costs have been made in favour of the husband and against the wife.    There has, sadly, been litigation about the children, the father&#8217;s contact and his holidays abroad with them.  Often, the father, rather than the mother, has been successful.  So Mr Charles Howard QC says the fault is not all on the side of the husband, and that it is unfair to attribute all the &#8220;insanity&#8221; and &#8220;shock&#8221; at the level of costs to the husband alone.   I do not accept that submission.   Whatever mistakes the wife or her advisors may, from time to time, have made, it has all only been necessitated because of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">total</span> failure of the husband to obey or even attempt to obey the lump sum order and much of the order for periodical payments. The wife may have thrashed around, but it has all been in her desperate attempt to enforce payment.   I have not informed myself at all as to the disputes about the children, and I am well aware in particular that in his judgment of 17 June 2003, connected with the children, Mr Justice Singer made many comments critical of the wife, as helpfully summarised by Mr Charles Howard QC and Mr Richard Harrison at paragraphs 13 and 14 of their written submissions for the present hearing.  But I have little doubt that, without putting it any higher, much which the wife has said or done in relation to the children has been tinged by the failure to pay the money and the depressing effect that has had upon the wife&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s standard of living.   Further, the position of the now adult children, Salem and Noor, in the present hearing, and the content of their questions to their father, left me in no doubt that they now have massive bitterness at their father&#8217;s total failure to pay and its effect both on their mother and on themselves.   That bitterness must pervade the whole family.</p>

They are all directed to a single goal: getting the money which the husband has already owed the wife for seven years, plus the escalating arrears of periodical payments and costs.   None are aimed at getting a penny more for the wife than he already owes her.   They are, however, essentially alternative approaches.   Application 1 is directed to removing the husband&#8217;s shares from the trust and re-instating them to the husband, so that the wife can directly enforce against him and them.  It would leave nothing in the trust except the wife&#8217;s own minority shareholding of relatively low value.     </p>

If application 1 is successful and the husband&#8217;s shares removed from the trust, then an order under application 2 is of little use to the wife.

A discretionary choice would need to be made whether finally to proceed under application 1 (setting aside the disposition of the shares) or application 3 (varying the post-nuptial settlement).   It thus seems to me more logical and more transparent to consider, first, in relation to each of the applications, the issue of power or jurisdiction; and to do so in the chronological order of events.  Having decided what, if any, powers are open to me on the various applications, I can then consider whether and how I should exercise them.</p>

Further, this is clearly a case which falls, if at all, within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/37/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37 (2)</ref> (c).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Howard QC, for the husband, suggested that the transfer of the shares was actually made &#8220;for valuable consideration&#8221; and was outside the scope of a reviewable disposition altogether by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37 (4)</ref> (there being no suggestion or question of bad faith on the part of the professional trustees in Jersey).    His argument was that the transfer into the trust in September 1997 was part of a larger overall transaction which included the earlier share reduction in August 1997 and the creation of a loan by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings Ltd to the husband, and that in some way that larger transaction involved valuable consideration moving from the company to the husband.  I reject the argument.   The only disposition under attack is the transfer of the shares into the trust.   There is no attack upon any of the earlier transactions as between the husband and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings.     The stock transfer forms transferring the shares (now at bundle 5 D (ii) pages 243 and 244) clearly state that the &#8220;consideration money&#8221; was &#8220;nil&#8221;.

By July 1996 (as recorded in the attendance note of 31 July 1996 now at page 204) there was the thought of the whole family moving here to live, which would definitely make him resident here for tax purposes.    Everything about all the documents points to, and is consistent with, the twin objectives alone of an orderly succession on death and avoiding UK taxation.  But the wife and Miss Harris say that if, subjectively, he also had an intention to defeat the wife&#8217;s claims, or as it was put, to create an &#8220;insurance&#8221; against possible separation and divorce, then of course he would be unlikely to have mentioned that to his solicitor or barrister.

She points to the very wide powers reserved to him under the deed and to the concern of Mr Ewart (see the telephone reaction of Mr Ewart as recorded at the outset of the note of the conference on 8 August 1997, now at page 230) that the width of those powers might imperil the tax efficacy of the proposed trust.

She says that that conclusion can only be fortified by the subsequent ruthlessness of the husband and his determination that the wife should not have a penny, all of which Miss Harris submitted is part of  &#8220;a continuum&#8230;of a totally devious and thoroughly dishonest and ruthless man who is prepared to take any steps at any expense to prevent the wife from receiving her due&#8221;.

But the presumption does not apply.  The fact is that the husband plainly did have legitimate and appropriate intentions, namely orderly succession and, very critically, avoidance of tax, which are capable of fully and wholly explaining and justifying the setting up of the trust and the transfer of the shares.  All the available documentary evidence supports those intentions and gives no hint of any other.  The fact that when the marriage did later break down he took advantage of the trust to impede enforcement (if nothing else) of the wife&#8217;s claims, may help justify, but certainly does not require, an inference that he had had that intention all along; nor, in my view, does the width of the powers reserved to him.   He is a proud man who had previously, both within the marriage and in the world at large, had complete autonomy over his businesses and all financial matters.  He now had to part with his assets into a trust, not through any altruism, but in order to achieve his motives of orderly succession and avoiding tax.   It seems to me entirely explicable that he still wished to retain as much autonomy and control as he could, consistent with achieving those motives.    The note of the conference on 8 August 1997 precisely bears that out.   The &#8220;comfort mechanism&#8221; need not have involved &#8220;comfort&#8221; from the wife, or from the impact of separation and divorce, but simply the &#8220;comfort&#8221; that he was retaining as much as possible of his previous autonomy.</p>

But I still do have to be satisfied that such an intention was actually in play.  When all that happened up to and including September 1997 is, in my view, fully and completely explicable by succession and tax reasons, I am simply unable to infer or conclude that there was another intention in play in the face of the husband&#8217;s denial.    I place no positive reliance, as such, upon the husband&#8217;s denial, which could so obviously be self serving, but there is simply nothing in the end to pit against it.  If I were to conclude that he did have the second intention of defeating the wife&#8217;s claim, I would simply be inferring, or presuming, intention from later consequence.   I ask myself the simple question: am I satisfied on a simple balance of probability that on or before the disposition in September 1997 the husband had the statutory intention?

See judgment of 10 December 1999 at internal page 7 (bundle C8) lines 23 to 26; judgment of 19 January 2006 at internal page 4 (bundle C69) at B; and judgment of 23 October 2005 at internal page 30 (bundle C 124) at line 21.   Mr Howard submitted that these comments (they are nowhere expressed to be &#8220;findings&#8221; although the reference at C69B comes closest to being one) in some way raised an issue estoppel.    I do not accept that submission for a moment for two reasons.  First, this point was never clearly in issue before Mr Justice Bodey, nor the subject of evidence or detailed argument before him.  Second, it is not in dispute that the trust was set up for fiscal reasons.  The question is whether there was another reason, or intention, as well, which Mr Justice Bodey did not address.  The use of the word &#8220;merely&#8221; at C69B to C cannot bear the weight that Mr Howard would put upon it.   The comments of Mr Justice Bodey on this point have not influenced me in the slightest and I have approached the topic entirely from scratch  It happens, however, that my conclusions align with the recorded comments of Mr Justice Bodey.  </p>

He claims that his intention was to ensure, now that they were separated, that the wife did not benefit under the trust in the event of his sudden and accidental death, eg in an aeroplane crash, and relies upon the last paragraph of the letter from Mr Phelps dated 9 November 1998, now at bundle 5D(ii) page 202, where this account and explanation is given.   That may well be true.  But by April 1998, in contrast to September 1997, there was actual separation and obvious marital breakdown, and I am sure that the husband, who had already consulted a matrimonial solicitor, Ms Doran of Withers, had the possibility of divorce firmly in mind and that that also substantially influenced his intentions.   I completely reject the further evidence of the husband for, and at, the present hearing that his intention in making the instrument of exclusion was to remove any incentive for the wife or her family deliberately to kill him so as to enable her to benefit under the trust.   If that was his reason (and it was only first mentioned years later in 2004), then he would have to have informed her at once, which he did not do, that he had excluded her.   His oral evidence that he &#8220;did not want to be a sitting duck&#8221;   but only &#8220;further down the line, if things went bad and someone in her family might make a nice little accident&#8221;, showed him at his most devious, unconvincing, and indeed, malicious.</p>

The husband says that the court, viz Mr Justice Bodey in December 1999, either has exercised that power (and it is trite law that a property adjustment power cannot be exercised twice in relate to the same property); or has dismissed the application for a variation of settlement order; or at any rate has made what was intended to be a once-and-for-all final order as to capital, which now precludes making any such order.   Clearly, these arguments all focus on, and require a decision as to, what Mr Justice Bodey did, or did not, order and do in December 1999; and that must centre on construction of his actual order, although all relevant and admissible surrounding material may also be considered.  </p>

In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span>, the original order was a so called Mesher order which postponed sale of the home until the younger child had ceased full time education, but required sale then to take place.   After that child had ceased full time education, the wife applied for a range of further orders including a transfer of, or at any rate further postponing sale of, the home.   The Court of Appeal had acceded  in part to the wife&#8217;s application.   In the House of Lords, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, with whom the rest of their Lordships agreed, made plain that in his (and so, their) view, the order of the Court of Appeal did substantial justice to the parties (see 260 B) and that he (and so, they) reached the conclusion that there was no power to make that order &#8220;with the greatest reluctance and regret&#8221; (see 264B &#8211; C).   So, the merits of the case were very strongly with the wife, but on a proper construction of the order it had finally and conclusively determined the rights of the parties in the house and no further order could be made.  </p>

So if I conclude that the order of Mr Justice Bodey was intended to be such an order, then that, too, is the end of the matter.  But if it was not intended to be a final order, and if there has not yet been an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> in relation to the trust, then I am asked to make one.   In my view, I would, as a matter of jurisdiction, be able to do so.  First, because <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24(1)</ref> begins with the words &#8220;or at any time thereafter&#8221;.     Second, because nothing in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span> or <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Carson</span> precludes that I can do so.   Third, because if a later order in relation to a different property<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> is</span> precluded, even if there has not been a once-and-for-all final order, then all the discussion in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Carson</span> as to whether there has been such a once-and-for-all final order would be otiose.

Apart from the order itself, the main aid to construction is what Mr Justice Bodey had said in the judgment itself on Friday 10 December 1999.    At paragraph 22 on internal page 52, now bundle C page 53, he found, even at that stage, that:-</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.11in"><marker name="tab"/>So, the previous behaviour and forecast problems were already known and in the mind of Mr Justice Bodey.   At pages 54 (C55) to 56 (C57) Mr Justice Bodey carefully considered whether he should make an order based on lesser capital provision and continuing periodical payments, or a &#8220;clean break&#8221; order.  He decided on the latter course and considered that in reality the husband had sufficient capital resources to pay an appropriate sum.  I stress that the jargon of &#8220;clean break&#8221; is different from the jargon of &#8220;once-and-for-all capital settlement (or order)&#8221; and I do not confuse the two.  &#8220;Clean break&#8221; is a reference to whether there be an ongoing liability to pay periodical payments or maintenance.  In this case, technically, Mr Justice Bodey made an order for  a postponed or conditional clean break, the condition of which (payment of the lump sum) has not yet been fulfilled.    It is perfectly possible and very common (and indeed <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span> is an example) to have an order which is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> a clean break (because maintenance continues) but which is nevertheless a once-and-for-all capital settlement.</p>

I reject that particular argument.    Paragraph 12 does no more than give to the wife a  &#8220;liberty to apply&#8221; and makes plain that if payment of the lump sum is delayed, the quantum of the periodical payments may be increased.    It does not in any way preclude alternative remedies against capital; and in any event, we are no longer in the territory of &#8220;delay in payment&#8221; but of prolonged, ruthless and contumacious refusal to pay.   I do not think that paragraph 12 impacts on anything I have to decide, nor does the fact that the level of interim periodical payments has already been increased.</p>

Before considering the meaning and effect of those provisions, I make the following general comments.   First, it might be thought that the best person to know what he meant and intended is Mr Justice Bodey himself and that he, not me, should perform the task of construing the order.    At the outset of this hearing, Mr Howard on behalf of the husband strenuously asked me to adjourn it so it could be heard by Mr Justice Bodey, who was not available for the present hearing due to being called for jury service.    I refused that application for reasons I gave in a judgment on 6 December 2006; essentially for two reasons.    First, it would have meant another intolerable period of delay and no doubt yet further and considerable escalation of costs.  Secondly, the essential issue has to be one of objective, not subjective intent.   A judge cannot say, especially years later, that what he actually had in mind was so and so, and there would be a real danger of impermissible &#8220;second thoughts&#8221;.    As <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Carson </span>and many other cases all show, it is a matter of identifying the true contemporary intent from what was said and done, at the time, in the overall context of the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Miss Harris relies upon a further passage in a much more recent judgment of Mr Justice Bodey of 9 May 2006.   By then, the applications currently before me (except that specifically under the slip rule &#8211; application 4) were already under way and Mr Justice Bodey was hearing an application under the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hadkinson</span> jurisprudence to prevent the husband from participating in the present hearing.  Mr Justice Bodey again referred at paragraph 13, now bundle C334, to the &#8220;concession&#8221; and repeated at paragraph 18, now C336, how the wife had been grievously misled.    At paragraph 36, now at C339, Mr Justice Bodey said:-</p>

(In parenthesis I note as regard point (a) that what I actually said at the end of my 1999 judgment was, that the wife&#8217;s claims against (among other entities) the trust, were to be regarded as abandoned or withdrawn &#8220;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic">as and when the husband pays the lump sum&#8221;.</span>  As this has not yet happened, any disjunction between the wording of the judgment and the wording of the preamble to the order is something to which the parties&#8217; advisors (particularly the wife&#8217;s) should perhaps be giving further consideration.)&#8221; [words emphasised in italics in original transcript of judgment as approved by Mr Justice Bodey].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Harris understandably seeks to attach weight to this passage and invites me to do the same.   The last sentence of the quote may have been a thinly veiled reference to possible application under the slip rule and did, I assume, trigger the making of that application.    I must, however, be very careful indeed as to what weight, if any, I should attach to this passage and/or what inferences I may draw from it.    First and foremost, this was said in May 2006, over six years after the December 1999 judgment and order.    Second, so much has happened since then, that there is real room for, and therefore risk of &#8220;second thoughts&#8221;.    Third, Mr Justice Bodey was very careful merely to &#8220;note&#8221; what he had actually said in judgment and to refer to &#8220;any disjunction&#8221;.    He did not say that there necessarily is disjunction; merely, in effect, that there may be.    Fourth, the whole passage in parenthesis is doing no more than flagging up to the advisors a point to which they should &#8220;perhaps&#8221; give further consideration.    In the light of these factors, I wish to make crystal clear that I do <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> regard and do <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> treat the passage as being an admissible or relevant aid, at all, to the correct construction of the order of December 1999.   The only point which I am willing to draw from that passage, and indeed from the judgment of 9 May 2006 as a whole, is that it presumably did not strike Mr Justice Bodey that an application now to vary the trust is obviously precluded by the order of 1999 or, I presume, he would have said so.    That does not in any way at all entitle or justify a conclusion now that the principle order can and should be construed so as to permit such a variation.  All it does is indicate the absence of a possible obstacle of the trial judge himself thinking that it was precluded.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the submission of Mr Howard that there was an actual exercise of the power.   He argues that as the stock of jewellery belonged to one or more of the companies, and they in turn were wholly owned by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century in turn was owned by the trust, the order made under paragraph 15 for delivery up and ultimate sale of the jewellery must have involved some implied variation of the post-nuptial settlement.   He submits that Mr Justice Bodey could only have attacked the jewellery if he had first given the wife some interest in it by varying the trust.   In his judgment on 13 December 1999, however, Mr Justice Bodey made quite plain and express that he was acting, or purporting to act, under the powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>; and that because of the concession as to the trust, he did &#8220;not see any difficulties as to piercing the corporate veil&#8221;.   On 23 October 2000, on the application of the companies, Mr Justice Bodey later accepted that he had not been entitled to pierce the veil in that way, and in fact discharged the whole of paragraph 15.    I do not at all accept the submission of Miss Harris that, as paragraph 15 has now been discharged, I should now construe the events and order of 13 December 1999 as if paragraph 15 had never been inserted.   In my view, that would be utterly unreal.   I have to discern the intention as a whole of Mr Justice Bodey in December 1999, and at that time he clearly intended to, and did, insert the provision of paragraph 15.  But it is quite clear from the way that Mr Justice Bodey approached the question of sale of the jewellery in December 1999 that he was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> varying the post-nuptial settlement.  Rather, he was simply &#8220;piercing the veil&#8221; and getting to the perceived reality, because of the concession, that the jewellery simply belonged to the husband.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much more difficult is the question whether Mr Justice Bodey had declined to exercise the power as part of making a once-and-for-all capital order.    Standing alone, the &#8220;as and when&#8221; basis and passage in the judgment of Friday 10 December is, in my view, clear.  The wife had applied in both her petitions for all forms of ancillary relief.  I have already described how I construe that passage.   It dealt separately and discretely both with &#8220;any interest in&#8221; and &#8220;any claim against&#8221; various assets including the trust.    The judgment was obviously pre-prepared and the words deliberate.   In my view, if those words stood alone, then the position at the end of the judgment and close of the Friday is quite clear.  The judge had not only <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not </span>declined to exercise the power, but had expressly and deliberately kept the power open until the lump sum had indeed been paid.  He did so precisely because he foresaw, in passages I have referred to, that there was likely to be a failure to pay and problems of enforcement.    Mr Howard submits, however, that by, or on, the Monday counsel and the judge had moved, or did move, on, and now deliberately selected paragraph 14 and the charges, and paragraph 15 and sale of the jewellery as the preferred and exclusive methods of enforcement.   He relies heavily on the preamble and basis (C):-</p>

He accepts that there is no express dismissal of such a claim; but says that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span>, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Carson</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sandford</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 1 FLR 412" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 1 FLR 412</ref> all show that even although it is desirable that any dismissal should be expressed, it is not essential that it should be.   Miss Harris counters that by saying that experienced professionals and experienced judges have moved on since <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dinch</span> and those cases.   She emphasises the first paragraph of the speech of Lord Oliver and says that in the ensuing twelve years between then and December 1999 all experienced professionals, as Mr Pointer and Mr Warshaw, the draftsmen, and Mr Justice Bodey, the judge, all unquestionably were, knew that if dismissal is intended that should be, and is, expressly stated.    She points to paragraph 72 of the then current fifth edition (July 1998) of the extremely well known and widely used SFLA Precedents for Consent Orders (there is no essential difference in the language, just because it is not by consent) which uses a clause :-</p>

He focuses, next, on paragraph 5 of the order.   This refers to the wife transferring &#8220;all such interest as she may have in&#8221; the stated assets, which include the trust, upon payment in full of the lump sum.   So Mr Howard says that it reflects and applies that part of the &#8220;as and when basis&#8221; and passage that deals with &#8220;any <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">interest</span>&#8221; the wife has <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in</span> any such assets.

So he submits that the judge, and maybe counsel as well, must deliberately have moved on from the position stated in the judgment.   By the time the order was made, the intention must still have been to delay transfer of any <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">interest</span> in the assets until payment in full of the lump sum; but to make dismissal of any <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">claim against</span> those assets immediate (see recital (C) ) and not &#8220;as and when&#8221;.</p>

First, she points out that apart from some interest in the Kashmir land (the subject of paragraph 5(b) of the order itself) the wife did not in fact have any interest in any of the assets listed in paragraph 5(a).    She submits that paragraph 5 was poorly drafted.   It was intended to reflect the &#8220;as and when passage&#8221; in the judgment, and accidentally failed to do so.    She says that, apart from the language of the order itself, there is no evidence and nothing in any of the recorded remarks of Mr Justice Bodey after judgment on the Friday, nor in his judgment on the Monday, to indicate that he intended to narrow the width and scope of what he had said in the as and when passage; and that there is no reason why he should have decided, wanted or intended to do so.  He knew that enforcement would be difficult and that is fortified by the further orders he decided to make on the Monday, attacking the jewellery.    He was not nailing his colours to that mast alone, but merely making that the first line of attack.   If there is &#8220;disjunction&#8221; between the as and when passage in the judgment and the order itself, it should be resolved by construing the order, absent any express dismissal, as reflecting the as and when passage.    </p>

She argues that there is obvious and deliberate contrast between the treatment of the wife&#8217;s claims and those of the husband.  Dismissal of all his ancillary relief claims in paragraph 7 is express, immediate and deliberate.   The disentitlement of the husband to apply under the Inheritance Act in paragraph 8 is immediate.   By contrast, there is no express or immediate dismissal of the wife&#8217;s claims and her disentitlement under the Inheritance Act is, by paragraph 9, &#8220;upon payment in full of the lump sum..&#8221;  <marker name="tab"/>I agree with Mr Howard that the language of paragraph 9 is not determinative or even a pointer as to construction of the capital parts of the order.    It is merely a conventional tie-in with the language of paragraph 2, which kept maintenance (but does not deal with capital) claims alive until payment in full.   </p>

First, he submitted that if I were to hold that there is still a power to make a variation of settlement and then to exercise that power, it would not have the effect of setting aside the lump sum order already made by paragraph 1; and that there is now no power to set aside that order (it not being an order for payment of a lump sum by instalments).    So he submitted that if a variation of settlement order is now made, the husband would be affected by not one, but two, orders and the wife could, at least theoretically, recover twice over and Mr Justice Bodey could not have intended that.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already given my reasons why I consider Mr Justice Bodey did not actually exercise the power.   My reasons for considering and holding that Mr Justice Bodey did not intend to, and did not in law &#8220;decline to exercise&#8221; the variation of settlement power, and did not make a once-and-for-all order as to capital, are that I must look at the events of 10 and 13 December as a whole.  The &#8220;as and when&#8221; passage is clear and deliberate and makes good sense when enforcement difficulties were already forecast.    There is nothing outside the four corners of the formal order itself to indicate that Mr Justice Bodey resiled from that position and intention, and no reason why he should have done so.   Selection of the charges (paragraph 14) and sale of the jewellery (paragraph 15) as the primary methods of enforcement in no way precludes the as and when basis as a fall back.  There is a lacuna or ambiguity within the four corners of the order in that recital  basis (C ) is not, as I would expect, reflected in, or given effect to by, an express dismissal.  There are repeated references to &#8220;upon payment in full of the lump sum&#8221; which suggest no closing down of all possible powers until it has been paid.   It seems to me that the language selected in paragraph 5, with its references only to &#8220;interest in&#8221;, is more likely to reflect a poorly drafted attempt to express the &#8220;as and when basis&#8221; in the judgment, than a deliberate choice to restrict the scope of the as and when basis to any interest in the assets and not also to keep it extended to any claim against the assets.   It seems to me that the most likely explanation of the &#8220;disjunction&#8221; is that counsel did not have the judgment in written form when they drafted the order (it was delivered orally and would not by then have been transcribed) and failed to recall, and accidentally omitted to record in the draft order, the breadth of the language deliberately used by the judge in the as and when passage in his judgment.   Although, as I have assumed, and am sure, Mr Justice Bodey will have read the draft order with care, there is a difference in practice between actually being the author or draftsman of an order, and checking one to see if it reflects one&#8217;s intention.   It seems to me most likely that Mr Justice Bodey accidentally thought that paragraph 5 dealt fully and faithfully with his &#8220;as and when basis&#8221; and that it is only under the later spot light of these applications that the disjunction appears. </p>

This, in my view, makes it strictly unnecessary for me to consider application 4 under the slip rule, which is designed merely to make more express that which I have now held.  Further, if, conversely, the order does not bear the construction which I have reached, then the effect of any order under the slip rule would indeed be to give effect to second thoughts.   I stress only that in my consideration of construction or &#8220;the Dinch point&#8221; I have focused very much on events on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>and 13 December, up to the making of the order itself.   I have, I hope, been very careful not to allow later or second thoughts to intrude.  Rather, I have placed considerable weight on the &#8220;as and when passage&#8221; as being the first thoughts from which, before the making of the order itself, the judge did not resile.</p>

In the period since December 1999, the lump sum has remained fixed.

Even if, as I have now held, Mr Justice Bodey deliberately left open the possibility of a later order varying the settlement, the December 1999 order was, in the words of Mr Howard, &#8220;meant to bring finality&#8221;.    He submits that even if, as I have now held, there may be a further property adjustment order against different property at a later date, such a course is very rare and should not be done by way of &#8220;enforcement&#8221;, rather than to meet a legitimate need for a further substantive order, for example, later serious ill health or some such change in circumstances.  <marker name="tab"/>He submits that, at the very latest, the application to vary the settlement should have been made soon after the hearing in October 2000, when paragraph 15 and the direct route of enforcement against the jewellery was set aside.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I bear this overall point firmly in mind.  But there is no rule of law that there cannot be a later order by way of &#8220;enforcement&#8221; and the very fact that orders are routinely made which express dismissal only from the date that a lump sum is paid in full, shows that a further capital order by way of &#8220;enforcement&#8221; is contemplated both by lawyers who draft, and judges who make, such orders.   The fact of the seven year delay is entirely at the door of the husband.    The delay would weigh heavily with me if, during the seven years, the wife had been inactive and had not sought to enforce her order and only now resurrected it.  But that is not the scenario of this case.    I would also be influenced if, at any stage in the seven years, the husband had made any realistic attempt to pay.    By his application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the principle order, he argued that the lump sum should have been not 4.8 million pounds but 3 million pounds.   He has not even paid, or offered to pay, that sum.  <marker name="tab"/>The order made on 21 December 2000, now at bundle B page 158, records that he stated in court through his leading counsel (viz Mr Howard QC) that he would, by 28 February 2001, make proposals for payment of the lump sum.    His solicitors&#8217; letter sent at the last moment on 27 February 2001, now at bundle H337, says that he does not make any proposal at all.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Next, Mr Howard submits that any order which I may make will not of itself produce any money for the wife, but will merely open the door to the prospect of further litigation in Jersey, where the trust is situated, and possibly further proceedings in Hong Kong and/or Bermuda, to extract capital from, and/or for the liquidation of, the companies which are situated there (21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings is incorporated in Bermuda; a main part of the business still takes place in Hong Kong through subsidiary companies incorporated there).   This ties in with a related submission that, precisely because the costs are so enormous already, I should firmly draw a line now, and not permit, let alone encourage or promote, inevitable yet further litigation.   All this seems tantamount to a licence to a man ruthlessly and contumaciously to refuse even to attempt to obey an order and then to raise costs as a bar to enforcement.   Further, there is in any event the prospect of further litigation in Bermuda where Mr Wani is pursuing current proceedings, number 2002:No.473, claiming his alleged 45% interest in 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century Holdings Ltd.   The pleaded position of the husband in those proceedings is one of neutrality, neither denying nor admitting Mr Wani&#8217;s claim.   The effective defendant and target of the proceedings is, no doubt, the wife, who is doing her best to defend them there.   Finally, on this point, when I asked him what remedy he suggests the wife alternatively could, and should, take to enforce payment of her due, Mr Howard said &#8220;go against the husband&#8217;s loan account with 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Century in Bermuda&#8221;.

Mr Howard says that underlyingly  there is no liquidity and no assets in the whole empire other than the stock, and that on any forced sale basis the amount realisable from the stock would be relatively low.    The stock held within the Hong Kong company, Dianoor International Ltd, alone is shown within the balance sheet of that company for the year ending 31 March 2006 as worth the equivalent of about 13.6 million pounds.    The most recently produced accounts (viz for 2005) for the trading companies indicate balance sheet assets within the trading companies as a whole of around four million pounds <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> provision to the husband of the whole of the sum of about nineteen million pounds (US dollars 36 million), shown in the accounts as owed to him but of which the husband undertook in 1997 not to seek repayment until the company &#8220;is financially capable to do&#8221;.

Further, in 1999, and repeatedly since then, judges have been satisfied that the husband had the means to pay this order and I remain so satisfied.   He claims that he has funded his costs by further borrowings. I do not believe that, but if he can borrow to pay lawyers, I see no reason why he could not have borrowed to pay his wife.   In recent years he has given to his sister the half share which he owned in a flat in Bombay.  He has paid about &#163;40,000 to the other lady, Miss KS.   The company, Checkers Ltd, in Hong Kong has sold the former matrimonial home and, as a minimum, the net proceeds of sale were available as a liquid sum.   The husband continues to indulge in expensive holidays (he says financed by his father).   There is money available when he wants it for everyone, bar the wife.    He is even proposing to embark on further litigation in the European Court of Human Rights, against the government of the United Kingdom (this arises out of the terms of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hadkinson</span> order made by Mr Justice Bodey last May), and presumably, to commit himself to yet further costs in doing so; not to mention the costs of the litigation he is currently pursuing against his own children in Kashmir.   </p>

Assuming scenario 1 does broadly continue to have application, much depends upon the domicile of either or both these parties whose domicile of origin is clearly Indian and neither of whom have taken the step of applying to be British citizens.

So far as the husband is concerned, any adverse tax consequences for himself flow from his failure to pay the lump sum, which he could still pay so as to obviate direct recourse against the trust.

Some of them (e.g the standard of living enjoyed before the breakdown, and the duration of the marriage) have not changed.  The needs of the wife certainly have not decreased.  In truth, they have increased, in part because of escalating house prices.   Her contribution to the welfare of the family has not decreased.  Arguably, it has increased by having to support the children through the seven years of, as Salem and Noor described in their letter, &#8220;great financial hardship&#8230; shame and humiliation.&#8221;</p>

The trust in this case is not at all like the B Trust in the case which Sir Philip Bailhache was considering.    In reality, it always has been, and remains, the alter ego of the husband himself, interposed only (on his own evidence and case) as a means of avoiding tax and ultimately enabling orderly succession.

For this, I apologise.    Nevertheless, I have restricted myself to the evidence and arguments actually presented to me and citation of only a small selection of the many authorities cited to me.
