	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court's task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

Family judges deal with increasingly difficult child cases and are much assisted in their decision-making process by professionals from other disciplines: medical, wider mental health and social work among others. The courts pay particular attention to the valuable contribution from paediatricians and child psychiatrists as well as others, but it is important to remember that the decision is that of the judge and not of the professional expert. Judges are well accustomed to assessing the conflicting evidence of experts. As Ward LJ said, judges are not expected to suspend judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert. An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption or belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this judge did. A judge cannot substitute his views for the views of the experts without some evidence to support what it is he concludes.</span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

I do not find that is any explanation at all for the denials in a statement MB prepared for the court for the purpose of a case considering the welfare of her child in which these specific allegations were made and she was required to address them.</p>

Notwithstanding its importance there was no mention of how she found the book in any of MB&#8217;s filed documents and she did not avail herself of the opportunity to file a second witness statement.

She many have been influenced by some of her friends. One in particular friend asks her inappropriate questions such as about my relationship with my wife. CA has also on occasion talked about a friend of hers in foster care who has a lot of freedom and I feel this has given CA the impression that a child can do what they want whilst in foster care.

Whilst that is possible it is not likely. Further, I found her oral evidence on the point convincing. She said she only read books from school and she would have run the risk of someone checking if it was in the school library.

Save for the involvement of the stepmother the allegations CA makes differ: in this case the abuse is alleged to have been perpetrated by the stepmother (MB) and the nature of the abuse differs in that the Step Child refers to the child masturbating the adult male perpetrator whereas in this case the allegation is of CA being forced to perform oral sex on MB.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">When Dr Rahman gave evidence he was asked about this report. He said that the life span of a bruise is 1-2 weeks so &#8220;to last 3 weeks and be visible as described would be unlikely&#8221; although later he accepted &#8220;bruises resolve at different rates and in different ways&#8221; but &#8220;the description is of a blue tender bruise which makes a difference, if it was just the colour I would struggle to give an answer but tenderness suggests it was 1-2 days old&#8221;. In other words CA&#8217;s report of it being caused by MB or F is not consistent with her having been removed from their care on 28 February 2 weeks prior to the SARC examination on 13 March 2023. That would be consistent with the CP medical report of 1 March 2023 which does not identify the knee bruise and expressly reports CA saying &#8220;Does not have any bruises currently&#8221; [F235]. Dr Lomp&#8217;s statement dated 23 November 2023 confirms that &#8220;there was no injury to the left or right knee visible at the time of examination&#8221;.</p>

CA said she did not do anything wrong but got the blame as the male Teacher did not like her. I spoke to the Headteacher about this as I was concerned that she was being treated unfavourably. I was then told that CA was dishonest about her involvement and kept information to herself, so her friend did not get into trouble.

The chronology is important: the consultation with Dr Cheng was on the afternoon of 5 January 2020, the police attended the family home that evening and according to their log spoke first to F to whom &#8220;it was explained&#8230;that someone had overheard a comment stating that CA would be hurt and abused later&#8221; [L42], then to CA (who had been in bed) and then to F to whom they spoke &#8220;at length&#8230;about concerns raised today but did not go into great detail with him&#8221; [L42].</p>

She thought that F had been told of them when the police visited on the day of the report to Dr Cheng. That is consistent with F&#8217;s oral evidence which was to the effect that the police had told him CA reported &#8220;bruises on your hand and you were locked up in the room&#8221;.</p>

She was asked if she tried to &#8220;listen in&#8221; and said it was &#8220;not something I was interested in&#8221;. I find that entirely incredible given she had been told by F that CA should not have been left alone.

That does not mean that CA did not <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">think</span> he would be able to hear.

The implication of this was that she felt let down by not being removed initially so did not want to take the risk with repeating the allegation given the threats by her father. She said he had threatened to kill her and she reported that to the DSL on 27 February 2023 although it is not documented. I note that by the time CA saw the social worker there would have been time for F to have threatened her and he would, on his own account, have been aware of the allegations CA had made. F suggested in closing that there was an inconsistency between this evidence and what CA said to the social worker reported at [F59] which is that MB was &#8220;kind, caring and they have a close relationship&#8221;. That, it is said, went further than simply denying the allegations. It does but is not inconsistent with CA&#8217;s explanation of why she did not report the allegations to the social worker, exaggerating how good the relationship with MB was to undo the allegation that had been made against her is an entirely plausible response for someone who would &#8220;have to still go home&#8221; to somewhere CA felt at risk of harm if she repeated the allegations.</p>

It was put to her that was the reason for fabricating this allegation and she said &#8220;It was to escape abusive household, maybe it was just about her because I was cross with her but I didn&#8217;t make them up&#8221;. I found this answer quite candid, she accepted some motivation to complain about MB but stuck to her guns that the allegation was true. I also note that on MB&#8217;s oral evidence all that happened to provoke what she characterises as lies to Dr Cheng was MB was saying &#8220;we are going to lose the appointment if we go [to get something to eat]&#8230;she kept getting annoyed and frustrated so I said if you don&#8217;t stop I will tell F you don&#8217;t want to wait for appointment&#8221; and she indicated that she did not speak in a raised voice. I find it lacks credibility that mild rebuke would provoke CA to fabricate the allegations against MB made to Dr Cheng; I accept she lied about a lock on the door but she gave a credible explanation for that.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">F also remined me of the ABE guidance about leading questions (2022 edition paragraphs 3.69 and F2.4) although I also note that paragraph 3.51 advises interviewers to move from open to specific closed, forced choice and leading questions in that order. Dr Cheng&#8217;s oral evidence was that &#8220;I try whenever I see a patient we ask open questions and then go into specifics, I try to keep it as open as possible&#8221; and later &#8220;I would have asked a mixture of open and closed questions&#8221;. I accept that there is a risk that leading questions may have influenced CA&#8217;s responses to Dr Cheng and without the questions it is impossible to form a clear view of that. However, I find it difficult to accept that CA would have been prompted to make up these allegations, unrelated to the incident alleged in reception, because of the nature of the questions and a mild rebuke in the manner described by MB or because CA wanted to &#8220;go into town&#8221;.</p>

I also bear in mind that CA gave a believable explanation for having lied about MB locking her in her room. It is plain that on a cursory view of the home that allegation would not have been substantiated and CA would have known that; it is consistent with a cry for help and wanting to prompt removal. Having not been removed I can well imagine an 11 year old fearing worse repercussions if she persisted in the allegations.</p>

I do not consider this a material inconsistency in the circumstances. There was also an inconsistency between the SARC report referring to the left ear and the other references to right cheek or ear. It is not clear where the author of the SARC report got the information about the side from, it is not entirely clear it was from CA herself so conceivably there could have been a mistake by the author when reading the referral. There is also an inconsistency between the police log entry for the PIA which refers to &#8220;left ear&#8221; but the PIA note does not record which side. The police log entry is the day after and the best evidence is the contemporaneous note of the PIA. In closing submissions F also relied on a potential inconsistency between the police log recording a fall off the bed as a result of the slap whereas the DSL reported that &#8220;she took herself away to her room&#8221;, it is not clear if that is inconsistent if CA was in a different bedroom when the alleged assault occurred. However there is a more significant inconsistency between the police log recoding the assault in a bedroom and the VRI recording it was in the living room. Again, the PIA notes are a contemporaneous record and the PIA refers to a table not a bedside table.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">Dr Rahman was asked about the allegation and said that if a grown man used the degree of force described in the VRI then &#8220;very likely&#8221; you would expect a sign of that at the CP medical on 1 March 2023; that would be 2 days later and &#8220;the description would have caused bruising and bruises take 1-2 weeks to resolve&#8221;. He also said it would be &#8220;very likely&#8221; to be visible at school unless she was covering her face completely. In answer to questions by the Guardian he agreed that the type of injury was dependent on the level of force used and he was taken to CA&#8217;s comment that only a red mark was left and he agreed that was &#8220;possible&#8221; but the likelihood of leaving a red mark and of it disappearing was smaller and the colour of CA&#8217;s skin may have made a difference to visibility but &#8220;the description of what she says makes me think she would have sustained a bruise&#8221; i.e. more than just a red mark of limited duration. There is inherent difficulty in this evidence. First, CA was recalling the force in the VRI some months after the alleged incident, second, CA&#8217;s description is vague, she initially said she flew back then that she barged into a table and I note her hand movement demonstrating the slap as more of a flap (VRI at 13:53:23), third the perception of the victim of the force of a blow is very likely to be conditioned by the surrounding circumstances and expectations of injury and an unreliable guide to force. Although CA said that it was the force of the blow that pushed her back to barge into the table (in her oral evidence) it is at least conceivable some of the momentum backwards was her instinctively seeking to avoid the blow or retreat from F&#8217;s wagging finger that preceded it.</p>

I was in shock and did not know what to do, but ask CA to explain. I then took CA to the car to speak to her alone. CA told me that this is normal behaviour. CA initially said the male in the images was her friend's boyfriend and then said it was someone she met online and who lives in Wales. I did not know what to say to this, so we then went back in the house. I wanted time to think about how to manage this.

CA&#8217;s inconsistencies may be the result of inaccurate reporting by others or mis-remembering by her as a result of the passage of time. In particular my findings against F on Allegations 1-4 demonstrate a person prepared to resort to physical violence when angered. On F&#8217;s case MB had taken back a previously confiscated phone, was using it to communicate inappropriately with a male and had alleged an act of sexual abuse against MB which may well have provoked an angry response. On that basis I find the allegation proved on the balance of probabilities:</p>

The photo seems to be dated 19 January 2023, the MARF of 27 February 2023 says it was 2 weeks ago, in the SARC report on 13 March 2023 it was January, in the VRI on 21 July 2023 it was January. In cross-examination CA said it was 27 or 28 February 2023. Given the date on the photo is consistent with the date given in the SARC report on balance, if there was an incident, it was likely to have been then. Of course CA&#8217;s uncertainty may go to the credibility of her report, particularly the report of the incident being &#8220;2 weeks ago&#8221; on 27 February 2023.</p>

I asked if it was possible for an injury to the top of the head to result from a combination of extending the neck and the back, arching backwards. He agreed it was possible but the likelihood was &#8220;small&#8221; in a scenario where the parent was pulling the child backwards. He clarified that if the child was falling (i.e. slipped and fell) then that would make a difference although he later said &#8220;if she was bending backwards and falls then small possibility if hit a sharp edge but more likely if falling it&#8217;s the back of the head that would get injures&#8221;.

He felt it was the sort of injury that he would have expected a parent to seek medical attention for. The fact that F and MB did not means either (1) they were aware of it but were neglectful, (2) were aware of it and knew they had caused it and wanted to conceal it or (3) were unaware of it. If they were unaware of it that might have been because CA wanted to conceal it although if what CA says about the extent of the injury is correct it seems unlikely to be possible to do so effectively, if it was an entirely innocent injury she would have wished them to know so it could be attended to. There is no evidence to suggest it being caused any way apart from that which CA asserts. Whilst it is not for MB and F to prove something else caused the injury I am entitled to take into account the absence of any evidence of an alternative cause.</p>

I was at work on this date. CA was at school and did not return home on this date. This is when CA made this allegation. On 25 February 2023, I was working. It was a Saturday. My wife called to ask me to come home as CA was arguing with her. I came home from work and MB told me that CA has been using her phone. CA knew she was not allowed to use her phone, as in the past she has been using the phone for adult contents. CA then made an allegation of sexual abuse against my wife. I have no knowledge of where the physical abuse incident came from. CA has never informed me of any physical abuse. I cannot understand the reason CA would make such serious allegations about my wife and I, apart from believing this is due to me taking her phone.</p>

It is also instructive to note that there was a delay in reporting the incident notwithstanding the photographic evidence. If the allegation was fabricated it would have taken a good deal of pre-meditation on the part of CA to have photographed an injury in mid-January to save to support an allegation made over a month later. I do accept there is an alternative explanation that the photo may have been taken for another purpose (counsel for F suggested perhaps to post on social media) and then applied later to a false allegation of abuse, i.e. CA photographed a non-abusive injury and later decided to fabricate her allegation based on the photo.</p>

Choosing not to tell MB and F about it seems unlikely if it was caused innocently and there is no evidence of it being caused in some way other than CA alleges. The mechanism of injury is consistent on Dr Rahman&#8217;s evidence and CA&#8217;s oral evidence. Against that there are conflicting accounts of the precipitating event but I note that memory is fluid and malleable, discrepancies may arise over time because of &#8220;faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress&#8221; and on CA&#8217;s evidence this was plainly a time of heightened stress. On balance I prefer CA&#8217;s evidence when I weigh it against MB&#8217;s outright denial and F&#8217;s apparent lack of interest in the surrounding circumstances.

With one exception in the evidence above MB and F may have genuinely believed CA was lying and there is evidence of her in fact having lied (about the lock on her door for instance and to protect herself). The one exception is the report of F saying CA was lying about the sexual abuse but there is no evidence F had any direct knowledge of it and I can well imagine him wanting it to be untrue and believing any denial by MB so, again, there is no evidence this was abusive by F. The same is true of two of the three examples of F saying CA was a disgrace.</p>

Taking account my comments above about books and TV it is really limited to an allegation of restricting CA&#8217;s friendships, not using MB&#8217;s milk and bread and MB telling CA she had ruined her marriage or life. In relation to the food I found CA&#8217;s evidence confused and unclear, it seemed to amount to a deprivation of food for short periods as discipline and a restriction in use of some of MB&#8217;s food. I do not find this limited evidence is sufficient to prove &#8220;abusive and demeaning behaviour&#8221;. As to the evidence of MB saying CA had ruined things similarly to verbal abuse it is hard to see this crosses the line from words spoken in anger to abusive behaviour.
