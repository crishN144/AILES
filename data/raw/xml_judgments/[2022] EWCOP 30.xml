	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.57in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The challenging issue for the court to determine in this case is whether it is in the best interests of a vulnerable 36 year old woman, FP, who lacks capacity to make decisions about residence, care, and contact with others, to be deprived of direct contact with her mother, RT, with whom she wants to have contact, for a period of at least five months. RT&#8217;s behaviour forms the basis of the Local Authority&#8217;s application to prohibit contact with her daughter for a long interim period, and her behaviour as an unrepresented party made it very difficult to manage the hearing of the application before this court. RT showed no respect for the authority of the court and no appreciation of the need to ensure a fair hearing for all concerned. Her husband, FP&#8217;s stepfather ST, wrote to the court ahead of the hearing to say that he wished not to participate. The Local Authority was represented by Mr Garlick and FP, through her Litigation Friend, by Mr O&#8217;Brien QC. Both Counsel, and the Litigation Friend, have had a long involvement in this case.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.57in"><span style="font-size:12pt">FP was born and brought up in Russia until the age of 12 when she moved with her mother to the United Kingdom. RT then married ST. A few years ago the family settled in the area for which the applicant Local Authority, SCC, is the relevant social services authority under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/23" uk:canonical="2014 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Act 2014</ref>. As a child, FP was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has a history of seizures, now controlled by medication, and mobility problems necessitating, now, the use of leg splints, a walking frame, and, for longer distances, a wheelchair. In 2011, FP contracted meningitis which resulted in a deterioration in her mental health ultimately leading to hospital admissions under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>) in 2017. She has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, experiencing auditory hallucinations including that people were going to kill her and to harvest her internal organs. On discharge from hospital in October 2017, FP was cared for at placement 1. In January 2020, FP was admitted to hospital as a voluntary patient but in February 2020 she was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>. That detention was discharged on 2 June 2020 but her health deteriorated once more and she was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> again on 8 July 2020, remaining subject to detention until 15 December 2021 when she was made subject to a Community Treatment Order. At some point plans were considered to place FP at placement 2 but they were not pursued. Since 10 November 2021 FP has been living at her current care home, placement 3. FP&#8217;s schizophrenia has been resistant to treatment. She requires care 24 hours a day. She continues to suffer from delusions and will have episodes of screaming.</span></p>

She had the benefit of five reports from Dr Ince, Consultant Psychiatrist. Given that HHJ Moir has already provided a detailed history and analysis of the medical evidence and capacity, I need not repeat those in this judgment. In short, HHJ Moir:</span></p>

Telephone contact twice a week was to be on loudspeaker and was also to be supervised by a staff member at placement 3. RT was not to instigate discussions on certain topics such as FP&#8217;s medication. She extended the injunctions against RT and ST and ordered SCC to monitor the impact on FP of the reduced contact arrangements.

She told me that the reasons she would not attend court were that she would be abducted if she attended, that the court was not a safe place for her, and that her husband needed her care. Given the desirability of RT participating in the hearing and her refusal to attend court in person, I allowed her to participate remotely. A Russian interpreter had been arranged to assist RT but at no point in the hearing was the interpreter required save when RT made the affirmation prior to giving evidence when, oddly, the interpreter repeated the words of the affirmation in English to RT who then spoke them herself.</span></p>

Her entire focus was on challenging the decisions on capacity that had been made previously by the court but she has not appealed those decisions, which were made over 20 months ago. At the time of those decisions RT had the benefit of legal representation and, as she made clear, she considered the issue of appeal with her legal representative after the judgment was handed down. I therefore proceed on the basis of the findings made by HHJ Moir. Nevertheless, capacity is time specific and an individual may regain capacity. Dr Ince, Consultant Psychiatrist, advised the court previously that FP was unlikely to regain capacity so long as she continued to lack insight into her condition. FP continues to suffer from the same condition which caused her to lack capacity on the findings of HHJ Moir in October 2020 and she remains sure that she does not have schizophrenia. Hence, Dr Ince&#8217;s views remain highly pertinent. Therefore, I invited LP to direct the court to any evidence that might suggest that FP may have regained capacity. RT was unable to point to any grounds for suspecting that her daughter&#8217;s condition had changed such that she may have regained capacity. Indeed, in her witness statements, affidavit and several written communications to the court preceding the hearing, RT&#8217;s case was that FP was deteriorating because of failings and neglect at her placement. I have reviewed the evidence provided to me about FP&#8217;s condition since the determinations by HHJ Moir. Contrary to RT&#8217;s assertions, the evidence suggests a general improvement in FP&#8217;s mood, sleep, eating, and self-care. However, there is no evidence of any material change in FP&#8217;s ability to understand, retain, weigh and use information relevant to the decisions. She has been reviewed by Dr Keown, Consultant Psychiatrist in March 2021, and by Dr Harrington on 17 November 2021, who assessed FP as lacking capacity to make decisions about her residence. I have a number of recent records about FP&#8217;s condition from placement 3. I bear in mind the principles and provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> in relation to the issue of capacity, not least that there is a presumption that FP has capacity unless the contrary is established. More than once during the hearing RT appeared to imply that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> states that &#8220;unwise decisions are allowed&#8221;. What the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> provides at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> is that &#8220;a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">merely because </span><span style="font-size:12pt">he makes an unwise decision&#8221; (emphasis added). As I indicated early during the hearing, I can find no grounds on which to consider setting aside the determinations of capacity made by HHJ Moir. I can find no justification for directing that further assessments of FP&#8217;s capacity be conducted. I am satisfied to the civil standard of proof that FP continues to lack capacity in relation to the conduct of this litigation and decisions concerning residence, care, and contact with others.</span></p>

The most recent such determination was on 3 March 2022 when HHJ Moir ordered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.16</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> that FP reside at placement 3 receiving care and support there in accordance with the care and support plan of 9 February 2022. RT&#8217;s alternative proposal was that FP should live with her and ST at home. She mentioned, in passing, the alternative possibility of FP renting a house near to RT and ST&#8217;s home. Neither plan had been aired in advance of the hearing, no details for how care would be provided at those homes were given. It is also clear that if FP were in RT&#8217;s care, RT would not administer the currently prescribed medication to FP because she believes that it is harmful to her daughter. Placement 3 has recently acquired an &#8220;outstanding&#8221; rating from the Care Quality Commission and is a placement capable of meeting FP&#8217;s very complex needs. HHJ Moir had previously declared it to be contrary to FP&#8217;s best interests to live at her mother and step- father&#8217;s home and that declaration has not been appealed. Again, there has been no material change in circumstances since the last hearing and I can find no grounds on which to re-open the issue of residence. On the evidence before me it clearly remains in FP&#8217;s best interests to reside at placement 3.</span></p>

She frankly accepted that this has been the most difficult case she has had to deal with in her 15 years or so as a social worker - not due to FP&#8217;s complex needs, but due to the behaviour of RT. In common with most professionals who have had a significant role in seeking to protect FP&#8217;s welfare, RT has complained about H to her professional regulating body. H has had to spend a great deal of time dealing with the complaint. I am satisfied that H&#8217;s evidence was not influenced by that complaint. Nevertheless, the pressure on those caring for FP caused by RT&#8217;s constant complaints, accusations, and challenges is waring and distracts them from their work in trying to support FP. Placement 1 gave notice in part because of RT&#8217;s conduct. A contact supervision service likewise gave notice. H advised the court that it would be very difficult to find another suitable placement in the same region for FP were Placement 3 to give notice.</span></p>

However, many indirect contact sessions have to be cut short because RT begins to tell FP that she is being abused, is on the wrong medication, is being neglected, or should complain about her treatment. This is not only in contravention of court injunctive orders, but also detrimental to FP&#8217;s sense of stability and safety. FP has paranoid schizophrenia and RT&#8217;s communications with her at most contact sessions tend to cause destabilisation and fear of being unsafe.

FP will defer to her mother and adopt her views which are expressed very strongly and repeatedly. Through contact, FP receives constant messages from her mother that she is being mistreated and neglected at the placement, that she should not take her medication because it is harmful to her, that she needs to be seen by doctors to stop her medication, and that she needs police protection from those caring for her. This constant barrage not only serves to undermine FP&#8217;s sense of safety and stability, and her relations with carers and social workers, but also adversely impacts on her ability to make choices for herself.</span></p>

She believes that FP has been misdiagnosed and, as a result, she is being given medication she does not need and that is harmful to her. She believes that the harm caused to her daughter is being ignored by the court, by the Local Authority, and by care staff at the placement. These views are deeply entrenched She has repeatedly made those beliefs known to the placement, the Local Authority, the court, the police, the CQC, and other regulators. She refers to FP being &#8220;tortured&#8221; and &#8220;abused&#8221;. In her oral evidence, RT confirmed that in her belief medical professionals and the Local Authority have conspired over many months deliberately to give FP the wrong medication to cause her harm. When she has been asked why they would do that she has previously responded, &#8220;because they can&#8221;, but at this hearing she said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Ask them.&#8221; It is quite clear to me, having experienced RT&#8217;s conduct during the hearing, having read several documents she has prepared, and considering the evidence in the bundle, that she will not change her views and believes that anyone who does not share her views is deliberately ignoring the facts and is possibly corrupt. Her unshakable belief that her daughter would not be ill were it not for the medication, means that whenever FP has delusions or feels unwell due to what psychiatrists believe is her schizophrenia, RT thinks that her daughter is suffering due to the medication. This is a fixed view and there is no foreseeable prospect of it changing.</span></p>

A number of different psychiatrists have been involved in FP&#8217;s care over recent years. The diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, resistant to treatment, is well established. Dr Ince, who was not involved in FP&#8217;s care or management, carefully reviewed FP&#8217;s condition in his five reports as an expert witness. He confirmed FP&#8217;s long-standing history of complex delusional beliefs and the diagnoses over time of psychosis, non-organic psychosis and paranoid schizophrenia. In his view there was &#8220;clear evidence&#8221; that FP suffers from schizophrenia. It is difficult to discern the origin of RT&#8217;s beliefs that her daughter does not have a mental health condition but is being deliberately harmed by a conspiracy of professionals. In cross-examination by Mr Garlick, RT appeared to suggest that for a period of about two weeks in May 2020 FP was well but that subsequent medication given to her, Clonazepam, a Benzodiazepine, had caused her to deteriorate. In fact, records from that month show that there was no period when FP was &#8220;better&#8221;. Her condition can rapidly wax and wane so that she has good days and bad days. Sometimes she might have a few good days in succession but, sadly, her condition has been resistant to treatment and has been persistent. Clonazepam is not one of FP&#8217;s current medications. RT has not adduced any evidence at all that the medications prescribed to her daughter have been the wrong medications, or that the combination of medications is liable to have caused her harm. Medical professionals from different centres and teams have been involved in her care and the management of her medication over the past few years. Her medication has been adjusted from time to time, but none of the practitioners have raised an alarm about the medications prescribed. FP is under regular review by suitably qualified healthcare professionals. There is not a shred of evidence of torture or mistreatment of FP by her carers, healthcare professionals, social workers or others. There is no evidence before the court on which I could possibly hold that FP is being harmed by her medication. What RT takes to be medically induced harms are the effects of FP&#8217;s mental health condition.</span></p>

It is difficult adequately to describe her conduct over a remote link in court. Most of her communications during the hearing were shouted. Indeed, I struggle to remember any time when she was not speaking in a raised voice and remonstrating with me or the other participants. She did not swear but she was dismissively rude to the witness H, to Counsel, and to me. She spoke over others throughout the hearing. She repeated her views about the harm being caused to her daughter and the court&#8217;s inadequacies very many times and in forceful terms. She was insistent on completing repeated, long tirades about the injustices being perpetrated against her and her daughter. The evidence within the bundle shows that this was not atypical behaviour by RT caused by the stress of appearing in court, but rather that it was entirely consistent with her contacts with professionals and others involved in FP&#8217;s care.</span></p>

On viewing the recordings, a pattern emerges in which typically, but not always, RT states to FP that she is being abused or that her medication is making her ill, manipulates FP into agreeing and then says, for the purpose of the recording, that FP is complaining of the matters which RT herself has stated earlier in the conversation. Given the number of recordings submitted to the court and their dates, there must have been periods over which RT recorded every telephone contact with her daughter and then posted the recordings on social media.</span></p>

She has demonstrated repeatedly, including at the hearing before me, that she has no respect at all for court orders she does not agree with. RT has failed to abide by any encouragement or orders to (i) restrain herself from sharing her beliefs about FP&#8217;s treatment with FP; (ii) desist from posting recordings of FP and members of her care team on YouTube without their consent. She admits to conduct that amounts to repeated breaches of those orders because she disagrees with them and does not see why she should abide by them when she is justified, in her own mind, in making and posting the recordings. For over 18 months now the court has tried to manage RT&#8217;s contact with FP to avoid distress to FP. For example, orders have been made to restrict RT from expressing her views about FP&#8217;s medication when speaking to FP. RT is unable to restrain herself and she was unable to give me any reassurance that she would change her ways in the future. A note of a call between RT and FP in March 2022 provides one of many examples of how RT diverts conversations from positive things to her complaints:</span></p>

From the information provided to me, it appears that RT has complained to their respective regulators/official offices about the conduct of placement 3, doctors, nurses (including the CPN), social workers, barristers, the Local Authority, and a judge. No upheld complaints or sanctions have been brought to my attention. Indeed, RT&#8217;s constant grievance is that nobody is listening to her. It was apparent to me at the hearing that RT has no qualms about making career-threatening allegations against professionals on the mistaken basis that there is a conspiracy to harm her daughter. Recently, she has complained to the police about her daughter being abused at the placement. The police have sought this court&#8217;s authority for disclosure of FP&#8217;s medical records to allow them to investigate. H has had to give evidence to her regulator in answer to complaints against her by RT. These complaints have an adverse effect on those who are caring for FP.

Firstly, there is cumulative effect of telling FP she is being abused, that her medication is harming her, and that there is no other cause of her problems. FP&#8217;s confidence in her carers and placement will be further undermined, leading her to feel unsafe and insecure. Secondly, there is the risk of further acute distress following contact, as has occurred in the past. Thirdly, there is a risk that the placement will give notice. Placement 3 has not said that it has contemplated giving notice &#8211; indeed it has said that it will not let RT&#8217;s conduct prevent it caring for FP - but the barrage of hostile communications from RT does have a toll on staff and everyone has their breaking point. There might be a change of management or other personnel who will be less tolerant of the constant hostility from RT. Were FP to lose this placement, she would be plunged into uncertainty. It was said by H and in submissions, and I accept, that it would be unlikely to find a suitable placement for her, with her complex needs, in the region. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a placement willing to take her given the history of complaints by RT and the involvement of the Court of Protection. To lose her current, &#8220;outstanding&#8221; placement would be potentially very harmful to FP. Fourthly, there is a risk that the detrimental effects on FP of her mother&#8217;s hostility, her continuous undermining of those seeking to care for FP, and her influence on her daughter, could trigger a deterioration in FP&#8217;s mental health so as to require further detention under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>.

RT refused to attend court in person at the hearing before me because, she said, she feared being abducted. She is reluctant to attend at placement 3 for a similar reason. RT told the court that the Applicant Local Authority has attempted to abduct her in the past. I heard evidence from H about this supposed incident. The hospital at which FP was being treated arranged a taxi for RT to facilitate contact. The taxi driver called out the wrong address for RT when trying to pick her up. That is all. As a result of that error, RT now has a fixed belief that she is at risk of abduction.</span></p>

I am also aware of the importance of making all attempts to accommodate a parent&#8217;s concerns, to make proper inquiry, and to respond to them, and to make all reasonable attempts to maintain the contact between parent and child in the best interests of P. RT urged the court to &#8220;look into all this&#8221;. I asked her what that would involve and all she could say was that all the doctors should be brought before the court. It was unnecessary and would have been disproportionate for me to do so at this hearing (and no such application had been made prior to the hearing).

However, had she been free to do so, she may well have taken a rational view of her condition and treatment and wanted to have evidence-based, conventional treatment and to remain under care arrangements that were the best for her health. She may well have wanted to see her mother, but only if her mother was supportive of her and those doing their best to care for her.</span></p>

The review in December will consider whether they should be extended for a further period or whether face to face contact can be re-introduced and telephone contact increased, in particular over the Christmas period and at birthdays or other significant events.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.57in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is important, in my judgment, that I make it plain that having reviewed the evidence in this case, having regard to the detailed findings and judgment of HHJ Moir from October 2020, and having had the opportunity to view and hear RT at this hearing, RT is labouring under an irrational and unjustifiable belief that FP is a victim of a conspiracy of professionals to harm her. This belief is entrenched. I do not have the medical qualifications to speculate as to why RT labours under this erroneous belief or why it is so entrenched that no evidence of facts will change it. RT herself vehemently resists any suggestion that she might benefit from an assessment of her own mental health or personality. However, this belief is what causes her to make complaints against all manner of professionals who become involved in FP&#8217;s care and these proceedings. I am content to consider the release of this judgment, and the judgment of HHJ Moir to any regulatory body asked to investigate the conduct of such professionals.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.58in">In the circumstances I do not accede to the police application for disclosure of FP&#8217;s medical records. This is not a &#8220;cover up&#8221;, it is an exercise in protecting the privacy of FP and acting in her best interests. The fact that RT has made a complaint of abuse of her daughter does not justify the release of confidential records about FP because the evidence before me shows that the complaint irrational and unjustified. The application for disclosure is dismissed.</p>
