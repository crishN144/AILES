He described a child with an insecure avoidant attachment pattern  and significant levels of pseudo maturity which he felt as a result of being idealised by both parents and inappropriate levels of exposure to the adult themes of parental conflict and court processes, with an idealised relationship with his Father and a denigrated relationship with his Mother, he described  this as typical of &#8220;splitting&#8221;.  The reasons for his views of his Mother appeared to him to have little substance and he was also informed by the  child of his having seen court papers in which he said she had lied. He felt incidents like his passport being seized had not caused trauma and were occasions when a parent would soothe a child&#8217;s reaction rather than, as here, repeat and build on it. The complete denouncement of the other parent was very unusual and not on the evidence he was aware of justified. K&#8217;s views were not he said his own organic views but because of his Father's behaviour and what his Father  said. Reinforcing anxieties rather than alleviating them was clearly in his view not  proper parental care. He noted too how K was capable of being soothed by foster parents even when on occasion challenging, meaning his Father could have done this had he chosen to.</span></p>

He had told her about an incident when his sister had been self harming and the Father had thrown something at her which K justified  saying he &#8220;did the right thing.&#8221; She noted how the terms of the conversation with him mirrored the topics and content his Father had raised just the day before.  She had urged the Father to consider how you can disapprove of a person&#8217;s behaviour and not the person</span></p>

Their plans  include provision of therapy from a services called WRAP to support the Mother and child in their ongoing relationship and will involve if needed further systemic therapy.  Social services will continue to provide parenting support and advice to the Mother and will supervise the contact with Father and propose now , in alignment with the Guardians suggestions, it is once a fortnight.  They will enter into a clear written agreement about how this contact takes place. The father would like more than once each week to continue and would hope it might progress to be unsupervised and overnight.  </span></p>

For the reasons set out in some detail above I cannot accept his wishes and feelings at face value at this time.  in relation to spending time with his Father I am concerned at present about his Fathers capacity to be child centred in discussions with his son and consider supervision is currently necessary.  There remains a real risk his strong feelings otherwise would destabilise the child and this would cause serious harm given the steps it has taken to have him now in a settled place.</span></p>

It enables this relationship to continue while K settles into what is now his new home.  Any development is entirely dependent on the Father&#8217;s behaviour and thinking.  I really think the Father  would benefit from therapy.  It does not matter that he thinks it is the fault of others he has lost the care of his son but this in itself is a serious loss and I think an independent person to reflect on this would be helpful.  Anger can be very wearing to good health and this might help him with that.  I would hope too this might enable him to reflect on his proper responsibilities as a parent to both his children</span></p>

However the Father has confirmed to me that he will not either himself or encouraging others attempt to ascertain both the home and school address of his son ( or his daughter ) and will not contact his former wife or his son except through social services.  I consider if he does so he risks his contact with K ending , actually a far more serious threat to my mind than the police arresting him. I note the court has never determined the Mother's now historic claims about his behaviour and during these long proceedings he has never harassed pestered or threatened her in any way.  I am not satisfied there is a proper evidential basis to make this order and will reflect what the Father says in my order.</span></p>

He has agreed he will not ask K about this either in a direct way or in  a way to encourage that information to be shared.  Again were he to do this the case would likely come back quickly to court and I would be very concerned.</span></p>
