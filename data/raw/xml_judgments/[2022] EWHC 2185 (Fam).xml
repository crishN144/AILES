In the case of the latter, the local authority acts as his appointee and assists TT in the management of his finances. It provides him with a solid allowance from his income, over which he has control and the capacity to decide how it is expended. At present, he is not assessed as having capacity to decide where he lives. In the fullness of time, further assessments will be undertaken to ascertain the extent to which TT&#8217;s capacity or lack of capacity to decide where he lives is consequent upon his learning disability or is being impeded by undue influence and interference by his mother, ST.</span></p>

Those concerns continued to escalate, culminating in the local authority issuing the parallel applications which are before me now. Interim declarations as to TT&#8217;s lack of capacity to conduct these proceedings and to make decisions as to where he lives were made, and the case has been timetabled to a final hearing later this year, again before me.</span></p>

On other occasions, he has spoken in hushed tones, suggesting that he was concerned about being overheard.

It was, as I have said, a pleasure to meet him. TT&#8217;s speech and language can at times be a little hard to follow, but we spoke about the things he likes, and which were important to him. He likes the placement but would ideally like to be closer to home and his local community. He misses engaging with others of his own ethnicity. He enjoys seeing his girlfriend, usually two or three times per week and does not wish to be encumbered as to when he sees her. He enjoyed going to college, but the location of his placement meant that he was reliant upon public transport, a journey which at times feels very onerous. His companions in placement are </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;ok&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> but he misses opportunities to engage with others who do no not share their level of disability. He enjoys playing on his X box and would like to get another job. He was able to tell me a little about his income and what he pays towards his placement and said that his mother has asked for money for his board. He was somewhat preoccupied by an incident the night before, in which he alleged that he had been accused of taking money by ST (which he strenuously and repeatedly denied) and had thought of telephoning the police, but had not wanted to cause or possibly be, in any trouble.</span></p>

He would spend time going into town and looking in shops, which he appeared to like, but he wanted to have other activities in his day, as otherwise this was a waste of his time. It was not clear to me whether that was a genuine point of view or one which had been suggested to him, as he also indicated that this was a point of view his mother had expressed.

However, her evidence spoke volumes as to her fundamental belief that TT lacks capacity to decide all but the most basic things for himself. She is ever fearful for his safety in the community and in his intimate relationships. She is, I find, profoundly mistrustful of the local authority and the psychologists who have assessed TT repeatedly as having the capacity to make decisions around his care and support and who he spends time with. She is unswerving in her belief that only she knows TT and what is best for him and can keep him safe. She was invited to consider whether there was anything about her own behaviour that needed to change, but she did not.</span></p>

ST is unable to see that TT has any real autonomy in respect of many decisions around his life or that he deserves the opportunities, as the social worker put it, to be supported and assisted where possible, to exercise that autonomy. Rather, and no doubt driven by her own assessment of what TT needs and is capable of, ST continues to frustrate those opportunities.  Sadly, given the findings of HHJ Moir in 2019, the mother has not moved on from that viewpoint in any material way. </span></p>

I am satisfied from the totality of the evidence, that the mother has attempted to control and influence TT&#8217;s daily life and decisions in almost every respect: where he goes and what he does with his day-to-day life, who he sees and when, and most of all, where he shall live.  To that end, as Mr Mahmood submits, she attempts to provide what she thinks TT requires and by-passes what TT wants, the advice of social workers, support staff and his lawyers. The chronology of events since November 2021 does indeed indicate that she has become emboldened in her decisions to ignore what the professionals say, to the point where she is now firmly of the belief that his life has been ruined by them all. </span></p>

I raise two matters before approving the orders as they are currently drafted. Firstly, the court has determined that on an interim basis, TT is to continue to live at his current placement. As TT has already of his own volition move back to the placement, I suggest that the injunction should explicitly state that ST is not to prevent him from living there, in addition to those preventing him from returning. Secondly, District Judge Temple, when hearing this case in June, authorised that TT was to live at the placement, but in accordance with his wishes, was permitted to spend a maximum of two nights per week staying overnight at the family home. This was aimed at striking a balance between preserving the placement as his place of residence and reflecting his desire to spend time, including on occasions, time overnight, at his family home. As it is drafted, the Court of Protection injunction does not reflect the court&#8217;s decision nor does it that opportunity for contact. As there is no indication that TT lacks the capacity to make decisions as to who he spends time with, I can see no basis upon which the court should interfere with that arrangement on his behalf.  Subject therefore, to any representations from the local authority and the Official Solicitor, I propose to make the following injunctions against ST, the precise addresses and locations to be stated in the orders:</span></p>
