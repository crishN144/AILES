In addition at the hearing the court had detailed information about Z&#8217;s immigration position and future options. The orders recorded the agreed way forward regarding immigration applications for Z. Directions were made leading to a two day fact finding hearing in July.</p>

In his report dated 20 October 2021 he outlined the relevant legal framework in that jurisdiction and the steps that would need to be taken for an order made here to be recognised. In his opinion, any welfare order made in this jurisdiction in this case may not be recognised for enforcement in North Macedonia as he considers one of the requirements to do so, namely the recognition of the decision is not contrary to the public order of the Republic of North Macedonia. In his opinion, some local courts may see a foreign decision granting parental status or rights to two same sex individuals as importing same-sex parenthood in a jurisdiction that does not otherwise allow this. He considers that the time taken for a decision to be made as to recognition is likely to take between three months and up to three years to complete.</p>

However his report refers to unofficial inquiries with the Ministry and Labour and Social Relations, which acts as the Central Authority. They are reported to have confirmed they have not had experience of a case involving same sex parenthood and consider, unofficially, an order in such circumstances would face obstacles with being enforced under the Convention. The expert stressed this is an unofficial view. He considers that there is an implicit and effective prohibition on two people of the same sex being recognised as parents of a child. Whilst he recognised there is no precedent, he considers there exists a real possibility that this prohibition could be elevated to the level of public order and could result in grounds to refuse to recognise such an order.</p>

He saw X for a remote assessment on 8 October 2021, two days previously X had completed the psychometric questionnaire. His report concludes that the difficulties in the parties&#8217; relationship, including the move to London and Z&#8217;s birth, have meant that X&#8217;s coping skills were no longer sufficient to protect him from the re-emergence of PTSD symptoms and this combination of factors led to a deterioration in his mental state. In his opinion X meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD and Dr Desautels considers X is not receiving adequate treatment. He recommends he requires CBT or EMDR and because of the complexity, chronicity and nature of his trauma, X is likely to need longer than the 8 &#8211; 12 sessions recommended. He considers a minimum of 6 months of weekly sessions would be required before an improvement is noticed. Dr Desautels considers X&#8217;s motivation for treatment is above average, which bodes well for treatment outcome.</p>

Ms Odze observed that there are findings made that X had sought to distance Z&#8217;s relationship with W and evidence that X was still deeply angry with W. These features, coupled with the fact that X had not received the treatment he requires, Ms Odze did not see in those circumstances X will be able to promote W&#8217;s relationship with Z, particularly in the light of his recent description that it takes him two days to recover from seeing W at handovers. Ms Odze said she had factored into her balancing exercise the impact on X of remaining here. She agrees it is a tall order but against that is the real risk in her view of Z losing his relationship with W. Ms Odze said it was not just about the risks from not being able to enforce any order, it also included the need for X to have therapy as well. Ms Odze said her recommendation if X&#8217;s application is refused is for a shared care arrangement with the change over via the nursery each Friday. She observed that a Friday is a good time as the weekend lays ahead before the routine of the week starts again. She considered such a division meets Z&#8217;s welfare needs, as it conveys the message of the equal role of both X and W and limits the risks for Z if things go wrong.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the application to relocate Ms Giz invites the court to weigh in the balance a number of factors, including the following. X&#8217;s difficult financial circumstances where he has no income or recourse to benefits in circumstances where he has significant debts. The consequences of X having no credit rating which has a direct impact on his ability to live in this jurisdiction, for example limiting his ability to sign a tenancy, secure household bills in his name. X has lived through the extreme stress of isolation, loneliness and uncertainty in London in circumstances where he has had to move three times and not had the benefit of family or other support. In his seventh statement, he sets out the detail of how he proposes to rebuild his life if his application is granted and what would be available for Z. These plans involve a clear role for W in Z&#8217;s life. The support that would be available is set out in the statement signed by X&#8217;s parents. The prospects of X&#8217;s treatment being successful would be enhanced by X living with the support of his family in North Macedonia, as well as meeting Z&#8217;s cultural needs. The impact on X of the application being refused should not be underestimated. X has demonstrated on a number of occasions his commitment to W&#8217;s parental role, for example contacting him in May when Z was admitted to hospital. Dr Desautels evidence was that remaining in England would increase the risk of further deterioration in X&#8217;s mental health.</p>

She submits the expert&#8217;s evidence is over cautious and addresses potential risks. She submits the court will need to balance these risks with X&#8217;s evidence about his commitment to W&#8217;s ongoing role with Z, the relative ease of travel to North Macedonia and the support that would be available from his family. Weighed in the balance too must be the advantages for Z of X&#8217;s application being granted. He would grow up in the traditions and religion of his family. Ms Giz submits there remain concerns about W&#8217;s attitude to X. This is illustrated in what he had said to Ms Lewis and Ms Odze and if Z was in W&#8217;s care, there is a real risk X&#8217;s relationship with Z would not be supported or promoted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gartland places reliance on the history as illustrating X&#8217;s understanding of the legal position in a way that undermined W&#8217;s relationship with Z. For example in his first statement he confirmed he had Y&#8217;s consent to take Z abroad, that W did not have parental responsibility and his intention was to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;either stay in Macedonia or move back to the US depending on where I found employment&#8217;</span>. In that statement, he continues to confirm he has instructed his solicitor to apply to the court for leave to withdraw the application for a parental order. This, Ms Gartland submits, is an early indication of X&#8217;s position regarding a lack of respect for W&#8217;s position in relation to Z, which in reality has continued since that date. She gives as an example X&#8217;s evidence that in May 2021, if foster care had been an option he could have preferred that to Z being placed in W&#8217;s care.</p>

Whilst she recognises the move to North Macedonia is clearly the place where X believes will solve many issues that he has the evidence is the therapy he requires is available in London combined with regular childcare for Z and a defined care arrangement with W, sharing the care could also bring improvements in X&#8217;s well-being. Whilst the move to North Macedonia would enable Z to develop his love and relationship with X&#8217;s family, the risk to Z at this point in his life is that his relationship with W will likely be severed and permanently damaged. She submits as recently as 10 October at hospital, X was insinuating that W is a paedophile. X is not in a position to positively promote W as Z&#8217;s parent, as in North Macedonia same sex parenting does not have the same legal basis as it does in this jurisdiction. It is only if Z remains in London will Z be able to continue to grow up being able to develop a strong relationship with each of his parents, as he will be living with each of them on an equal basis.</p>

Ms Odze remained clear that the option that least promotes Z&#8217;s welfare is relocation to North Macedonia. Ms Odze&#8217;s overriding concern is X&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;obviously very negative attitude towards W and the impact that may have on his ability to promote and facilitate a relationship between Z and W in the future&#8217;</span>. Having considered the fact finding judgment, the expert evidence and X&#8217;s oral evidence, she considers there is a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;significant risk that if X were to be given leave to remove, he would find himself unable to facilitate contact between Z and W with devastating consequences for their relationship&#8217;</span> with limited recourse to enforce any order in North Macedonia. When compared to the position if Z remained in England, there is less risk of Z losing his relationship with either X or W as if either stop complying with orders, there would be recourse back to the court. If X does leave without Z, Ms Odze does not consider it likely W will stop contact with X. Even if he did, X would have a remedy back to this court.</p>

This is in the context where both X and W&#8217;s positions are to support the role each has in relation to Z.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X states that an important consideration in the balancing exercise is the impact on him of remaining here in the circumstances he is now in with uncertain accommodation, very difficult financial circumstances, with limited ability to realise his earning capacity, lack of family and other support here and the detrimental impact on his mental health of remaining here. Whilst recognising the difficulties X has in remaining here, W proposes a package of financial support that would enable X to secure 1 bedroom accommodation near to the proposed nursery, with financial support for the nursery which will help support X realising his earning capacity. This together with securing the therapeutic support recommended by Dr Desautels, which with the disclosure of Dr Desautels report the support, can be accessed in the way he suggested in his oral evidence. Both X and W have recognised that an application will need to be issued for financial provision following the decree nisi.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W sets out that an important consideration is the risk if Z does move to North Macedonia with X of W&#8217;s current close relationship with Z being severed. This is due to the findings made by the court in August that X had taken steps to undermine the relationship between W and Z. X continues to hold W responsible for the situation he is in and describes the impact on him of handovers. In those circumstances, W submits whilst X states he accepts W&#8217;s parental role in Z&#8217;s life the reality is very different, with the result that there is a significant risk that once in another jurisdiction, X will avoid taking steps to properly support Z&#8217;s relationship with W. Such action needs to be seen in the context of the legal experts advice that there is a real risk that orders made here would not be effectively enforced, and this includes steps take under the Hague Convention. Ms Giz submits this risk is not justified on the evidence, X has complied with orders relating to Z seeing W to date, he recognises the important role W has in Z&#8217;s life and the legal experts report only refers to the possibility of difficulties in recognition or enforcement under the Hague Convention. As a consequence, the risks of this happening are low compared to the risks of remaining here for X and the impact that would have on his ability to care for Z.</p>

Whilst such a change would have an impact on Z, there is no suggestion that W is not able to care for Z. W has  encouraged Z&#8217;s relationship with X and if there were any issues the matter could be restored back to this court.</p>

Those important relationships are more likely to be maintained if Z remains in this jurisdiction where it is more likely X and W will remain. Even if X decides that he will move to North Macedonia in any event, which he has stated he may do, when considering the evidence as a whole that is the least worse option to meet Z&#8217;s welfare needs as Z will remain here, W would be able to care for him, X would be able to spend time with him here which would be supported by W with effective recourse to the court here, if required. If Z went to North Macedonia with X it is more likely that his relationship with W would be seriously at risk of being undermined and/or severed which would be inimical to his welfare needs.</p>

In my judgment the uncertainty about that aspect of his life has, understandably, been one of the most difficult aspects for him to manage. W has made proposals about that. They were not made until the second day of this hearing, in my judgment they should have been made earlier. W&#8217;s proposals to fund and support such accommodation until June 2022 up to the sum of &#163;1,300 per month provide an important period of security and stability for X which will benefit Z.</p>

Having considered the evidence as a whole X with the financial support offered by W that will help secure accommodation coupled with the nursery support will enable X to realise the earning capacity which in my judgment he has due to his work history, his impressive academic record and the resourcefulness he has demonstrated regarding work in the past. There is no reason why, with the right financial and other support being available, he can&#8217;t realise that earning capacity here, as he was planning to in North Macedonia or the other jurisdictions he has considered moving to.</p>

I recognise it would be different but it would still be available. If the division of time was as Ms Odze suggests he would be able to travel to visit them or they could come here and he would be able to maintain regular contact with them, as he does now. It is recognised this is not what X wants and the impact on him of his application being refused on him has to be weighed in the balance. I readily recognise that is going to be difficult for him but he has demonstrated resilience and commitment to meeting Z&#8217;s welfare needs and readily recognises the psychological help he needs, both of which are positive factors. The psychological treatment X needs is more likely to be available here and Dr Desautels opinion is such treatment is likely to be successful, and would have a wider positive impact on X&#8217;s mental health which would not only benefit X but also Z&#8217;s longer term welfare needs.</p>

By comparison the evidence about what treatment options were available in North Macedonia were generalised references to it being available but without any granular detail. Dr Desautels evidence was clear that it needed to be the specialist help he identified in his report. Whilst he recognised the benefits X would derive from having the support of his family he was equally clear about the separate need for the specialist treatment to bring about any longer term change that Z&#8217;s welfare needs required to take place.</p>

This is due to the legal position in North Macedonia regarding same sex parental relationships and the realities he refers to on the ground in that jurisdiction. Ms Giz also submitted the option of in some way making an order for relocation but suspend it or make it conditional until an application for recognition has been placed before and determined by the Macedonian court. I reject that submission as the continued lack of stability will be inimical to Z&#8217;s welfare as the uncertainty, which could last for some time will remain a source of difficulty between X and W, which will have an impact on Z.  </p>

No option for Z is risk free.  Ms Giz raises the issue that if the application is refused whether X would be able to have leave to remove Z to North Macedonia for the purposes of a holiday. For the reasons I have outlined the risks at present, in my judgment, remain the same in relation to Z&#8217;s relationship with W even for a short term visit. The risks are not static and will evolve over time. If X and W are able to take steps to provide a more secure basis to their parental relationship with Z, with X having had the necessary psychological treatment and for them to each gain a better understanding of the wider family so there is a firmer foundation on which there could be confidence that the risks that I have assessed are present now if Z went to North Macedonia would be manageable. If they were, there are undoubted wider welfare benefits for Z to be able to visit and spend time with X&#8217;s wider family. </p>
