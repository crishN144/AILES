On one hand, this would have alleviated the judicial task: the provision of a paginated bundle containing the most important documents is, after all, a basic requirement of court procedure. But on the other, in terms of the visible assets, this is a low asset case which has already involved an inordinate number of hearings (six) including three ineffective Financial Dispute Resolution appointments before Recorder Cowton KC. In light of the Wife&#8217;s persistent non-compliance, I think it unlikely that an adjournment would produce the disclosure which she has been ordered on provide on four earlier hearings. </span></p>

Ultimately, all litigation must come to an end, and it would in my view be grossly disproportionate to allow this case to proceed to a further, eighth, hearing when in all probability the court will again be presented (with due respect to the Husband) with badly prepared, where the Wife has failed to comply with orders and disclosure and might again not attend. </span></p>

The problems facing ordinary litigants are substantial and have been exacerbated by reductions in legal aid. Nonetheless, if proceedings are not to become a free-for-all, the court must insist on litigants of all kinds following the rules. In my view, therefore, being a litigant in person with no previous experience of legal proceedings is not a good reason for failing to comply with the rules.&#8221;.</span></p>

At [11] (underlined) the court &#8216;emphasises to the respondent that it can make a final order dealing with all assets, including ordering a sale of the family home, whether or not the respondent engages with these court proceedings, in order to provide a fair overall outcome to both parties&#8217;. The application was set down for pre-trial review (before Recorder Cowton KC) and final hearing (before another judge). A further order made for disclosure against the Wife with penal notice. An order made for s.25 statements to be exchanged by 27 May 2024, open proposals by 3 June 2024.</span></p>

He invites me to draw the inference that the reason why the Wife has not provided documentation which would cast light on her present income (e.g. bank statements, a copy of her CV, details of jobs she has applied for etc.) is because she has in fact already returned to work and wants to conceal this fact.

Having considered the matter carefully, I conclude that it is reasonable to draw inferences in relation to the Wife&#8217;s current income. Firstly, that has returned to work; Secondly, that it is reasonable to infer she is earning at least &#163;2,100 net pm (i.e. what she was earning last year); Thirdly, that the Wife is regularly in receipt of additional monies which might include some payment from her mother, which I propose to assess modestly at &#163;300 pm. This means that I have drawn inferences that the Wife&#8217;s income is &#163;2,550 pm comprising her earned income &#163;2,100, some additional unexplained income of &#163;300 pm and her child benefit of &#163;145 pm</span></p>
