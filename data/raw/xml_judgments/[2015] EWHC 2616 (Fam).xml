The agreement, which is elaborate, provided for an existing portfolio held by the parties jointly for the child, Anton, to be augmented significantly by further monies, and by the transfer into the trust of a property.  In all, the trust fund would comprise just over &#163;900,000.</span></p>

However, the normal tenets of contractual interpretation, leave to me conclude without any doubt that it was the intention of the parties that the arrangements made in this final order would be in substitution for and supersession of the interim order, including any arrears that may have arisen under it.  This simply cannot be gainsaid in circumstances where the question of arrears were raised by leading counsel on the mother&#8217;s behalf.  If it was intended that the arrears should remain outstanding then that would unquestionably have been reflected in the terminology of the order.  </span></p>

I regard that application that she has made to the Swedish court as being abusive.  She has not attended today, notwithstanding that the rules require her attendance to be here.  I am told that she has a hospital appointment, although no medical evidence has been produced.  Instead, her father and her sister have attended.  </span></p>

She says that they have only received documents late in the day and the mother would like, in those circumstances, an adjournment so that she can take legal advice.  If I felt that her position had any merit at all I might consider granting an adjournment.  But in circumstances where I am satisfied that her position in the Swedish court is meritless, and where her resistance to the application that has been made by Mr. Johansson is equally meritless, I decline an adjournment.  </span></p>
