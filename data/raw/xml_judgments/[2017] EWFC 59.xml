The updated assessment was carried out in August and September 2016. In that assessment she demonstrated limited acceptance of the courts findings, in particular about her knowledge and involvement of M and C coming to this country without the consent of IE and with false documents.

CI has expressed strong views that the children should not remain with MI, and has made a number of threats towards MI and her family.

CI co-operated with the assessment, but made it clear he did not accept any of the findings made by the court. He expressed those views in forceful terms, he regards MI as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;evil and it is her evil that has caused this&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Ms F reported she found the CI&#8217;s behaviour during their sessions controlling, he would change the subject or talk at length about unrelated topics. She notes she was concerned about the comments CI made about the people in his community and how they will support him </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;do whatever is needed&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> if the children remain with MI.

Whilst recognising the advantages of M and C being placed with him Ms F was clear that the risks caused by CI&#8217;s inability to accept the findings, his inability to meet the children&#8217;s emotional and psychological needs and his dishonesty in the past made it difficult to place reliance on what he asserts now and the impact on that with professionals seeking to work with him resulted in her not being able to recommend placement of the children in his care. She re-evaluated her position following receipt of the assessment from the Lucy Faithful Foundation (LFF) that put his risk of sexual abuse in the future as being </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;low&#8217;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> particularly in relation to his own children. In her oral evidence Dr Stubley confirmed what was set out in her report. Ms F acknowledged the LFF&#8217;s expertise in relation to the assessment of sexual risk but said the sexual risk was just one aspect of the concerns relating to CI&#8217;s ability to meet the children&#8217;s needs. When Ms F discussed the LFF&#8217;s assessment with him CI repeated that he did not regard himself as being any sexual risk to the children. Ms F shares the concern expressed in the LFF assessment about CI&#8217;s threats to MI and his controlling behaviour and her conclusions in her assessment are not changed, she does not recommend placement of M and C with CI in Country A. In his oral evidence CI confirmed his position that he considered M and C&#8217;s best interests would be served by returning to Country A to be in his care.</span></p>

They have two children age 4 and 2 years. They married in 2010 and Mrs AM came to the UK to join her husband. She has indefinite leave to remain here. Following a positive viability assessment Ms M carried out the full assessments, the first in February 2016 with updates in April (following discussions with the referees), May 2016 (following receipt of the PNC details for Mr AM which made Ms M re-evaluate her assessment to be negative), June 2016 (which details the additional alias names Mr AM is known as) and October 2016 (which details Ms M&#8217;s discussion with the AM&#8217;s about the courts findings and seeking clarity regarding Mr AM&#8217;s previous convictions as a result of her discussions with the AMs she revised her conclusion to recommend an SGO). In the initial assessment Ms M sets out their personal history given to her by the AM&#8217;s. Mr AM confirmed he holds a British Passport and was born in Country A, since he arrived in the UK the only time he reported he had been unemployed was when he was serving a custodial sentence from October 2002 to 2006 for importing 720 gms of cocaine into the country. Subsequent enquiries found that he had convictions under an alias name concerning the drugs offence and subsequent driving offences in 2006/2007, which resulted in him being recalled to prison until September 2009. Ms M spoke at length to Mr AM about his failure to inform her that he had been convicted under an alias and that he had other convictions apart from the drug related one, she considered he had been reflective, had shown insight and was able to take responsibility for his actions. She considered the risks of him repeating such behaviour to be lower as a result of his changed personal circumstances and increased responsibilities. Following his release he reported that he moved to Scotland, worked for employment agencies before securing a position as a chef at the university. Since 2015 he has been running a cleaning franchise that he purchased. Whilst Ms M acknowledges the strength in their relationship she expresses the view that she remained unclear how much Mrs AM knew of Mr AM&#8217;s previous criminal behaviour and sentence. Ms M concludes that she does consider the AM&#8217;s would be able to meet M and C&#8217;s needs and would be able to safeguard the children appropriately from any risk posed by CI. In their written statement Mr and Mrs AM confirm their commitment to care for M and C. Mr AM gave oral evidence and showed himself to be instinctively sensitive to the children&#8217;s needs. He confirmed they would take professional advice about how best to manage M and C being placed with them and their contact with their parents, and would not make any decision he considered would be emotionally harmful for the children or was against their wishes. He confirmed there was schooling available for the children nearby and that they had a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;cordial&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> relationship with MI.</span></p>

She did not recommend M and C&#8217;s placement with the AW&#8217;s. The AW&#8217;s married in October 1996 and have one son age 20, who currently studies in the US. Mr AW, CI&#8217;s childhood friend, is 55 years. He is a lawyer and accountant and has his own business. Mrs AW is 51 years and works as a bank manager with long hours from 5.30am to 9pm each day. Their plan if they care for M and C is the children would attend boarding school and M and C&#8217;s paternal half sister, SI age 30 years, would care for them until she enrols at university. Ms C does not recommend placement with the AW&#8217;s due to their failure to accept the findings of the court, the enmeshed nature of the relationship between CI and the AWs, particularly Mr AW, the risk of the children being returned to the care of CI and their lack of availability to meet the children&#8217;s needs. In his oral evidence Mr AW said he was unaware of the findings that had been made regarding CI and his view was that if CI still disputed them there should be a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;re-investigation&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of them. He confirmed that he had not told any of his wider family about his proposals to take on the care of M and C. Ms C did not recommend the AW&#8217;s as future carers for four main reasons: their lack of insight into the risks posed by CI and that he was likely to be given unsupervised contact with the children; their working commitments and the number of carers the children would have; Mr AW&#8217;s close working ties with CI and their lack of insight into the children&#8217;s needs.</span></p>

In her most recent statement she recommends E, V and A remain in MI&#8217;s care and M and C go and live with their maternal aunt and uncle in City C. She accepts the assessment recommendations regarding CI and Mr and Mrs AW. She recognised and weighed in the balance the cultural advantages of M and C returning to but was clear in her oral evidence that placement with either CI or Mr and Mrs AW did not meet the children&#8217;s emotional and physical needs. Whilst she recognises that M and C&#8217;s wishes are first to remain placed with MI she considers that Mr and Mrs AM, due to Mrs AM&#8217;s biological connection with IE, are better able to offer the children emotional support, in particular in understanding why and how they have come to be in the situation they are now in. She recognised how more recently MI had permitted contact between M and C and their mother and aunt. However she considered Mr and Mrs AM are in a better position to promote contact between M and C and their birth parents. If M and C moved Ms B agreed it would be important for her to do some life story work with M and C to help them understand their recent history. In relation to contact Ms B considers there should be contact between the children and MI and limited indirect contact for M and C with CI. In her oral evidence she considered M and C needed to have some emotional stability before any direct telephone or skype contact could be considered between CI and M and C. She said the difficulties in this case are CI&#8217;s non acceptance of the courts findings and the children&#8217;s current wishes not to see their father. They needed to be in a secure placement, well supported and settled before contact with CI could be looked at. In her oral evidence she recognised that there needed to be effective liaison between the LA and the asylum service, who will take over responsibility for the day to day financial needs of MI and the children. Regarding the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings she accepted in her oral evidence they could be influenced by MI.</span></p>

It would meet their cultural needs, it is where their birth parents live, where the wider family are and would avoid the uncertainty caused by their current immigration status. Against that, both in relation to the placement with CI and Mr and Mrs AW, neither of those placements display any recognition or insight into the findings made by the court. In the light of the history both placement options in Country A are likely to give them a distorted view of their background, how they came to live in the UK and the roles played in that by CI, MI and IE. Such behaviour would be very damaging to both children. CI has made clear in the assessment interviews he has participated in, in his written and oral evidence that he is simply unable to accept or show any insight into the serious findings made against him. His position remains resolute that he shoulders no responsibility for the position the children find themselves in, he puts the responsibility entirely at the door of MI who he regards as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;evil&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> It is very likely if the children were placed with the AW&#8217;s they would almost certainly have unsupervised contact with CI.</span></p>

MI and CI&#8217;s relationship remains very difficult, which is likely to adversely impact on the likelihood of future contact. I agree with the Guardian that the risk of M and C remaining with MI is that due to her limited acceptance of her actions in bringing the children here and the long period when they had no contact with their mother it may be difficult for M and C to get a clear, reliable and coherent account as to how they came to the UK.</span></p>

The court shares the concern expressed by Ms M and the Guardian regarding Mr AW&#8217;s failure to be frank when first asked about the full extent of his previous convictions and the alias he used. However it is clear from the interview Ms M had with him in September he gave what she considered was a full account. On the evidence the court has I agree with the Guardian&#8217;s view that the risk to the children arising from this is low. Mr AM&#8217;s circumstances now are very different, he is now married, has a young family and a relatively secure job through his cleaning franchise. He was impressive in his oral evidence, showing a sensitivity towards M and C. I have some residual concern that CI will seek to put pressure on him for contact to take place between M and C and their father sooner rather than later. Mr AM said he would take advice from the professionals about this, which I accept. However he and Mrs AM also need to make decisions themselves that have M and C&#8217;s interests at their heart, and not be influenced by any requests made by CI. Each child needs to feel emotionally secure and stable and want to have contact with CI before it is even considered appropriate for it to take place. CI is going to need to re-build trust with them, which will take time and patience. In his oral evidence Mr AM said he understood why CI would want contact as he is their father but he recognised that what CI wants may not be in the children&#8217;s interests, he needs to keep that distinction at the forefront of his mind. If the children are placed with them Mr and Mrs AM bear the responsibility of making sure they make the right decisions for M and C. The AM&#8217;s are clearly supportive of continuing contact between M and C and their mother. The evidence demonstrates that is in their interests.</span></p>

Mr AM accepts it was wrong not to volunteer all the information about his previous convictions but his situation is now more stable and settled and the risks of him re-offending are low. Placement with them whilst involving some short term disruption in terms of the move of home and school will, in my judgment, provide the children with the best chance of long term stable care that will promote and maintain links with both the maternal and paternal family. There remains the uncertainty of their immigration applications, but that is the position whether they remain with MI or are placed with the AM&#8217;s.</span></p>

I have carefully considered the submissions made by Mr Tughan Q.C. in relation to contact in particular the need for the court to recognise the gaps in contact and to consider CI&#8217;s parenting against a wide canvas. There is no need for any order regarding IE as there is no issue that her skype contact will remain in place and in the event that she is able to come to this jurisdiction, I have no doubt she will be able to reach agreement with her sister. The situation in relation to CI is too uncertain and more complex. The proposals made by Ms B have much to commend them and are set out in the SGO support plan. There should be exchanges of written communication between CI and the children after two months, once they have had a chance to get settled. This should initially be via Ms B with a view perhaps to setting up a dedicated email account that could be overseen by the AM&#8217;s. Dependent on the success of that communication, it may move on to skype contact supervised by the AM&#8217;s who will best be able to judge whether it is of benefit for the children. Direct contact is a commendable aim, but only if it is commensurate with the children&#8217;s interests. They have to have the emotional security and stability to manage it, which is likely to take some considerable time. CI&#8217;s wish for fortnightly or monthly direct contact is not in the children&#8217;s interests now or in the foreseeable future.</span></p>
