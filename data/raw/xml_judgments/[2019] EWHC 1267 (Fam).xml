He told me that D&#8217;s legal team had been informed of C&#8217;s proposal for ENE by a High Court Judge on 10 May 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">The Note expanded on the reason for seeking an ENE or FDR, reproduced Rule 3.1 (2) (m), and referred to the decision of Norris J in <span style="font-weight:bold">Seals and Seals v Williams [2015] EWHC 1829 (Chancery), [2015] 4 Costs LO 423. </span>I am certain, and so is my clerk, that I did not see it before the hearing commenced.  I recall struggling to read into the case without a reading list (which the skeleton argument contained) and remarking on this. I cannot now recall, and neither counsel can tell me, whether I was referred to the Note or its attachments in court.  I have recorded nothing to that effect in my notebook. Having been recently provided with the Note after circulation of this judgment in draft its contents were unfamiliar. I would certainly have remembered being referred to Ilott v Mitson (No 2) [2017] 2 WLR 979 (having heard one of the appeals at High Court Level), and probably also P v G [2006) 1 FLR 431- and I do not.  Also, I recall that I did not see in court the Rule itself, either a copy, or in a document. (I cannot remember whether Seals was referred to at the hearing). </p>

I may or may not have seen Mr Entwistle&#8217;s skeleton argument. It may be in the light the of the concession on behalf of C that it was not considered relevant for me consider <span style="font-weight:bold">Seals </span>nor the amended CPR Rule 3. (2) 1.

I am certain that no draft was provided which referred to ENE or specified the terms of reference of any ENE; and counsel do not dissent from this. The remainder of the directions were essentially agreed but their timing depended on what steps were to be taken as to ADR.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Mayes asked me to give an indication as to whether I considered that an ENE would be beneficial or not. Mr Entwistle had not addressed in his skeleton argument C&#8217;s case that the case was best suited to a form of ENE. This may or may not have been because he thought there was no point, in view of the concession therein that there was no power to order it.     In oral submissions he asked me not to interfere by expressing a view; he argued that no transaction was impugned, and that ENE/FDR would lead to a substantial increase in costs because of the extent of the disclosure required. He told me that D was prepared to submit to mediation and proposed that it should take place over summer/ autumn 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.03in">The decision here is in an importantly different context from the judge&#8217;s factual/evaluative determination in Re L. I had made a decision with direct consequences which had been intended to be drawn up in an order. But it is also significant that this was a case management decision. I do not read the Rules as confining the approach to the court to a one-off application for some form of ADR- circumstances may arise to change the landscape. Furthermore, if following my decision, the Rule had been clarified to establish that consent was immaterial it seems obvious that C would have been able to renew her application. Such a clarification would be arguably a relevant change in circumstances, and arguably merely a statement of existing fact (since opinion can be a relevant fact) and not a change in circumstances.     </p>

Promptitude is of particular relevance.  Promptitude bears on the extent to which the parties have altered their positions, as may also the lack of perfection of the order, (not as a matter of black letter law but as a matter of fact upon which the parties can normally rely); and the prejudice to one or other party and the extent to which the decision has been relied on, and the consequences, financial or otherwise. An asserted manifest mistake by the judge &#8211; and it should not matter whether the mistake is that of the judge or of counsel leading the judge into error; misstatement or omission; or where something has been overlooked in genuine error- opens the door to injustice.  The reasons for advancing a different case which the judge is asked to consider for the first time must also be important and justify setting aside the order.  </p>

The guidance conflicts. The consequence is that there was a mutual failure to draw my attention to important statements of principle from high-quality sources which bore directly on my adjudication, and which although not binding are of considerable persuasive weight, and which I am now considering for the first time. To that extent this is not a &#8216;second bite at the cherry&#8217;. At the application stage it cannot be necessary for the argument to be overwhelming and conclusive; the question is whether the material should be put before the judge to decide. Its absence leads to a potentially flawed decision which requires to be reconsidered.  </p>

It is also arguable, as Mr Entwistle submits, that by stating this was &#8216;slightly different&#8217; from a case where the parties jointly requested the parties to express provisional views on a particular hypothesis,  where it would be part of the judicial function to accede to assist the parties in dispute resolution complying with the overriding objective, Norris J can only have meant that consent is essential to such a process.

This is an interesting but not determinative inclusion in an order which the authors consider can only be made by consent. The authors may well have taken the view was that consent to the referral entails consent to the making of court orders to facilitate it.  </p>

So, a ruling that there can be a non-consensual order for an ENE process in non-family proceedings would not create an anomaly between the CPR and FPR/FDR regimes.  On occasion I have been urged by a party to bypass the Family Division FDR process and list the case for trial. There is no doubt that I have power to do so (I believe that I have always declined) but it has never been suggested that a party is entitled to opt out of the FDR process.  </p>

It would be possible to extend Norris J&#8217;s argument in Seals to say that FDR is available as part of the court&#8217;s case management powers, but the rules do not say so - indeed Rule 3 is silent as to FDR, which seems to have been adopted as a matter of practice, as it was originally in the family courts. This all strengthens my perception that the ENE is different from an FDR. Does this matter? Should I place any reliance on the absence of any reference to FDR in the amended Rule 3? Should I take the view that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to order an FDR in furtherance of the overriding objective? If so, and any intervention can be justified on that ground, it is pertinent to ask why the framers of the Rules thought it necessary to provide an amendment to &#8216;codify&#8217; Norris J&#8217;s decision. </p>

ENE is not strictly a process of mediation, although FDR comes closer to it. As the Chancery Guide states at 18.7 2 ENE is a simple concept which involves an &#8220;independent party, with relevant expertise, expressing an opinion about a dispute or an element of it. It is unlike mediation because a mediator acts primarily as a facilitator. Although the mediator may undertake some &#8216;reality testing&#8217;, there is no requirement to do so. The person undertaking ENE provides an opinion based on the information provided by the parties and may do so without receiving oral submissions &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

Even if settlement does not take place at the FDR itself seeds are often sown which lead to an agreed solution later. FDR is appropriate in all types of dispute; from the most complex cases with vast wealth, requiring massive presentation for FDR, to the small value case where the issues are often even more difficult to resolve. FDR judges have no difficulty in assessing the risks and advantages likely to accrue to both or all parties of various litigation approaches, and in advising on appropriate settlement, which may be in specific or more general terms.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">The CPR in totality contains powers enough to compel the parties to participate in a court process by filing documentation and most importantly to attend. But that is not conclusive as to whether the Rule creates a compulsory process. It is not helpful for me to speculate what Norris J would have ordered had there been no consent in the absence of sanction by the Rules. It is necessary for me to look beyond Norris J&#8217;s judgment at the Rules and what they in totality provide.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">The commentary on Rule 1.4 (1) (e) (ADR) at 1.4.11 refers to &#8220;facilitating&#8221; ADR, as opposed to &#8220;ordering the use of early neutral evaluation &#8220;, which implies but does not specifically state that a compulsory approach is envisaged. But it is not clear nor conclusive and could be restricted to a consensual process. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">Tempting though it would be to say that this is no different from the FPR/FDR process, the FPR Rules make it quite explicit what the court&#8217;s powers are and that this is not an elective process. The CPR does not. I accept Mr Entwistle&#8217;s submission that the language of Rule 3 itself in totality is directed towards facilitation rather than compulsion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">Also, the FDR process is extremely specific and focussed on a particular outcome, as opposed to the more diffuse guidance entailed in an ENE where it will probably take a consensual effort by the parties to define what issues need to be resolved. I cannot ignore the lack of reference to the FDR process within the amended Rules. In my view FDR cannot be considered just as a sub-species of ENE.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">My overall conclusion is that the current Rules are insufficiently precise in their formulation for me either to conclude, or be confident that the Rule makers intended, that the judge is permitted to give directions which lead to a non-consensual ENE; or that the term ENE in the amended Rule is intended to govern FDR as well.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.03in">My conclusion does not disturb my view that this is a case which cries, indeed screams out, for a robust judge-led process to focus on the legal and factual issues presented by this case; and perhaps even craft a proposed solution for the parties to consider. Mediation (even by a legally trained mediator, if one could be found to assist where the issues are specialised, is unlikely to approach the issues in an authoritative way, as Norris J said in Seals. </p>

The arguments for the court having power to do so are strong and the experience in the Family Division of court-controlled intervention presents a very favourable picture. </p>
