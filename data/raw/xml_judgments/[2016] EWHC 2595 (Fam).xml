	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">   A few weeks ago I circulated a draft judgment to the parties at the conclusion of public law care proceedings.  This week I have been considering whether or to what extent that judgment should be placed in the public domain. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">   Having indicated that I would hand down judgment on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October I impressed upon the Local Authority that if they were to apply for a Reporting Restriction Order (RRO) it was to be done in a timely and procedurally compliant manner.  I regret to say that the application was both late and disorganised.  However, I have been satisfied that the Press and broadcast media have notice of the application.  Only Associated Newspapers Limited has chosen to make representations which they have done through their counsel Ms McMahon.  Her arguments have been broad ranging and ambitious, they have also been advanced forcefully and succinctly. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="None" style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;The issues in the case are extremely unusual, and it will be submitted that the Court should ensure anonymity for the child concerned  to the fullest sense possible bearing in mind his young age and the detrimental effects upon him and his family should he be identified as the subject of this judgment, the potential for media interest in the issues arising in the case even from a fully anonymised judgment, and the potential impact and stress on the placement with his father in the wake of such media  interest. It will be submitted on behalf of the Local Authority that there are &#8220;compelling reasons&#8221; to do so in this case.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">   The Local Authority contend that in order to achieve its objectives there should be wide scale anonymisation to include: all the experts; the various CAFCASS officers involved in the case, both in the Care proceedings and the earlier Private Law proceedings; the social workers; the solicitors and barristers instructed in the case and the Circuit Judge who heard the majority of the Private Law proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">  The Local Authority associated itself with the even more wide ranging restrictions sought on behalf of the father (F) which contemplated the construction of a summary of the judgment, largely denuded of detail, which alone should be placed into the public domain (the full and detailed judgment to remain private).  This idea had been drawn from a guidance document prepared by Dr. Julia Brophy entitled &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Anonymisation and Avoidance of the Identification of Children</span>&#8217;.  When the concept was tested in practical terms during the course of exchanges with counsel it proved, in my judgement, impossible to undertake the exercise in a way which achieved any kind of satisfactory resolution.  It is the core issue in the case here which raises the risk of identification, as is clear from Ms Flowers&#8217; own submission, set out above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">  As Ms Flowers accepted during the course of her submissions, her support for the idea of a summary judgment indicated a recognition that the case contained matters which were in the public interest and thus fell within the ambit of the Practice Guidance issued by Sir James Munby (P) on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014: &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">Transparency in the Family Courts; Publication of Judgments</span>&#8217;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The framework of the law in this area is easy to state.  Indeed, Lady Hale considers that it can properly be regarded as &#8216;trite&#8217; see: <span style="font-weight:bold">R (C) v The Secretary State for Justice <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2016/2" uk:canonical="[2016] UKSC 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] UKSC 2</ref>; (citing Re S (a child) (identification: restrictions on publication <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref>)</span>.  The essence of the exercise is one of parallel analysis in which neither the Article 8 ECHR rights, which broadly protect individual privacy, nor Article 10 rights, which safeguard freedom of expression, has precedence.  In <span style="font-weight:bold">V v Associated Newspapers Limited  <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2016/21" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCOP 21" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCOP 21</ref></span> Charles J described it as a clash of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">titanic proportions</span>&#8217; in which the public interest in the effective administration of justice plays a significant role.  In <span style="font-weight:bold">M v The Press Association <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2016/34" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCOP 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCOP 34</ref></span> I observed that whilst the framework of the law may be relatively easy to identify, its application, in what is always a highly fact sensitive arena, can be anything but.  Certainly the application of the principles to the facts of this case is challenging.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">It is also important to bear in mind that the analysis is not confined to the &#8216;polar alternatives of openness and privacy&#8217; as Mostyn J put it in <span style="font-weight:bold">DL v SL (Financial Remedy Proceedings: Privacy) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 2 FLR 552" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 2 FLR 552</ref>.  </span>Thus I must here consider the proportionality of each request for anonymisation or any wider restriction.

F was offered remuneration if he was prepared to speak to the Press.  I should say that I am confident that F would have declined a King&#8217;s ransom.  I have accepted the assurance of the journalist concerned that this was done in error and will not be repeated.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">"The principle of open justice is one of the most precious in our law. It is there to reassure the public and the parties that our courts are indeed doing justice according to law. In fact, there are two aspects to this principle. The first is that justice should be done in open court, so that the people interested in the case, the wider public and the media can know what is going on. The court should not hear and take into account evidence and arguments that they have not heard or seen. The second is that the names of the people whose cases are being decided, and others involved in the hearing, should be public knowledge. The rationale for the second rule is not quite the same as the rationale for the first, as we shall see. This case is about the second rule. There is a long-standing practice that certain classes of people, principally children and mental patients, should not be named in proceedings about their care, treatment and property. The first issue before us is whether there should be a presumption of anonymity in civil proceedings, or certain kinds of civil proceedings, in the High Court relating to a patient detained in a psychiatric hospital, or otherwise subject to compulsory powers, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> ("<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>").

It is right that this should be the case in the Family Justice system, not least because those conclusions may (and I emphasise may) be relied on by Judges who are required to make some of the most draconian orders in any jurisdiction.  These include the separation of families, temporarily or permanently and the revocation of parental rights and responsibilities.  Not only is the probity of the process enhanced by scrutiny, so too is its efficacy.  Transparency stimulates debate and in so doing provides fertile ground for the growth of knowledge and understanding.  </p>

Ms Flowers robustly, but erroneously in my view, submits that if I name this particular category of individuals, her argument for not naming the Local Authority directly becomes otiose (or at least, she says, very nearly so).

It certainly &#8216;tightens the net&#8217; to use the phrase coined in submissions, but I am not persuaded that it will therefore lead to the identification of the child whose details and location cannot be published in any event.  Moreover, there is a very considerable difference between permitting information to be included in a judgment that runs the risk of identifying the child&#8217;s geographical location and effectively stating it in terms in the judgment itself by naming the Local Authority.  For the avoidance of doubt the Reporting Restriction Order incorporates the publication of information leading to the identity of the child, including material gleaned by way of the &#8216;jigsaw effect&#8217;.  To avoid any ambiguity the order should specifically prohibit the publication of the region of the country in which J lives.  </p>

Of course, were she to succeed it would have the collateral attraction of keeping the name of a Local Authority out of the public domain in a case where they have been subject to trenchant criticism.  Whilst I have been critical of this Local Authority I must say that I am entirely convinced of their integrity in this argument.

Firstly, the factual background is striking and remarkable.  Secondly, the impact of his experiences on J is likely to be profound and potentially long lasting.  It is important to keep these issues at the centre of this exercise.  If I were here exercising a welfare jurisdiction, that is to say one in which J&#8217;s interests were the paramount consideration, then I should wish to construct an impregnable fortress around him to guarantee the peace and privacy which he undoubtedly requires to recover from his extraordinary experiences.  I do not operate here in that jurisdiction, as is clear from the framework of the law set out above.  I am required to balance rights and freedoms of &#8216;titanic proportions&#8217; in an exercise which requires me to evaluate principles which are conceptually different.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Ms Kilvington submitted that though the balance is a delicate one, the facts of the case are indeed so striking that the identification of the geographical area in which the child lived would, far more readily in this case than in others, risk his identification becoming known.  I agree both with Ms Kilvington&#8217;s ultimate conclusion and with her identification of the delicacy of the balancing exercise.  I would add that an important factor in coming to this conclusion is my earlier decision to require a thorough investigation of this case at the most senior level in the Authority.  This I believe addresses, to an important degree, the public interest in the professionalism of child protection within this Authority&#8217;s department.  I should also say that whilst I am satisfied that the balance here falls in favour of J&#8217;s Article 8 rights, that balance may potentially shift at some point in the future.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Mr Baker has informed me that the mother has entirely rejected the views of the experts, set out in my judgment, as well as my own reasoning and conclusions.  In her last contact session with J she said this to him <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I know you are a girl and you feel like a girl and want to be a girl&#8217;</span>.  I accepted the evidence that this had caused him significant distress.  During a voluble interjection in the course of Ms Flowers&#8217; submissions, M said that she did not maintain that J is a girl but rather that he is &#8216;gender dysphoric&#8217;.  M has been ambivalent throughout on this point.  For the purposes of this application the distinction does not matter.  From any perspective, M has a different view concerning J&#8217;s gender identification and emotional needs to everybody else.  This has been properly identified as a significant challenge in promoting the mother and son relationship in the future.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">It follows, to my mind, that were M to talk about her son in the media, advancing what Mr Baker has referred to as her &#8216;alternative view of the case&#8217;, there is the real risk that, contrary to my findings and in a way which is inimical to J&#8217;s best interest, M will misrepresent his &#8216;gender identity&#8217; to the world. That after all is what M&#8217;s &#8216;alternative view&#8217; of the case is.  The expression of that view, therefore, not only risks J&#8217;s privacy but his emotional wellbeing.  As will be clear from my extensive judgment, given space and independence, J has moved from presenting as a girl to asserting his male identity.  This process has been gradual and public.  It has been witnessed by his peers and teachers.  His school has been tremendously supportive.    This is the landscape in which J&#8217;s Article 8 rights, asserted on his behalf by his father and Guardian, fall to be considered.  There is, in my evaluation of the competing rights and interests here in play, a high and wholly unacceptable risk that the mother will either unknowingly or otherwise, broadcast some detail of her and J&#8217;s life together which will identify J to those who know him and who hear or read such information.  Again, the highly unusual facts of this case render that, self evidently, far more likely than would be the case in many other circumstances.  The potential consequences incorporate not only the violation of J&#8217;s privacy but the inestimable harm to him caused by hearing, or hearing of, his mother asserting, in the public domain, her wholly unjustified conviction that her son is gender dysphoric or identifies as a girl.  Moreover, it is difficult to see how by advancing her views in the public domain M can fail to damage the fabric of her relationship with her son.  That relationship as I have said in the substantive judgment is, above all else, J&#8217;s right.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The mother&#8217;s competing right is that of freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 ECHR.  Mr Baker tells me that M is also interested in speaking publicly about the issues presented by those experiencing gender dysphoria.  She has the inviolable right to do so.  Her right to speak about her son however, has to be balanced against J&#8217;s own rights.  This for me is not a delicate balance, the predominance of J&#8217;s right is both pressing and clear. I am accordingly prepared to grant the restrictive order sought by the parties, save the mother and Associated Newspapers Limited, preventing her from speaking about any aspect of &#8216;gender dysphoria or gender identification&#8217; in so far as these relate to J.  For the avoidance of doubt the restriction extends, as seen from the wider terms of the order, to prohibiting the mother from broadcasting or publishing any detail of J&#8217;s life which might identify him as the child subject to these proceedings.</p>

I formed the clear impression that counsel in this case and indeed in another case that I heard recently, had overestimated the reach and scope of Dr Brophy&#8217;s research.  The confusion, it seems to me, lies in the title: &#8216;Judicial Guidance&#8217;.   I think the legal profession may interpret that as signalling an authority which this research does not have.

The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.

Thus it follows that whilst Dr Brophy&#8217;s detailed suggestions are helpful when addressing the proportionality of intervention in a particular case, they must not be regarded as constructing a paternalistic presumption of privacy for every child in every case.  I am sure she did not intend that her work be construed in this way.  In a mature family justice system the weight afforded to the right to freedom of expression must be recognised and engaged with.</p>
