	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">It is far from clear whether the mother was first in time in issuing the proceedings in Jordan on 6 June 2021. Reliance by the mother on the part of Mr Edges report that states &#8216;The Jordanian Court as part of the divorce proceedings would consider issues of maintenance and custody and guardianship of the Children&#8217; does not address the question. He relies on a document produced by the father during the hearing appears to be a summons dated 13 December 2021 on an application made by the mother for custody stating in the application that the father &#8216;opposes her custody of the children and attempts to unfairly take the children&#8217;. The document asks for the father&#8217;s attorney to be notified and summoned to court and the mother seeks an order upholding her custodial rights. Mr Venables notes this application was made days after the mother&#8217;s brother had been served with a summons to attend court and had filed a statement in these proceedings. Prior to this there are similar documents in the bundle in August relating to alimony, child support and education expenses. He submits the later document dated 13 December 2021 is the first time matters relating to custody are raised, some months after the father&#8217;s C66 application in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position in relation to habitual residence can be set out quite succinctly. The mother rightly accepts the children&#8217;s habitual residence was here prior to their removal to Jordan on 22 May 2021. They were clearly well integrated here, had lived here for a number of years, Y attended school, H was born here and the family lived together as one family unit until just before the mother left with the children.</p>

Apart from some generalised evidence about staying with the maternal family, there is limited evidence about any particular integration in the social and family environment. Reliance by the mother on the lack of stability of her position and her intention lack any weight when looked at in the context of other evidence. There is no evidence the father agreed to this move. There is evidence the mother intended to return through, for example, the purchase of return tickets, Y attending school remotely, her reported conversation with the school that she was going to return in two weeks. That is supported by subsequent events, such as the six month rental of accommodation for her and the children to return to and what her brother reports is her position in his later statement.</p>

There remains some uncertainty as to whether the divorce proceedings issued by the mother on 6 June 2021 included a claim for custody as Mr Edge alludes to in his report and the mother&#8217;s Jordanian solicitor states was the position in his letter attached to the mother&#8217;s fifth statement and his more recent letter. The only information the court has about it being raised as a live issue is the document dated 13 December 2021. Having regard to the timing, it is likely that was prompted by the order made in these proceedings for the mother&#8217;s brother to attend court here. This factor is only one of the considerations the court needs to take account of.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the submissions of the parties and the evidence the court has, I have reached the conclusion the application for a stay should be refused. In my judgment Jordan is not the more appropriate forum for the welfare issues relating to these children to be determined. The majority of their life has been spent in this jurisdiction. Until recently, it was the jurisdiction where their family life was anchored. Both parents will have access to legal advice and any relevant evidence is more likely to be readily available here. There is unlikely to be any significant delay in the welfare issues being determined here. The application and orders sought by the father are more likely to be available here under the umbrella of a much wider welfare analysis than that which would exist in Jordan. Whilst I recognise the children have now been in Jordan for a number of months, there are other factors that need to be considered, in particular for issues regarding their ongoing relationship with their father and what role he may have in their future upbringing. Also, the circumstances in which the children were removed without his apparent consent or knowledge should be factored in.</p>
