There is a dispute as to whether she is primarily based in a flat on her own or in a property with her parents.  Indeed, the district judge made a finding of fact in relation to that.  The father lives in Leicester.  He is a professional man.  The parties married in July 2005 and lived in the property in Leicester, which was shared with the father&#8217;s mother.  There are two children:  E (a boy) who is aged 3 and P (a girl) who is aged 2.  Unfortunately, the parties&#8217; marriage broke down in April 2009.  At that point the mother was pregnant with P.  She moved with E to South East London.  It is clear that there have been significant proceedings before District Judge Backhouse ever since.  Initially, contact was at a contact centre.  Then it developed to visiting contact and then to staying contact.                          On 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2010, a shared residence order was made.  Four nights out of fourteen, including alternate weekends were to be spent with the father together with each half-term and half of the school holidays.</span></p>

Her recommendation was that the children should live with the mother.  She said that the mother was the primary carer.  She said the children&#8217;s attachments to the mother were very close, although they did indeed have a close and affectionate attachment to their father.  She did not believe the court would want to change the position unless there was good reason to do so.  She did not consider that the advantages of a move to Leicester could be said to outweigh the disadvantages.  The mother&#8217;s parenting was better than good enough and it was not appropriate to make decisions about education at their current ages.</span></p>

District Judge Backhouse continued the shared residence order but provided that the children should move to be with their father primarily and attend a private school in Leicester, residing with the mother on alternate weekends, reducing from three nights to two nights when they were at school for longer.  It is clear from the judgment that the district judge made a number of findings of fact in relation to dishonesty on the mother&#8217;s behalf.  This concerned where she was living and which nursery the children had been attending.</span></p>

I would not go that far.  I would suggest that the concept of a real prospect of success must mean, generally speaking, that it is incumbent on an appellant to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the appeal will be allowed at the substantive hearing.  Anything less than a fifty-fifty threshold would of course, by linguistic definition, mean that it is improbable that the appeal will be allowed and in such circumstances it would be hard to say that any appeal had a real prospect of success; rather, it could only be said as a matter of logic that it had a real prospect of failure.&#8221;</span></p>

I have also in fact heard from Ms.&#160;Ecob for the father.  In my view, there needs to be a Practice Direction as to how the High Court should deal with an application for permission to appeal because at the moment the system is not uniform.  There is a decision of Baron J. which suggests that such applications should be dealt with first on paper with the possibility of a renewed oral hearing.  There is the decision of Mostyn J. that I have just referred to.  My experience is that these cases tend to be listed for an oral hearing initially, sometimes with both parties present, sometimes only with the appellant present.  Nevertheless, I decided to hear from Ms.&#160;Ecob.</span></p>
