The father contends that on 3 November 2020 he spoke to the maternal grandmother in an attempt to seek help with respect to the ailing marriage.  The father says that thereafter the mother took G to England without his consent on 6 November 2020 but that the parties ultimately agreed that this would be a break for them and the father travelled to England on 4 December 2020, the family returning to Ireland together on 6 December 2020.  The father accepts that, following an argument on 7 December 2020, he drove the mother to the port at Belfast whilst G was cared for by the father&#8217;s sister, he says after the mother expressed a wish to return to England.  The father says the mother then changed her mind and did not want to leave without G. </p>

The paternal grandmother exhibits to her statement pictures of scratches and swelling to her face, which the paternal grandmother states were caused by the mother.  Each blames the other for instigating the assault.  Each say they acted in self-defence.  The Gardai were called as a result of this altercation.  The Gardai escorted the mother to a refuge with G.  The mother alleges that a car was thereafter driven at her near the refuge by an unidentified assailant.  There is no mention of this incident in the evidence provided by the refuge. </p>

The court does have a police report from the Gardai which makes clear the mother requested to leave the location at which the altercation occurred and was taken to a Women&#8217;s Refuge with G.  The report also records that the version of events provided by the mother and the paternal grandmother changed numerous times as between them, that no offences were disclosed and that no complaint was forthcoming from the mother. </p>

Within this context, the mother further asserts that the father&#8217;s family is well connected in the Republic of Ireland and that if she is compelled to return to that jurisdiction the father and his family will locate her and force her to return to the paternal family.  The mother further asserts that having fallen foul of family customs and etiquette within the traveller community, she remains at risk of cruel and abusive treatment by the father and other family members.  Indeed, the mother now goes so far as to contend that her life will be at risk from the father and his family were she to return to the Republic of Ireland. </p>

Within this context, it is important again to bear in mind that Art 13(b) looks to the situation as it would be if the child were returned forthwith to his or her home country and that the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to ensure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when he or she gets home. The significance for the situation the child will face upon return of a parent's refusal to return must in each case be evaluated in the context of the protective measures that can be put in place to mitigate the impact of the same.&#8221; </p>

The Supreme Court has also made clear that words 'physical or psychological harm' gain colour from the alternative 'or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation' in Art 13(b). 'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to S must mean a situation which S, in his particular circumstances, should not be expected to tolerate. Examples of situations it would not be reasonable to expect S to tolerate on his return are being subjected to physical abuse or neglect or being exposed to the harmful effect of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of his mother (<span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Children)(Abduction: Custody Appeal)</span> at [34]). </p>

I would only add that in a situation in which it is necessary to consider operating the machinery of the Convention, some psychological harm to the child is inherent, whether the child is or is not returned. This is, I think, recognised by the words "or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation" which cast considerable light on the severe degree of psychological harm which the Convention has in mind. It will be the concern of the court of the State to which the child is to be returned to minimise or eliminate this harm and, in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary or evidence that it is beyond the powers of those courts in the circumstances of the case, the courts of this country should assume that this will be done. Save in an exceptional case, our concern, i.e. the concern of these courts, should be limited to giving the child the maximum possible protection until the courts of the other country, Australia in this case, can resume their normal role in relation to the child.&#8217; </p>

In particular, I must assume that Holland has adequate procedures for protecting S in foster care, which procedures extend to ensuring that any psychological distress consequent upon his temporary separation from his primary carer is appropriately addressed (Re S (Abduction: Return to Care) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 843</ref>). There is in any event in this case ample evidence that the social services in Holland are adept in this regard. The Dutch authorities have in the past intervened to protect S when his mother was unable to care for him for a period of time and managed the situation such that S developed well in foster care and was able to return to his mother in due course. Moreover, the mother willingly accepted this intervention and has at no point contended that the placement of S in foster care for a temporary period exposed him to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise exposed him to a situation that was intolerable for him. In the circumstances, and accepting that S is now two years older, beyond the demands of comity I am satisfied in this case that adequate protective measures will be put in place to address any psychological distress and emotional upset experienced by S consequent upon his being returned to Holland without his mother and being placed in foster care. The corollary of this is that I must reject Ms Renton's concise submission that, in this case, "the placement is the harm". </p>

I of course accept that S will be caused a degree of psychological distress and emotional upset by being separated from his mother and placed in foster care. However, having regard to the protective measures that can be put in place by the Dutch authorities, I am not satisfied that that level of distress and upset will be such as to meet the narrow exception to the obligation to return constituted by Art 13(b).

However, taking those allegations at their highest, they amount to one altercation between the mother and the paternal grandmother (during which both received injuries, both blame the other for initiating it and both gave accounts that were considered by the Gardai to have changed numerous times as between them) and one incident during which the father attempted to, and did headbutt the mother.  As I have noted, the mother did not seek to gainsay the assertion by Ms Ridley that, prior to 7 December 2020, there had been no police involvement with the paternal family and the mother makes clear in her statement that there has never been any social services involvement with the family. Whilst the court would never seek to downplay the significance of domestic abuse, I am not satisfied that the foregoing matters, even taken at their highest, can make good the contention that were G to be returned to Ireland not in the care of the mother G would be exposed to emotional and physical abuse directly, and indirectly by witnessing it. </p>

Absent evidence that the care of parent who assumes care of the child will harm the child or expose the child to a risk of harm, such short term disruption and upset will not constitute a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.

The undertakings offered by the father, in respect of which he is willing to submit to orders, are extensive and comprehensive in addressing the risks contended for by the mother. The Republic of Ireland is a signatory to the 1996 Hague Convention.  Within that context, save in so far as they relate to issues of financial support and child maintenance, it would be open to the mother to seek to enforce undertakings or orders in the court in Ireland under Art 23 of the 1996 Convention as measures taken by the authorities of another contracting State.  In addition, it would be open to the mother to obtain orders from the Irish court mirroring the protective measures obtained before this court.  In circumstances where, as I have noted, the mother places her case regarding Art 13(b) squarely on the contention that the separation the mother from G by reason of her refusing to return to Ireland in the event the court made a return order constituted a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to G or would otherwise place him in an intolerable situation, which case I have rejected, I say no more about these matters. </p>
