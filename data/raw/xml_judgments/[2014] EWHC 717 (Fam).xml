In the event, I made only a award for child support in the sum of &#163;20,000 per month and I made an order of &#163;50,000 as a contribution to the historic costs that the wife had incurred with her previous solicitors, Vardags.</span></p>

Therefore, the wife&#8217;s expert is of the view that the triple talaq here was void and of no effect.  His opinion is that the single talaq is the effective divorce and that this was a proceedings divorce entitled to recognition as such in this jurisdiction.  The single joint expert now agrees with this opinion.</span></p>

I am of the view that there is a strong case that the single talaq pronounced by the husband before the judge in his home country is the effective divorce and that this is a proceedings divorce entitled to recognition as such in this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the wife, subject to meeting the jurisdictional requirements under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.15</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (where she has a more than merely arguable case, particularly if her claim is confined to maintenance - see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.15</ref>(1A) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>), would, in my opinion, in all likelihood, be granted leave under Part III.  The wife has a strong case for the grant of leave under Part III.  Therefore, in my judgment, in sharp contrast to my previous opinion, the wife today has a strong case for a substantive award for maintenance pending suit and a costs allowance, provided that the merits warrant such an award.</span></p>

Since February 2012, the wife has instructed six firms of solicitors in all and has spent a small fortune on legal fees.  Prior to and subsequent to February 2012, the wife received vast sums from the husband.  There is a schedule at para.78 of her witness statement dated 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2013.  This shows the receipt by her of &#163;3.125 million between June 2011 and March 2012.  Of this, &#163;1.9 million and &#163;600,000 was received by her in the first 10 days of February 2012.  The &#163;1.9&#160;million was designated to buy the freehold of the London property, but the wife did not use it for that purpose.  She was asked by the husband&#8217;s solicitor on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2012 to preserve it in a joint account.  Similarly, that letter asked that the &#163;600,000 be preserved, but the wife exported these monies to Egypt specifically to avoid any preservation measures that the husband might seek from the court.  She bought a villa for &#163;2.3 million  in Cairo.  Since then, political turmoil has engulfed Egypt so that by the time that the wife came to swear her Form E in February 2014 she deposed to the villa being valueless.  But, nonetheless, she has recently transferred it to her uncle for &#163;500,000 to discharge a debt said to be owed by her to him for &#163;400,000, leaving her with a mere &#163;100,000.  That debt was not mentioned in any of her earlier statements and first saw the light of day in her very recently made Form&#160;E.  The &#163;600,000 to which I have referred has all gone.  It has largely been spent on costs of which she has paid about &#163;400,000.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am not aware of any case where a reckless dissipation of funds has been taken into account in an adjudication of maintenance pending suit; nor would it be appropriate for this court to break the mould and to do so.  An award for maintenance pending suit is by its very nature a measure designed to hold the ring and to ensure that the claimant can live reasonably pending the final determination of her claims.  A legal services payment order is designed to ensure access to justice and that the parties can litigate on an equal footing.  Both types of award are always adjustable if it transpires at the final hearing that there has been too much or for that matter too little paid.  In my judgment, it is not appropriate for me to take into account a dissipation of money at the maintenance pending suit stage, even if the arguments for taking into account such dissipated monies at the final hearing appear strong or even very strong.</span></p>

He sent &#163;2.5&#160;million to London and gives an account of the expenditure of some, but by no means all, of it.  He says he received a further nearly &#163;4 million in January 2011 and he gives an account of the expenditure of some, but by no means all, of it.  Well over &#163;4 million is simply not accounted for at all.  When I asked Mr.&#160;Cusworth where it had gone, he blithely said that it had just been spent.</span></p>

So far as the LLL Bank and BBB Bank are concerned, it is also significant that when the husband came to make his Form E he did not exhibit any bank statements referable to his accounts at those banks, notwithstanding the clear requirement that 12 months&#8217; worth of bank statements should have been produced.  He said in relation to the BBB Bank this in his Form E, that it had no money in it, and the footnote says:</span></p>

He says, &#8220;I have requested statements and these are awaited&#8221;.  I find it very difficult to accept that.  Mr.&#160;Dyer has demonstrated convincingly to me that in relation to this bank, as well as in relation to BBB Bank, internet banking is available and so the statements would be capable of being produced at the click of a mouse.</span></p>

The wife brought certain documents with her that she wished the husband to sign.  One of the documents that he did sign was a confirmation by him to start paying her immediately &#163;60,000 per month.  In his witness statement the husband says that he was emotionally disturbed at the time.  He was missing his children whom the wife was not allowing him to see.  He did not have his reading glasses.  He did not know what he was signing or, if he did, his mind was altered by the circumstances so that he did not fully appreciate what he was putting his signature to.  I tend to agree with Mr.&#160;Dyer when he says that this man is no ing&#233;nue.  He is a former minister in the  government of his home country,.  I find it very hard to accept that he would have signed a document committing himself to pay &#163;60,000 per month without appreciating the consequences of his signature.</span></p>
