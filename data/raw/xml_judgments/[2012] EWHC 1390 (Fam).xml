Following assessments over the weekend by a consultant neurologist, Dr. M, and JP, an experienced speech and language therapist, there has been no issue on the evidence before me, or between the parties, that XB now lacks capacity to communicate his views as to the continuation of life support or to conduct the litigation. </p>

Save for a hospital admission in 2003, he has continued to live at home.

It derives, I think, from the acronym for non invasive positive pressure ventilation device (NIPPV), even though that is not actually what it is.  He actually has an invasive device.  The description given for this device has varied in the documents; for example, the description given by the XPCT in the continuation form attached to their application and in the advance decision itself.  But, in my judgment, the oral evidence is abundantly clear (in particular from the GP XW) that what was being referred to is the ventilation device they call 'Nippy', which XB has had for the last eight years.   </p>

He has invasive ventilation, and has had this since 2003.  But XW was very clear in his oral evidence that what was being discussed with XB in his presence and what he agreed to was the removal of his 'Nippy' device, which is the invasive ventilation he has had for over eight years.

Decisions around end of life are not easy for someone who has loved life so much.  She said the progression of her husband's motor neurone disease has been such that he has been forced to come to terms with the fact that his quality of life has deteriorated significantly, to the extent that he lost control over the most basic aspects of his life because he cannot communicate any more.  She said, having seen the report from Dr. M, who concluded that her husband's inability to communicate is permanent, this is the position her husband wanted to avoid, and the way he wanted to avoid it was by being allowed to peacefully end his life.  This was why, after careful consideration, he reached the decision to agree to the advance decision.  This was a decision that had the support of his family, and can now proceed in accordance with XB's wishes. </p>

One of the difficulties in this case was the inclusion in the pro forma of a 'valid until' date.  Those organisations that have such terms in their pro formas may want to look again at the necessity for that being in the pro forma form.  It is clearly in the interests of the person who has made the advance decision, his or her family, and those who have responsibility for providing or withholding treatment that there is clarity in relation to what the terms of the advance decision are.  </p>
