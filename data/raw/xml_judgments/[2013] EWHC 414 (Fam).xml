	    <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in">These proceedings concern R, a boy aged 3 and a half, who is the son of G B and R B. The family is Romanian. The Father lives in Romania. The Mother and R live in York. The matter comes before the Court today on the Mother&#8217;s appeal against a recent registration in this jurisdiction of a Romanian court order dated 20 November 2012. That order granted the care of R to his Father until proceedings in Romania were finalised. </p>

	    <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in">The procedure for registration of a judgment is governed by FPR 2010 at rule 31.8. Subparagraph (2) makes it clear that this is an administrative matter. The decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D (Brussels II Revised: Contact)</span> 2008 1 FLR 516 shows that the means of challenging a decision is by an appeal. I do not have the exact date of registration by the Senior District Judge but I am assured that this happened very recently. Grounds for non-recognition of a judgment of this kind are set out at Article 23 of Brussels II Revised. There are 7 grounds for non-recognition and the Mother relies upon two of them, namely (c) and (d). The intention behind these grounds for non-recognition is clearly to prevent the receiving court being required to enforce an order that was made without one party having had the opportunity to be heard in relation to the judgment.  </p>

Some of these have been translated with the Romanian originals, others are only in Romanian but I am satisfied that with the assistance of the Romanian speakers in Court it is possible to understand the substance of the documents. </p>

If I felt that the picture was clouded, I would not hesitate to adjourn this hearing to allow Father and Mother to present formal written arguments. However, as I came to understand the situation better it became clear to me that the position here is quite clear. The combination of documents and information provided by the Father very strongly suggests that the Mother has been well aware of what is going on in the Romanian Courts and she has had every opportunity to put her case before the judges there. </p>

	    <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in">That is not the end of the matter. On 5 April 2013 there is to be a hearing in the Romanian Court at which both parents will be represented by way of an appeal by the Mother against the decision which is at the root of the registration. It would be wrong for this court to allow the Romanian order to be enforced ahead of that hearing in case the Romanian Court on that occasion should think it right to change its decision. Therefore, I place a stay on any application to enforce the Romanian Order until 19 April 2013 to allow the parties to adjust to the decision taken in Romania. </p>

It is not likely to be in his best interests to live with one parent, whoever that is, and see nothing of the other parent, so I hope that the parents will now start to treat each other with some respect for  the sake of their son. </p>
