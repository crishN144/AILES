Before she had children she worked.  Now she is, in her term, a housewife.  The father is in his early thirties.  He is in full time work.  They live in a small house, which they own.  It is obvious that their home is well run, well maintained, and a source of pleasure and justified pride both to them and to their children.  The children described to me how their father, assisted by their mother, had partitioned the first floor bedroom to make a separate room for each child, of which the children are fond and proud.</span></p>

They later married.  Their son, B, is now aged 11.  Their daughter, A, is now aged 10.  The father said that they had what everyone wants, one of each, and it was pretty much perfect.  Although the mother has suffered some mild episodes of depression in the past, for which she has on occasions been prescribed, and taken, antidepressants, there was nothing at all about this family to attract the slightest attention, worry or concern.  All the indications were, and are, that the parents and children were a well functioning, happy and close knit family, in which the children thrived and performed well at school, save that at one stage A was the victim of some bullying at school.</span></p>

There is now no suggestion that it was other than a typical childhood accident during normal play, but she had some bleeding in her external genital area, and her parents, who are very attentive to their children, took her to A&amp;E.  The contemporary notes of the registrar, Dr A. J. Downes, are now at bundle pages D.256 to 259.  A full account of falling off the wall was given to the doctor by both the parents and A.  She had a small laceration in her labia with some bruising, and other minor bruises and grazes.  The registrar considered that the "injury seems to be related to fall off wall", and A was permitted  to return home.</span></p>

At that examination Dr Skelton noted, now at bundle page D.259, that A gave a "clear history" as previously given to Dr Downes.  The labia was sore, but the laceration was external only.  Dr Skelton examined A frog-legged with a bright light.  Her hymen, genitalia and anus were all recorded as normal.  The recorded impression of Dr Skelton was that the injury was accidental, with no internal damage, and no follow up was required.</span></p>

It has no relevance at all to the subsequent concern as to sexual abuse, save this.  Unusually, and fortuitously because of the accident, A's anus and genitalia were examined by a specialist paediatrician in August 2005 and were then normal.</span></p>

On Monday 17 October 2005, after A had taken off her underpants, her mother saw a small patch of what she thought was blood in them.  She showed them at once to the father.  They decided to take A at once to A&amp;E.  They took the pants with them, but unfortunately the examining doctor did not make any record of the extent or appearance of the bloodstain.  There is now no available evidence, save what the parents each say.  They have consistently used words like "slight", "tiny", "a small amount".  At paragraph 4 of his written statement made on 15 May 2007, now at bundle page B.12, the father said it was "a small circle less than an inch".  In her oral evidence the mother said it was a small amount, about the size of a 5p piece.  It did, however, stain through to the outside of the pants.</span></p>

Meanwhile, on Wednesday 19 October, the mother saw another similar small bloodstain in A's pants.  Again she showed this to the father.  When they attended for the examination on 20 October the parents took both pairs of pants with them.  Once again there is, unfortunately, no medical record of the extent or appearance of the stains.  The pants were handed back to the mother who, very reasonably and understandably, then washed them, and they are no longer available.</span></p>

Her report is now at bundle pages C.1 to C.3.  A was "a little thin for her height.  Her general examination was normal, but she had a number of bruises on her body ..."  In the opinion of Dr Harty her "hymen was abnormal.  It was gaping with separation of her legs, and the hymen itself had a smooth rolled edge.  There were no specific tears in the hymen.  Anal examination was normal."</span></p>

In her notes, now at bundle page D.236, Dr Harty recorded that the hymen had a rolled edge, and was thinner on the right than on the left. Although Dr Harty clearly examined the anus (see photographs on J.12 and J.13) there is no record, so far as I am aware, of her impression of it.  I presume that if she had considered that the anus was abnormal she would have recorded that fact and reported it in her later report to the GP, now at bundle page C.5.</span></p>

But it seems that something was said about the care being given to A that led her, A, to become worried that she might be taken into care.  After the appointment on 9 November A became anxious and unhappy, and off her food.  The worries were also communicated to B (perhaps by A herself) because one morning B (at that time aged about nine and a half) told his parents in distress that he thought he and A might "have had sex".  Although in paragraph 5 of his much later statement dated 15 May 2007 (now at bundle page B.13) the father attributed this event to the morning of 9 November itself, it seems clear that that date is wrong, and the contemporary note of Dr Hobbs (now at bundle page D.241) attributes it to 11 November, i.e. two days after the meeting with Dr Harty.</span></p>

The evidence comes entirely from the parents, and they are quite satisfied, and I am quite satisfied, that B and A had not in fact "had sex" with each other.  They were merely playing playfully and appropriately, and fully clad in pyjamas.  I have deliberately raised and explored during the course of the hearing whether, if A has been penetrated or abused, B might have been responsible (whether digitally or with some implement such as a pencil).  However, I am now quite sure, and now find and record to the point of being sure, that B has never touched or interfered inappropriately with his sister.  If anyone has abused her, it is not B.</span></p>

Two notes by Dr Harty, each dated 23.11.2005, now at bundle page D.239, are revealing.  First, she records that on 23/11 she spoke to A's teacher to enquire about any recent changes in her behaviour or toilet habits.  Dr Harty records that the school had received a letter from the parents saying that A had passed blood, and that they, the parents, wanted to be informed if this occurred again.  The significance is that this appears to be the act of caring, concerned, but wholly innocent parents.  It seems improbable that an abusing parent would positively alert the school to be on the lookout for blood in the underclothes.</span></p>

A was not physically examined on this occasion.  Neither the notes of Dr Hobbs at bundle pages D.241 to 242, nor the report dated 5 December 2005 from Dr Harty to the GP, now at bundle page C.6, record any particular diagnosis or outcome from the meeting, other than a further appointment made for 20 December.  However, the mother said in oral evidence that the father had had to leave during the consultation to collect B from school.  She said that after the father left the doctors said something about sexual abuse.  This made her very uncomfortable, and she felt that it wrong and inappropriate that Dr Hobbs should say this to her on her own.  It left her shocked and tearful.</span></p>

The thighs and upper arms are common sites for self inflicted injury, and the absence of other lesions elsewhere on the body would mitigate against infection or a clotting disorder.  It would also be unusual for such a rash to be painful, which is how A described these bruises.  Self inflicted injury is an important indicator of abuse in a child.

Although a general paediatrician, she is a designated doctor for child protection, and has a particular interest in, among other matters, child sexual abuse.  She is now based in Bradford, but for seven years she was a consultant at Leeds General Infirmary.  She had been trained there by Dr Hobbs, and she was still working there as part of a team, including Dr Hobbs, in March 2007.

Dr Skelton lacked the complete independence that is required for a second opinion in these sorts of circumstances.  She was, in effect, being asked to review and express an opinion upon the previous opinion of someone who was a more senior colleague, then working daily in the same hospital, and who had been her own teacher.  Further, examination and assessment for physical signs of sexual abuse clearly involves considerable subjectivity, both in examining techniques (e.g. the degree of traction applied when parting the labia, and particularly the buttocks to examine the anus) and in forming a medical opinion.</span></p>

This examination was video recorded as a moving dynamic examination through the colposcope.  It is available on disc, and subsequent experts, and I myself, have been able to view it several times.  I mention that it became quite apparent that there is some variation in colour and appearances, depending on precisely which of the several available discs is used, and upon what computer it is displayed.  (This is relevant in particular to whether stool may be seen within the anal canal.  Viewing one disc, Dr&#160;Skelton said she could not see any stool.  Viewing another disc, Professor Heger said she could see stool, and I myself could see to what Professor Heger was referring.  When Dr&#160;Crawford later gave oral evidence it became clear that she happens to have viewed more than one disc.  In one disc she can, and in another disc she cannot, discern stool.  The relevance in turn of stool is that if there is stool present the anus may, in the opinion of some experts, tend to dilate or open more readily than if there is not.)</span></p>

A does not appear to have any clinical signs or history of any other cause for this anal dilatation.  Namely, she is not severely constipated or has any neuromuscular weakness.  Taken in conjunction with the episodes of bleeding, in my opinion the most likely explanation for this whole picture is that A has been sexually abused chronically, over a long period, both anally and probably vaginally ...

In her statement dated 22.8.2007, now at bundle pages B.30 to 32, Mrs. C makes plain that the parents had always kept her fully informed about the situation regarding A, and indeed she had attended the Child Protection Conferences, but the parents now asked her to speak directly to the children, and she did so.  She says at paragraph 7 of her statement that she asked both children what they thought had happened, and on all occasions A said that nothing had happened to her.

The children have lived with their grandparents ever since, now for eleven months.  They have been permitted to see their parents on four days a week for about one a half or two hours a day, and always strictly supervised by a social worker or similar person.  The present proceedings were commenced on 20 April 2007.  A final date was originally fixed for a fact finding hearing on 29 August 2007 with three days allowed.  However, that hearing was postponed on the application of the parents to enable further medical evidence to be obtained, including evidence from Professor Astrid Heger in California.  A fresh hearing date was fixed for 28 November 2007, this time with eight days allowed.  In the light of the later report from Professor Heger, it was then considered that the case should be transferred to the High Court, and also that yet further dermatological evidence should be obtained, so the present two week hearing came to be fixed.  The delay seems unconscionable but, with hindsight, it has been a price worth paying in order to obtain the exhaustive and wide ranging evidence which is now available.  Any fact finding hearing in August 2007 would almost inevitably have concluded that A had been sexually abused, and the further evidence which has been obtained since November has been very important indeed.</span></p>

However, Mrs. Bradley submitted that, "The integrity of the evidence of Professor Heger is in question", and submitted in general terms that she is someone whom parents seek to instruct in cases such as this because she is known or believed to be sympathetic to parents and partisan in her opinions.

She said, "It is easier to see what I believe to be a labial adhesion at 6 o'clock of the posterior fourchette", in an image taken on 18.12.06 later identified as image 003.JPG on bundle page J.31.  She was referring to the slightly whiter or lighter coloured line which is indeed visible at 6 o'clock, as she said.  By the stage of her report at the top of bundle page C.94 she was referring to "the labial adhesion" in a way that implied its definite presence.  In the light of later dermatological evidence, in particular that of Dr Yell, Professor Heger has now accepted that what she was referring to is not the residue of a labial adhesion.  Mrs. Bradley submitted, in effect, that Professor Heger had deliberately put the weight of her experience and reputation behind a firm suggestion of labial adhesions, which she, Professor Heger, must have known from the outset was speculative, if not spurious.</span></p>

Unwittingly, I gave her the opportunity to do so.  As she was giving her evidence via video link from California, with only a partial view of the courtroom on her screen, I invited the parents (who were rather lost in the sea of people in the long and narrow courtroom) to stand up and make themselves conspicuous, so Professor Heger could clearly see the parents to whose case her evidence undoubtedly gave much support.

In my view, however, these very strong criticisms need to be seen in context.  I agree that Professor Heger gave more weight and firmness in her written report to the suggestion of labial adhesions than any of the appearances in the images warranted, but her "retreat" showed an appropriate response to the more specialist evidence of the dermatologist, Dr Yell, as it emerged.  Her oral evidence was given under circumstances of considerable personal pressure upon Professor Heger.  On one day of the hearing she had effectively been up most of the night in California listening in to oral evidence given here during our day.  On the final day of her own evidence (which, for logistical reasons, had to be given in two tranches) she began giving evidence at 2 p.m. English time, but 6 a.m. Californian time, by which time she had had, of course, to get up and travel some distance in to her work place.  Her evidence was at times characterised by impatience and a briskness of manner, but her impatience was a consequence of, not the cause of, her own firm opinion that all the images are within the range of normality, and her briskness of manner probably reflects a generally brisk and dynamic personality.  Her comments to the parents were a reflection of her own informality and of the conclusion that she had certainly already reached that the images do not indicate sexual abuse.</span></p>

Research into normal anal anatomy in children reports that reflex anal dilatation occurs frequently in children selected for non-abuse; venous distention occurs in almost all children if they are in a knee/chest position for even a short period of time, and that the pectinate line is normally irregular, causing that distortion of the anal opening.  I believe that the medical examiners in this case have relied heavily on 'reflex anal dilatation' as diagnostic of sexual abuse.  This is a common finding (up to over 49%) in children selected for non-abuse.  There is no research comparing children who report anal penetration with those who are selected for non-abuse that supports the use of reflex anal dilatation as a sensitive or specific finding for sexual abuse."</span></p>

Dr Sheila Clark is a consultant dermatologist based in Leeds, who was asked to examine A and report specifically on the rash or bruises observed and photographed in September 2006.  On 1 October 2007, when Dr Clark was taking a history from A and her parents, A spontaneously said that on the day of that rash she and her class had been slapping their thighs over an appreciable period, in time with the music during a music lesson.  Dr Clark observed in her report, now at bundle page C.84, that, "A's parents, while A recalled this incident, appeared to have no previous knowledge of it."  Subsequent enquiries made by Dr Clark with the school revealed that in music class at about that time A and the other children had indeed been slapping their thighs to several songs as part of a lesson.</span></p>

Dr Yell later explained in her oral evidence that endogonous eczema "can pop up anywhere in the body".  On the day of the examination A was dermographic, that is, her skin wheals easily with rubbing.  She had (on that day) eczema of the dorsum of her hands, with some cracking.

It tends to presuppose that all the pieces can be fitted together, and that there is a "full picture" to be made.  By presupposing that each piece of information does fit somewhere in the picture, it may ascribe some weight or significance to each piece of information and obscure the important point that 0 plus 0 plus 0 still equals 0.  If the jigsaw metaphor is helpful at all, then, in my view, it is important to think of a pile of jigsaw pieces in which pieces from more than one jigsaw have been muddled up.  There may be pieces which, on examination, do not fit the jigsaw under construction at all, but which require to be discarded or placed on one side.</span></p>

Whilst that may be mathematically true, it is, in my view, dangerous and equally mistaken to adopt so mathematical an approach.  Professor Heger said during her oral evidence, "To me if one finding does not support a diagnosis, I credit that finding as zero."  I cannot and do not accept that at all.  In a case like this, individual pieces of information cannot be viewed in isolation.  To say that a given piece of information standing alone is not probative of anything, does not necessarily mean that it has a value of zero.  Each piece of information does need to be weighed and assessed in the context of all the other pieces of information.</span></p>

Professor Heger stressed the clear appearance of tenting on images such as those in March 2006, at J.19, 20 and 21, and in September 2006, at J.25 to 27.  "Tenting" is the stretched skin around the anus which is caused by the examiner pulling apart the buttocks so as to obtain a view of the anus.  The essence of the dispute is that if the examiner himself pulls the buttocks apart too firmly (i.e. with too much traction) that very process may open the anus and create the appearance of dilation or laxity.  When Dr Crawford conducted her examination on 16 August 2007 she did, as she said, deliberately apply excessive or undue traction, but she considered the anus to be normal.  The images actually recorded of her examination, at bundle J.41 and, in particular, J.42 (image 012.JPG) are remarkably similar to the images in particular at bundle page J.25 and 26 of the examination performed by Dr&#160;Hobbs in September 2006, when he concluded that the anus was abnormal.  There are similar appearances of tenting, and a very similar shape to the anus.  In contrast, there is no sign of any tenting at all in the images of the anus on 18 December 2006, at J.33 to J.35, upon which date Dr Hobbs considered the anus to be normal.</span></p>

I am well aware that it would have been impossible for A to give an indication to me in the presence of B that she had indeed been abused.  I therefore attach no discrete significance to the fact that she did not do so.  When we were talking about the question whether A had been touched, she did become tearful.  I lack the expertise to say whether that was because she is in truth hiding what she knows to be a dreadful secret; or because she has been asked so often about it, her denials appear to her not to be being believed, and she feels responsible for all the turmoil to her family.  Both children said that they love their parents very much and just want to go home.</span></p>

I need not make any detailed reference to the law.  These are care proceedings brought by the local authority.  They depend entirely upon proof that A has indeed been sexually abused in some way.  The burden of proof is upon the local authority.  The standard of proof is the civil standard of the balance of probability.  I am quite clear that the local authority have not discharged that burden.  I am not satisfied that it is more probable than not that A has been sexually abused.  That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the case.</span></p>

I can of course only do so if, after due consideration, that is the true state of my mind.  The difficulty lies in being positive about a negative.  Since there are "worrying" features about the case, it is impossible to eliminate all doubt.  However, viewing every aspect of the case as a whole, I do feel sure, and so find, that A has not been sexually interfered with or abused at all.</span></p>

The doctors start with their physical observations and with the reports of blood in the underpants.  I start the other way round.  For reasons which I have already given, if A has been abused at all she can only realistically have been abused by one or other (or both) of her parents.  If there is any medical evidence of abuse at all, it is of repeated abuse ongoing over all or much of the period from (at the latest) October 2005 (when the blood was observed) until March 2007 (when Dr Skelton carried out her examination).  Throughout most of that period, and certainly from late November 2005, the parents claim (and the children corroborate) that they were kept under close watch by their parents.  There cannot have been any other abuser than one of the parents.</span></p>

But there is no data in that document, or of which I am aware, to undermine the proposition that a majority of parents in our society do not sexually abuse their children.  The starting point must be that it is improbable that a parent of otherwise good character would sexually abuse, or has sexually abused, his or her child in the sort of deliberately penetrative way under consideration in this case.  (Less serious forms of touching such as kissing or stroking the external genital area are not what is under consideration.  If there has been abuse at all, it must clearly have involved deliberate penetration by a finger, penis or object of the vagina and/or the anus.)</span></p>

As I have already described, from late November 2005 and, in particular, from 21 March 2006, both these parents were well aware that they and A were under intense and continuing scrutiny, and that there would inevitably be further follow up medical examinations.  They would have known that there was a high risk of any sexual abuse being exposed.</span></p>

She has denied it to her mother, to her headteacher, Mrs.C, to social workers and to her guardian.  Two different social workers, Miss Ali and Miss Ellwood, in different periods of time (May 2006 and January/February 2007) have done specialised work designed to enable her to disclose or hint at abuse, or, at any rate, to reveal or indicate any underlying fears or insecurity.  She revealed and indicated nothing.  On the contrary, she gave every indication of being a happy and well integrated member of a happy and well functioning family.</span></p>

Every observation of these parents is of caring and attentive parents.  Out of their care for their children they have taken steps which might obviously expose any abuse instead of attempting to cover it up.  Leaving aside the fall from the wall in August 2005, this whole case only began because the parents at once took their child to A&amp;E when she had the smallest of stains of blood.  That seems to me to be the act of a caring and innocent parent.  If the mother was the abuser, she could so easily have washed the pants and kept quiet, at least unless and until repeated or significant bleeding occurred which she could not ignore.  If the father was the abuser, he could so easily have suggested to the mother that they need not go at once to A&amp;E, but wait and see if there was further bleeding, but he did not do so.  As I have said, there is evidence that in November 2005 the parents wrote to the school, positively encouraging the school to be alert for blood in A's underpants.  This seems more consistent with a concerned and innocent parent than with an abusing parent with something to hide.  </span></p>

They led Dr Skelton to the view that A was a very disturbed girl at bundle page C.36, and were an important part of Dr Crawford's constellation of symptoms, at bundle page C.56.  In my view, they have now been innocently explained by the evidence of Dr Clark, and information from the school.  Of course, the alternative more sinister explanation of self harming may also be possible, but there is simply no warrant for assuming that explanation when the alternative explanation exists and is credible.  So this, too, does not belong to this jigsaw at all, and should be laid to one side.</span></p>

Clearly these two aspects of the case do need to be considered together.  Dr Yell's evidence provides a credible, possible, non-abusive explanation for the presence of the blood, but cannot go further than that.  It does not, in my view, reduce the presence of the blood to a nought or zero factor.  Professor Heger herself said, "The one thing that is concerning is the blood in the underwear."  Whilst it may have been the result of small erosions, it may also have been the result of abuse.  But it certainly is not diagnostic of abuse.</span></p>

By the end of their evidence, Dr Hobbs and Dr Crawford considered or accepted that the genitalia were normal, or within normal limits.  Dr Skelton was more guarded, but certainly does not regard the genital appearances as diagnostic of abuse.  As I have said, all three English paediatricians are much more concerned about the anal appearances, but the highest they put it is that they are suggestive or supportive of abuse.  Undoubtedly, if there was any credible account by A of penetrative anal abuse, then the anal appearances would be consistent with, and supportive of, that account.  I cannot regard the evidence of Professor Heger as outweighing or negating the opinions, in particular, of Dr Hobbs and Dr Skelton, who each personally examined A and considered that they respectively observed abnormality.

When Dr&#160;Hobbs examined the anus on 18 December 2006 he considered it to be normal and healed or healing, yet there is a marked absence of tenting in the images of that examination when contrasted with that on 13 September 2006.  On the known facts of the case, it seems to me especially unlikely that if one parent had been anally abusing A, and had then stopped in time for the anus to repair and heal between September and December 2006, that parent would have resumed the abuse between December 2006 and March 2007.  The parents knew in December that a further appointment had been fixed for March, and the period was one of intense investigation by the Social Services.  Miss Ellwood carried out her work in January and February 2007.</span></p>

But in August 2007 Dr Crawford deliberately applied excessive traction and considered the anus in fact to be normal.  I do not positively find that the observed signs of abnormality in the earlier examinations were in fact the product of too much traction, but I consider that there is a real possibility that they were.</span></p>

I do not reduce these factors to the value of zero or nought.  But I do consider that they are so heavily outweighed by all the other factors to which I have referred that I am judicially sure that A and her parents are right, and that no abuse has in fact occurred.

Very important indeed is the account of the child, considered, of course, in an age appropriate way.  An express denial is no less an account than is a positive account of abuse.  It is also, in my opinion, very important to take fully into account the account and demeanour of the parents, and an assessment of the family circumstances and general quality of the parenting.  The medical assessment of physical signs of sexual abuse has a considerably subjective element, and unless there is clearly diagnostic evidence of abuse (e.g. the presence of semen or a foreign body internally) purely medical assessments and opinions should not be allowed to predominate.  Even 20 years after the Cleveland Inquiry, I wonder whether its lessons have fully been learned.</span></p>
