	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In this matter I am concerned with an application under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to revoke an adoption order made on 8 November 2019 in respect of Z.  Z is represented by Mr Alan Cryne through her children&#8217;s guardian, Daniel Yartey.  The application is made by the birth father of Z, HX (hereafter &#8216;the birth father&#8217;) represented by Ms Christina Omideyi of counsel.   The application to revoke the adoption order is supported by the birth mother, Y (hereafter &#8216;the birth mother&#8217;), represented by Mr Jason Green of counsel.  The application is opposed by the local authority, the adoption agency in this case, represented by Ms Julie Doyle of counsel, and by the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  In light of the position of the local authority and Children&#8217;s Guardian, I did not consider it necessary to join the adoptive parents as parties to these proceedings, although they are aware of the birth father&#8217;s application. </p>

In her statement in support of the birth father&#8217;s application to revoke the adoption order the mother now contends that she did not provide the birth father&#8217;s contact details because she did not have them and did not know his whereabouts. </p>

Within this context, the local authority made efforts to contact the maternal grandmother, again through the Red Cross.  Once the maternal grandmother&#8217;s details were obtained, the social worker wrote to the maternal grandmother on 20 July 2017 advising her of the proceedings and asking whether she wished to be assessed as a potential carer.   The maternal grandmother subsequently put herself forward to be assessed as a potential carer for Z.

The birth mother advised that the birth father was a 70 year old man who she had been forced to marry by way of a polygamous marriage.  She further alleged that were Z to be returned to Uganda there was a chance that her birth father would be made aware and would abduct Z, the birth mother asserting that the birth father was a dangerous man.  The birth mother asserted that prior to the birth of Z she had suffered two miscarriages during her forced marriage, in respect of which the birth father became angry and his other wives accused her of having demons.  The birth mother further asserted that Z had had to be cared for by the maternal grandmother following her birth for Z&#8217;s own protection.  The birth mother asserted that, ultimately, she had escaped what she described as her traumatic marriage.  She again asserted that the birth father would present a risk to Z were Z to be returned to Uganda although she did not specify the nature of that risk.  The assessment of the birth mother summarises the information she provided in respect of the birth father as follows: </p>

Through the Skeleton Argument prepared by Ms Omideyi, the birth father asserts that much of the information provided by the mother in respect of him was inaccurate.  In his statement in support of his application to revoke the adoption order, the birth father further asserts that he and the birth mother had an arranged marriage and had met on the day of the wedding. The birth father points out that he is not in his seventies, denies that he is a dangerous individual and denies that Z was conceived as the result of rape. </p>

The local authority advised the High Commission of a forthcoming hearing in November 2017 at which they would be able to make representations.  Ms Doyle conceded during her oral submissions that the local authority did not make any specific request of the Ugandan High Commission for assistance in locating the birth father as named on Z&#8217;s handwritten birth certificate and described in some detail by the mother during her social work assessment.  Indeed, the letter makes no mention of the birth father at all.  No response was received from the Ugandan High Commission.

It provides the status of the adopted child and of the adoptive parents. The effect of an adoption order is to extinguish any parental responsibility of the natural parents. Once an adoption order has been made, the adoptive parents stand to one another and the child in precisely the same relationship as if they were his legitimate parents, and the child stands in the same relationship to them as to legitimate parents. Once an adoption order has been made the adopted child ceases to be the child of his previous parent and becomes the child for all purposes of the adopters as though he were their legitimate child.&#8221;</p>

The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents.&#8221; </p>

The authorities show, I am sure correctly, that where there has been a failure of natural justice, and a party with a right to be heard on the application for the adoption order has not been notified of the hearing or has not for some other reason been heard, the court has jurisdiction to set aside the order and so make good the failure of natural justice. I would also have little hesitation in holding that the court could set aside an adoption order which was shown to have been obtained by fraud.&#8221; </p>

(An Infant)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] 1 QB 385" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] 1 Q.B. 385</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">In re R.A.

Those cases concern a failure to effect proper service of the adoption proceedings on a natural parent or ignorance of the parent of the existence of the adoption proceedings. In each case the application to set aside the order was made reasonably expeditiously. It is fundamental to the making of an adoption order that the natural parent should be informed of the application so that she can give or withhold her consent. If she has no knowledge at all of the application then, obviously, a fundamental injustice is perpetrated. I would prefer myself to regard those cases not as cases where the order has been set aside by reason of a procedural irregularity, although that has certainly occurred, but as cases where natural justice has been denied because the natural parent who may wish to challenge the adoption has never been told that it is going to happen. Whether an adoption order can be set aside by reason of fraud which is unrelated to a natural parent's ignorance of the proceedings was not a subject which was relevant to the present appeal...As the case law stood, certainly in 1976, the powers of the court to set aside an adoption order as known to Parliament would, in my view, have been limited to the power to set aside such an order on the basis of a breach of natural justice such as I have described above, and not an inherent power to set aside an adoption order by reason of a mistake or misrepresentation.&#8221; </p>

In my judgment Mr. Holman, who appeared as <span style="font-style:italic">amicus curiae</span>, is right when he submits that it would gravely damage the lifelong commitment of adopters to their adoptive children if there is a possibility of the child, or indeed the parents, subsequently challenging the validity of the order.&#8221; </p>

For present purposes it is enough to draw attention to a few key propositions: (i) Under the inherent jurisdiction, the High Court can, in an appropriate case, revoke an adoption order. In relation to this jurisdictional issue I unhesitatingly prefer the view shared by Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order)</span>, para 6, and Pauffley J in <span style="font-style:italic">PK v K</span>, para 4, to the contrary view of Parker J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re PW (Adoption)</span>, para 1. (ii) The effect of revoking an adoption order is to restore the status quo ante: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (Adoption Order: Set Aside and Leave to Oppose)</span>, paras 11&#8211;12. (iii) However, &#8220;The law sets a very high bar against any challenge to an adoption order. An adoption order once lawfully and properly made can be set aside &#8216;only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances&#8217;&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (A Child) (Adoption: Placement Order)</span>, para 44, quoting <span style="font-style:italic">Webster v Norfolk County Council</span>, para 149. As Pauffley J said in <span style="font-style:italic">PK v K</span>, para 14: &#8220;public policy considerations ordinarily militate against revoking properly made adoption orders and rightly so.&#8221; (iv) An adoption order regularly made, that is, an adoption order made in circumstances where there was no procedural irregularity, no breach of natural justice and no fraud, cannot be set aside either on the ground of mere mistake (<span style="font-style:italic">In re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside)</span>) or even if there has been a miscarriage of justice (<span style="font-style:italic">Webster v Norfolk County Council</span>). (v) The fact that the circumstances are highly exceptional does not of itself justify revoking an adoption order. After all, one would hope that the kind of miscarriage of justice exemplified by <span style="font-style:italic">Webster v Norfolk County Council</span> is highly exceptional, yet the attempt to have the adoption order set aside in that case failed.&#8221; </p>

Pursuant FPR r 12.8 following the issue of proceedings notice must be given to all respondents.  Further, pursuant to FPR r 12.4(2) the applicant must also give notice to any person who holds or is believed to hold parental responsibility for the child under the law of another State where that parental responsibility subsists in accordance with Art 16 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  In this context, FPR r 12.4(3) imposes on the applicant and the other respondents to the proceedings to provide to the court such details as they possess as to the whereabouts of any person they believe to hold parental responsibility for the child.  With respect to proceedings for a placement order, pursuant to FPR r 14.3 every parent with parental responsibility will be a respondent to an application for a placement order and FPR r 14.4 again requires notice be given to any person who holds or is believed to hold parental responsibility for the child under the law of another State and imposes a duty on the applicant and the other respondents to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As is clear from the authorities that I have set out above, the adoption order in respect of Z is intended to be legally permanent.  The effect of the adoption order made on 8 November 2019 is to extinguish the parental responsibility of the birth mother and birth father.  The adoptive parents are now Z&#8217;s legal parents and Z has ceased to be the child of the birth mother and birth father. Further, and within this context, now the adoption order has been made there is a public interest in not permitting the revocation of that adoption order in respect of Z for the reasons I have set out above.  I must bear in mind that this public interest is a robust and durable one given the strong interest in encouraging the lifelong commitment of adopters to their adoptive children.  The consequences of undermining this, both for individual adoptive placements and on the supply of prospective adopters available, by allowing the revocation of a lawfully made adoption order absent a situation of highly exceptional circumstances would be grave.  Within this context, as set out above, the birth father has a very high hurdle to surmount in seeking to persuade the court to revoke the adoption order.  Namely, one of high exceptionality. </p>

In particular, the bold assertion in Ms Doyle&#8217;s Skeleton Argument that, in the context of those proceedings, &#8220;the local authority made repeated efforts to identify the whereabouts of the [birth] father and engage him in some form of assessment&#8221; is entirely unsupported by the evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Rather, the papers before the court demonstrate a marked lack of rigor and urgency during the care and placement proceedings with respect to the need to ascertain the identity and whereabouts of the birth father and a pre-occupation with the birth mother&#8217;s account to the exclusion of any efforts by the local authority or the then Children&#8217;s Guardian independently to ascertain that information.  By September 2017 the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian had a birth certificate for Z stating the name of her birth father, a description from the birth mother as to the birth father&#8217;s occupation which, it transpires, was accurate and a clear indication from the birth mother that the maternal family had been involved in, or were at least aware of, the arrangements for the marriage of the birth mother to the birth father.  Notwithstanding this, no attempt was made by the local authority or the Children&#8217;s Guardian to request the Ugandan authorities or the Ugandan High Commission in London to assist in identifying the man named on the birth certificate as &#8220;XH&#8221;, the birth father asserting in his statement that he is both registered with the Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs and holds a Ugandan passport and driving licence.  Nor does it appear that the maternal grandmother was ever asked by the local authority or the Children&#8217;s Guardian to assist by providing any details she could provide regarding the identity and whereabouts of the birth father, named as he was on Z&#8217;s birth certificate and described as he was by the birth mother.  These would have been &#8220;reasonable steps&#8221; to take in the circumstances and the fact that such enquiries concerned a foreign national did not absolve the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian from attempting them independent of the position adopted by the mother.  Whilst I accept that the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian will have been given pause by the graphic nature of the birth mother&#8217;s description of her marriage and the conception of Z, these matters likewise did not absolve the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian from attempting the enquiries I have outlined. </p>

Each case must be decided on its own facts but, in the context of the deficiencies in the enquiries of the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian that I have identified, I again note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Webster</span> the fact that the children in that case had been denied the opportunity to argue that they should grow up together with their parents as a family in breach of the Art 8 rights and the fact that the parents had been wrongly accused of physically abusing one of their children and three of their children had been removed wrongly and permanently from their care, did not amount to sufficient justification to revoke the adoption orders made in that case, notwithstanding that the procedure that resulted in the public law orders that preceded that adoption orders was fundamentally flawed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Whilst the birth father now contends that he was not given a proper opportunity to participate in the adoption proceedings to the extent that a fundamental breach of natural justice has occurred, in these circumstances the evidence before the court simply does not bear out that contention.   The adoption order in respect of Z was made on 8 November 2019.  From June 2019 the birth father was aware that there were proceedings on foot in the United Kingdom and that within those proceedings it was proposed that Z be adopted.  The birth father instructed solicitors in Uganda and those solicitors indicated to the court in July 2019 that they were instructed to accept service of the adoption proceedings on behalf of the birth father.  Thereafter the birth father was made a party to the adoption proceedings in August 2019 and permitted to file evidence.  Whilst the birth father now contends that his solicitors in Uganda were unaware of these developments I am sceptical of the claim that those solicitors simply did not receive this information from the local authority in circumstances where the emails were sent securely via Egress and show that they were delivered but not opened, where certain of the emails sent by the local authority to the solicitors in Uganda elicited a response and where the local authority followed up a number of its email communications with telephone calls to the solicitors in Uganda, which telephone calls were answered.   Whilst the birth father also relies on the refusal by HHJ Woodward to adjourn the hearing of the <span style="font-style:italic">mother&#8217;s</span> application for permission to oppose the making of an adoption order notwithstanding that his English solicitors were yet to secure legal aid, this does not in my judgment avail the birth father in circumstances where he was granted emergency public funding one month <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the final adoption hearing.  The birth father was granted emergency public funding on 27 September 2019 yet he had still made no application to court, whether for permission to oppose the making of an adoption order or otherwise, over five weeks later when the adoption order was made on 8 November 2019.   </p>

In the circumstances of this case, four months passed between the birth father becoming aware of the proceedings and indicating his wish to care for Z in Uganda and the making of the adoption order.  During that time the birth father had solicitors engaged in Uganda and latterly in this jurisdiction, the father was made a party to the proceedings and directed to file evidence and the birth father had the benefit of an emergency public funding certificate from 27 September 2019.  Notwithstanding this position, at no point in the four months between the date at which he contends he became aware of the plan for adoption and the making of the adoption order did the birth father seek to make any of the applications available to him to oppose the making of that adoption order.  Indeed, the father made no application in respect of Z until 6 February 2020, some 3 months after the adoption order was made and over four months after the grant of an emergency public funding certificate.   </p>

Whilst what constitutes reasonable steps will depend on particular circumstances of the case, methods exist for obtaining information from foreign jurisdictions on the whereabouts of a child&#8217;s parent or parents.  In the absence of an applicable international instrument to facilitate the exchange of such information between jurisdictions, these methods will also include requesting information from the embassy, High Commission or consulate of the relevant foreign country, seeking information via non-government organisations that provide family tracing services, such as the Red Cross, and making enquiries of other known relatives (always taking care that such enquiries not place the parent in question in danger).
