The application is made in sad circumstances, because the respondent surrogate mother, Ms. A, suffered from respiratory arrest during the course of a caesarean section when giving birth. This has left her with a hypoxic brain injury and cognitive impairment.</span></p>

Although he is absolutely fine now, there were some complications during his birth which meant that Mrs. R were advised that a subsequent birth could be risky. For that reason they turned to surrogacy. In May 2023 they met Ms. A online. Ms. A has children of her own, and has also acted as a surrogate for other couples on three previous occasions.  She agreed to act as a surrogate for Mr. and Mrs. R.   The medical arrangements were made in a clinic abroad, and a memorandum containing the surrogacy agreement was drawn up in September although it was not signed (Mrs. R states that this was because all the parties knew that this was not an enforceable agreement but one that had to be done by consent). Mr. and Mrs. R agreed to pay Ms. A the sum of &#163;15,000 in expenses, plus any expenses relating to the birth. The embryo transfer took place in October using Mr. R&#8217;s sperm and Mrs. R&#8217;s eggs. Mr. and Mrs. R are therefore the genetic parents of O.</span></p>

The pregnancy was not an easy one, with Ms. A experiencing a number of bleeds due to a low lying placenta.  When she was 30 weeks pregnant, Ms. A suffered another bleed. She informed Mrs. R of this by text saying &#8216;On way to hospital&#8230;bleeding! I don&#8217;t know if you want to make your way or I can let you know what they say&#8217;.  In the event Mr. and Mrs. R travelled to the hospital, and were informed that Ms. A had been taken to the operating theatre.  They were then told by Ms. A&#8217;s adult daughter that O had been born, but that Ms. A had suffered from a cardiac arrest and the doctors were trying to stabilise her.  O had been taken to the neonatal intensive care unit because he had not been breathing when he was born.</span></p>

In the meantime O was made a ward of court by Moor J on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2024, on the basis that he would be placed in the care of Mr. and Mrs. R.

They did not ask for receipts on the basis that this was a matter of trust.  The Guardian states that she does not believe Mr. and Mrs. R attempted to undermine Ms. A&#8217;s free will or exploit her in any way and invites the court to authorise the payment as compliant with s54 HFEA 2008.</p>

First, the court must carefully scrutinise the evidence as to the efforts which have been made to find her. It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without consent that the court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent. Secondly the court is entitled to take into account any evidence that it has that the woman did actually consent, even if that was before the period of six weeks after the birth, albeit the weight to be attached to that would be limited, and thirdly that the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.

I am satisfied that the question as to whether the relevant person is incapable of giving agreement pursuant to s54(7) is a question of fact to be determined by the court, giving the words their ordinary meaning, and that the capacity concerned is wider than that defined in the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  The court is likely to wish to consider the person&#8217;s ability to understand the information relevant to the decision, to retain it, to use and weigh it, and to communicate it, but may take into account other issues too.</span></p>
