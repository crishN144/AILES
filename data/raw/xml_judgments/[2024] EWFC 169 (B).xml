This was entirely refuted by M via her counsel, who pointed out that F has not disclosed anything about his own employment, nor does he contribute financially at all toward the children. Ms KELSEY submitted that the argument as to this point by F was not relevant, and M provided evidence that she had previously run a successful jewellery business in London, and intended to revive this in the future. She submitted that M would be closer in terms of rail links to the City than the current home at East Grinstead. Ms KELSEY pointed out that F had not made any counter proposal as to financially supporting the children. F maintained that he had recently moved to the UK from the USA and had no financial history here, he was working three jobs whilst trying to establish himself financially and was, broadly, not in a position to contribute significantly to the financial support at this point. </span></p>

M on the other hand had addressed the issue that the children and her are currently living at the largesse of family and she wanted to move into her own home and to help the children grow in that home with an established base. I take it as axiomatic that moving house can be stressful for an adult or younger person, but at ages 3 and 2, I had no evidence before me that the house move would cause the children any harm. I note that they will be further away from their grandparents, but again the journey is only 28 miles, and there are many grandparents who live much further away from their grandchildren and who still make the effort to spend time with them despite this. I heard evidence as to the beautiful and spacious home which M has bought for the family in Esher, and took the view that it, in conjunction with the schools she has secured, and the locality itself, would provide a wonderful environment for the children growing up. Finally, I heard evidence that the commute into London is around an hour less than in East Grinstead, so the children and M would be able to visit the City relatively easily to enjoy excursions there going forward. </span></p>

It is to her credit that she has secured a home and good schools for them, and there was evidence of lots of time spent working out where to live and which schools to attend, and that M had reached out to F to try to gain his input in the matter, without success.
