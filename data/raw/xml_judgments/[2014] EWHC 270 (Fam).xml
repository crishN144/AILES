	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am giving this judgment a fortnight or so after the conclusion of the appeal hearing for three reasons. Firstly because the case raises important issues of practice and procedure during the earliest stages of care proceedings; secondly because significant irregularities have emerged as to the way in which the Justices had compiled their Facts and Reasons; and thirdly so I could discover, by delving into the court file, why the hearing of the appeal only came to be listed more than two months after issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother, EL, is 32 years old. She had a sad, unhappy childhood and became a &#8216;looked after&#8217; child during adolescence. In 1996, when only 15, she formed a relationship with a 26 year old man who came to be the father of her elder four children. She and the children&#8217;s father abused alcohol, took illicit substances and there was domestic violence &#8211; both were seen as instigators. Their children were born between 1998 and 2001. There was local authority involvement, Child Protection Plans and eventually proceedings were brought which resulted in residence orders in favour of the father of those children together with a 12 month supervision order. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence is that until she went to [a specialist treatment unit in the north of England] last August, she and the four older children were &#8216;messaging&#8217; one another every day. Since then, she has had telephone contact when they are around at the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home visiting.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s younger three children were born between 2006 and 2009 when she was in a relationship with another man. Again there was local authority involvement resulting from the mother&#8217;s longstanding issues with illicit substances &#8211; heroin, crack cocaine &#8211; and alcohol. Her then partner was also taking heroin and crack cocaine. The mother&#8217;s seventh child was born in May 2009 withdrawing from drugs. There was local authority intervention. He was made the subject of an emergency protection order and placed with foster parents.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the two older children of the sibling group were also subject to proceedings, initially no orders were made because their parents demonstrated a willingness to engage with the local authority so as to effect change. In 2010, a random drugs test of the father, positive for cocaine, led the local authority to issue further proceedings. Ultimately, in March 2012, those two children were returned to their father who, together with the paternal grandmother, looks after them under a residence order. The mother&#8217;s evidence is that she has a good relationship with the father; they talk about the children regularly and, prior to last August, she would take them out, for example, to the park. Now her contact with them is over the telephone and by writing.</p>

When NL was born in October 2013, he showed no signs of withdrawing from drugs. Whilst in the hospital environment, the mother was viewed by the Vulnerabilities Specialist Midwifery Team as having provided good care to NL. She was &#8220;accepting of all advice&#8230; reacts well to baby&#8217;s demands.&#8221; EL and her baby were said to be &#8220;bonding well&#8221; and there was &#8220;good emotional interaction.&#8221; There were no concerns in relation to the mother&#8217;s parenting whilst in the hospital setting.</p>

It was also claimed that she had failed to prioritise NL&#8217;s needs above her own; and it was suggested that NL was likely to &#8220;continue to suffer significant harm if returned to his mother&#8221; because of her unwillingness until mid August to &#8220;address her dependency issues.&#8221; It was also said she had failed to make meaningful lifestyle changes; there had been a lack of consistent engagement with professionals; and she had had very little positive life experience to help guide her own parenting skills.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr van Rooyen&#8217;s oral evidence, according to Ms Myerscough, was &#8220;very strong and powerful.&#8221; Now I&#8217;ve had the chance to compare Miss Watson&#8217;s written summary with the legal adviser&#8217;s typed notes, it&#8217;s clear that Miss Watson&#8217;s analysis could not be improved upon. It&#8217;s in these terms &#8211; whilst Dr van Rooyen noted the mother&#8217;s progress, she stood by her conclusion that there was a poor prognosis for change. Insofar as the immediate risk to the baby in the care of the mother was concerned, Dr van Rooyen said that the practical day to day care posed less of a risk but the difficulty lay with her capacity to provide emotional care to him. She said she was not sure how that could be mitigated by the staff at [the resource]. The mother&#8217;s lack of empathy, in her view, would affect NL&#8217;s ability to attach; the mother had attachment issues and this would affect his sense of security and ability to bond. Dr van Rooyen was concerned that because of the intense demands of the programme she was undertaking, the mother would not be available to NL because of her need to address her own issues. She opined that [the resource] might be able to provide some degree of physical safety for NL but could not provide the emotional safety he required.</p>

Dr van Rooyen has noted that the history shows that the mother has not been able to learn from her past experiences, lacks empathy and has deep seated emotional and psychological limitations. The local authority&#8217;s contention is that the deficits in the mother&#8217;s empathy and emotional and psychological functioning will impact immediately on her care of NL. The balance of the immediate risk of harm to NL is such that his safety requires the continuing removal from his mother&#8217;s care. It is proportionate and in his best interests.</span>&#8221;</p>

To their very great credit, both Miss Watson and Ms Myerscough implicitly accepted there were fundamental flaws in what happened. They did not seek to justify the local authority&#8217;s actions nor did they suggest there had been an adequate assessment exercise. Miss Watson positively encouraged me to supply a considered judgment believing that it would be of assistance.</p>

Miss Watson described a customary practice of such documents being sent electronically; and thus, they may be easily adapted.

Firstly, appeals from interim care orders where separation has been sanctioned are amongst the most urgent of all public law hearings: time is of the essence and the court must do its utmost to list such appeals as a matter of urgency. By that I mean within days or at the most a very few weeks. Second, that listing for the convenience of Counsel, whilst desirable, should not be a factor leading to a hearing date later than the court can accommodate. Third, that the guardian&#8217;s ability to attend in person at the appeal hearing is of minor significance when weighed against the requirement for an early hearing. Ms G&#8217;s leave arrangements should not have resulted in any delay in fixing a date &#8211; though it was never suggested, in fact, that they should.</p>
