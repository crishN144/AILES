	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 May 2011, Kathleen Wyatt (who I shall for convenience hereafter refer to as &#8216;the wife&#8217;) issued financial remedy proceedings against Dale Vince (referred to here as &#8216;the husband&#8217;).  This application followed some 19 or so years after the grant of decree absolute of their divorce.  The highly unusual factual circumstances of the case, and of that application, are described in the judgment of Lord Wilson of Culworth at [2] and [4]-[18] of the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling which is reported under the citation <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/14" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 14</ref>.

A compromise agreement was, however, reached some months later, and at a hearing on 20 May 2016 I was invited by the parties to approve terms of settlement.  I conducted the hearing in private, although members of the press were present, without objection, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">rule 27.11</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">PD27B </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">Family Proceedings Rules 2010</span>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the terms of settlement itself, I am perfectly satisfied that it is reasonable, and that the wife is entitled to receive a modest capital award following the breakdown of this marriage; the lump sum payment agreed between the parties fairly represents, in my view, a realistic and balanced appraisal of the unusual circumstances of the case, having particular regard to the factors set out in <span style="font-style:italic">section 25(1) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">(2) </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref></span>.  I appreciate that the husband does not see it this way, having explicitly offered this sum merely to weigh off this litigation at this stage as cost-effectively as he can.  I venture to suggest that the agreed payment corresponds with what Lord Wilson had described as the wife&#8217;s &#8220;real prospect of comparatively modest success&#8221; in her claim, falling (so it seems to me) within the bracket of possible awards which he appears to have contemplated (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/14" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 14</ref> at [36]).

By this stage therefore, the parties had agreed that the need for the <span style="font-style:italic">Dean</span> summons had been overtaken by events, having been issued only because the husband had taken a position on undertakings which, without more, he had then abandoned.  In these circumstances, I see no reason why the wife should not be entitled to recovery of the costs of issuing the <span style="font-style:italic">Dean</span> summons, as they stood at 13 May.
