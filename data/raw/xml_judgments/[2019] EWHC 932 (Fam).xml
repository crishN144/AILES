I&#8217;m not aware of the detail of the allegations or the sums involved, whether he has been charged, convicted in his absence or sentenced. However it seems to be agreed that if he returned to the Russian Federation it is likely that he would be incarcerated. On 29 September 2011 he came to the UK and claimed political asylum. He has remained here to this day. The applicant and their child remained in Moscow although visited the respondent in London during school holidays. This continued until 2014. On 21 February 2013 the respondent was granted asylum in the UK. Again I am not aware of the basis of this but self-evidently the Home Secretary considered that the respondent had a well-founded fear of persecution. Subsequently the husband was granted indefinite leave to remain. I believe he remains a citizen of the Russian Federation. In 2014 the applicant and child were granted visas on the basis of their being dependents of the husband: the Cafcass report refers to a family reunion Visa. At some point the husband&#8217;s older daughter also moved to live with him in London. There is a dispute between the parties as to the extent to which the wife ever lived in London; it seems her passport shows that in 2015 she spent 96 nights in the UK and in 2016 48 nights. The wife spent time in Russia as well as in Tenerife where she was seeking to establish residency.  </p>

She has spent almost no time in London since. I am not sure of her Visa status now. The respondent and the child remain living in Notting Hill, along with the respondent&#8217;s adult daughter from an earlier relationship. The wife has seen very little of Vassilisa since 2016. The parties&#8217; daughter holds a very negative view of her mother and a very positive view of her father. Vassilisa said she believes that her mother has only brought an application to spend time with her because she wishes to secure a right to live in the UK and to seek financial support. The Cafcass officer considered that the child&#8217;s views were essentially her own. </p>

It seems clear; indeed it was effectively accepted by Mr Harrison, that the main concern of the parties was not their status but rather the financial consequences that would follow from a divorce. The &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Hemain</span>&#8217; application was listed at risk on 17 July 2017; so 2 days before the proposed hearing in Moscow. </p>

He says that he is not able in the short time available to provide the court with full disclosure of his assets but that he fully intends to do so at the appropriate time. He deals with the list of assets that the wife had identified and speculates that she had identified some of them through a company search. He says that many of the companies identified are old start-ups which failed. He produced a statement from his Russian lawyer which addressed the current status of many of the legal entities identified by the wife and the husband&#8217;s position in relation to various properties.  </p>

He was ordered to instruct his Russian lawyer to take steps to adjourn or suspend the Moscow proceedings.  It is said on the husband&#8217;s behalf that at that hearing Mrs Justice Roberts made clear that the arguments on <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span> were by no means all one way. Thus Mr Harrison argues that there was no reasonable expectation that the wife could have had that she would have been able to pursue her Form A to a final hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">The hearing in Moscow on 19 July was adjourned but on 27 July 2017 a further hearing took place and a decree of divorce appears to have been granted. There is a dispute between the parties&#8217; Russian lawyers as to how that came about. The husband asserts that he complied with the order of Mrs Justice Roberts and he says that he instructed his Russian lawyers to adjourn or suspend the Russian proceedings and that they made written and oral applications in order to further that aim. The wife&#8217;s Russian lawyer states in a witness statement that the position adopted by the husband&#8217;s lawyer forced the judge to take a decision on the divorce. I am not entirely sure what this involved but it seems to be an assertion that whilst perhaps appearing to comply with the order, the husband&#8217;s lawyer took a technical position which was bound to lead to the judge granting a divorce. There is considerable disagreement between the parties&#8217; Russian lawyers over a range of issues and there is no way those issues could be resolved (to the extent that they have to be resolved) without far more detailed exploration than was possible in the context of this hearing. It is a feature of the case before me that it is (certainly on the evidence available to me) extremely difficult, indeed potentially misleading to seek to draw parallels with English law, procedure and practice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">On 3 August 2017 - thus within a week of the divorce - the respondent issued a financial application in the Moscow court [C298]. In answer to my query whether there was some clock ticking against him which required the husband to issue the application I was told that there was not. Indeed it seems to emerge from the evidence of the Russian lawyers that an application relating to finance or property can be made at any stage. It is the wife&#8217;s case that this was further evidence of the husband taking steps in Russia to frustrate her ability to pursue a financial remedy application in the English court. The husband&#8217;s case is that he simply wanted to put in train a process which was simple, formulaic and low-cost in order to resolve issues relating to matrimonial property. Given the absence of any time limit counting against him there may be some force in the wife&#8217;s submission although of course I cannot determine the husband&#8217;s motivation without hearing evidence which is not possible within this hearing. The letter which emerged from the husband&#8217;s English solicitors after the completion of the Russian process which specifically refers to a potential Part III claim and the relevance of the Russian process and order certainly demonstrates how very aware the husband was of the potential impact of the Russian proceedings upon the wife&#8217;s prospects of pursuing a claim in England. Of course the issuing of the application was not a breach of the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Hemain</span>&#8217; injunction although one might reasonably conclude that it was far from compliant with the spirit of the process that Roberts J had put in train. </p>

That is not to say that with further time and exploration it would not be possible; but even with the relatively generous time estimate for reading that this &#8217;leave&#8217; application has had I have not been able to untangle matters.

The court does not as a matter of course require full and frank disclosure of all assets of both of the parties. It is not clear to me what scope there is within that process for the investigation of other assets. Mr Harrison submitted that it was clearly open to the wife to ask questions about further assets which might exist beyond those put before the court by the husband. Whilst that may seem common-sense to an English lawyer steeped in English financial remedy law and practice I was unable to ascertain from the evidence whether that was the case in Russia. </p>

The amendment in substance stated that there were no legal objections to either dividing the joint marital assets equally or with the consent of the parties to transferring all the jointly acquired marital assets subject to division into the wife&#8217;s ownership.

By this stage the husband&#8217;s lawyer was seeking to introduce questions of the true value of assets rather than their nominal value and in connection with this, questions of set off. Reference is made to the fact that the Russian court is dealing with the assets which were identified by the wife to the English court. I assume this is a reference to the wife&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hemain</span> injunction statement. Issues arise about the husband having recently informed his Russian lawyer about other assets of the wife&#8217;s and issues to do with the wife&#8217;s Swiss bank accounts which cause the judge some concern. There is reference to the understanding that there will be further proceedings in England [C81] [C82] [C83] and that the decision of the Russian court will matter there. There is reference to a property in England (I think this must be an error although one cannot be sure). At one stage the judge says (I think out of exasperation) <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I&#8217;m going to stop </span>(due to translation complications, it may be <span style="font-style:italic">or top</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> myself right now&#8217;. </span>The judge states that he will not establish the value of the property. The husband&#8217;s Russian lawyer states that they do not want a second division in England [C86]. The judge&#8217;s exasperation with the husband&#8217;s lawyer appears very clearly at [C87] and the judge refuses to adjourn any further to allow further instructions to be taken from the husband. The wife&#8217;s lawyer restates her position that they wish to share everything equally. At the conclusion of the hearing the husband&#8217;s lawyer then offers to transfer everything to the wife which the wife agrees to and the hearing is closed. </p>

The ruling identifies the properties set out in the husband&#8217;s statement of claim and confirms that they were jointly acquired marital assets and upholds the husband&#8217;s claim.  It identifies that when joint marital assets are divided shares are deemed to be equal unless stipulated otherwise. It also identifies the court has the right to depart from the principle of equality having regard to the interests of minor children or the interests of one of the spouses that deserves consideration. </p>

It will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law and an award was made in the foreign country.

At one end of the spectrum will be cases where it is blindingly obvious that leave should be granted; for instance that identified at paragraph 64 in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Agbaje</span>.

Those cases will be clearly unmeritorious. However between unmeritorious and substantial ground it seems to me there is no clear boundary. In between the plainly unmeritorious and the plainly meritorious will be many cases where the assessment of substantial or solid ground is as much an art as a science; the classic territory of judicial evaluation. In some cases, there may be one factor which is of such significance that it crosses the threshold. In others, there may be a constellation of factors which taken together give the case substance or solidity. Having regard to the inevitable limitations imposed by the court&#8217;s inability at this stage to resolve disputes of fact, or to fully evaluate competing arguments, sometimes (like the elephant) it is hard to describe but one knows it when one sees it. Thus reminding myself that: substantial does not equate to showing a more than 50% prospect of  an order ultimately being made but that there is something which can sensibly be said to amount to more than substantial issues of fact or law that require determination, more than good arguments, that the application raises substantial issues which as a matter of justice require determination, and that the application is not wholly unmeritorious or capable of being determined by knockout blow, I turn to my evaluation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Whilst Mr Harrison is undoubtedly right that much about this case is Russian that is only part of the picture. There is now a significant English element to it as a result of the habitual residence of the husband and the child in London. The husband chose to seek asylum in England and has made his home here for 8 years. That choice - which was his - has led to the accretion of significant connections with England. From 2014 to 2016 following the grant of visas the marriage was based in England; it could not be anywhere else due to the husband&#8217;s predicament. Whilst it is right that there are few identifiable assets in England, at present I am unsure whether there has been full and frank disclosure. In his main statement the husband said that he would in due course provide such disclosure but it has not yet emerged. As Mr Dyer points out, it would have been relatively easy for the husband to provide further documentation evidencing for instance how he meets his living expenses. Whilst I appreciate that the rejoinder to that is that it is for the wife to establish substantial grounds and it is not for the husband to disprove them, in the context of this hearing, which, whilst it is not an application to set aside leave, has resulted in far more detailed evidence being before the court, the husband has chosen not to put that material into the court arena despite an earlier indication that he would do so. What is known as a result of the husband&#8217;s disclosure in Russia, which was not known to the wife when she filed her main statement, was that the husband has significant offshore connections with 2 BVI companies which owe him very substantial funds, and a further offshore company which it is said he owed significant sums to. Thus I conclude that on the material currently before me there is a connection with England and Wales which is significant. Of course there is also a significant connection with Russia. There is a connection with Tenerife albeit it is one-sided and more limited than the English or Russian connection. </p>

As I have indicated earlier in this judgment it has been incredibly difficult to unscramble the Russian process and indeed the true import of the ruling which resulted within the confines of this leave hearing. At this stage (but without determining the issue of course) it seems to me that there is a very real argument over the impact that the ruling of 21 December 2017 should have within a Part III claim. It is far from clear to me that that process led to an agreement and thus an order which was in full and final settlement of all the parties&#8217; claims. If that is so why does the order not record that? If that is so why within the course of the 21 December hearing were there frequent references to intended proceedings in Great Britain? Why did the wife&#8217;s documents expressly refer to only part of the marital assets being before the court? Why does this appear within the transcripts? Was the position taken by the wife within the totality of those proceedings a protective one engaging with the Russian court but doing so principally to ensure the preservation of a potential claim in the UK, or was it a genuine engagement with court in order to reach a final resolution? There are hints from the Russian judge himself that he was detecting procedural manoeuvring. </p>

The sense of the process which emerges from those transcripts and the judgment is not in any sense as clear-cut as he submits. It may of course be, given the constraints within which I am operating in this leave hearing, that the impressions may be confounded upon a more detailed enquiry into the position. But for the purposes of leave such an enquiry is not possible and impressions based on a partial immersion are what I ultimately have to operate upon in this hearing. Thus I conclude that there is a real argument as to what impact that process and order have. </p>

The fact that in the Statement of Claim the Husband identifies the wife as having $300,000 in a bank account but refers to her having c.&#8364;1m in his recent statement adds to the lack of clarity over what information the Russian court was given and what it was taking into consideration. Again it may be that on a deep dive into this with the benefit of more evidence a different picture could emerge. However, as matters currently stand there seems to be merit to Mr Dyer&#8217;s argument that the Russian process did not involve the sort of full and frank disclosure and the opportunity for investigation and testing which would justify this court placing very significant weight on the Russian ruling so as to seriously undermine the solidity of the wife&#8217;s application &#8211; or to deliver a knockout blow. </p>

Although the bottom line figures still leave some room for argument in terms of disparity; but that might well only be the sort of disparity that would be acceptable. A top-up approach would probably fall into the unmeritorious category. But this is not the sole basis of her making this application; the more substantial point is whether there are assets which were not disclosed within or or as part of the Russian process, and thus whether this court might be looking at very substantially different assets and orders. </p>

However there is in reality very little reference to anything other than the properties identified in the husband&#8217;s statement of claim; there is no broader discussion about the lifestyle of the parties. Perhaps that is because the Russian court was undertaking a quite different exercise to that which is familiar to the English court or perhaps it is because the wife was adopting a tactical approach and simply not proactively putting such issues before the court. Perhaps it was because she thought it might be considered ludicrous? It is simply impossible to get to the bottom of this in such a hearing. However the significant point for my purposes is whether there appears to be a genuine issue over the true extent of the husband&#8217;s wealth. If there is a real issue over this, and thus a real issue over whether the orders of the Russian court did not deal with a significant part of his wealth, then it may be that it would be appropriate for an order to be made by this court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">What is a court in the current position to do when there is no direct evidence that the foreign court order only dealt with part of the assets? Of course in a case like <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Agbaje</span> (above) where it is plain that the foreign court did not deal with English-based assets, and where those assets are substantial the court may find the task of discerning substantial grounds relatively easy. What of a case such as this where it is the wife&#8217;s position that the husband as an entrepreneur and banker had extensive wealth prior to 2011 but is unable to identify it? It seems to me that the court must look at what indicators exist and extrapolate from them whether there is a real or viable argument that more extensive assets exist which would form the foundation of a further order. If there are such arguments they may translate into a substantial or solid ground. The husband accepts that since 2011 and continuing he is making extensive expenditure out of capital in the region of up to &#163;400,000 per annum net up to January 2018. This is very substantial expenditure albeit far from the oligarch league.   I note that the husband asserts that 95% of the business of his main business vehicle Family Health Ltd was lost when the manufacturer of the product decided to distribute it directly rather than through his business. The husband does not ascribe a value to Family Health Ltd at any stage and it is therefore almost impossible to get any feel for this. It is clear that some of the husband's business assets have considerable value i.e. Ekstechno and the properties which have been purchased both in Russia and Tenerife together with the substantial BVI funds suggest that at some point prior to 2011 the husband had quite significant financial resources. It may of course be right that in effect since then the husband has been drawing down on assets built up prior to his leaving Russia and that his asset base is being steadily and significantly eroded each year by the expenditure that he has been and continues to make being something in excess of &#163;300,000 per annum. However the alternative is that at some point prior to the collapse of Family Health Ltd and the husband&#8217;s hurried flight from Russia on the back of political persecution he was a man of considerable substance and that the Russian assets and the Swiss and UK bank accounts and the BVI assets are not a full representation of his finances. It may well be that his rapid application to the Russian court following the grant of a divorce was only designed to make use of a cheaper and more straightforward procedure than would have occurred in England. However it might also be that it was designed to secure a favourable outcome as a stepping stone to preventing a deep dive into his financial position that would generally accompany English proceedings. It would be inappropriate for me to draw any conclusions on these two possibilities in the absence of hearing evidence from the parties about it.  The various strands relating to the husband&#8217;s expenditure, his previous position in Russia, his rapid application to the Russian court are sufficient in my view to raise a reasonable or viable argument that the assets considered by the Russian court were not a full reflection of his finances notwithstanding the relative lack of particularity of the wife&#8217;s contention. </p>

Again this issue is not capable of full evaluation in the context of a leave application &#8211; who knows what the outcome might be after full exploration &#8211; but it is not sufficient to knock out or undermine the other strands of the wife&#8217;s case.   </p>

Her claim in my view plainly cannot be characterised as wholly unmeritorious. In the circumstances it would be unjust to close the door. Whether the grant of leave ultimately translates into a decision following detailed consideration of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref> factors that it is appropriate for the English court to grant relief, or whether it is appropriate to make an order after detailed consideration of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref> factors, is to prejudge the ultimate questions.  </p>

However it does appear in relation to Russian assets that they have been relatively extensively enquired into, and that the focus of the application is likely to be on assets held outside Russia; probably with the focus being on Swiss or offshore assets. That may narrow the parameters both of disclosure and of the issues which the court ultimately needs to determine. </p>
