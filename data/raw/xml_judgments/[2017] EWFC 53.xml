Both self-representing, each has behaved with restraint and courtesy, each has articulately and sensibly put their case, including in cross-examination to each other, and each has extended to the other the same politeness they have shown to the court, even when the subject matter of the questions and their answers has been painful or emotionally charged.</span></p>

It was at this point that she started to look further afield than the north-east for a place in which to spend the next stage of her life.  She does not have family in the north-east and described to me that many, if not virtually all, of her friends from university have moved out of the area.  A particularly close friend of hers had shortly beforehand moved to work in the UAE and through and because of her the mother decided that she would like to do the same, taking FW with her.</span></p>

At that point he was actively considering relocating to live and work in the UAE for as long as FW was there.  Ultimately he decided not to do so, the difficulties involved, both professionally and socially, making such a course on closer analysis unattractive.</span></p>

She raised it with the father.  His initial reaction was that he thought he might agree to a further year.  However, he broached this topic with then seven-year-old FW and reports that FW&#8217;s immediate and vehement response was that he did not like living in the UAE and that he wanted to return to England.  This was enough to convince the father that FW should not remain in the UAE for any period beyond that originally agreed.</span></p>

The case was listed to be heard by me for directions on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> June 2017.  On that occasion, the father was at court, the mother attended by video-link from the UAE.  They were, and are, both litigants in person.  I explored with the parents whether there was any prospect in the successful diversion of the case from court and if any form of alternative dispute resolution might yield a consensual, and so inherently better, outcome.  It was clear, however, that there was a single irreconcilable difference of principle between the parents, which required a third party decision.  It was also apparent that there was a degree of urgency as decisions have to be made in time for FW to be enrolled at the right school and otherwise prepared for the upcoming new school year.  I made a series of directions aimed at preparing the case for a final hearing in fairly short order and coinciding with a planned return by the mother and FW to England.  I directed that their return be brought slightly forward, this allowing for a targeted piece of work with FW by a Family Court Adviser from Cafcass in order that I could be fully informed as to his wishes and feelings.  I did not direct a full section 7 report as time did not allow for this and I did not consider that I would have been remotely hampered by the absence of an analysis of the fairly straightforward issues in the case.</span></p>

The re-crafting of section 8 orders from residence and contact into child arrangements orders has inter alia the benefit of emphasising, absent adverse circumstances and welfare conclusions, the equality of parental responsibility that each parent has. Parents are to be expected to exercise their autonomy and to respect the autonomy of their children by entering into arrangements that plan for their children&#8217;s long term welfare by providing for a meaningful relationship between each adult and each child. </span></p>

That is neither a new approach nor is it an option. A welfare analysis is a requirement in any decision about a child&#8217;s upbringing. The sophistication of that analysis will depend on the facts of the case. Each realistic option for the welfare of a child should be validly considered on its own internal merits (i.e. an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option should be undertaken). That prevents one option (often in a relocation case the proposals from the absent or &#8216;left behind&#8217; parent) from being side-lined in a linear analysis. Not only is it necessary to consider both parents&#8217; proposals on their own merits and by reference to what the child has to say but it is also necessary to consider the options side by side in a comparative evaluation. A proposal that may have some but no particular merit on its own may still be better than the only other alternative which is worse&#8221;. </span></p>

However, in her oral evidence to me, she acknowledged that it is important that the father knows both that his son is eventually to return to England and when he is to do so.  Fixing that latter date at three years hence will coincide with the point at which FW is set to move from middle to secondary school.</span></p>

It is also relatively well-paid and comes with the joint benefits of a housing allowance and a discount on school fees.  Thus, the mother&#8217;s plan, if she is allowed to stay in the UAE, is that she and FW will move to a larger home, a newly-built flat in a well-serviced complex of which she has provided the particulars.

To the criticism the father makes that it would be better if FW could rely on his parents alone rather than an employee for childcare, the mother makes the point that his parents&#8217; study and employment have always combined to necessitate some extra childcare, previously breakfast and after-school clubs.  She further points to the real advantages which will accrue when she and FW are at the same school, in that they will travel together and see each other at school and she will have the opportunity to engage with his teachers, and to watch those various activities, matches, assemblies etc., normally not accessible to a parent who teaches in a different school to that attended by their child.  </span></p>

The mother, while she is driven to improve herself, her employment prospects, her lifestyle and, in the longer term, her financial status, is impelled in all of these endeavours by an ultimate desire to provide well for FW.  She genuinely believes that the best outcome for FW for the time being is to remain living in the UAE.

Indeed, until the unpleasantness of the last few months, his childhood seems to have been remarkably devoid of any of the common repercussions of having separated parents.  It is a great shame that he feels now in the fray and even more so that he considers himself to bear the weight of making a decision - ultimately in his eyes between two parents whom he loves - which is not, on any view, for him to take.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s view is that if she were to remain in the UAE, FW, after a brief unsettled period, would not mind her absence.  I disagree.  Although FW&#8217;s father has always played a very important role in FW&#8217;s life, it is his mother with whom he has primarily lived since separation and so with whom he has lived consistently since he was born.  I consider that to leave her care would probably be profoundly unsettling and very possibly damaging for FW.  However I agree with the father when he predicts as unlikely the prospect of the mother remaining in the UAE if FW were to leave.  Notwithstanding how difficult it would be for her, emotionally, financially, and practically I think it very much more likely that she would find a way to return herself at the same time or shortly thereafter.</span></p>

Notwithstanding her obvious abilities, her optimistic and impressively ambitious personality, as I consider it to be, the emotional impact on the mother of being forced to leave the UAE would be very considerable.  Moreover, for her also to have to live in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[north-east city]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> area when she so passionately does not want to do so, would significantly compound the effect of this.

While I am sure that the mother would in fairly short order seek to attend to these matters, I judge that she is entirely correct when she says that she could match neither the quality of her prospective accommodation nor the status or remuneration of her upcoming employment in the UAE.</span></p>

Were this to come to pass, it would undoubtedly cause FW very significant harm.  In the current case, however, I do not consider this to be even the slightest risk.  The mother is British, has strong ties to England (all members of her family living here) and evinces no intention whatever to abandon her longer-term life here.  The very fact that it was she who applied to this court for an order demonstrates that she will submit to the court&#8217;s decision, whatever it may be.  That the father agrees that there is no appreciable risk provides further support for the notion that this is not a case in which the possibility of retention of the child or non-compliance with orders of this court arises.</span></p>

That he has inadvertently been drawn into the current dispute is disappointing.  I hope that this problem can be nipped quickly in the bud before any harm is caused, certain in the knowledge that prolonged exposure of a child to parental disagreement, especially when the child feels in some way responsible for the outcome, is a sure-fire way to cause harm.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I consider first whether there is a risk of harm inherent in what the father would say is the diminution in his relationship with FW corollary to their living 4,500 miles apart.  I acknowledge how difficult the father finds the enforced absence caused by these arrangements.  However I note that, apart from a hiatus when relations between the parents were at their worst, indirect contact has continued with great frequency.  Perhaps more significantly I note that it has been possible for there to have been a very high level of visits, both FW to the UK (four in eleven months) and the father to the UAE (three in eleven months).  This is testament to the efforts of the father and to the good faith of the mother.  It is also the reason, I have no doubt, for FW&#8217;s relationship with his father being as close as it is.  For these reasons, I do not consider that the geographic hurdles to seeing his father are positively harmful.</span></p>

As I have indicated, although I think it unlikely to arise, a scenario by which FW ceased to live with his mother would, I consider, be harmful to him.  For the reasons I have set out above, I consider that the mother&#8217;s being forced to return to the north-east would, due to the impact on FW of his mother&#8217;s emotional state, in combination with their markedly changed circumstances and the unplanned move to school and accommodation currently unsourced, would expose FW to the risk of harm.</span></p>

Despite his case having being reduced to writing in a lengthy statement and the subject of considerable oral evidence, I remain unable to accept that the father would be in a position to assume the full time care of FW.  There are a number of examples in England both before and after FW&#8217;s leaving for the UAE, in which the father has been unable entirely to prioritise arrangements for FW over his own work or other commitments, and occasions in the UAE on which he has seen somewhat less of FW than would have been possible, juggling, it seems, a holiday with his partner with opportunities to see his son.</span></p>

Even if she did follow, it would be a mother with her dreams crushed and forced, to her mind, into a prison, long distant from family and friends elsewhere in England and even further from the life she wanted for herself and FW in the UAE.  She would not be in a position to offer FW a home to anywhere near the same standard as he enjoys in the UAE and her employment prospects would, I agree with her, be significantly stunted in comparison to what they would be in the UAE.
