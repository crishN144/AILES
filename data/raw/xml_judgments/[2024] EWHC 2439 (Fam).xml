His mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) by Notice dated 30 May 2024 applies to commit his father (&#8220;F&#8221;) for breaches of an order made by Sir Jonathan Cohen on 15 April 2024.  Specifically:</p>

The written authority is to state the following:&#8221;. In fact, the order does not go on to state the content of the written authority. As it stands, the order at para 19 makes no sense. I am told by counsel for M that it was  intended that F would, by the written authority, give consent for the third party to accompany V to this jurisdiction. However, the order does not say so, nor does the transcript of the judgment given on that day. It may be a logical interpretation of what was envisaged, but in my view the order lacks the essential clarity of the obligation on the respondent which is a pre-requisite of any committal application. On balance, I do not consider that it is appropriate to waive this procedural defect under FPR 2010 PD37A(2) and this pleaded breach shall be struck out.</p>

Of course, it is for M to prove that these matters were within F&#8217;s power, not for F to prove that it was impossible for him to comply. </p>

The accused must (i) have known of the terms of the order i.e precisely what s/he is required to do and (ii) have acted (or failed to act) in a manner which involved a breach of the order and (iii) have known of the facts which made his/her conduct a breach (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Masri v Consolidated Contractors Ltd [2011] EWHC 1024 (Comm). </span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">If it be the case that applicant cannot prove that the defendant was able to comply with the order, then s/he is not in contempt of court. It is not enough to suspect recalcitrance. It is for the applicant to establish that it was within the power of the defendant to do what the order required. It is not for the defendant to establish that it was not within his/her power to do it. That burden remains on the applicant throughout, but it does not require the applicant to adduce evidence of a particular means of compliance which was available to the defendant provided the applicant can satisfy the judge so that s/he is sure that compliance was possible. The judge must determine whether s/he is sure that the defendant has not done what s/he was required to do and, if s/he has not, whether it was within his/her power to do it. Could s/he do it? Was s/he able to do it? These are questions of fact. That said, breach may occur where compliance is difficult or inconvenient but not impossible; see <span style="font-weight:bold">Perkier Foods Ltd. v Halo Foods Ltd. [2019] EWHC 3462 (QB).</span></p>

Ms Gollop KC judge found that the removal was wrongful, having been made without M&#8217;s knowledge or consent. F returned to this jurisdiction on 7 April 2022 without V, who he left in Algeria with his family, in particular his mother, V&#8217;s paternal grandmother. F granted a Power of Attorney in favour of his mother on 12 May 2022 at the Algerian Embassy in London in respect of guardianship of V. V has been in Algeria ever since. It appears that he has been in the care of his grandmother throughout, apart from a short period of some two weeks or so at the end of 2023 when he was placed in the care of Algerian social services before being returned to the grandmother. The consequence is that V has not been in the care of either parent for 2 &#189; years. </p>

A series of hearings took place thereafter, leading to a final hearing on both jurisdiction and welfare before Ms Gollop KC over 4 days in October and November 2023. She handed down a reserved judgment on 13 December 2023 concluding that the court had power under the parens patriae jurisdiction to make orders, and that it was appropriate to make a return order.

M issued a committal application on 26 January 2024 which was dismissed on 7 March 2024 by Cusworth J because of procedural flaws in the application. As I have indicated, a further return order was made by Sir Jonathan Cohen on 15 April 2024. F applied for permission to appeal against that order. The application was refused by the Court of Appeal on 12 June 2024. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He has repeatedly confirmed that, regardless of any orders made in this country, he will not return V. In a statement dated 24 March 2023 he said: &#8220;My son&#8230;is very happy now and I will not change his surrounding and I will never take him anywhere&#8230;No one can take my son from Algeria except me and I am not going to do it at all&#8221;. On 31 August 2023, he referred to what he described as V&#8217;s quality of life in Algeria and said: &#8220;I will not facilitate my son&#8217;s return to the UK if a summary return order is made&#8221;. In a statement dated 5 October 2023 he said that &#8220;&#8230;when I took my son to Algeria, my intention was for him to live there permanently&#8221;. He had no intention of permitting him to return, and has fought tooth and nail to prevent a return. In none of these or other statements throughout 2022 and 2023 did he intimate that his mother had the power to determine whether V returned to the UK. On the contrary, on a plain reading of his own words, he considered he held that power himself, regardless of the fact of a Power of Attorney having been granted in his mother&#8217;s favour. At the final hearing in December 2023 (and, so far as I can tell, at all hearings before then), F did not advance a case that he had no power to secure a return because of his mother&#8217;s opposition.  Even after the final hearing, in a statement dated 22 January 2024, he said nothing about his mother preventing him from complying.</p>

A short formal letter from his mother attached to that statement asserts legal rights although it does not say in terms that she would not assist F if requested to do so.

I am satisfied from everything I have read and heard, and to the requisite standard of proof, that F, not his mother, has the power and control to take the significant decisions in V&#8217;s life. I am equally satisfied, to the requisite standard of proof, that such decisions include procuring the return of V to this country, together with ancillary provisions, and the arrangement of indirect contact.  I am satisfied that the grandmother does not take these decisions and cannot or would not thwart F if he wanted to comply and ensure a return of V to this country. F deliberately abducted the child to Algeria, and never had any intention to return him. In my judgment, his mother is no more than a cipher for his actions. Insofar as F relies upon the Power of Attorney granted to his mother (which he himself told Sir Jonathan Cohen is now irrelevant), he has chosen not to take the necessary steps to revoke it in the past two and a half years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, regardless of the dynamics between F and the grandmother, I am satisfied that F is able to ensure the return of V to England through the Algerian courts. A report was commissioned from Dr Edge on Algerian law and the means of procuring a return of the child to England. In his report dated 18 June 2023, Dr Edge said that the only way to secure a return under Algerian law is for F to agree to the child returning; the Algerian court would adhere to F&#8217;s authority and consent to this effect. The Algerian court would not accede to an application by M without F&#8217;s consent. I am satisfied, again beyond reasonable doubt, that F has made no attempt to secure from the Algerian court an order which would enable V to be returned. He has taken no steps to give instructions and consent for that step to be taken. </p>

So, it is said, that is a logistical and practical hurdle to compliance. The problem is that Sir Jonathan Cohen said there was no evidence of such an order, nor is there any such evidence before me. There is evidence that the grandmother issued proceedings in Algeria on 25 December 2023, but there is not a scrap of evidence that any substantive orders in her favour were made by the Algerian courts (port alert, or the equivalent of s8 orders). The only evidence (contained in the bundle before me) is that the Algerian court dismissed the application on 19 May 2024. In any event, I am satisfied that F is well able to ensure that there are no legal steps to V leaving Algeria if he so wishes; the truth is, however, that he does not so wish. </p>
