	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns JR, a 16 year old boy. The issues before me are, firstly, whether to make a Care Order and, secondly, the terms of a Deprivation of Liberty Order (&#8220;DoLs order&#8221;). The Local Authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) wishes to withdraw its application for a Care Order, but that is strongly opposed by the Guardian. All parties agree that there should be a DoLs order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case was listed before me, as the Family Presider for the Midlands, because there are lessons to be learnt from JR&#8217;s case about the way children subject to DoLs orders are assessed and their needs met. These are amongst the most complex and traumatised children within the Care and Family Justice systems, yet the care they receive is often, although not always, extremely poor. This is for a host of reasons, many well outside the scope of this judgment, or indeed the role of a judge. However, there are lessons that can be applied more generally, in particular those set out in the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Principles of Care for children with complex needs and circumstances; Principles of Care Framework</span> 2023 (&#8220;NFJO Report&#8221;), which I refer to below. </p>

I note from the chronology of criminal justice involvement that even by this early stage there had been a number of occasions when the police were called because of JR&#8217;s behaviour. </p>

JR was returned to Warwickshire and there was then a period of significant disruption in his care. JR was cared for by residential staff at an Airbnb, then in another property with different care providers. This provider then gave notice and JR was moved to a short breaks provider, who also gave notice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12 May 2023 the LA applied for a DoLs order, the parents agreed, and the order was made on that day.  There was then a lengthy period where the providers were unwilling to impose the restrictions permitted by the DoLs order.  JR frequently absconded from the placement and placed himself and others at risk of harm. It was certainly the view of the Guardian that X Provider were incapable of controlling JR or meeting his needs, and the objective evidence entirely supports this analysis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before me on 15 September 2023, having been referred by HHJ Walker sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, because of the level of concern about the LA having a DoLs order but there being no care proceedings and no holistic view of JR&#8217;s welfare needs. HHJ Walker, the Guardian, and then I, were all concerned that because there were no care proceedings it was not possible to properly consider JR&#8217;s wider welfare interests and to obtain a psychological assessment of his needs. We were also concerned that despite the palpable unsuitability of his placement with X Provider, not least because of their inability to prevent his absconding and putting himself at risk, no progress had been made in finding another placement. Although I fully accept the difficulty of finding suitable placements for children as challenging as JR, it was the clear view of HHJ Walker, the Guardian and myself, that the LA were tolerating an inappropriate and unsafe placement for far longer than should have been the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 October 2023 the LA issued public law proceedings although did not seek an Interim Care Order.  I continued the DoLs order and the matter returned to HHJ Walker. The parents remained in their view that care proceedings were unnecessary and that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> CA consent was sufficient to meet JR&#8217;s interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The social work statements record that throughout October &#8211; November 2023 JR was regularly absconding from the placement with the DoLs not being imposed in any meaningful way. In reality, reading those statements, JR was simply doing as he pleased, including threatening staff, abusing them and there are various reports of him carrying a knife. It was entirely clear that the staff were incapable of controlling JR. There were also a series of racially aggravated incidents, both in the property and in public places. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In early November JR transitioned to a new school, but after a short positive period he was suspended for being racially abusive to staff. There was also a report of JR sharing images of his genitals with a 15 year old girl and of him being involved in a sex act with an older man. This raised concerns about whether JR was being sexually exploited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December the Father proposed taking JR on a skiing holiday in January 2024. The LA conducted a risk assessment and determined that the risks were too great given the trauma JR had been through in the previous months. It was felt that, given the need for a DoLs order, the risk of the Father being on his own with JR and unable to control him were too great to be acceptable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents did not agree with this assessment and wished for JR to go on the holiday. Given that he was accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> agreement rather than a Care Order, it was not open to the LA to prevent the holiday. They therefore made an application to HHJ Walker for an order preventing the parents from removing JR from the jurisdiction. She granted the order sought on 15 January 2024, finding that he would be at risk of significant harm if allowed to go. The parents had told JR about the planned holiday, and then told him that the Judge had refused to allow him to go. Perhaps unsurprisingly this made JR even more dysregulated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of the sexual images which had been seen and the concern that during his frequent periods of absconding JR was being sexually exploited, the LA convened a s.47 meeting. The representative from the education provider noted the high level of concern around JR&#8217;s harmful sexual behaviour. I note that in the minutes there is reference to the Police saying there were 70 investigations on their system concerning JR. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Bryn Williams, psychologist, was appointed to undergo a psychological assessment of JR and he produced his report on 15 January 2024. That report is a remarkably useful document, both in respect of its analysis and recommendations in respect of JR, but also because it gives some insight into the problems faced by many children and young people subject to a DoLs order. I therefore quote from it extensively below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The LA&#8217;s position, as set out in the final Care Plan, details that he will remain accommodated by the LA for the rest of his childhood. It is notable, however, that the LA does not seek a Care Order and therefore does not seek to share parental responsibility with the parents. The proposal is to work with the parents through the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> agreement. </p>

Mr Crispin submits that a Care Order gives no greater access to services from the LA and no greater legal oversight. The LA&#8217;s care planning duties set out in The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 apply regardless of whether the LA accommodate JR under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> or a Care Order.</p>

She accepts that the parents are fully committed to achieving the best possible outcomes for JR in respect of living arrangements, education and getting therapy. Her view is that since the first residential placement broke down in October 2022 there has been little safe and consistent parenting of JR. The LA failed to provide him with therapy and left him in a palpably inappropriate placement. </p>

One slight irony of this case is that the parents have frequently been the ones pressing for the LA to take further action, yet they strenuously oppose the making of a Care Order. </p>

In terms of education, JR has been out of formal education for a period of two years. There was a plan for him to be provided with education through an educational provider. However, that quickly failed, as set out above, and he was in effect excluded. A face to face tutor was appointed but that did not get off the ground because of safety concerns. The Guardian is very concerned, as are the parents, that JR only has a fairly short period before he becomes an adult, and it is essential to get him more formal education. The Guardian suggests that the Care Plan should be amended to make more specific proposals for formal education. </p>

Rourke, who first described non-verbal difficulties, recognised that extreme psychological problems was a key feature of the children he was describing. From clinical experience, this is not anxiety that many of us would recognise. The metaphor of the glass elevator from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory comes to mind when helping a child with NVLD cope with anxiety &#8211; it does not just go up, it bursts through the roof in a completely irrational and uncontrollable way, and it remains paralyzing unless we intervene. His behaviour is functional insofar as it enables him to cope, the problem is that it is so destructive to both him, his family and, at times, his carers.

It is so normal for us to focus on what is going wrong, but we are more likely to succeed if we focus on what is good and right. For example, quite often [JR&#8217;s] left brain is working far more efficiently than his right brain, so be creative, verbal, and use his strengths to master any weaknesses. I observed him talking to himself frequently during the assessment.

This includes the many children who are deprived of their liberty due to concerns about their well-being, and who are placed in unregulated settings because there is nowhere else for them to go. These children have multiple emotional and behavioural needs that are often associated with experiences of early and ongoing childhood adversity (such as abuse and neglect, but also poverty and racism) and complex trauma. There may have been repeated failures by children&#8217;s services, mental health services and education services to provide them with effective help. The children&#8217;s behaviour may cause significant risk to others (e.g. physical aggression) and to themselves (e.g. self-harm), which is very challenging to manage at home and in residential settings. They often have overlapping difficulties with mental health, emotion regulation, neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g. autism and ADHD), risk of exploitation, and missing education. It is often the combined impact of these multiple, intersecting (and mutually synergistic) needs &#8211; rather than the impact or &#8216;severity&#8217; of any individual risk factor &#8211; that increases a child&#8217;s vulnerability, and that systems struggle to effectively respond to.&#8221;</span></p>

Firstly, it would give certainty as to how decisions will be made about JR&#8217;s care, including where he lives and where he goes to school. The parents plainly care deeply about JR and want what is best for him. However, there have been situations where they and the LA have not agreed, in particular over the skiing holiday when HHJ Walker had to make an order preventing the parents from taking JR away. As long as JR remains accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref>, the prospect of that type of problem arising continues to exist.</p>

In my view it is perfectly possible that such differences will arise again.  One of the Guardian&#8217;s reasons for strongly supporting the making of a Care Order is that she feels JR needs the absolutely clear message that the LA is a corporate parent to him and ultimately, if there is a disagreement, will be making the decisions about his care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, although I accept that the LA has committed to a Care Plan which appropriately meets JR&#8217;s needs, whether he is subject to a Care Order or not, I have little doubt that there would be a greater level of oversight if JR was under a Care Order than if he is accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref>. The reality is that the level of oversight of JR was significantly increased when HHJ Walker and I became involved. My judgement is that in practical terms, rather than necessarily legal theory, a Care Order will give greater confidence in the LA taking responsibility for his care.  Although the Independent Reviewing Officer is involved even if JR is only accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref>, it appears that there is more likely to be liaison with Cafcass if there is a Care Order in place. However I accept that the likelihood of this happening is actually very slight. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the services would probably be the same whether or not there is a Care Order, I am confident that the practical level of involvement and oversight will be greater. This is particularly important in a case such as JR&#8217;s, where his needs are complex and difficult to meet, and he is approaching his 17th birthday. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching this conclusion I am influenced by the fact that without the intervention of the Court and the Guardian, it seems quite possible that JR would have been left in inappropriate placements with a lack of attention to his holistic needs. Whatever the legal position may be, the reality is that the LA had a prolonged period when they did not focus on JR&#8217;s needs. Without the LA holding parental responsibility I am very concerned that disagreements with the parents may again lead to delays in the provision of the necessary support. I appreciate the LA and the parents dispute this, but I am inclined to accept the Guardian&#8217;s position on this. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents are concerned that if JR is subject to a Care Order he will feel that shows a lack of commitment from them. They are worried about the messaging that will be received by JR. However, the Guardian discussed this with JR and her perception was that he was not concerned either way. To the degree that there is any strength in this concern, the important point to be communicated to JR is that the decision to make a Care Order is that of the Judge, and certainly not that of the parents.</p>
