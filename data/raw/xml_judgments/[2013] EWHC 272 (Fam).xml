She has suffered years of traumatic experiences, not only at home but also in foster care and subsequently in a series of institutional settings, including WH.

It is unnecessary for the purposes of this short judgment to consider her background and diagnosis in any greater detail, although I anticipate that those matters will be the focus of much greater attention in the next hearing.</span></p>

The tribunal held inter alia that L &#8220;needs to be placed in a residential establishment in the community, equipped to meet the needs of a person suffering from mild learning disability with challenging behaviours, and supported by a package of aftercare comprising medical, nursing and social worker oversight and the provision of day-care.&#8221; </span></p>

As a preliminary step, however, L moved in early September 2012 to WH, a hospital within the meaning of paragraph 17 of schedule 1A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8220;MCA&#8221;), situated closer to her home area.

As a result, a Mental Health Act Assessment was carried out by Ms Emma Goodall, an Approved Mental Health Professional employed by the local authority. She was, of course, aware of the tribunal decision to discharge L from detention and concluded that, as there had been no material change in her circumstances since that decision, it would be unlawful for L to be detained under the MHA, following the decision of the House of Lords in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">R v East London NHS Trust, ex parte Count Von Brandenburg </span><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 AC 280" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 AC 280</ref>.

The deferred discharge therefore took place on 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'"> September. In fact, L did not leave the hospital on that date, and her status thereafter was, and remains, that of a patient under an informal admission within the scope of s.131 of the MHA.</span></p>

She advised that, should L remain at WH as an informal patient under the same restrictions, and without a legal framework to authorise them, there was a significant risk of an unlawful deprivation of liberty.  She therefore advised the PCT and the hospital trust that authorisation should be sought for the restrictions in the care plan through a court order. </span></p>

The local authority, acting on the PCT&#8217;s behalf, appointed Ms. Anna Hudson as best interests assessor for the purpose of carrying out the necessary assessments<span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">. Ms Hudson also reached the view that the circumstances of L&#8217;s accommodation at WH amounted to a deprivation of liberty, and further concluded that L was &#8220;ineligible to be deprived of her liberty&#8221; under Schedule A1 on the basis that, in her opinion, L was within the scope of the MHA</span> and the criteria in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1A were met.</p>

B Healthcare Group was joined as third respondent. In the course of preparation for the hearing, it became apparent that the issues, in particular the assessment of capacity, and the question of eligibility, are potentially complex. After time spent in further negotiations, it became plain that there was insufficient court time to resolve all the issues and that further evidence, analysis and argument would be required. It was therefore agreed that two preliminary issues would be considered and determined by the court at that hearing, the others being adjourned to a later date.

Mr Dooley submitted that it was not necessary for all of those factors to be present. In this case, he relied in particular on the fact that, as Dr A accepted, staff in this case exercised complete control over the care and management of L, and over her treatment and medication. As part of that complete control and management, it had been decided that she could not leave the premises. </span></p>

Expanding on this position in oral submissions, she argued that L&#8217;s long history of mental disorder and institutional abuse, leading to her current presentation and needs,</span> precluded any immediate move into a setting other than one with the level of medical input and expertise available at WH.  The restrictions on her liberty would therefore need to be the same wherever she was placed. Ms. Rickard suggested that WH, as a community hospital, did fall within the tribunal&#8217;s recommendation of &#8216;a residential establishment in the community equipped to meet the needs of a person suffering from mild learning disability with challenging behaviours, and supported by a package of after-care comprising medical, nursing and social-worker oversight and the provision of day-care&#8217;<span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">.

It may well be the case that not all of the factors identified in paragraph 2.5 are satisfied in this case but I accept Mr Dooley&#8217;s argument that it is not necessary for every such factor to be present. As paragraph 2.5 itself makes clear, the factors listed therein &#8216;</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">can</span><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'"> be relevant to identifying whether the steps taken involve more than restraint to amount to a deprivation of liberty.&#8217; In this case, a number of the factors are manifestly present as identified by Mr Dooley above. The plain fact is that in this case the care and movement of L is subject to the complete and effective control of the staff at WH. That control extends to treatment, contacts and residence. The treatment includes medication. It has been decided that she will not be released into the care of others or to live elsewhere, unless staff consider it appropriate.

Similarly, whilst L must understand the fact that she may not be permitted to leave, Mr Mant submits that it is unnecessary for her to have a full grasp of this specific legal mechanism by which she might be prevented from leaving. He points out that the questions of what provisions might be applied are issues which perplex lawyers and to require a person in the position of L to understand such issues would be to set the bar too high. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">It seems to me to be undesirable for the court in these circumstances to be asked as a matter of course to identify in advance and with precision the information which a person must be capable of understanding, retaining, using and weighing by a person in order to make a decision whether to consent to a placement which amounts to a deprivation of liberty.  The evaluation of capacity is a complex process that engages the principles in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1</ref>, 2 and 3 of the MCA. The better course, in my judgment, is for the clinician to consider the concrete situation and assess the level of the person&#8217;s understanding about that situation. The court will then, in the light of that assessment and all other relevant evidence, consider whether practicable steps to help him decide whether or not to give his consent have been taken and if so, whether it has been proved on a balance of probabilities that he lacks the capacity to make the decision. If the court were asked as a matter of routine to identify for the parties in advance the precise information necessary for making a decision, it would lead to an alarming amount of satellite litigation at great and unnecessary cost.</span></p>
