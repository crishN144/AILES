The application is supported by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, who is the First Respondent. The patient at the heart of the application is GF. The Acute Trust is responsible for GF&#8217;s physical care. The South London and Maudsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is responsible for GF&#8217;s mental health through the Mental Health Liaison Service. GF is the Second Respondent to these proceedings. He acts within these proceedings by his litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. </span></p>

On 23 February 2024, he was admitted to hospital via A&amp;E. He had been taken to the hospital by his niece AB, who was concerned he had burns or wounds to his right leg and was walking with a limp. At the hospital, GF was reported to be disorientated. He was saying his sores were caused by lasers and Wi-Fi which was hitting his legs. He was reviewed by the Mental Health Service and noted to be psychotic with clear delusional thought content. On examination, what his niece had suspected were burns were actually thought to have been caused by infection.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">GF was transferred to a ward in the Acute Trust for treatment with intravenous anti-biotics. On examination and, as of 22 March 2024, he was found to have necrotic ulcers on his right ankle and leg secondary to occlusion of vascular supply to his lower limb. The ulcers are septic. He is pyrexial despite intravenous antibiotics being given. The multidisciplinary team of professionals at the Acute Trust propose an above knee amputation. Without it, the prognosis is that of further deterioration and death within weeks. At the moment, although GF is unwell, he is haemodynamically stable. Without surgery in the next few weeks, he will become haemodynamically unstable, and surgery will no longer be an option. More conservative wound management will not resolve the problem. The unanimous view of those treating him is that surgery must take place as soon as possible before it too becomes an unviable option for GF.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">GF has a long-standing history of paranoid schizophrenia. He was first diagnosed 20 years ago.  He fits the criteria for ICD-10 F20.0. He has had several psychiatric admissions but none since 2013. GF is intermittently non-compliant with his medication when in the community. When seen by the Community Mental Health Team in January 2024, he reported that he had not taken his medication for about a year. He is not presently acutely unwell, but he has some baseline chronic psychotic symptoms. He takes aripiprazole. He could be given more aggressive treatment to help improve his mental state but not within the timeframe required for the surgery he requires. It has been noted that whilst he is on the ward, he will often comply with a lot of reassurance and multiple approaches. He has continuing delusions around &#8220;lasers&#8221; which are longstanding and persistent. He is likely to be resistant to treatment to some degree. He has refused interventions for his legs saying the ulcers have been caused by &#8220;rays&#8221; that are implanted in him. He also refers to bad spirits causing him ill health. He has, on occasion, maintained that there is good blood flow to the leg and that there is nothing wrong with it, so he does not need surgery. He has on other occasions thought his leg was burned rather than anything more serious.  On others he has said that he has not fully ruled out surgery but wants more time to consider this. Over time, he has seemed to accept amputation but would prefer a below knee amputation.</span></p>

GF was represented by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor who instructed Mr Rylatt of Counsel. I am grateful to them for their assistance. They rightly identified that I did not have before me any evidence from a consultant anesthetist. Hence, although GF had already undergone preliminary testing such as &#8220;stress&#8221; testing, provision was agreed between the parties and approved by me to enable this application to come back before me if the Consultant Anesthetist assessing GF before his operation raised any issues of concern. With that mechanism in place, an agreed order was placed before me in the terms summarized at the beginning of this judgment.</span></p>

AB thanked all involved in the case for the diligence and sensitivity.

Firstly, this case has been heard in public subject to a transparency/reporting restrictions order. I consider that where, as here, a case has been listed for a final hearing in public, if it is reasonably practicable, a short judgment should be published so that the public may know, if they wish, what has happened and why it has happened. Secondly, GF should have a record which he can access at his will which sets out why he has had his leg amputated and the steps that were taken to make sure that that amputation was in his best interests. GF did not want to see me as part of the hearing. However, I am conscious that his views on the operation have been sought by the Official Solicitor and those treating him. I have recorded a summary of those views in this judgment, and I have factored those views into my decision making. He should know that and the outcome of this hearing, which after all is about him.</span></p>

However, he does not understand that the ulcer has become infected, and he does not understand that the antibiotics he has been given have not worked. It is Dr B&#8217;s opinion that he does not understand the consequent risk of overwhelming infection, possible sepsis and ultimately death. GF listened carefully as Dr B tried to explain to him what was wrong with his leg and why he needed surgery. However, he did not appear to understand the relevant information. Dr B&#8217;s experience is not isolated. GF has had the pertinent information explained to him on a number of occasions by clinicians, but the evidence is that he is unable to recall key points about his condition, in particular he could not recall that his leg was not responding to antibiotic treatment. In Dr B&#8217;s opinion GF is not able to retain relevant information. Whilst GF is willing to engage in the decision-making process, GF is unable to weigh up the risks and benefits of treatment. He cannot use the information he has been given to make a reasoned decision. He cannot weigh the relevant information. Dr B is satisfied that GF&#8217;s inability to make a decision about the amputation of his leg and his care and treatment plan is because of his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and that his condition is possibly also impacted by delirium linked to the infection of his leg. Whilst Dr B&#8217;s opinion is that it is possible that treating his delirium may slightly improve his mental state, she considers that his chronic residual symptoms of schizophrenia mean that it is unlikely that there would be a significant improvement which would bring about any meaningful change in his decision-making capacity.</span></p>

However, he appeared to accept her explanation that this did not seem to be adequate, and that more serious intervention was necessary. He did not seem to recall the detailed discussions he has had with other clinicians about surgery, but when prompted by Dr B, he expressed a desire not to have this, until he had given more time for the other treatments to work, i.e. that he had not completely ruled this out. </span></p>

They have been involved in the Multi-Disciplinary Foot Team discussions about GF's treatment.  It is the collective view of all involved in those discussions that GF&#8217;s right lower leg is extensively gangrenous and necrotic and unsalvageable. GF is likely to suffer life&#8211;threatening sepsis if the leg is not amputated. Other treatment options have been considered including an aortic-femoral bypass/revascularization which would improve blood supply to the wound and allow healing. However, the procedure would take 6-8 hours and given the acute infection GF is not considered to have sufficient physiological reserve. The collective view is that major amputation is the only viable treatment option for GF. The extent of the necrosis in the calf and the presence of aorto-bi-iliac occlusion means that the amputation must be above-the knee. The surgical procedure will take about an hour. It has, I am told, the advantage of being a definitive procedure for GF from which he is likely to recover well.</span></p>

In addition, there are risks that arise out of a General Anesthetic in every case where such an anesthetic is administered.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I also factor in that the operation may impact GF&#8217;s mental ill health. The treatment will involve amputation which may prove distressing to him.  It is hard to predict the potential impact on GF&#8217;s mental health if he was to have the treatment against his wishes. The amputation may well become incorporated into his chronic delusions. However, as things are GF cannot mobilise without use of a wheelchair, he is fully dependent on others and confined to hospital and he is likely to be in pain. Without the above knee amputation, he will become increasingly unwell physically, increasingly delirious (which would likely present as confused and potentially agitated) and I am told that he will eventually die of sepsis, which is contrary to his expressed wish to live.</span></p>

Accordingly, I find that it is lawful and in GF&#8217;s best interests to undergo surgery to have his right leg amputated above the knee and to receive care and treatment in accordance with the terms of the treatment plan dated 3 April 2024. Pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.16</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, I consent on behalf of GF to the provision of the treatment set out in the treatment plan dated 3 April 2024.</span></p>
