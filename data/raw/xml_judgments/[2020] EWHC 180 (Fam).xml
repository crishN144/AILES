The Third Respondent had the assistance of a translator. There was some lack of clarity after the hearing as to whether Mr Quintavalle had been representing the Mother. However, as there was no difference in position before the court between the Mother and the Father, and Mr Quintavalle assured me by email after the hearing that he had been representing the Mother at the substantive hearing, I will record him as having done so. I am very grateful to counsel and Ms Stanley for the sensitive way they presented a very difficult case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The facts of the case are tragic and one can only have the greatest sympathy for what the parents are going through. Midrar was born at full term, but his Mother&#8217;s membranes had ruptured on the way to hospital and there was a cord prolapse, which meant that oxygen was cut off to his brain. He had an undetectable heart rate and no respiratory output when born, his heart was restarted but he has been on a ventilator at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) since his birth. Three brain stem death tests dealing with death by neurological criteria (DNC) have been carried out, the first on 1 October 2019 and each has concluded that Midrar is brain stem dead. The Trust wishes to take him off the ventilator and allow his life to come to an end, whereas the parents wish him to remain on the ventilator.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The issue I have to decide is whether Midrar is dead, according to DNC as set out in the relevant clinical guidance, and therefore the ventilator can be removed. The Trust argues this is not a best interests analysis under the inherent jurisdiction, because if Midrar is dead then best interests do not arise. Both Mr Davy and Ms Stanley agreed that if I concluded that Midrar did not meet the DNC then it would not be appropriate or fair on the family for me to go on to consider best interests, as a separate legal test.  But, Mr Power in his report to the court had analysed Midrar&#8217;s best interests and concluded that it was in Midrar&#8217;s best interests that the ventilator should be removed and his life come to an end. Mr Quintavalle argues that best interests are relevant to whether I make the declarations sought.  </p>

He was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and has remained there since. I would like at this stage to pay tribute to the care he has received and the commitment of the staff in the Unit who do what must be an enormously difficult and emotionally draining job. From the evidence that I have heard it appears that Midrar&#8217;s heart and organs have continued to function in large part because of the expert care he has received from staff in the most difficult of conditions.  </p>

The Trust suggested getting an independent consultant from another Trust to review the position, and Dr Y (consultant neonatologist) at Liverpool Women&#8217;s Hospital was instructed. He examined Midrar and reviewed the clinical notes on 29 October and his opinion states; </p>

He will eventually develop ventilator associated pneumonia. He will start to develop muscle wasting and joint contractures. It is likely that internal homeostasis will be disturbed as he no longer has central control of endocrine or autonomic functions. It may be possible to manage some of these complications by medical intervention. This is likely to require repeated reintubation of the trachea, chest physiotherapy and airway suction, repositioning and nursing care to maintain skin integrity, multiple blood tests, repeated venous cannulation and antibiotic administration, escalation of ventilator settings and oxygen administration and an increasing number of drugs to be administered. </span></p>

It will also place a significant burden of distress onto his family and onto those who are caring for him given the futility of these interventions and the associated unkindness.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.78in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">First, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness does not by itself entail individual death. Patients in the vegetative state (VS) have also lost this capacity (see section 6.9). The difference between them and patients who are declared dead by virtue of irreversible cessation of brain-stem function is that the latter cannot continue to breathe unaided without respiratory support, along with other lifesustaining biological interventions. This also means that even if the body of the deceased remains on respiratory support, the loss of integrated biological function will inevitably lead to deterioration and organ necrosis within a short time.  </span></p>

What does follow from such a diagnosis is that none of these potential activities indicates any form of consciousness associated with human life, particularly the ability to feel, to be aware of, or to do, anything. Where such residual activity exists, it will not do so for long due to the rapid breakdown of other bodily functions. </span></p>

However, as this movement is independent of the brain and is controlled through the spinal cord, it is neither indicative of the ability to feel, be aware of, or to respond to, any stimulus, nor to sustain respiration or allow other bodily functions to continue. </span></p>

It is for this reason that patients with such activity can no longer benefit from supportive treatment and legal certification of their death is appropriate. </span></p>

When the patient is in the tragic situation of someone like Midrar the relevant clinical tests are those set out in the 2008 Code, in particular section 6.

Dr G (consultant neonatologist in the NICU) who has been Midrar&#8217;s lead consultant on the NICU and first attended him about 3 minutes after he was born. She has been a consultant neonatologist since 2003. Dr M (a consultant neonatologist at NICU) who carried out the third DNC test. Dr B (a consultant intensivist at PICU) who carried out all three DNC tests. Dr Y (a consultant neonatologist at Liverpool Women&#8217;s Hospital) who was asked to give an independent opinion in the hope of reaching an agreement with the parents and therefore was not a treating clinician, but equally was not appointed as an independent expert in the litigation.

However, I make clear here that all four of the medical witnesses were in my view eminently well qualified to give the evidence they did. Their evidence was entirely clear and consistent, and none of them had any doubt that Midrar was brain stem dead and that he was not capable of breathing. Dr G, who has been Midrar&#8217;s lead consultant since very shortly after birth was plainly doing her utmost to maintain as good a relationship as possible with the parents, even in these very difficult circumstances. </p>

He plainly cared passionately for his son, and was driven by a very human desire to maintain hope in all circumstances and not to give up on him. Mr Ali has a degree in biomedical science and had examined the medical records and watched the monitors in detail. He and the Mother&#8217;s love and commitment to Midrar cannot be in any doubt. However, his desire to cling on to any hope does appear to have led him to interpret material in the way he wanted rather than at times listening to the evidence. An example was that he was convinced that Midrar had been sedated for long periods of his time in NICU, including during the tests. There was simply no evidence to support this suggestion, which was a highly damaging one to the Trust. The drug charts have been disclosed and save for the first two days of life no sedatives had been administered, as Mr Quintavalle accepted.  Mr Ali also had alleged that various clinicians had a conflict of interest because they had some involvement in organ donation. Again this is a highly damaging (and hurtful) allegation for which there was no evidence. Again this was not pursued by Mr Quintavalle.  I refer to these points because although the greatest sympathy must be extended to parents, that does not mean that they can have a free rein to make allegations against the doctors who are treating their child, where there is no basis for such allegations.  </p>

Firstly, he argues that the DNC tests are not reliable because Dr E was not suitably qualified; it is not clear that the apnoea test was carried out in the right circumstances; and parental consent was not obtained for the tests. Secondly, Mr Quintavalle argues that there is evidence that shows that Midrar is not brain stem dead. </p>

It is correct that Dr E had not carried out a DNC test previously, and had not been on any training course but had watched a video of the tests. He was undoubtedly appropriately qualified as a consultant neonatologist of the sufficient number of years qualification in accordance with the Code. There is no requirement for any specific training to be undertaken and for each individual there will necessarily be a first time they undertake the test. It is worth noting that the tests are not in themselves complicated, but involve close observation of the patient.  Dr B, who has carried out DNC tests on a number of occasions, said that in her view Dr E was appropriately qualified and carried out the tests appropriately. She also made clear that it is good practice for one of the treating clinicians to undertake the tests, so that one of them knows the child. </p>

Until the 2015 Guidance was produced DNC tests were not carried out on babies under 2 months old. Dr B said that so far as she was aware, in the year 2018/19 only one child of that age was DNC tested. It is therefore inevitable that very few doctors will have much experience of conducting the tests on very young babies, and happily not even that much experience on the slightly older children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The second issue raised concerns whether Midrar was in the appropriately oxygenated condition when the apnoea test was carried out. Mr Quintavalle pointed to the fact that the PaO2 for the apnoea test needs to be above 10kPA, but when the DNC was started the capillary blood test showed only 8.1kPA. However, this point goes nowhere because, as Dr B pointed out, the key issue is that Midrar was 100% oxygenated before the apnoea test element was commenced. Therefore, Dr B could be entirely confident that his Pa02 levels were above 10 by the time that stage of the overall test was reached. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The third issue is that Mr Quintavalle argues that the DNC tests could only be carried out if the parents had given fully informed consent. He relies on <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Glass v UK</span> to argue that the tests would be invalid without such consent. In my view this argument is wrong for a number of reasons. Firstly, the parents were aware that the tests were going to be carried out probably that day, as is shown by the transcript of the conversation with Dr E, and the Father did ultimately accept this. The transcript does not suggest that the Father or Mother said the tests should not go ahead. Further, the parents were fully informed as to the purpose of the tests, so in my view the issue about &#8220;informed&#8221; consent goes nowhere on the facts of the case.  Secondly, I do not think there is any requirement for written consent from the parents, or for the information to be written down. There is no such requirement in the Code. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Glass</span> is dealing with a very different situation, where the issue was the withdrawal of certain treatment. It is not clear to me that consent would necessarily have to be given for a test at all. But, I do not have to decide that issue because the parents undoubtedly knew that the test was to be carried out, and knew what the test was about. Therefore they were given the appropriate information, and on the facts of the case their consent can be inferred from their conduct. Thirdly, and in any event, even if the tests should not have taken place because of lack of consent that does not mean that the outputs of the test would not be admissible before me. I am being asked to decide a factual question as to whether Midrar is dead, and lack of consent would not vitiate the evidence that goes to that issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The final issue is that the Father and Mother do not believe that Midrar can be brain stem dead because they have seen him making movements on a number of occasions; he was seen to be sweating during the circumcision that took place last week, and they believe the output screen from the ventilator shows that Midrar has been attempting to breathe. They also argue that the fact that his organs (including his heart) have continued to function for such a long period after the first DNC test indicates either that the outcome of the test should not be followed or that the test was wrong.  For these reasons Mr Quintavalle asserts that Midrar cannot be brain stem dead.  </p>

Dr G and Dr B both explained that the movements that the parents and the clinicians have seen are not movements emanating from brain activity, but rather are reflexes from the spinal cord. Dr G explained that in patients who are brain stem dead their spinal cord nervous system (the peripheral nervous system) can continue to give rise to reflexes, which is what have been observed. Both Dr G and Dr B said this response was quite normal in such patients. </p>

The Trust witnesses say that the chest movements are the same phenomenon as responses by the peripheral nervous system rather than any brain stem activity. There may be some very small movements of the chest but these are not attempts to breathe. Dr G was very clear that when the apnoea test is being undertaken and the CO2 levels are allowed to increase, the patient, even a small baby, will make a clear and obvious gasp for air and that this is definitely not what was seen with Midrar at the third DNC test, when the apnoea test was being undertaken and Midrar&#8217;s chest moved.  Dr B, who has carried out the DNC tests on a number of occasions and has treated a very large number of very sick young babies, was completely clear in cross examination that what was seen was not an attempt to breathe. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The Trust witnesses make the following points. Firstly, it is extremely rare for an infant to be kept on a ventilator for a prolonged period after they have been found to be brain stem dead. In fact, it appears that Midrar may have spent the longest time in this condition of any recorded case in the UK. This means that it is unsurprising that there is no documentation on how long the heart will continue to beat in that situation, because it virtually never arises. This is not an indicator that Midrar is not brain stem dead, but rather that the unhappy situation that has arisen in this case is exceptionally rare. Dr Y explained that the heart muscle will continue to beat regardless of whether there is neurological integrity. </p>

It seems that most, if not all, of these cases are ones of pregnant women where the woman who is brain stem dead, is kept on a ventilator so that the foetus can develop to the point where it can be born at a reasonable gestation period. </p>
