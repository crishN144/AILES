It turned out that, in fact, she was about twenty-nine weeks pregnant.  The lady is a member of an ethnic minority community which I will not more precisely identify.  To a social worker at the hospital shortly afterwards she stated that her boyfriend was not the father of her unborn child and that she had become pregnant from a one-night stand after clubbing and that she had never seen the man concerned again.  </span></p>

On the date of the birth itself the mother signed a form, consenting to the baby being voluntarily placed with the applicant local authority pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and to being placed for adoption.

She did give a name as being the name of her fianc&#233;.  So, already differing  accounts had emerged as to the circumstances in which the mother became pregnant and as to the identity or whereabouts of the father.  The mother is reported as briefly wavering as to whether or not she wished the child to be adopted, but with that brief exception she has consistently expressed that she cannot look after the child herself and that she wishes the child to be adopted and herself to have no further involvement at all.  Indeed, it transpired that this very premature baby had a heart defect which required surgery and there was some difficulty and delay in obtaining the mother&#8217;s consent to that surgery, although ultimately she did consent and the surgery was successfully performed.  </span></p>

She says at its lowest that she would be ostracised by her family and the community, and at its highest and at worst that she herself might be killed.  Indeed, she sent an email to the social worker  which says:</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is, of course, axiomatic that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, the statute and rules and practice all require that before consideration is given to the adoption of a child, both genetic parents, if known, must be identified, located and made aware of the circumstances.  Further, good practice requires that before a child is adopted or placed for adoption, consideration must be given to whether there could be a home for that child within the wider maternal or paternal families, But most rules have an exception, and a number of authorities which have been drawn to my attention, but which it is not necessary to cite, do make clear that in very rare and very exceptional circumstances it is permissible, and may be appropriate and justifiable, for the court to dispense even with those requirements of notice.  I am satisfied on the facts and in the circumstances, as I have briefly summarised and described them, that this is, indeed, one of those very rare and exceptional cases.  In the forefront, of course, must be consideration of the best interests of the child concerned.  In the light of those facts and circumstances, it is really impossible to conceive how it could be of any benefit to this child to seek further reliably to identify the child&#8217;s genetic father so that he can be given notice.  It is equally impossible to conceive how it could be of any benefit to this child for the child&#8217;s wider maternal or, if identified, wider paternal family to have notice.  The child&#8217;s own mother has made this desperately painful and dreadful decision that she can have nothing further to do with her child and has expressed most eloquently in that email both her continuing love for her child and her fear of the consequences if her family find out what has happened.  That being the belief and assessment of the child&#8217;s own mother, it is unrealistic to imagine that this child might, in fact, find a home within either her wider maternal or her paternal family.  </span></p>

There is, in fact, no psychological relationship at all between this child and any members of either the maternal or paternal family since none of them even know of the child&#8217;s existence and none of them have ever met the child.  What legal relationship may exist between the child and the father is speculative.  It is true to say that if the genetic father is, in fact, the man who is now lawfully married under English civil law to the mother, then he would, by virtue of that marriage, have acquired parental responsibility for the child. But, as I have described, the identity of the father remains obscure and highly speculative and could not, frankly, be reliably established now without DNA testing.  </span></p>

As recently as yesterday she had a further meeting with a team manager of the local authority, who is present in court today.  She signed a form of advance consent to adoption in the presence of, and witnessed by, that team manager.  At the same time she was given by the team manager a letter, which I have seen, making plain to her that there was this hearing here today, and that she could attend if she wished; and making plain to her that if at any stage she changes her mind and decides that she does not want the child to be adopted she could and should contact the manager immediately.  The mother has not attended today.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In these exceptional circumstances I am satisfied, first, that grounds exist for making a care order placing this child in the care of the local authority.  Those grounds quite simply are that from the moment of the child&#8217;s birth the child&#8217;s mother has not wished to care for the child or made herself available to care for the child, and save under arrangements made by the local authority this child would not receive the care and nurture the child needs.  So, I will make a care order placing the child in the care of the local authority.  I am satisfied also that the conditions exist in this case for making a placement order and that the mother has given the required consent for that purpose in the form which she signed yesterday. So there will be a placement order in the prescribed standard form.  There will be a freestanding order or declaration, in terms which counsel and the solicitor for the guardian will shortly draft, to the effect (without at this point dictating the language) that neither the local authority nor the guardian need take any further steps to seek to identify or locate the father of the child, nor to give any notice of these or any future adoption proceedings to any member of the maternal or putative paternal family.  The order can include the wording that counsel drafted in her most helpful case summary for today, that:</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Counsel did go one further by her case summary and, indeed, by her cogent submissions today, by asking me to make an additional order or declaration that:</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;Unless the mother has contacted the local authority to indicate that she would wish to be informed of any application to adopt [the child] prior to the issue of any application to adopt [the child], the mother shall not be served with notice of such proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-size:14pt">In my view, that particular proposed order goes too far, at any rate at this stage.  As counsel frankly accepted, it would be in conflict with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/141" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 141</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> and the rules made pursuant to that section.  However exceptional it may be not to seek out and give notice to a putative father or wider family members, it is even more exceptional not to give notice of adoption proceedings to the mother who actually carried and gave birth to the child.  The fact is that at the moment prospective adopters have not even been identified for this child; the child has not been placed with a view to adoption, and any actual adoption application must be many months away.  There is no knowing whether or not, or in what circumstances, the mother might make further contact with the local authority and/or the guardian.  In any event, recent history has shown that it is possible for both the local authority and the guardian to establish some line of communication with this mother without, it seems, imperilling the mother.  As I have said, the guardian has spoken to her twice on the telephone and they have had email exchanges, and the team manager saw the mother at local authority offices as recently as yesterday pursuant to some arrangement or appointment. So I am not prepared to go so far as to make an order that at some time in the future the mother is to be denied all notice of actual adoption proceedings to adopt her child, but in other respects I am prepared to make, and do make, orders as requested.  </span></p>
