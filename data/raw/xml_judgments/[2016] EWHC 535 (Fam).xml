She is profoundly neurologically disabled, with encephalopathy and microcephaly; she has cortical visual impairment, as well as sound sensitivity.  She is globally developmentally delayed, suffers from prolonged seizures, and is fed by gastrostomy.  She has advanced scoliosis of her spine and subluxation of her hip.  She currently receives oxygen supplement by nasal cannula.  The unanimous medical opinion in this case is that even with the best care in the world, S remains at significant risk of sudden and unexpected death.  </p>

While in hospital, her health rapidly deteriorated.  By 3 February 2016, S was in a life-threatening state; the treating clinicians frankly believed that she was at the point of dying.   </p>

An interim declaration to that effect was granted that night; on the following day, the application was restored by S&#8217;s father (who by then had obtained representation) for variation of the order, before Mostyn J.  At the conclusion of a short hearing, at which evidence was called, a further interim declaration was made, in broadly similar terms to the order made on the previous night (and in the terms set out at &#167;20 below).  S&#8217;s condition fortunately improved, and she was discharged back to foster care on 22 February.  She was briefly re-admitted to hospital with further concerns about her breathing last week.  As it happens, in the intervening period her brother has separately been admitted to hospital with uncontrollable seizures.  </p>

They have dispensed with the services of their solicitor and have represented themselves before me, participating by telephone over the two days.  I have read the relevant reports and statements; Dr. A gave oral evidence, and was cross-examined reasonably extensively by the father.

The father has lived in England since 1991, the mother since 2005; they lived in the Durham area from 2013.  In May 2014, the mother returned to India, ostensibly for three weeks for a wedding, leaving the children in the father&#8217;s care.  The mother did not in fact return until August 2015 and while in India gave birth to her fourth child (October 2014).  In May 2015, S was admitted to hospital from home suffering prolonged <span style="font-style:italic">status epilepticus</span>; she was an in-patient until November 2015.  </p>

Although the parents were not at court, no application was made on their behalf to adjourn the hearing; the Local Authority&#8217;s application proceeded by way of oral submissions.  Counsel for the parents highlighted evidential weaknesses in the Local Authority&#8217;s case, but the parents&#8217; challenge to the factual basis of the <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV </span>care application, and to the plan of the authority, was perforce circumscribed by their absence from the hearing and the lack of immediate instructions.  At the conclusion of the hearing HHJ Simon Wood delivered a judgment (reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>[2016] EWFC B7) and made care orders.  In doing so, he said this (see &#167;47):</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.95in">&#8220;The conduct of both parents in this litigation, especially given the repeated warnings that have been given by the court of the effect of failure to participate, has to translate into an inability to prioritise these children. Sadly, since they left, there has been no contact really, asking about the children&#8217;s welfare. The children appear to be settled and, within their limitations, thriving and making an attachment to their carers now in their placement. It is not suggested that either parent does not love their children. The father clearly loves them very much indeed and there are signs of some kind of bond. But what is completely unfathomable is what it is that drives his views and prevents him from engaging in a way that would better meet their needs.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">The father holds strong and dogmatic views on the treatment of his children. Some of these views are paranoid and delusional. His insistence on the validity of these views impinges on the ability of the treating team to treat the children effectively.

She shows minimal awareness of the presence of her brother.  Her life expectancy has always been significantly shortened, due to the profound nature of her disability and health needs; death in childhood is a not infrequent occurrence in such profound neuro-disability, however recognising what may be the final illness of a profoundly disabled child is very difficult.  Dr. A (speaking for the treating clinicians) expresses the view that it is, sadly, possible in S&#8217;s case to track a general decline in her health and functioning over recent weeks and months and some of this stems back to a relative neglect of her care needs whilst in the care of her parents. If S suffers a cardiac arrest, this will be the consequence of &#8220;acute-on-chronic&#8221; respiratory failure, with associated severe hypoxia and metabolic disturbance: achieving resuscitation in this situation is extremely difficult, and even if a cardiac output is regained, there is highly likely to be a period of multi-organ failure. Dr. A goes on:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;[T]he likelihood of successful resuscitation for any child suffering a cardiac arrest, even with access to advanced life-support procedures is fairly low. In S&#8217;s case this is likely to be even lower, and the medical consensus is that the chances of successful resuscitation, following a cardiopulmonary arrest are virtually nil for S.  In addition to the negligible chance of success in the situation of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation, S would be at high risk of sustaining serious physical injury from the process of chest compression, like rib fractures, due to her thin bones and possibly severe bruising. Even if S recovers from the current illness, she is likely to succumb to increasingly frequent respiratory infections in the future, each of which will be life-threatening, and with an increasing risk of being infected with multi-antibiotic resistant organisms.&#8221;</p>

S, in her opinion, is not such a child.  The clinicians are of the view that it would be technically extremely difficult to provide S with adequate sedation and analgesia to achieve effective intensive care, including intubation and ventilation. The clinicians are of the combined opinion that there is a very high risk that S would not be able to recover sufficiently from an intensive care episode in order to be able to survive independently once such support was withdrawn.

She is Chair of the British Academy of Childhood Disability. She has had access to the papers filed in this application, to the extensive medical records concerning S, has spoken with the treating clinicians, and has had the benefit of meeting with and assessing S. Put shortly, Dr. Horridge concurs fully with the views of the clinicians, both in describing S&#8217;s condition, and in evaluating the treatment options for her. She supports this application.  I therefore select from her report for this judgment only particular features which have assisted me in understanding S&#8217;s condition, and guiding me in determining this application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Horridge describes S&#8217;s marked abnormality of muscle tone known as dystonia, most obviously demonstrated by her kyphoscoliosis or curvature of the spine. As the curvature has progressed over time it has compressed S&#8217;s internal organs including her lungs, which makes her more vulnerable to chest infections and skin infections. S&#8217;s spinal curvature is now so severe that this poses the most major risk to her health. The window for correcting this condition has, regrettably, now passed; the clear view is that S would not tolerate intensive care treatment.  Dr. Horridge goes on:</p>

If she is sick enough to be in respiratory failure, it is highly unlikely that even with intensive care, her life will be significantly prolonged. To put S through intensive care would likely change the mode and place of her death and again may deny her the chance to die naturally with dignity.  Should S deteriorate and go into respiratory failure, her symptoms should be managed at all times to ensure her comfort and dignity.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Horridge explains that the risk of respiratory arrest is greater for S than cardiac arrest; severe kyphoscoliosis affecting body posture is restricting the movement of her chest wall, which in turn restricts her ability to move air effectively in and out of her lungs. There is increasing risk over time that S&#8217;s lungs are more squashed and that movement in and out of the air sacs in her lungs will reduce over time, reducing her capacity to oxygenate her blood. She also has a degree of upper airway obstruction, caused by dysfunction of coordination of the nerves and muscles around the upper airway.  Any future severe infection creates a significant risk of respiratory failure; there is a risk that S would become tired and stop breathing altogether.  It is Dr. Horridge&#8217;s view (referred to at &#167;1 above) that S remains at significant risk of sudden and unexpected death; it is quite possible that she could die in her sleep at night without warning.  </p>

Dr. Horridge further recommends that the clinical team may wish to seek expert opinion from a senior paediatric intensive care specialist regarding the potential risks and benefits to S of intensive care.

It is S, and her situation alone, on whom I focus.   I am satisfied that the combination of her disabilities render her particularly vulnerable to respiratory failure, while her thin brittle bones, and advanced kyphoscoliosis, are likely severely to impede cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any effective, safe, and/or beneficial way.  S is not a child for whom intensive care would bring obvious benefits, as it does for so many children and adults; on the contrary, at best it would be likely to bring her only temporary dependence on artificial ventilation, medical complication, and discomfort.  Any life beyond such intensive care would, I find, be of significantly diminished quality, even from its current &#8220;poor&#8221; baseline (see &#167;18 above), and it would, I find, be adversely affected by regular (I suspect increasing) pain.

She could potentially have a prolonged life, in the care of her current foster carers, and with her brother; that said, it is difficult to ascertain her &#8216;likes or dislikes&#8217; or any sense she has of proximity to her brother (see &#167;16 above) so the quality of her life is currently difficult to measure.  Even assuming, as I do, that there is or may be some benefit to her by prolongation of life, any perceived benefit is in my judgment significantly outweighed by the considerably compromised situation in which she will be left. Ultimately, failed resuscitation would be likely to strip her of any vestigial dignity as she survives (however briefly) intensive care before inevitably and shortly passing away.  It is my view that carefully planned palliative care would be considerably more beneficial for her than intensive care: transfer into palliation is entirely in accordance with the &#8220;moral duty&#8221; on clinicians described in the RCPCH 2015 Framework (see &#167;22(ix) above).  The treating clinicians have set out how they would propose to interpret and apply the discretion which they seek from the court in the way they propose to treat S; I have summarised this at &#167;21 above.  Their approach seems to me to achieve an appropriate blend of humanity and sound clinical practice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have paid close attention to the wider views of the parents in this case, which I have summarised at &#167;30 and &#167;32 above.  They love S and have a unique relationship with her, which in my decision-making has to be (and is) properly respected.   I am satisfied that they have had the fullest opportunity to contribute to my determination, having been offered the funding of their airfares to attend the hearing; in the end they participated throughout by telephone.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No one can doubt their stress, and distress, at having to confront these extraordinary and profound decisions concerning their daughter; their frustration and sense of impotence in trying to deal with this litigation remotely, even if that is to an extent a situation of their own making, was also palpable.  They expressed their opinions about S&#8217;s care forcefully, and with more than a little anger during the hearing.  As I observed at &#167;12 above, I was able to see for myself what HH Judge Simon Wood had described as the father&#8217;s strong and dogmatic views on the treatment of his children. The father&#8217;s strongly worded attacks on the individual medical professionals (on Dr. A in particular) and on the health service in general were, however, unwarranted and ill-judged; they suggested a degree of paranoia.  As I make clear elsewhere in this judgment, I consider that Drs A, B and C have been, and are, dealing with S&#8217;s complex care with exceptional skill and obvious humanity.  I reject the parents&#8217; contention that S&#8217;s deterioration has in material respects been caused or aggravated by sub-optimal care by the Local Authority and/or her treating doctors; while I acknowledge that there is a coincidence in timing with the recent significant life-threatening deterioration in her condition following shortly from the making of a full care order, it is no more or less than that &#8211; a coincidence.  Indeed, there is a strong suggestion in the medical evidence that had S received surgery to address the curvature of the spine in the period while she was in her parents&#8217; care <span style="font-style:italic">prior </span>to May 2015, the difficulties of treating her now would not be so acute (see &#167;24 above).</p>

She is critically frail (as Dr. C has observed) and could collapse at any time.  The decision has to be made now.</p>

As I indicated above, I share Dr. Horridge&#8217;s view of the exceptionally high quality of care which S is currently receiving from Drs. A, B and C.  The clearly expressed and clinically sound views of the treating team are amply re-inforced by the independent views of Dr. Horridge and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, and consistent with the RCPCH 2015 Framework.  I confirm that I regard both Dr. Horridge and the Guardian as providing views which are truly independent of the treating clinicians and of each other.  The Guardian brings to the case valuable knowledge and experience of S (and of her parents) over a period of time, and I am satisfied that she has approached the assessment of the particular issue here, and in her initiative to seek a second opinion, with fresh eyes.  </p>

But it is not absolute, nor necessarily decisive; and may be outweighed if the pleasures and the quality of life are sufficiently small and the pain and suffering or other burdens of living are sufficiently great.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">'There is without doubt a very strong presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong life, but &#8230; it is not irrebuttable &#8230; Account has to be taken of the pain and suffering and quality of life which the child will experience if life is prolonged. Account has also to be taken of the pain and suffering involved in the proposed treatment&#8230; We know that the instinct and desire for survival is very strong. We all believe in and assert the sanctity of human life &#8230;. Even very severely handicapped people find a quality of life rewarding which to the unhandicapped may seem manifestly intolerable. People have an amazing adaptability. But in the end there will be cases in which the answer must be that it is not in the interests of the child to subject it to treatment which will cause it increased suffering and produce no commensurate benefit, giving the fullest possible weight to the child's, and mankind's desire to survive.'</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">The views and opinions of both the doctors and the parents must be carefully considered. Where, as in this case, the parents spend a great deal of time with their child, their views may have particular value because they know the patient and how he reacts so well; although the court needs to be mindful that the views of any parents may, very understandably, be coloured by their own emotion or sentiment. It is important to stress that the reference is to the views and opinions of the parents. Their own wishes, however understandable in human terms, are wholly irrelevant to consideration of the objective best interests of the child save to the extent in any given case that they may illuminate the quality and value to the child of the child/parent relationship."</p>
