The judge gives permission for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of this judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. If the judgment is to be reported or published, there is a requirement to ensure that no reporting restriction will be breached. This is particularly important in relation to any case involving a sexual offence, where the victim is guaranteed lifetime anonymity (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992), or where an order has been made in relation to a young person. All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.</span></p>

That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from say negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of section 31(2)."</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one-person hearing accounts given by others.

During this argument M said she pushed F&#8217;s keyboard down the stairs following which there was a physical struggle between them.  She says during this she was struck to the face.  She said at first, she thought he had hit her to the face but was later told she had hit herself with her hand during the struggle.  She said she ran upstairs in a panic and threw the first thing to hand to prevent him from following her.  This happened to be the drill which hit F to the head causing the injury.

The local authority contend that the deliberate lies and minimisation of matters are inextricably linked to important wider canvas issues and are designed to prevent professionals from viewing how the injuries to A were sustained in their full context.  I will return to the oral evidence of M and F in due course in this judgment.</p>

He said that the important point to him was that it does not make a good diagnosis just because there might be an over presentation of one or other alternative of aetiological groups.  That does not make a good diagnostic criteria as if 60% are abuse and 40% are non-abuse you cannot use that as diagnostic criteria of abuse as would be wrong in 40% of cases.

The other possibility he posited was that the fractures occurred without excessive force as a freak event.

Initially he replied that he had never seen fractures like this from a throw and catch activity nor had he seen descriptions of it in literature.  He caveated this response by saying that this was based on the assumption that the child had been caught around the chest but it would be a different situation if the child was caught by the arms as F suggests he did to A.  He said throwing a child in any direction would result in gravity doing its job.  If the child is then caught by the arms, it would induce a very severe traction of the arm and traction of the arm is one possible mechanism for a fracture of the nature seen here.  He added that it would  not matter whether the child was caught by the inner or outer arm as if a child who had some speed due to gravitational acceleration was caught by the arm one would easily accept that it would lead to traction of the arm beyond what seem part of reasonable handling.</p>

Dr Saggar replied that even without that information M has a lot of features that in his opinion fit within the spectrum or syndrome for EDS type 3 hypermobile the most severe being hEDS.  He added that the only reason he had not said M has hEDS is because of the strict 2017 criteria under which a person has to have a Beighton score of 5 or greater.  M is 2/9 so officially he is not allowed to say hEDS.  However, he said that the 2017 criteria does not take into account all of the non-muscular skeletal issues such as POTS, chronic fatigue and bladder problems and brain fog/confusion.  He said he was confident that M is on the spectrum without doubt.</p>

She said she had tried to imagine the topple onto the plug and could not see it injuring just the concha whilst sparing other parts of the ear.  She expanded on this when questioned by Mr Day saying that the extension tower is a tube and if A had fallen on to it there would be a bruise around the outer ear and that she did not see how it could have gone into the inner ear.  She accepted that whether the bruise was inflicted or accidental something had to have entered the inner part of the ear (the concha) with some sort of force to cause the injury.  She said that the use of a cotton bud from her knowledge and experience does not explain the bruise.  She added that the concha is very much in the protected part of the ear and is an unusual area to bruise accidentally.  In fact, with 30 years&#8217; experience Dr Alu could not recall seeing an isolated bruise in this location previously.  </p>

Her view remained the same even in relation to a child with fragile bones.  This remained her position until towards the end of Mr Day&#8217;s cross examination when she said that her reading of the literature was that such fractures require forceful twisting but if Dr Olsen says it is possible then &#8216;maybe&#8217;.</p>

However, when questioned by Miss Edmondson it was clear that she had either not read or not appreciated the oral evidence of Dr Saggar that A in his opinion had more than a 50% chance of having inherited HSD due to other features he had identified during his assessment.  Her evidence was that Dr Saggar said A had a 50% chance which does not make it more likely.  She went on to say  that if (and she said if is the key word) A had HSD she would be susceptible to more easy bruising but A did not have a diagnosis of HSD and that even if she did it would not mean that all bruises are due to HSD.  To Mr Rees she said that she had considered the statement of the foster carer and there was nothing remarkable in that statement to suggest that A had a propensity to bruise easily.</p>

Dr Alu said that joint hypermobility is subject to significant uncertainty and confusion.  She added that not being an expert on HSD her limited understanding was the literature as it is would still say fractures under the age of 1 are not seen.  She again pointed out that even if A were diagnosed with HSD, then that is not mutually exclusive with NAI as children with HSD can still have NAI.  In respect of A, she maintained that the explanations are not plausible and given the lack of plausibility NAI is high on the list.</p>

She may have gone off her feeds.  She pointed out that all children are different and from her experience a carer may not pick up on the fact that A had been injured.  She accepted that A is likely to have cried at the time of fracture but in the context that children of that age cry for a variety of reasons.  She again said that a parent may not pick it up as a sign of something untoward.  She said that from her experience parents do not necessarily realise that they have caused a fracture or injury so would not necessarily attribute the cry to what they had or had not done.</p>

She said that metaphyseal fractures tend not to present that way.  She described them as being occult.  and do not present the same as other fractures clinically.  She added when questioned by Mr Rees that, given the occult nature of metaphyseal fractures and the fact they are often not picked up until the child is presented for other reasons, it would suggest that such fractures do not always present with pain.</p>

She also confirmed that she deferred to Dr Olsen.  She would not accept that A has a diagnosis of HSD and repeatedly drew a distinction between a formal clinical diagnosis and the evidence of Dr Saggar.  She said that she was entitled to her opinion; that A does not have a diagnosis of HSD and even if she did it did not exclude NAI.  She maintained that no plausible mechanism had been proffered by M or F for the injuries.</p>

F asked how anyone could hurt this little thing.  At 15:00, F said he had done his own research and found that the injuries could be caused due to the c section but rare.  He said he had played with A by throwing her into the air lightly, not past his fingers and catching her again and believed this could have caused the injuries.  F was observed on his phone and a couple of minutes later said that M remembered a time he threw A into the air in the bedroom (cannot remember when) and she did wince but there was nothing more to this. </p>

For the first time in his evidence it became apparent that it was his opinion that the mechanism of throwing A in the air and catching her by her arms could account for the symmetric fracture presentation and this was with or without the presence of a genetic condition.  He set out clearly his reasoning for this by reference to the gravitational forces at play as A descended which would create tractional force if A were caught by the arms.  Mr Rees submitted that Dr Olsen only said arm singular and that there would need to be two separate incidents of a similar nature to explain the fractures.  I do not accept that submission.

That does not mean that M was incapable of caring for A.  In the first six weeks post-birth M had to supervise all of F&#8217;s time with A.  She continued to play an active role with A an would take over when F was tired or required a break.</p>

It was clearly a volatile situation.  There was clearly a physical struggle between M and F during which time M was struck to the face.  I do not make the finding sought that F punched her to the face.  That may have happened but I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it did.  It is perhaps of little relevance as it is clear that M and F physically tussled with each other and during this tussle M was struck to the face.  There was shouting and both M and F were angry.  F&#8217;s keyboard became damaged and M threw a drill down the stairs knowing that F was at the bottom of the stairs.  That drill struck F and caused a significant wound.  I do not accept M&#8217;s evidence that she was not angry when throwing the drill.  She had been arguing with F for a number of days.  This culminated in the physical altercation and in anger M threw the drill in the direction of F.  Even on their own account this was an unsavoury incident all of which took place when A was in the house.</p>

M and F&#8217;s own evidence is that if A was awake they would stop arguing and continue their argument via messages rather than do it in front of A.  I have no doubt that the messages deleted would have provided an insight into the relationship and would have most likely contained messages evidencing their arguments and issues within their relationship.  I draw that inference but I do not draw the inference sought by Mr Rees that they deleted messages to hide incriminating evidence about the injuries to A.

It was put forward to the health visitor, the GP, the social worker and police officer and during the child protection medical.  Throughout F has said there were other plugs in the tower (police interview and initial statement).  The cotton bud was not mentioned until the child protection medical but that took place the same day as the health visitor appointment.

A fell sideways onto plug and landed on the extension tower which had various plugs in it.  The length of time A was sat was given at various times as 10-20 seconds or a minute.

I accept the evidence of the P that A cried after the throw in the air and continued to do so for 5-10 minutes and took up to 20 minutes to fully settle.  I accept the evidence that A cried after falling onto the plug but settled when comforted by M.  </span></p>

Dr Alu said with metaphyseal fractures there is often no swelling, redness, bruising, deformity or reluctance to use the arms.  There may be nothing to alert a carer whether present or not that A had sustained a significant injury such as a fracture.  F said he checked A over following the throw but the signs that he was checking for, on the evidence, may well not be present following a metaphyseal fracture.</span></p>

He did not caveat this by reference to any particular height that A would have to been thrown.  Miss Edmondson suggested to M that unless A was thrown really high gravity would have no effect.  In my judgment that cannot be correct.  If A left F fingers there would be period however brief of going up before coming back down.  Gravitational acceleration would be caused coming back down and this is exactly what Dr Olsen was referring to.  I accept F&#8217;s evidence that on one occasion he did throw A when she was in the air for longer and then caught her wrongly.  Dr Olsen&#8217;s evidence was that if F then caught A by arm as she was coming down this would create tractional force and would be plausible as an explanation for fracture.</span></p>

It is clear that a bruise to the concha is unusual.  The health visitor had not seen it in 26 years and Dr Alu could not recall seeing in 30 years.  The concha in a 6 month old child is very small.  There was no bruise or injury to the outer ear.  It is likely to have been caused by a small object coming into direct contact with the concha.  M and F have always said that A fell onto the extension tower which had other plugs in it including a charger plug with a USB.  Dr Alu did not consider whether that could have caused the injury.</span></p>

From the medical evidence plausible explanations were accepted by Dr Olsen and Dr Saggar.  Medicine has a great deal to learn about HSD as is clear from Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence.  There are aspects of the unknown and uncertainty regarding HSD and its impact on A.  Dr Saggar said it is well described that the milder form, hypermobile spectrum disorder (HSD) is associated with easy bruising and bleeding.  He said that he could not rule out a susceptibility in A to fracture from lesser force but there would still have to be a plausible force that could be seen as a precipitant.  In evidence he deferred to Dr Olsen re the throw mechanism and accepted it as being a plausible and precipitant force.  I cannot discount the possibility that it has some relevance in this case.</span></p>
