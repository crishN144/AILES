      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">&#167;1 &#8212; INTRODUCTION </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">This application concerns the liberty, residence and care of AM, who is deprived of his liberty at X Nursing Home under a 12-month standard authorisation issued on 14 August 2019. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The applicant is AM&#8217;s wife AG, and the proceedings are brought under section 21A of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The Official Solicitor acts on AM&#8217;s behalf as his Litigation Friend. The other respondents are MH (a son of AM by a previous marriage) and the relevant local authority and CCG. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">In broad terms, AG wishes her husband to be discharged to the family home and this is also his wish and that of a number of other relatives. Her application is opposed on the ground that such a move would be contrary to his best interests by the Official Solicitor on his behalf, by the local authority and by one of his sons, the Third Respondent MH. The CCG would also not approve a return home if the decision was for them to take, believing that it involves considerable medical risks and is not in his clinical interests. It invites the court to balance the clinical and other best interests considerations. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The reasons for opposing a return home include a belief that AM&#8217;s needs are too complex for him to be safely cared for at home, insufficient local GP capacity to provide the required level of care and support at home, and that the family underestimate the level of care which AM requires. Those against a move say that it is very likely that home care would rapidly break down, resulting in avoidable hospital admissions and then discharge to another nursing home with less expertise than X Nursing Home, possibly many miles from the family home. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">ECCG suggested that the parties might wish to explore the possibility of a nursing home closer to the family home. This was something which AG had been interested in exploring in previous court proceedings. However, on this occasion, neither she nor any of the other parties wished to pursue the idea. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">AM is now aged 74.  He and AG married in 1992. They are Muslims and originally came to this country from Somalia. They have had two children together, both of whom are now young adults. AM has six other children from previous marriages, one of whom, MH, is the Third Respondent.  </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">After 16 years of marriage, AM suffered a brain haemorrhage in June 2008, at the age of 62. He maintains active movement in all four limbs but it is uncoordinated and not functional. His vision is impaired by cortical blindness. He has insulin type-2 diabetes and he suffered two epileptic seizures in the summer of 2014, one of which was unresponsive to first-line medication and resulted in admission to a critical care unit. He receives nutrition and hydration via PEG. He is doubly incontinent and requires all of his personal care and activities of daily living completed for him, with two carers and a hoist for transfers. He is eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare, with the result that his treatment and care are funded by ECCG. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">Since 4 March 2009, AM has been a long-term resident at a specialist nursing home for people with profound and complex disabilities who require long term 24-hour nursing care. This nursing home, which I refer to as &#8216;X Nursing Home&#8217;, is situated in an outer city location approximately eight miles from the family home where his wife lives. Depending on the time of day and the traffic, it takes his wife between 30-60 minutes to drive there by car. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">Three other matters may be highlighted by way of introduction: Firstly, AM's private financial means are limited. Therefore, he relies on state-funded care and treatment and his options are limited to what the state can provide. Secondly, there is a limit to what the NHS can or is willing to spend on care at home as an alternative to care in a nursing home. Thirdly, provided they do not act so irrationally as to be unlawful, etc, it is NHS bodies, local and other public authorities &#8212; not judges &#8212; who decide how to allocate their limited resources between the local citizens for whom they must provide. Furthermore, the funds available to public authorities, and levels of taxation and public expenditure, are political decisions, that is matters for all of us, <span style="font-style:italic">i.e.</span> for voters not judges.</p>

      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Interested persons</p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">A number of relatives and interested persons attended hearings in support of the applicant without formally having the status of parties. They included Ms AM (sister of AM), MH2 (son of AM), HH (daughter of AG and AM) and HAM (son of AM).</p>
      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">&#167;4 &#8212; PROCEDURE AND HEARINGS</p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The proceedings have a long history and were before another judge for several years. In 2013, AG made an application to the Court of Protection, seeking a declaration that it was in her husband&#8217;s best interests to be cared for at their family home. AM then suffered two epileptic seizures, one in June 2014 and the other in August 2014. AG decided not to pursue her application for AM to return home, and she invited the CCG to consider transferring her husband to a nursing home closer to the family home.  For various reasons, this possibility did not materialise and a final order was made on 27 April 2015, dismissing the proceedings without any final determination of AM&#8217;s best interests. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The Second Respondent local authority, LBE, was not a party to the original proceedings. On 4 July 2016, X Nursing Home made a request to LBE for a standard authorisation in respect of AM&#8217;s deprivation of liberty, which was granted. Because the first proceedings had concluded without any substantive order or determination, and there were objections to AM being deprived of his liberty at the nursing home, the local authority quite properly applied to the Court of Protection. It asked the court to determine whether AM satisfied the requirements for a standard authorisation, and in particular the best interests requirement. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">By order of 23 June 2017, it was ordered that AG be named as the applicant and LBE was excused from attending further hearings unless their attendance was specifically requested by one of the parties, or ordered by the court. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">From time to time, I have checked whether AM wished to meet with me or whether it was in his best interests to see me despite his own wishes. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The case was before the court for final hearing between 1 and 3 April 2019. That hearing was adjourned after three days, in order to obtain an OT assessment of AG&#8217;s physical fitness to be a carer and to try to identify a GP practice with whom AM could be registered should he return home. The final hearing was then resumed, and concluded, on 22 November 2019. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">I should add that two hearings had to be postponed because I was called into hospital for unplanned surgery at short notice. It was extremely unfortunate that the same case should be affected on both occasions, and I have apologised to the parties for the delay. </p>
      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Documentary Evidence (Court Bundle)</p>
      <p style="margin-left:-0in">The Court had the benefit of two sets of bundles: several lever-arch files of documents from the original proceedings that concluded on 27 April 2015, and in addition four lever-arch files of documents filed in connection with the current proceedings. As would be expected, the written evidence included witness statements, independent expert reports, reports and statements from local experts, copies of the standard authorisations, daily care records, previous position statements and orders, care plans, emails, correspondence, and so forth. Excellent position statements were filed by the advocates, for which I am very grateful. </p>
      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Oral Evidence</p>

      <p style="margin-left:-0in">I would like to thank all those involved in the proceedings for the many ways in which they have assisted the court. The oral evidence and commitment of the family witnesses was highly impressive and I have given their evidence considerable weight. I was also very impressed by the skill and fairness of Mr IR and the CCG, who made every effort to help the family construct the best home package of care and treatment that could be devised within available NHS resources. Sometimes I have found a marked reluctance on the part of NHS agencies to fully commit themselves to exploring home packages of care. That was certainly not the case here. </p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being. </span></p>

Naturally, precisely how much weight to give to a person&#8217;s present wishes and feelings will depend on the particular context and their circumstances. These include the degree of their incapacity; the strength and consistency of their views; the possible impact on them of knowing that their wishes and feelings are not being given effect to; the extent to which their wishes and feelings are, or are not, rational, sensible, responsible and pragmatically capable of sensible implementation; and the extent to which their wishes and feelings, if given effect to, can properly be accommodated within the overall assessment of what is in their best interests. However, while the weight to be attached to the person's wishes and feelings will always be case-specific and fact-specific, their wishes and feelings will always be a significant factor to which the court must pay close regard.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The underlying rationale of the legislative framework is that it is a protective scheme. Anyone who is deprived of their liberty &#8212; that is, who is under another person&#8217;s complete and effective control and is not free to leave &#8212; is vulnerable to abuse.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">That risk is multiplied if they are unable to decide whether to remain or leave. Children and adults with mental health problems are particularly at risk and the law has usually afforded them special protection.  This protection involves imposing legal duties on those with power, conferring legal rights on those in their power, and independent scrutiny of how these powers and duties are exercised. The effectiveness of such schemes depends on whether, and to what extent, they are observed.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">In this arena, the deprivation of liberty scheme ensures that there is at least an annual assessment by two suitably qualified and independent professionals, who can ensure that the arrangement really is necessary to protect them from harm, is in their best interests, proportionate and so forth.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The purpose of these requirements is the same as in the case of the &#8216;sectioning criteria&#8217; in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, i.e. to prevent people who do not meet certain conditions or requirements from being deprived of their liberty.

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">If one or more of these conditions is not satisfied, the relevant person does not meet the best interests requirement; and, because a standard authorisation may only be given if all six requirements are satisfied, AM may not be deprived of his liberty under the MCA scheme. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">&#167;7 &#8212; AM&#8217;S SITUATION AND BEST INTERESTS </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">There is no solution. AM&#8217;s situation will be less than optimal in both suggested care settings in the sense that he will have to forego some of the benefits that he would have in the other setting. Neither option will provide him with security, safety, liberty, happiness, an absence of suffering and an unrestricted home life. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Participation of AM in the decision-making </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">So far as reasonably practicable, AM has been permitted and encouraged to participate as fully as possible in the decision-making process. He has been ably represented by an experienced specialist solicitor, Mr Whitaker, has had the assistance of the Official Solicitor, and has also benefitted from the application, encouragement and assistance of his wife and children. He has had many opportunities to express his current wishes and preferences and, as far as his circumstances permit, has done so. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Whether a recovery of capacity is likely</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Following a review in October 2017, some improvement in AM&#8217;s cognition was identified in 2017. However, the evidence clearly indicates that it is unlikely that his capacity will improve sufficiently in the foreseeable future to enable him to make these decisions for himself. Therefore, a decision must be made for him now, by me, in his best interests. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">AM&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">AM's wishes and feelings are extremely important factors to be taken into account when reaching my decision. However, account must also be taken of his limited understanding of the evidence about the risks involved in being treated and cared for at home. For example, it has not been suggested to me that he understands that the likely price of returning home is that he will be more vulnerable to a deterioration of his health, to more severe forms of illness and to an increased risk of premature death, or that he will be at increased risk of hospital admissions. Nor, on the evidence, can he understand, even in the most general terms, that the NHS treatment and care that will be available to him will be sub-optimal compared with that currently provided by the team of GPs, nurses, therapists and care staff at X Nursing Home. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">There is a lack of reliable evidence about AM&#8217;s views prior to his stroke concerning the relative importance of these considerations and what weight they should be given. Family members expressed different opinions about whether he would be likely to prefer the medical advice to remain at X Nursing Home or prefer to take the risks involved in a return home. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, that he wishes to live with his wife and family at home, rather than just to have extensive contact with them at X Nursing Home. This is clear from, for example, his interview with his solicitor at G/292 (&#8216;go home, with my wife&#8217;) and from psychiatrist Dr K&#8217;s DOLs assessment in November 2017 at L/5 (&#8216;He informed us repeatedly and consistently during the interview that he wished to be at &#8220;home&#8221;.

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, his wish to be cared for by family members within his own home has an important cultural aspect. The significance of this can easily be imagined by reversing the roles, and asking a white English person, brought up say in a traditional shire town, to imagine being displaced and then, after having a severe stroke, living as a refugee, separate from their spouse and children, dependant on others, in a Somali care home. Someone in that vulnerable situation is likely to have a great need to cling on to their trusted life-partner and children and the reassuring familiarity and sense of safety of being with them in a familiar environment. The people, customs, traditions, language, values, dress, religion, cooking, cuisine, smells and scents are familiar and imbued with feelings of familiarity, reassurance and wellbeing, and a sense of belonging.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, he would wish to be looked after by his wife if at all possible. They entered into marriage vows and have enjoyed a long and close marriage. She has continued to attend the nursing home almost every day for the last ten years, staying for the best part of each day. He has expressed and reciprocated her devotion during that time by the way in which he readily accepts her touch and care. As with almost all people who have had that benefit, it is therefore natural that they should wish to live together under the same roof, as husband and wife.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I must therefore see if I can facilitate this for him by finding a way of giving practical expression to his wishes in a way that is not self-defeating. By that I mean that there is no benefit to him and his wife in authorising a return home if it is likely that he will suffer unduly and be back in hospital, and then a nursing home, within a short period &#9472; and in a worse position from the point of view of their family life, because it is not X Nursing Home but somewhere less good and less accessible. </p>

Overnight, and at weekends, the on-call GP service is called by the nurse and a GP is expected to be on site within one hour if required to attend. (The oral evidence of AG and HH was that this is not always the case.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It can be seen that AM has very significant disabilities, requires substantial support, and benefits from a very good package of care, treatment and family contact.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span/><span style="vertical-align:baseline">The ward on which AM is a resident was subject to a safeguarding report and inquiry shortly prior to the hearing in November 2019. However, having regard to the evidence that I received and X Nursing Home&#8217;s CQC report, I am satisfied that care a</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline">nd treatment AM receives there is very good, and that the general service provided is good. </span></p>
	      </authorialNote></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">This is highly relevant. AM&#8217;s case is not of the kind that I see all too frequently, that of an older person having to endure minimum standards of care, and little in the way of social stimulation, in a care home far away from family and home. If I give up AM&#8217;s place at X Nursing Home, I am giving up something of real benefit to him &#8212;  Something that only by chance will be available to him again should home care break down. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">With regard to this risk, I should make two observations. Firstly, the CCG can or will only keep his place at X Nursing Home open for 14 days if he goes home.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="19">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">  I asked IR whether ECCG might reconsider for how long it could keep open AM&#8217;s bed at X Nursing Home, and for its position to be confirmed at a higher level. The</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline"> CCG later confirmed its position:  Although 14 days is necessarily a somewhat arbitrary figure, it believes that it should not offer longer, having regard to its budget and reasons of equity (the need to be fair to other local patients with a claim on its</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline"> budget). </span></p>
	      </authorialNote> Secondly, for this reason, and because ECCG is unwilling to incur the costs of adapting the family home and training family carers for a trial at home, to establish if home treatment and care is viable, a trial at home is not an option available to me. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">If a three-month trial at home were an option then it is likely to have been my preferred option. Without that option, if I discharge AM and matters go awry after 14 days, he stands to lose a lot:<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">  Ms TR considered that any deterioration in AM&#8217;s health would be likely to result in admission to an acute hospital, whilst a breakdown in the care package would necessitate admission to a different nursing home, unless it were to occur within</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline"> the first two weeks. </span></p>
	      </authorialNote> a place at a nursing home with a national reputation, within a short drive from home, which provides him with good quality care and treatment, staff who know his needs, family visits daily for 8-9 hours, and the possibility of visits to his Mosque and the family home. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">His wife&#8217;s answer to this observation was, in part, that she cannot go on as she has been. If her application is refused, she is too worn out by many years of driving and caring for AM to be able to continue to visit him at X Nursing Home, or at any rate to do so regularly (see e.g., G/295-G/304). It is not the case therefore that her husband will have the benefit of her presence and care for much of the day regardless of the outcome. Her absence will not only cause him distress. It will adversely affect the quality of his care at X Nursing Home. Staff rely on her to perform oral care and other tasks, and her presence means that his behaviour is less oppositional. Nor, if he remains at X Nursing Home, is it possible (or, at any rate, likely) that he can also have the benefit of enjoying time at the family home and his local Mosque. His sitting tolerance and the journey time make visits to his local Mosque impractical, and a Disabled Facilities Grant will not be available to fund adaptations to the family home if he is not residing there. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I have given considerable weight to AG&#8217;s evidence, and I greatly admire all that she has done to support her husband. Her contribution to his care and well-being is particularly significant. Her presence makes him calmer.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="21">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="vertical-align:baseline"/><marker name="tab"/><span style="vertical-align:baseline">DL, the Head of Service at X Nursing Home, stated that, &#8216;The RN agrees that AM is calmer when his wife talks to him in his first language, Somali&#8217; (G/305). </span></p>
	      </authorialNote> She does sometime pick up on things that other people, including his children and care assistants, do not notice. She has a good record of appreciating when he is unwell or is not behaving normally; she will ask him questions, and he will respond either verbally or with gestures, pointing to an area of his body. She has demonstrated an understanding of knowing when to call the GP, for example in August 2018, which led to AM being prescribed antibiotics and then being admitted to hospital (see I/47&#8211;48; K/190).<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="22">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">  As concerns the care provided to AM in August 2018, when he was admit</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline">ted to hospital with a chest infection, Ms TR could find no evidence of a lack of care, commenting that medical, nursing, therapy and care input had been appropriately delivered and recorded.  She was, though, critical of the fact that a hyoscine patch had</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline"> not been appropriately administered during this period, which would have contributed to AM&#8217;s oral secretions. </span></p>
	      </authorialNote> She also assists staff with communication. For example, the daily record sheet on 21 September 2017 records that AM&#8217;s &#8216;wife reported that AM also requests for feet to be elevated&#8217; (K/15). </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Fulfilling a caring role in the conscientious way that AG has been doing over many years is exhausting, and a 30-45 minute drive to the nursing home in urban traffic adds to the strain. I hesitate to turn her own virtue against her. However, it is because of her unwavering devotion and commitment over so many years that I find it implausible that she will cease to visit AM if the court refuses her application, or visit only occasionally. I accept that she is suffering from long-term fatigue and that her own health may well have suffered. I am her husband&#8217;s decision-maker and, if he realised the strain she is under, he would no doubt want me to give weight to her comfort. I have therefore factored into my decision the fact that caring for him at home will spare her the daily drives, be better for health and add to her happiness. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">On balance of the evidence, I find that AM&#8217;s sitting tolerance has improved and that visits to his local Mosque are now likely to be possible. As to the possibility of visits home, it was not established that the &#163;11,000 cost of adaptations to the family home cannot be funded.  If an application for a Disabled Facilities Grant is refused, this still leaves open the possibility of obtaining funding under other legislative schemes, such as the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/44" uk:canonical="1970 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970</ref>. In my view, home visits ought to be a key part of any care and treatment package at X Nursing Home. </p>

They had agreed a family care rota to provide the additional care which AM needs that the NHS cannot fund. The original rota is at G/473. At the time it was written, it was likely that AG would require knee surgery and be out of action for several weeks. The rota is carefully thought out and comprises three weekly alternatives: a rota for when AG is fit to provide day and night care; a rota for when AG is fit to provide day care but not night care; a rota for when AG is unfit to provide any care. In the event, AG underwent a right total knee replacement on 19 August 2019. In my view, by the time the hearing resumed in November 2019, the general concerns which the Third Respondent raised at the hearing in April 2019 &#8212; that AG&#8217;s own health might prevent her from being a carer or from performing some of the care tasks required of her &#8212; were not supported by the evidence (see the OT assessment and the letter from her Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, at G/496). </p>

All of the proposed family carers were willing to undergo necessary training and accepted the need to meet the required competencies. The CCG told me that it would support them in accessing the appropriate training. Evidence of completion would be required prior to discharge. Many of the required competencies are considered valid for one year only and therefore refresher training will be necessary (G/345). </p>

AG&#8217;s and AM&#8217;s daughter HH was previously coPresident of her university student union, and impressed me by her willingness to make considerable personal sacrifices to look after her father. MH2 runs a tutoring company and, as a diabetic himself for 20 years, has a particularly good understanding of that area. HAM is a qualified optician. All of the children can assist AG with translation and interpretation. As to the required competencies, they are able to understand and implement some quite technical requirements.  </p>

Nor do I believe that they have under-estimated the level of care and expertise required to continually care for someone with AM&#8217;s needs (I/49I/50). They have been providing a great deal of care for many years already, are highly intelligent and have a very good understanding of what is required. They consider that it is their duty, and an honour, to care for AM within the family home. Their devotion and commitment to him, and their willingness to give up their time and comfort, and in one case their job, to care for him is admirable. </p>

The necessary work could be completed within around six weeks of approval by the relevant housing department, and the preliminary view was that the proposed adaptations would probably be approved. TR, the independent nursing expert, also considered that the proposed adaptations would be appropriate and provide adequate accommodation. However, the accommodation would be &#8216;cramped&#8217; and carers could be hampered in their delivery of care.  She raised a concern that AM&#8217;s dignity could be compromised during transfers to the bathroom, but I think it likely that overall being cared for in his own home, with his wife or a family member present, will be a more dignified experience for him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Looking at this package, it can be seen that the family have worked thoughtfully and assiduously to construct a viable alternative to X Nursing Home. Equally, ECCG and the relevant local authority have put in a lot of hard work to assist the family with their endeavour. That is particularly commendable given their limited resources and the fact that they believe that remaining at X Nursing Home is in AM&#8217;s best interests. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">There is much that can be said in favour of AG&#8217;s application. AM wishes to live at home with his wife and family, and therefore my starting point is to try to enable him to live the life he wishes if it is feasible: the underlying purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/44" uk:canonical="1970 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is that it is an enabling Act. He is fortunate in having a devoted wife and family. The family home can be adapted to suit his needs. The CCG have constructed a care package which, taken with the family care rota, meets his day-to-day care requirements. Furthermore, although the package is not equivalent to what is provided at, or readily-available, on-site at X Nursing Home, it is nevertheless a significant package of care.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">  ECCG has recently &#8216;reprocured&#8217; its adult community, nursing, dietician and therapy services, which resulted in a new NHS provider taking over</span><span style="vertical-align:baseline"> the delivery of the contract (G/349). Given AM&#8217;s vulnerability and need for support, I have borne in mind that there is always a risk that some services may not remain available to AM, and also that the current configuration of local services may change, </span><span style="vertical-align:baseline">for better or worse. </span></p>
	      </authorialNote></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I agree with much of TR&#8217;s balance sheet (I/33-I/35) but not with all of her assessment of the burdens of home care. The family carers are competent, devoted and willing to undergo training; it is inevitable that assuming a care role comes at a cost; on the evidence I believe that the pool of carers is sufficient; I do not agree without more evidence that the fact that AM has not been home since 2009 is likely to be a significant problem; the family home can be adapted and &#8216;made fit for purpose&#8217; quite easily; the family carers are sufficiently experienced and committed that I find it is more likely than not that they can sustain their care roles; a suitable domiciliary care provider appears to have been identified; and I believe that regular visits to AM by MH can be managed by the court if necessary. The burden that I agree with is that, &#8216;AM will not have immediate access to the Primary Care Services i.e. GP, Community nurses and therapists.&#8217;  This, it seems to me, is the fundamental difficulty. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Despite the fact that AG&#8217;s application and care package has many positives, there are difficulties. There is a past history of conflict; the service provided will be reactive rather than active in many areas; and the issue of GP and medical input has still to be considered. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-style:italic">A past history of conflict </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I am mindful that the Third Respondent, MH, says that his family life with his father will be negatively affected by a return to the family home. He says that AM&#8217;s residence at X Nursing Home ensures both that his health and care needs are well managed and that he is able to spend time with all of his family, who are all kept aware of his wellbeing. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The Court of Protection bundle for the original proceedings contains significant evidence of conflict between AG and proposed family carers, on the one hand, and professional carers and the Third Respondent on the other. In my opinion, the Third Respondent was unfairly and unjustly treated. Most of the criticism of professionals was also unfair and damaging to AM&#8217;s interests. The picture is a familiar one for a Court of Protection judge, of tension and conflict between distressed step-relations with different perspectives, and of conflict between a distressed family and professional services that spiralled completely out of control. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The picture is different now. The oral evidence of AG and the proposed family carers was measured and fair. All of them reiterated that they understand the need to work cooperatively with medical staff and professionals. They also emphasised that the Third Respondent would be welcome to visit his father at the family home. I believe that their offer is sincere, and a genuine attempt to move forward in a more collaborative way. The history of past conflict does make it inevitable that, at least initially, there would be a certain tension or awkwardness in the air during such visits, which the Third Respondent does not have to endure when he sees his father at X Nursing Home. However, I do not think that this in itself would justify denying his father the opportunity to live in his own home if his needs can be met there and the risks can be adequately managed. The family carers would have a considerable incentive to avoid MH&#8217;s visits breaking down and the matter coming back to court. Furthermore, if it ever became necessary, the court could facilitate visits by way of a visiting schedule and/or undertakings or orders concerning the behaviour of family members who are not carers, such as AG&#8217;s son GH. I would be fairly confident that the court could deal with any difficulties. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-style:italic">Medical and GP input </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">This is, I believe, the critical issue. The Official Solicitor submitted, and I agree, that the evidence establishes that the proposed care package at home comes with risks but is potentially viable save for the issue of the medical input that AM requires.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It was the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission that the concerns about the quality of the clinical and medical care which can be provided in the community, and the consequential health risks, are so significant in the balancing exercise that they amount to the &#8216;magnetic factor&#8217; in the overall determination. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Having reviewed AM&#8217;s records, Ms TR told me that there is very little day-to-day GP input at X Nursing Home when he is well. However, when he is unwell and needs medical input, he tends to need it quickly. He will then be visited daily at X Nursing Home, which (she says) is more often than is likely to be available from a GP practice at the family home. </p>

The CCG has concerns that the services available in the community are unable to respond in the rapid manner he is currently able to access. At X Nursing Home his ability to access early assessment and treatment has helped mitigate escalation of medical deteriorations when they occur, enabling him to remain where he is familiar by limiting the need for hospital admissions. His poorly controlled blood pressure and blood glucose levels have now been optimised with this level of medical input. In the community, if unable to access GP or other community services for assessment and treatment, AM would need to attend hospital to meet his needs. The current GP service at X Nursing Home is experienced at working with patients such as AM due to their relationship with the unit.&#8217; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The GP practice initially contacted on AM&#8217;s behalf was that nominated by AG, namely C Rd GP Surgery. IR told me that it is open from 8am to 6.30pm from Monday to Friday. It provides a home visit service in between the morning and afternoon clinics when GP capacity allows; this would have to be requested first thing in the morning. If there is no GP capacity on the day, a GP would attend the following day.  The practice nurses are not able to make home visits.  Out of hours, the NHS 111 telephone service would have to be used.  If a blood sample is required for diagnostic purposes this could be undertaken through the domiciliary phlebotomy service on a Thursday. There is a 2-3 week wait for domiciliary phlebotomy. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">What this seems to mean is that if a GP cannot visit in the middle of the day (between the morning and afternoon surgeries) or AM needs immediate medical evaluation or attention outside this window, the gap will need to be filled by NHS 111, the local Rapid Response Service and, where necessary, an ambulance to A&amp;E. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The local Rapid Response Service (RSS) is part of the local Home Ward service. It requires a telephone referral from the ambulance service, a GP or from members of a patient&#8217;s primary care team after discussion with the GP, e.g. district nurses. It is an urgent service and would not be an integral part of AM&#8217;s care package. It can be contacted between 8am and 10pm daily. This multi-disciplinary team is composed of consultants, doctors, advanced nurse practitioners, nurses, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist and rehabilitation support workers. There is no defined limit on how often the service can be used. However, IR said that the frequency with which it is used could indicate that a home care package is insufficient to meet the patient&#8217;s needs. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The service provided by the Rapid Response Service is described at G/501. Following referral a member of the team will triage the patient. In practice, it is most likely to be a nurse or an &#8216;associate healthcare professional&#8217; who is sent out (oral evidence of IR).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The CCG told me that under contractual arrangements it would compel C Road GP Surgery or another surgery to register AM if the court ordered that AM should return to live at home with his wife.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">In oral evidence, IR stated that no patient would or should be admitted to hospital unless there was a clinical need. He disagreed with Dr F&#8217;s view that there would be a &#8216;massive&#8217; risk of hospital admissions, and described that as &#8216;an exaggeration&#8217;.  A move home, and registration with a GP surgery, would be &#8216;moving from a proactive to a reactive service&#8217;. The CCG considered that reactive care would be &#8216;adequate but sub-optimal&#8217; compared with the care which AM receives at X Nursing Home. The CCG was concerned that community services would be unable to respond in the same rapid way as at present, which has limited AM&#8217;s need for hospital admissions. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I agree with IR with regard to Dr F&#8217;s evidence. IR&#8217;s assessment and language was measured in a way that Dr F&#8217;s was not, and was based on a careful and thoughtful balancing of the relevant factors. I find that Dr F&#8217;s stated view was exaggerated. To my mind, the use of phrases such as &#8216;willingly harming his health&#8217;, and the suggestion that a GP would simply have AM readmitted to hospital if he was discharged from X Nursing Home, cannot be supported. The weight I give his evidence is that he is another GP who strongly believes that AM should remain at X Nursing Home. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Because the problem of GP and medical support at home could not be resolved adequately at the hearing in April 2019, further evidence was filed about other local GP practices with whom AM might potentially be registered (G/461-G/464). </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The CCG contacted B Road Surgery, the closest GP practice to AG&#8217;s home. It responded that it was &#8216;not willing to register&#8217; or &#8216;would prefer not to register&#8217; AM as a patient. Having reviewed the report of Dr AJ, it was their opinion that it is not possible safely to provide, in the community, the level of medical input that AM requires. Their view was expressed in measured tones. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">AG then asked that EP Health Centre be approached and the CCG contacted it. The response was similarly negative. The partners had reviewed AM&#8217;s case. They felt that his needs would be &#8216;extremely difficult to meet in primary care&#8217;. Furthermore, it would be better if he was registered at the same practice as the rest of the family. However, as the practice could not refuse to register a patient within their catchment area, if a request was made that AM be registered with them, they &#8216;would have no option but to accept&#8217;. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Unfortunately, the position therefore is that no GP practice has at any stage in the two sets of proceedings been willing to provide community medical support for a home care package. I find that there is an economic factor, as well as a safety factor, in this. To my mind, Dr F&#8217;s email and Dr VT&#8217;s letter make this clear. No doubt a GP would be professional and do all that is professionally required of them under their general GMS contract. The problem is that they might not be willing to continue to do, or be in a position to do, more than is professionally required of them under the contract; and their common evidence is that that is insufficient. I understand their point that enhanced services are required. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">A suggestion that the family might wish to investigate whether supplementary GP support could be available from a medical practitioner within the local Muslim community, perhaps as a religious obligation, was not practical. Although in theory it might fill some service gaps, such a GP would not have access, or sufficient access, to NHS GP notes, and there might be problems of insurance, working or liaising with NHS community nurses, and so forth. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Given this situation and the current configuration of local NHS services, what then would be the likely consequences (&#8216;risks&#8217;) for AM of receiving home treatment and care if the medical input is provided by a local GP under a GMS contract? </p>

Consistent with this, IR states that the additional medical risks include increased vulnerability to a deterioration in his health and increased risk of hospital admissions (&#8216;almost inevitable&#8217;), of more severe illness and of premature death (G/347-G/350): </heading>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Conclusions </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">A trial is not needed if one can be reasonably sure of the outcome. It is sensible to test an alternative that may or may not be viable before &#8216;burning one&#8217;s bridges&#8217;. That is not possible here and I must choose. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">On balance, I do not believe that currently it is in AM&#8217;s best interests to be discharged home under the proposed package of treatment and care. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">There is much to be said in favour of AG&#8217;s application. Home has very significant benefits in terms of the warmth and personal care his family provide, cultural familiarity and customs, and visits from friends and neighbours. The valuable contribution which his family now make to his care would be enhanced because a family member would be present to interpret and attend to his needs all the time. His home can be adapted, and the CCG has constructed a care package which, taken with the family care rota, meets his day-to-day care requirements. Although it is not equivalent to what is provided at, or readily-available, onsite at X Nursing Home, it is nevertheless a significant package of care. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I agree with the Official Solicitor that the proposed care package at home comes with risks but is potentially viable save for the issue of the medical input that AM requires. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">At present most of AM&#8217;s contact with carers is with paid care assistants and family carers, rather than with GPs and nurses, and this will not change if he goes home. However, it is a considerable benefit for him that at present there is an on-site GP service between 9am and 5pm, that out-of-hours a GP is expected to be on-site within one hour, and that X Nursing Home has qualified nurses on-site 24 hours a day. This has facilitated early assessment and treatment and avoided an escalation of medical deteriorations, which in turn has reduced the number of hospital attendances and/or admissions. His ward also has a speech and language therapist and two physiotherapists allocated to it on weekdays. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The services provided by AM&#8217;s local NHS are mainly reactive rather than active. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The CCG has declined to provide AM with enhanced GP services and therefore his medical input will be provided by a GP under a General Medical Services contract.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Under a GMS contract, that GP will not be required to provide more than reactive care. For example, the expectation is that the GP will visit between morning and afternoon surgeries if capacity allows.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The likely consequences for AM of this reduced medical input indicate the appropriate weight which I should attach to this risk: some delays in being assessed and treated (i.e. from time to time, a prolongation of suffering when ill), an increase in the number of hospital admissions and an increased risk of premature death (compared with how long he would be likely to live at X Nursing Home). </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">AG has not been able to find a GP who is willing to try to support her husband at home, nor has the court received evidence from a medical practitioner in support of home treatment. As a judge, I am bound to accept the evidential position. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">While I accept that most often AG will quickly identify changes in her husband&#8217;s presentation, and request professional help, it does not follow that the NHS will be able to respond quickly, or be able to offer an alternative to taking him to hospital. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">No local GP practice has wished to register AM. The strong resistance of local GPs to assuming responsibility and a caring role for AM has weighed heavily with me, and been decisive. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Someone with AM&#8217;s complicated needs requires maximum effort and commitment from all involved in providing home care for it to have a chance of success. I cannot rely on the GP who is forced to register AM being able or willing to do more than is required under their general contract. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It is a considerable negative that AM would be the responsibility of a practice that does not wish to receive him as a patient, one that believes that his needs are greater than it can fulfil under its contractual obligations. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">AM&#8217;s medical condition is complicated, he can deteriorate quickly and some signs and symptoms may be difficult to recognise. Given that he will not always have prompt access to medical treatment and therapy from his GP at home, necessarily there is an increased risk of his health further deteriorating before his condition is diagnosed and treated.  The fact that a delayed medical response may mean that he is more ill than he would be at X Nursing Home before treatment is commenced brings with it an increase of suffering and an increased risk of hospital admissions. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">The Rapid Response Service cannot sufficiently plug the gap in terms of the medical input that will be provided by a GP practice operating under a GMS contract.  The RRS is an urgent service and it is not a 24-hour service. It would not be an integral part of his care package. Most importantly, given AM&#8217;s history and the fact that my concern is with those occasions when he is at risk of becoming significantly unwell, the guideline response will most often be that he should be taken to A&amp;E. Given the unanimous and often frank views of the GPs and other medical practitioners about the inadvisability of home care, it is likely that on reaching hospital there would then be a considerable drag back in the direction of hospital admission and then discharge to another nursing home. Local NHS services are not configured to care for a person with AM&#8217;s needs at home. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">As matters presently stand, on the balance of probabilities it would be self-defeating for me to give practical expression to AM&#8217;s wishes by authorising his return home. Without committed GP input at home, it is very likely that home treatment would be unsuccessful. By committed support, I mean the type of support that in a different field a legal aid practitioner so often gives to their client, which is willingly given for meagre financial gain and over and above what is legally or contractually required. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It follows that, on the balance of the evidence, I believe that granting AG&#8217;s application carries a significant risk of her husband losing his place and current quality of life at X Nursing Home without there being a corresponding &#8216;risk of gain&#8217; which justifies this risk of harm.  The benefits which he has at X Nursing Home are considerable. He is medically stable, receives good quality care and treatment, is cared for by staff who know him, enjoys excellent contact with his wife and family, and most often appears content. There is also the possibility of visits outdoors, including to his local Mosque and, depending on funding, to the family home. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It is a very sad situation and I am sure that everyone involved in the case regrets the fact that it has not been possible to find a way of reuniting this couple. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Deprivation of liberty provisions </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">As regards the best interests requirement, AM is being detained at X Nursing Home for the purpose of being given care or treatment in circumstances which amount to a deprivation of his liberty. This is common ground. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">For the reasons given, I have found that it is in his best interests to continue to reside at X Nursing Home, and to be cared for there in accordance with the current treatment and care plan, notwithstanding that the arrangements involve a deprivation of liberty. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">This is necessary to prevent harm to him. If I permit him to go home in the current circumstances, he will be at significant increased risk of suffering a deterioration in his health, and an increased risk of hospital admissions (&#8216;almost inevitable&#8217;), of more severe illness and of premature death. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Furthermore, for the reasons given, the current arrangements for his treatment and care at X Nursing Home are a proportionate response to the likelihood of him suffering harm, and the seriousness of that harm (if he were not so detained). </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Whether the relevant purpose can be achieved in a less restrictive way </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">In reaching my view, I have had regard to section 1 and the need for me to consider whether AM can receive treatment and care in a less restrictive way at home. For the reasons stated, I have decided that this is not the case. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">In my opinion, the interference with AM&#8217;s home and private life is prescribed by law (the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>), proportionate (to the identified risks concerning his health and safety) and for a permitted purpose (his health and safety). </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Other matters </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It is, I believe, very important to AM&#8217;s happiness that he should have the opportunity to visit his local Mosque and have other regular opportunities for outings.  I would therefore ask the parties to agree suitable wording for a condition to this effect. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">It is also very important that he has the benefit of visits home. It is worrying that he has not been home for so many years. The cost of adapting the family home to facilitate this is not large in proportion to the fundamental importance of enabling him to enjoy family life at home from time to time. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">If funding cannot be secured, I would ask his solicitor and his wife&#8217;s solicitor to ascertain whether in the past he was able to visit his home in its present unadapted state, and whether that is feasible now. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">I am sure that it will give AM pleasure to be reintroduced to his home, Mosque and local community, and it could open up further possibilities for him. </p>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.45in">Future applications </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">As someone who is deprived of his liberty, AM is entitled to make further applications periodically. How much time the court will allocate to each application will depend partly on whether his circumstances have materially changed. Material changes might include significant changes to local GP and community medical services for people in his position (IR said that the CCG were looking to expand the Rapid Response Service); identifying a GP who is actually willing to try to support treatment and care at home; eligibility for enhanced GP services; the fact that his house has been adapted combined with a willingness to keep his place at X Nursing Home open for longer than two weeks; new medical evidence in support of treatment at home; new medical evidence setting out ways in which he could be successfully treated at home; improvements in his cognitive functioning and/or communication abilities, and/or the devising of new communication strategies by a Speech and Language Therapist,  which enable him to say more about his wishes and the risks of home care; more reliable evidence about his past wishes and feelings, when he had capacity. </p>
