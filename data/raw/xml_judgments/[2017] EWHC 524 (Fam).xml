I am satisfied that the answer to that question is &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>

The mother&#8217;s application for means and merits tested legal aid has been refused by the Legal Aid Agency on grounds that her monthly income takes her slightly over the income limit stipulated by the regulations, beyond which income limit means and merits tested legal aid is not available for wardship proceedings (the Legal Aid Agency did not take issue with the mother&#8217;s application for funding of the basis of merit).</p>

Mr Hale and Mr Barnes accept that the costs funding order that they seek as a remedy to this situation is without precedent.  They argue however that, in the present case, the law can and should be extended to provide for such an order, contending as they do that existing principle and authority demonstrates that the court can find a power under its inherent jurisdiction to make a costs funding order in favour of a parent against a local authority in proceedings of this nature.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the local authority, Mr Teertha Gupta QC and Mr Oliver Jones argue that to accede to the mother&#8217;s application for a costs funding order against the local authority using the inherent jurisdiction would amount to the court engaging in impermissible judicial legislation in circumstances where Parliament has created a detailed, carefully thought out statutory regime governing the provision of legal aid.  Mr Gupta and Mr Jones submit that the proper remedy for the situation the mother finds herself in (and that other respondents may potentially find themselves in the future) is for this court to reconsider what the local authority submits is guidance given in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Y (A Minor: Wardship)</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">LB Tower Hamlets v M and Others</span>, and endorsed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, so as to ensure that all cases in which the State levels allegations against a parent that they have caused or present a risk of significant harm to their child are pursued under the statutory regime designed to deal with such cases, namely Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, in respect of which statutory regime Parliament has made provision for non-means, non-merits tested legal aid.  Mr Gupta and Mr Jones further submit that, insofar as there remain cases in which it is appropriate for the local authority to proceed under the inherent jurisdiction, the court should consider indicating that a change to the scope of the legal aid regulations is merited to bring cases under the inherent jurisdiction in which a local authority makes allegations against a parent within the scope of non-means, non-merits test legal aid.  </p>

Mr Peter Oldham QC has provided written submissions to the court on behalf of the LGA, for which the court is grateful.  Mr Oldham submits that, in circumstances where Parliament could have, but has not made statutory provision for costs funding orders for proceedings of this type, where the mother has not sought to challenge by way of judicial review the lawfulness of the Legal Aid Agency&#8217;s refusal to grant her a certificate by reference to the provisions of the Legal Aid and Sentencing of Offenders Act 2012 and the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Payment for Services) Regulations 2013, where the granting of a costs funding order under the inherent jurisdiction would, in effect, be to set up an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc </span>extra-statutory legal aid fund and where, within this context, the making of a costs funding order would constitute an arbitrary decision and be contrary to good administration, the mother&#8217;s application should be dismissed.</p>

Those invitations were declined. By way of an email dated 7 February 2017, Mr Michael Rimer, Senior Lawyer for the Legal Aid Agency replied on behalf of the Legal Aid Agency and the Lord Chancellor as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;&#8230;the Legal Aid Agency (Director of Legal Aid Casework) and Lord Chancellor politely decline the invitation to intervene.  [HB] was assessed as being financially ineligible to be granted civil legal aid.  Her witness statement in support of her application confirms that her monthly income is above the threshold of &#163;733.  If [HB] thought that the Legal Aid Agency had made an error in assessing her financial resources, she could have written to the Agency to point this out.  Additionally, if [HB] thought that the Agency&#8217;s decision was wrong or otherwise unlawful, her remedy is to challenge the decision by bringing a claim for judicial review.  When an individual is financially ineligible for civil legal aid, there is no discretion in the scheme to grant them funding.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">HB is the mother of ML, aged 6, and BL, aged 3. The children&#8217;s father is MB, also known as MM.   MB has been in Syria since the end of 2013.  There is some evidence that certain material in the family home indicates the father is now dead.  Whilst the mother disputes the provenance of that evidence, she has heard rumours that the father is, indeed, dead. The evidence before the court is further said to establish links between a number of other members of the extended maternal family and extremism and terrorism.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to go into the detail of the allegations levelled at the mother by the local authority.  In summary, the local authority seeks findings against the mother that on one occasion she took the children to a town in Turkey close to the Syrian border, that on two occasions she has been stopped leaving the country with large sums of money, that she has sought to provide funds to persons associated with the so called Islamic State, that she holds, and sympathises with extremist views and that, within that context, she has placed, and is at risk of placing her children at risk of significant harm.  The mother contends that there are entirely innocent explanations in respect of her conduct and that the local authority&#8217;s case comprises nothing more than an assertion of guilt by association with family members with established links to extremism and terrorism.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that the mother has conceded the majority of the findings of fact sought by the local authority in this case, albeit that she invites the court to conclude that it cannot properly draw from those facts the inferences the local authority invites it to.  In the circumstances, the key issue at the final hearing will be what interpretation is properly to be placed on those facts conceded by the mother.  It is further important to note that the local authority&#8217;s case is not limited to risk of removal from the jurisdiction, but extends to questions of what material ML may, or may not, have been exposed to in the family home, whether the mother supports the cause of the so-called Islamic State, and the welfare consequences of the same.  The mother&#8217;s parenting otherwise raises no concerns.</p>

That application was made under the inherent jurisdiction on the basis of guidance the local authority submits is given in the authorities to which I have already referred.  The proceedings were instigated following the mother having been stopped for a second time attempting to leave the jurisdiction with large sums of money on 5 August 2016, following which attempt the mother was detained and the children were taken into Police protection pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

I was not prepared to accept undertakings without limit of time on the basis no admissions were made in circumstances where the children are aged only 6 and 3, it being likely that the mother would wish to travel with the children at some point during their minority, leaving the court faced with determining the matters alleged against the mother at a point even further removed from the events which grounded those allegations.  Following a further directions hearing before me on 12 October 2016, at which I also dealt with an application by the Metropolitan Police asserting public interest immunity in respect of certain documents I had directed them to disclose, I listed the matter for a final hearing with a time estimate of 5 days commencing on 13 February 2016.  In the event, following the mother indicating at the pre-hearing review on 20 January 2017 that she intended to make an application for a costs funding order against the local authority in circumstances where her application for legal aid had been refused and she could not afford legal representation, I reduced the time estimate of the hearing listed this week and converted it into a hearing of the application for a costs funding order.  I have adjourned the final hearing to a date in May with a time estimate of 2 days.</p>

In summary, the mother&#8217;s application for funding from the Legal Aid Agency was refused in circumstances where her disposable income exceeds the monthly income threshold of &#163;733.  The mother asserts that after her outgoings are taken into account, including rent, food, travel and childcare, she is left with a sum which is insufficient to privately fund legal representation.   The local authority has in this case provided, on a voluntary basis, funding to the mother to enable her to instruct lawyers to prepare her response to the local authority&#8217;s Schedule of Findings and her final statement of evidence.  This funding was offered without prejudice to local authority&#8217;s position with regard to the mother&#8217;s application for a costs funding order.  The local authority has declined further requests by the mother.</p>

In those circumstances, just as it may be appropriate to order the richer parent to pay the costs of the poorer parent with whom the child is to live, it may also be appropriate to order the local authority to pay the costs of the parent with whom the child is to live, if otherwise the child&#8217;s welfare would be put at risk.

Within this context, Mr Gupta and Mr Jones submit that the solution in this case (and in future similar cases) is not the creation of a new jurisdiction under the inherent jurisdiction to grant costs funding orders.

Mr Gupta and Mr Jones submit that this has in this case, and will in other cases, result in an impact far heavier than the light touch intended, and an impact far heavier than had care proceedings been instigated, having regard to the seminal importance of legal representation in proceedings of this nature.  Within the context of the well-established principle that the court should begin with a preference for the least interventionist approach, Mr Gupta and Mr Jones further submit that working within the four corners of a jurisdiction expressly established to deal with actual or threatened harm to children on the basis of parental responsibility being shared by the State where necessary, rather than the wide ambit of the inherent jurisdiction on the basis of parental responsibility being removed under wardship, is <span style="font-style:italic">in fact </span>the lighter touch.

By contrast, he submits that, in considering whether to make a costs funding order against an alternative public authority, namely the local authority, the court is in no position to weigh that application for legal funding against all the other claims on a local authority&#8217;s finite budget and decide which is the more meritorious, the court having neither the factual information nor the decision-making matrix to do so.  Accordingly, Mr Oldham submits that, absent express statutory authority, a costs funding order against the local authority would amount to an arbitrary intervention by the court in the local authority&#8217;s finances and affairs.</p>

Mr Oldham points out that these articles are of application in all other proceedings in which local authorities are required to engage where a litigant may not have funding, including, by way of example, a judicial review of a failure to provide care pursuant to a care plan under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/23" uk:canonical="2014 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Act 2014</ref> or to an appeal to the First Tier Tribunal by a parent against an education and health care plan under the Children and Schools Act 2014 which does not provide for education at the family&#8217;s preferred school.  Mr Oldham submits that if the basis on which the application succeeds is a more general and inherent power of the High Court, the potential application of the purported jurisdiction to make a costs funding order will be wider still.  Finally, and within this context, Mr Oldham reminds the court that it should not be assumed that a local authority in any given case has greater means to devote to the proceedings than the person whose circumstances led them to apply for a costs funding order, i.e. in the same way a litigant&#8217;s funds might be fully committed so as to preclude the payment of legal fees, the local authority&#8217;s funds might likewise be fully committed, with the same result.</p>

In particular, Mr Oldham submits that applicants for such an order should generally have sought and failed in a judicial review of the refusal of the Legal Aid Agency to grant funding.  Mr Oldham submits that it would be remarkable for a court, in effect, to remedy a perceived gap in the legal aid scheme on an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc </span>basis, without the lawfulness of the decision which created the alleged gap being tested in court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to children derives from the Royal Prerogative, as <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span>, to take care of those who are not able to take care of themselves (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (An Infant) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1968] 1 All ER 20" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1968">[1968] 1 All ER 20</ref> at 24G).  Its origins lie in the feudal period when, as an incidence of tenure, upon a tenant&#8217;s death, the lord became guardian of the surviving infant heir&#8217;s land and body (see Lowe, N. and White, R. <span style="font-style:italic">Wards of Court</span> 1986, 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> edn).  Prior to the implementation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the most frequently seen example of the exercise by the High Court of its inherent jurisdiction over children was in wardship, i.e. children made wards of court by virtue of an order to that effect granted by the High Court. It is important to note however, that wardship is merely one manifestation of the inherent jurisdiction with respect to children and that (subject to the distinguishing characteristics of wardship being that custody of the child is vested in the court and that, although day to day control is vested in the individual or local authority, no important step can be taken in the child&#8217;s life without the court&#8217;s consent) the jurisdiction in wardship and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court are the same (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Z (a minor)(freedom of publication) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 1</ref>). In the circumstances, the inherent jurisdiction in respect of children can be invoked without wardship (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Minor)(Medical Treatment: Court&#8217;s Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 64</ref>).</p>

I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention &#8211; risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment &#8211; is surely unproblematic.

The answer to this question requires a consideration of all the circumstances of the case, including the factors which are identified at paras 19 to 25 of the Guidance.  These factors must be carefully weighed.  Thus the greater the complexity of the procedural rules and/or the substantive legal issues, the more important what is at stake and the less able the applicant may be to cope with the stress, demands and complexity of the proceedings, the more likely it is that article 6.1 will require the provision of legal services <span style="font-style:italic">(subject always to any reasonable merits and means test)</span>.  The cases demonstrate that article 6.1 does not require civil legal aid in most or even many cases.  It all depends on the circumstances.  It should be borne in mind that, although in the United Kingdom we have an adversarial system of litigation, judges can and do provide assistance to litigants in person.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;It is true that the test for article 8 as it is stated in the Strasbourg jurisprudence (whether those affected have been involved in the decision-making process, viewed as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests) differs from the test for article 6.1 (whether there has been effective access to court). The article 8 test is broader than the article 6.1 test, but in practice we doubt whether there is any real difference between the two formulations in the context with which we are concerned. There is nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence to which our attention has been drawn which suggests that the European Court of Human Rights considers that there is any such difference. In practice, the court's analysis of the facts in the case law does not seem to differ as between article 6.1 and article 8. This is not surprising. The focus of article 6.1 is to ensure a fair determination of civil rights and obligations by an independent and impartial tribunal. Article 8 does not dictate the form of the decision-making process that the state must put in place. But the focus of the procedural aspect of article 8 is to ensure the effective protection of an individual's article 8 rights. To summarise, in determining what constitutes effective access to the tribunal (article 6.1) and what constitutes sufficient involvement in a decision-making process (article 8), for present purposes the standards are in practice the same.&#8221;</p>

I accept that at the date of the advent of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1970 Act</ref>) on 1 January 1971, no judge of the Family Division would have so construed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 22</ref>, particularly because one of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1970 Act</ref> was to remove the wife's agency of necessity and, with it, her opportunity to seek security for the costs of future litigation. But times have moved on. In the 1970s, a petitioner who had no assets and whose only prospect of affluence lay in the outcome of her application for ancillary relief, could easily find specialist solicitors who would pursue her claim on legal aid. That world has long since gone. In those days, a number of the leading specialist ancillary relief firms could, as a matter of public duty, take on an admittedly small number of legally-aided cases. Leading firms that would not take legally-aided clients invariably had an arrangement to pass such cases to highly competent firms that would do legal aid. All those support systems have disappeared. The modern reality is that the highly specialist solicitors and counsel necessary for the conduct of big money cases will no longer do publicly funded work. So, if the applicant has no assets, can give no security for borrowings, cannot guarantee an outcome that would enable her to enter into an arrangement such as that which was upheld in <span style="font-style:italic">Sears Tooth (A Firm) v Payne Hicks Beach (A Firm) and Others </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 116" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 116</ref> then there is no source of funding of the litigation other than the approach to the court for a maintenance pending suit that will include a substantial element to fund the cost of the litigation. Obviously, in all these cases the dominant safeguard against injustice is the discretion of the trial judge and it will only be in cases that are demonstrated to be exceptional that the court will consider exercising the jurisdiction. But, I am in no doubt that in such exceptional cases, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 22</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> can in modern times be construed to extend that far.&#8221;</p>

It is for this reason that I find it impossible to say that whenever the legislature gives a right of appeal, whether in civil or criminal proceedings, in circumstances where a successful appellant may be unable to recover his costs from any other party, that affords a sufficient ground to imply a term enabling the court to order the costs to be paid out of public funds. <span style="font-style:italic">The strictly limited range of the legislation expressly authorising payment of costs out of central funds in criminal proceedings no more lends itself to extension by judicial implication than does the equally limited range of legislation authorising payment of costs out of the legal aid fund in civil proceedings</span>. Some general legislative provision authorising public funding of otherwise irrecoverable costs, either in all proceedings or in all appellate proceedings, would no doubt be an admirable step in the right direction which the judiciary would heartily applaud. But this does not, in my opinion, justify the courts in attempting to achieve some similar result by the piecemeal implication of terms giving a power to order payment of costs out of central funds in particular statutes, which can only lead to anomalies.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those well-established principles, as articulated by the Master of the Rolls in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>, are clear.  Authority for public expenditure requires clear statutory authority, which authority must itself be in clear, express and unambiguous language.   Within this context, a general power or duty cannot be used to circumvent a clear statutory code.  Where Parliament has made detailed provisions as to how certain statutory functions in respect of legal funding are to be carried out, there is no scope for implying the existence of additional powers which lie wholly outside the relevant statutory code.  These principles hold true following the coming into force of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  Whilst they are articulated in the context of statutory interpretation, in circumstances where constitutional convention seeks to safeguard the control exercised by Parliament over the expenditure of public revenue I can see no reason why these principles should not apply when the court is considering the extent to which it has a power under the inherent jurisdiction to order a public authority to incur expenditure.  </p>

However, in the context of the principles I have summarised in the foregoing paragraph, it is important to highlight the significance of that very proper concession.  The examples of cost funding jurisdictions relied on by Mr Hale and Mr Barnes as indicating the court can properly find a power under the inherent jurisdiction to make a costs funding order against the local authority each have as their foundation a clear and unambiguous statutory power to award funds for a specific purpose.  The decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (Maintenance Pending Suite: Payment of Legal Fees</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">CF v KM (Financial Provision for Child: Costs of Legal Proceedings)</span>, albeit examples of the use of statutory interpretation to enlarge existing statutory powers, are based an express statutory power to compel one party to litigation to make payment to the other.  By contrast, the order the mother seeks compelling the local authority to fund her representation, and thus compelling a public authority to incur expenditure, is sought based on a power that is without <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>foundation in statute, clear, express and unambiguous or otherwise.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Wicks v Wicks </span>the Court of Appeal made clear that the court cannot simply make any order under the inherent jurisdiction that is required to ensure that justice is done between the parties.

Within this context, whilst I accept that it may act to ensure greater procedural fairness through ensuring &#8216;equality of arms&#8217;, I am satisfied that an order compelling the local authority to incur expenditure to fund advice and legal representation is an order affecting substantive rights.

However, I am satisfied that this submission constitutes an impermissible attempt to circumvent the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court in circumstances where Mr Hale and Mr Barnes are compelled to accept that a refusal of public funding based on the means test set out in the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Payment for Services) Regulations 2013 is lawful and does not amount to a breach of Arts 6 or 8.</p>

However, as the Master of the Rolls acknowledged in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>, it is also clear that these principles do not prevent a State party from imposing a means test to decide in which cases the State must fund the advice and representation required to meet the imperatives of Art 6 and 8 and in which cases the individual must themselves fund the advice and representation required to do so.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s submission that the creation of the latter jurisdiction is necessary to avoid breaches of Art 6 and Art 8 is an attempt to get around the fact that, as she accepts, she is not able to challenge the decision of the Legal Aid Agency in the Administrative Court and represents an impermissible attempt to open a collateral route of attack on a lawful decision.   If the mother seeks to argue that the decision of the Legal Aid Agency to refuse public funding based on her means places her in a situation that breaches her Art 6 and her Art 8 rights, then her remedy is to judicially review the scheme on the basis that it is unreasonably parsimonious or unfairly discriminates against her as compared to other parents in her situation, not to seek to craft a new jurisdiction whereby a different public authority (the court) takes the same decision again in respect of a different source of public funds. </p>

First, I am satisfied that a power under the inherent jurisdiction to compel a local authority to incur expenditure to fund advice and representation for litigants refused legal aid would be a power of extremely wide application.

Second, in deciding whether to make a costs funding order against a public authority pursuant to such a power, the court simply would not have available to it the wide range of information that would be required to be taken into account to ensure decisions were consistent and not contrary to principles of good administration.</p>

It follows that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be regarded as a lawless void permitting judges to do whatever we consider to be right for children or the vulnerable, be that in a particular case or more generally (as contended for here) towards unspecified categories of children or vulnerable adults.&#8221;</p>

Although the jurisdiction is theoretically boundless, the courts have nevertheless found it necessary to set self-imposed limits upon its exercise for the sake of clarity and consistency, and of avoiding conflict between child welfare and other public advantages.&#8221;</p>

As Lord Sumption pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 AC 415" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 AC 415</ref> at [37], courts exercising family jurisdiction do not occupy a desert island in which general legal concepts are suspended or mean something different.   Imposing the limits that I am satisfied must apply, I regret that I cannot accept the submission of Mr Hale and Mr Barnes that the inherent jurisdiction of this court is wide enough to encompass a power to order a public authority to incur expenditure in order to fund legal representation in wardship proceedings for a parent who does not qualify for legal aid because that parent does not satisfy the criteria for a grant of legal aid laid down by Parliament, notwithstanding the considerable benefits that would accrue to the parent, and to the child, from such funding.</p>

In such cases the orders available under the inherent jurisdiction (and not available under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) will be particularly apposite, including passport orders and orders in wardship that can be served on foreign States with a view to securing their co-operation where children have already been removed from the jurisdiction.</p>

Again, without wishing to lay down any hard and fast rules, these are likely to be cases where the welfare issues go beyond threatened or actual removal and concern, for example, the welfare impact of parental beliefs, loyalties or ideologies or the welfare impact of extremist material present in the family home.  In such cases, it is likely that proceedings brought under the comprehensive statutory code intended to address allegations of significant harm will be the most apt in circumstances where, in such proceedings, the child is an automatic respondent, where detailed and comprehensive multi-disciplinary guidance and conventional safeguarding procedures for addressing alleged harm to children (based on a large and carefully considered body of authority) can be brought to bear on the welfare issues that fall for consideration and where the actions of the local authority and the welfare of the child or children are subject to regular, statutory, review.  Additional advantages accruing from the use of proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> may include the fact that local authorities and other professionals working with families are more familiar with care proceedings and the fact that, following the conclusion of state intervention, a child or young person may be eligible for continuing support under the leaving care provisions in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, cases of alleged radicalisation deal with what can be considered a new type of harm to children (although it has parallels with other types of harm).  That alleged harm, which may justify State intervention in family life, occurs in a context that may also touch on complex and controversial arguments with respect to thought, conscience and religion.  In these circumstances, there are powerful reasons for ensuring that the harm alleged is evaluated by reference to, and addressed within the <span style="font-style:italic">statutory </span>framework put in place by Parliament for regulating State intervention in families based on actual or likely significant harm rather than under the wide inherent jurisdiction of the court.  This point is, in my view, reinforced by the fact that, as I set out above, the applicable criteria for granting final orders are not the same under the inherent jurisdiction and Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, final orders under the latter requiring the court to be satisfied that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the care given or likely to be given to him or her and that an order is in the child&#8217;s best interests, final orders under the former requiring the court to be satisfied that the order is in the child&#8217;s best interests, without the need to surmount any further threshold test for intervention with respect to significant harm. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, and within this context, where the issue before the court goes beyond the question of there being reasonable cause to believe the child is likely to suffer significant harm by reason of his or her threatened or actual removal from the jurisdiction, to the question of whether significant harm has occurred or is likely to occur and, if so, what orders should be made to ensure the child&#8217;s welfare in the context of that actual or threatened harm, then <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is unlikely to permit the use of the inherent jurisdiction given the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(4)</ref>(a) in the context of the recognised need to maintain fidelity to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> when considering whether to permit a local authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction.   </p>

Whilst it would be inappropriate to elect a jurisdiction <span style="font-style:italic">solely</span> on the basis of which set of proceedings will afford public funding for parents, the seminal importance of parents being legally advised and represented in cases leading to State intervention in family life will mean that the question of the availability of funding is a powerful factor falling for consideration when considering which form of proceedings will best meet the need to safeguard and promote the child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

Whilst I have rejected the local authority&#8217;s view that guidance was given in the authorities it cited, and making clear that the court has no jurisdiction to compel a local authority to issue proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, having regard to the matters set out above it seems to me that this is a realistic position for the local authority to take. The issues in this case go beyond the question of the threatened or actual removal from the jurisdiction of older children and encompass questions of the welfare impact of the mother&#8217;s alleged beliefs and sympathies (which, I make clear, she denies) and the welfare impact of material alleged to be in the family home.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, in circumstances where it is plain that there will remain a group of cases where wardship is the most appropriate vehicle to be utilised by the local authority in cases of alleged radicalisation, the issue of the lack of non-means and non-merits tested legal aid in such proceedings, notwithstanding that the same constitute an intervention by the State in family life based on allegations of harm, remains.  For the reasons I have given, this court has no jurisdiction to order an alternate public authority to provide a parent who finds themselves in these circumstances with funding for advice and representation.  In this regard, I repeat the observation, albeit made in a different legal context, of the Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re DE (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/6" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 6" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 6</ref> at [51]:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[51]&#160;Finally, this case has highlighted a further major problem. These parents face the prospect of losing their son permanently. If this prospect had arisen in the context of care proceedings, they would be entitled as of right to non-means tested legal aid. It is difficult to see why similar automatic public funding should not be available where the local authority proposes the removal of a child living at home under a care order and the parents apply to discharge that order and for an interim injunction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> HRA. The justification for automatic public funding in care proceedings is the draconian nature of the order being claimed by the local authority. Where a local authority seeks to remove a child placed at home under a care order, the outcome of the discharge application may be equally draconian. Because this father is working, and earns a very low wage from which he has contributed to the support of his family, he, and possibly the mother, are disqualified from legal aid. Miss Fottrell and Miss Sprinz and their solicitors are at present acting <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span>. It is unfair that legal representation in these vital cases is only available if the lawyers agree to work for nothing.&#8221;</p>
