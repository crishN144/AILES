By an earlier order the latter was transferred by me to the High Court to be heard alongside the former. Both relate to a marriage formed on 1 June 2013 in Pakistan under sharia law between the parties. There is no suggestion that the marriage is not valid in Pakistan. The issues for me are, first, whether the applicant had capacity to consent to marriage on 1 June 2013; and second, if not, whether the marriage should not be recognised by this court, or, alternatively, annulled.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In 1995 the applicant at the age of six was involved in a major car accident along with other members of her family. She was taken by helicopter to hospital where she spent many months recovering from her injuries, including what has been described as a catastrophic brain injury. There was understandably a serious impact on the applicant&#8217;s mental health and cognitive functioning.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The applicant settled her claim arising out of the accident for a large sum. A deputy was appointed for the applicant by the Court of Protection because she lacked capacity to manage her property and financial affairs. The final deputy was the applicant&#8217;s current solicitor who acts in these proceedings. The deputyship was discharged in 2019. The applicant&#8217;s deputy had observed that the applicant was becoming more independent and was able to manage her property and financial matters. A capacity assessment from Dr Simon Prangnell, a consultant clinical neuropsychologist, was obtained in March 2019; it deals with various aspects of the applicant&#8217;s life from making a will and managing property to entering into marriage and engaging in sexual relations. I will turn to his evidence in more detail below but in summary he concluded that the applicant did have capacity in all the areas of life canvassed including to marry and enter sexual relations. But it was his expert opinion that in June 2013 the applicant did not have capacity to marry.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The report by Dr Prangnell followed two earlier capacity assessments by Dr Michael  Barnes, Honorary Professor of Neurological Rehabilitation at Newcastle University. The deputy had for a number of years been obtaining capacity reports so that she could keep the Court of Protection up to date as to the applicant&#8217;s capacity. Professor Barnes in 2012 concluded that the applicant did not have capacity to marry. He opined in 2016 that the applicant would have continued to lack capacity in this regard in 2013. Again, I will turn to his report in further detail below.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I will set out below my findings about the course of the parties' relationship leading up to and following the marriage. As will be seen, the parties have since the marriage on 1 June 2013 spent very little time together and are now irretrievably estranged. The applicant has come under pressure from her family to reconcile with the respondent which has caused a high level of tension. The applicant travelled to see the respondent in April 2018 to explore the possibility of reconciliation. The applicant says they both agreed that the marriage was at an end although she says the respondent later changed his stance. She understands that the respondent now has plans to remarry although she is unaware of any attempts by him to divorce her.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Clearly, the applicant has achieved a great deal in her life. The applicant has fought back from the life-changing events of 1995 and from an uncertain initial prognosis to acquire qualifications, employment, and independent living. She has regained capacity in seemingly every field. This is not to detract from the submission of her counsel, who rightly argued that just because the applicant&#8217;s presentation is currently good, it does not mean that she is not suffering from a mental impairment or condition. I readily accept that to some degree the applicant still lives with the consequences of the accident.   </p>

It confers on the parties the status of husband and wife, the essence of the contract being an agreement between a man and a woman to live together and to love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others. It creates a relationship of mutual and reciprocal obligations, typically involving the sharing of a common home and a common domestic life and the right to enjoy each other's society, comfort and assistance."  </p>

The authorities have set the standard for capacity to choose to engage in sexual relations at an equivalently low level to that for capacity to marry: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">D Borough Council v AB</span> [2011] EWHC 101 [COP]; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 FLR 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 FLR 72</ref>, at [21]. If someone has the capacity to consent to marry then, as a matter of empirical experience, he or she is likely to have the capacity to choose to engage in sexual relations. However, because capacity is always issue-specific, capacity to marry, and capacity to choose to engage in sexual relations, are legally distinct. They may not necessarily produce the same answer, although typically they will.  </p>

Similarly, a couple may marry and live together <span style="font-style:italic">tanquam soror vel tanquam frater</span> (as sister and brother - see below).

Needless to say, these are all perfectly valid marriages. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">"However, I have been asked specifically to address the issue of whether Ms B had capacity to consent to marriage at the time of her marriage on 1 June 2013. I consider that at a very simple level she would have understood the nature of the marriage &#8216;contract&#8217; that she was entering into. In other words, I consider that she would be able to understand her emotions towards her husband-to-be and able to consent that she would like to live with him as his wife. It is also my opinion that she was able to consent to sexual relations. However, I do not feel that she had capacity, and still does not have capacity, to understand the full ramifications of marriage. In particular, it is clear to me that she was not able to think through the consequences of marriage, particularly in terms of her husband&#8217;s future residence with her in the UK. She was not able to think through his involvement in the management of her financial settlement and she was not able to think through the consequences of living with her husband in terms of less involvement from her own family in her day-to-day life. She is very dependent on her family, particularly her mother and sisters, and now finds it distressing to think that if her husband came to the UK then there would be potentially less involvement from her family. She now finds the whole situation anxiety-provoking and stressful and it is clear that she was not able to consider these broader implications when she entered into the marriage in June 2013.  </p>

He accepted that the applicant at a simple level understood the nature of the marriage contract; that she understood her emotions to her husband to be; that she was able to consent to live with him as his wife; and that she was able to choose to engage in sexual relations. That seems to me fully to satisfy the test for capacity to marry which I have set out above. In my judgment the law does not impose on this applicant a requirement to be able to understand the full ramifications of marriage and specifically the question of where her husband might choose to live, or his involvement in the management of her damages. The fact that she might find it distressing to spend less time with her family while her husband to come to England says nothing at all about her capacity to consent to marriage. </p>

It seems to me that this  matches the simple and relatively low standard set 136  years ago by the then President. Her lack of awareness of the difference between Islamic and English marriage; or the financial consequences depending on the contract; or her husband's potential claims against her estate; or her husband's proposed living arrangements say nothing at all about her capacity to marry. They may say quite a lot about her wisdom in getting married, but that is not the issue I have to decide. </p>

She told me that at the time of the marriage in 2013 her expectation was about just entering into marriage and living a normal married life; about living life as a couple. It was not about the after-effects such as finances and contracts. She told me that it was a choice that she made, but in which her family also had a say. She had met her husband-to-be at a family wedding about two years previously. She lived in England and he was in Pakistan; their courtship was by telephone. The agreement to marry was reached through the family; her parents learned that they were courting by telephone and thought that marriage would be a good idea. Nonetheless, she made the decision. The agreement to marry was about two months before the wedding. Her parents approved of her fianc&#233;. Naturally, she talked to her parents about the forthcoming marriage. She has siblings all of whom are married. The marriage took place in person and vows were exchanged. It was a big affair; there were about 500 guests. There was an after-party at the respondent's house after the ceremony. She stayed with him in his house and the marriage was consummated. About two weeks later she returned to England. They have never lived together since. She thought that once married he would come and live with her here; but that never happened. She has since discovered that he was always ambivalent about coming to live with her here. She heard last year that he was planning to remarry, but she has not been told that he has obtained a divorce in Pakistan. The difference between her comprehension then and </p>

That she was not aware, and may not have been capable of being made aware, of the potential financial ramifications of marriage; of her husband's intentions as to residence and work; of whether he would sign a prenuptial agreement; or of any potential claim he may have against her on divorce is nothing to the point. None of these things tell me anything about her capacity to marry in June 2013.

Even having regard to the relaxations that have permitted marriage to be celebrated in a variety of places and by a variety of celebrants, it is simply inconceivable that IC could be lawfully married in this jurisdiction. There is much expert evidence to suggest that the marriage which his parents have arranged for him is potentially highly injurious. He has not the capacity to understand the introduction of NK into his life and that introduction would be likely to destroy his equilibrium or destabilise his emotional state. Physical intimacy is an ordinary consequence of the celebration of a marriage. Were IC's parents to permit or encourage sexual intercourse between IC and NK, NK would be guilty of the crime of rape under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref>. Physical intimacy that stops short of penetrative sex would constitute the crime of indecent assault under that statute. IC's parents, perhaps understandably, cannot accept the court's statutory and inherent powers to protect IC. Their engineering of the telephonic marriage is potentially if not actually abusive of IC. It is the duty of the court to protect IC from that potential abuse. The refusal of recognition of the marriage is an essential foundation of that protection. Miss Ball has suggested that the public policy exception is not easily illustrated in the authorities. In my judgment the refusal of recognition in this case is justified even if not precedented. Accordingly I would grant permission to appeal on ground one and allow the appeal only to the extent of varying the language of the order of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December. In place of the existing declaration (h) I would propose a declaration that the marriage between IC and NK, valid according to the law of Bangladesh, is not recognised as a valid marriage in this jurisdiction." </p>

The court will only take the exceptional and momentous decision of non-recognition where recognition would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, or some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheni</span>, the then President gave the example of the refusal by the Court of the King's Bench in <span style="font-style:italic">Sommerset's case</span> (1772) 20 State Tr. 1. to recognise and give effect to a foreign status of slavery. However, in the case before him he declined to refuse to recognise the validity of a marriage in Egypt between uncle and niece as being an affront to the judicial conscience. That foreign marriage was void ab initio under English law in consequence of the parties being within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. On the contrary, he held that injustice would be perpetrated, and conscience would be affronted, if the English court were not to recognise and to give effect to the law of the domicile in that case.  </p>

So my only quibble with the Commentary is that the statutory codification in 1986 of the subject matter is not mentioned  as an additional powerful reason for very narrowly construing the criterion of exceptionality in this class of case. <span style="font-style:italic">Cheni</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">v Cheni </span>was decided 20 years before the reform. The Law Commission, and therefore Parliament, specifically decided not to allow a public policy exception to the statutory prohibition on making a declaration that a marriage was invalid at its inception. By contrast, it specifically did allow a public policy exception to the granting of a declaration that was otherwise available to be made. These considerations surely strongly militate, at the very least, in favour of an extremely limited exercise of the public policy power in cases such as these. It could be argued that the reach of statutory prohibition in fact extends to block additionally the exercise of the public policy power. It is not necessary for me to grapple with that, as I have decided that the facts of this case do not justify the exercise of the power. But it is a serious argument which will </p>

First, they would have an elaborate quasi-marital ceremony, which would not actually be a marriage, but would look like one; later they would have an actual formal marriage ceremony in a register office. Following the first event on 23 January 2004, the relationship broke down; the actual register office marriage never took place. Mr Hudson petitioned for a declaration pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction that the first ceremony did not constitute a marriage at all; it was a 'non-marriage'. He justified taking this approach on the grounds that the subject matter of the declaration was not covered by the statutory code. The code presupposed in each instance that the ceremony in question was one of marriage; whereas, this ceremony was said to have been nothing more than a charade. The case principally concerned the question of whether the law recognised such a thing as a "non-marriage". Bodey J held at [62] and [84] that recourse could be made to the inherent jurisdiction for a declaration where the issue was whether there was a bona fide marriage ceremony (even if the marriage was void or voidable) or whether it was a charade (and therefore a nonmarriage). Such a declaration could legitimately be made where its purpose is to declare that there was never a marriage, as distinct from being a marriage void at its inception.  </p>

Her submissions are succinct and attractively presented. Whilst she concedes that this Court has discretion whether to make a declaration of non recognition of a foreign marriage, she submits that the public policy priority weighs so heavily that it overwhelms the balancing exercise. If the Court declares that RS lacks capacity to marry it follows axiomatically, Ms Hearnden argues, that the marriage could not lawfully have been conducted in England and Wales. The fact the marriage is formally valid in Pakistan, an unchallenged fact in this case, should not encourage an English Court to recognise a marriage which offends a key contractual component, namely consent." </p>

Whilst I am not prepared to predict the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised, neither am I prepared to say that a Court is never likely to do so.

But this scenario was expressly considered by the Law Commission, and therefore impliedly by Parliament, which decided that the statutory prohibition should be unyielding even in those circumstances.

I would refuse to do so because it would amount to a blatant bypassing and flouting of the statutory prohibition. I would unhesitatingly decline to exercise the public policy power not to recognise this marriage (assuming that its exercise is not in fact blocked by the statutory prohibition) as the facts of this case do not satisfy the stringent criterion of exceptionality.

This was the case under the pre-1857 ecclesiastical law which became incorporated into secular law by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/20-21/85/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/20-21/85" uk:canonical="1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict.) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857</ref>. However, it was a doctrine of Canon Law, dating back to the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX in 1227, and adopted by English ecclesiastical law, that a marriage void on the ground that there was no consent at the time of the marriage ceremony could be ratified by consent voluntarily given subsequently, whereupon such consent was deemed to relate back to the time of the marriage. Thus, if no valid consent could be given at the time of the marriage in consequence of unsoundness of mind, and the marriage was therefore void, that void marriage could later be ratified following a later mental recovery. This doctrine of ratification was acknowledged in the post-1857 secular law.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The existence of the doctrine of ratification was considered by the Law Commission to be a good reason for the transfer of a marriage alleged to be void on the ground of lack of consent from the void into the voidable category, since it enabled a party to decide for himself whether he wished the marriage to take effect. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For this reason and others spelt out in the report at para 14, the Law Commission recommended that lack of consent due to unsoundness of mind at the time of the marriage should render the marriage voidable. The Law Commission opposed the suggestion that the concept of voidable marriages should be abolished altogether, leaving them as valid marriages only terminable by divorce, but recommended in para 25 that the effect of the decree of nullity of a voidable marriage should make clear that the marriage is to be treated in every respect as a valid marriage until it is annulled.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Law Commission recommended that the doctrine of ratification should be abolished and replaced by a form of approbation which would debar a party from seeking an annulment if he had led the other party to believe that he would not do so. It went on to propose at para 79 that there should be a three-year time limit from the date of the marriage for bringing nullity proceedings in the case of voidable marriages. This would extend to cases of lack of consent due to unsoundness of mind. At para 85 the Law Commission said that even in such a case there would be no hardship since proceedings could be taken on an incapacitated party's behalf within the time limit. Moreover, there was sense in bringing in a time limit for this ground where there already was a time limit for the already existing ground, now found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12(1)</ref>(d) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, that a party at the time of the marriage suffers from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfitted for marriage. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is true that 'mental disorder' is defined very laconically in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. It means merely any disorder or disability of the mind. Disorders resulting from learning disabilities or dependence on alcohol or drugs are excluded. That said, it is common knowledge that there is a world of difference between an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and a disorder or disability of the mind under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. The words describe two completely different scenarios. It is often said that there are plenty of people sectioned under the Mental Health Act who nonetheless have full capacity under the Mental Capacity Act. Conversely there are plenty of people who lack capacity under the Mental Capacity Act who nonetheless have perfectly good mental health. </p>

Miss Rahman made a valiant effort to get me to construe the medical evidence, which was directed at capacity, as demonstrating that mental disorder or mental disability existed at that time. I am afraid that it does nothing of the sort; if anything it demonstrates that in June 2013, and subsequently, the applicant has enjoyed good mental health. The condition for a grant of leave out of time under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/13/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> is therefore not satisfied in this case. </p>

That assumption was undermined by the later issue by the applicant of a nullity petition, which had it been successful would have granted the respondent the unrestricted right to seek ancillary relief. If the applicant now proceeds with a divorce petition the respondent's right to seek ancillary relief would be identical to that he would have enjoyed had a decree of nullity been granted. </p>

The award of damages to the applicant was calibrated by reference to her needs, and compensation for her pain and suffering. This marriage never functioned as a marriage and accordingly I find it impossible to conceive of any circumstances, even were the respondent to suffer grave hardship, where he could mount a plausible claim against the applicant. I say this in order to reassure the applicant were she now to regularise her status and move on by seeking a decree of divorce. </p>
