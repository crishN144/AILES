I was told that an offer has just been received, subject to contract, for the Barn and some amenity land in the sum of &#163;890,000 (a sum in excess of the formal valuation).  I have been told that there are ongoing proceedings in relation to an occupation order which W secured during the proceedings.  There is a further court hearing in January 2015.  These are not matters with which I need to deal in this judgment other than to observe, as I have earlier, that the ongoing costs of this litigation are likely to prove ruinous for this couple if common sense does not prevail at some point, and soon.  To put matters in context, it is clear from the asset schedule which is appended to the judgment of DDJ Airey that the total liquid assets available for division (excluding pension) may well be less than &#163;90,000 if the parties are unsuccessful in securing planning permission in respect of the FMH.  Even if that permission is granted, the available liquid assets are unlikely to exceed &#163;577,000 and that is all that will be available to rehouse them both after a marriage which has lasted more than 30 years.</span></p>

Whilst not specifying her capital target in relation to housing, she sought an uplift to reflect the finding made by the DDJ that H had a mortgage capacity of &#163;340,000 (a figure predicated on a multiplier of net income x 2).  She also sought permission to appeal the refusal of the DDJ to secure the award of periodical payments in her favour in the sum of &#163;100,000.  In addition, W indicated that she would be applying to permission to adduce fresh evidence at the appeal in relation to H&#8217;s failure to comply with the lump sum orders made by the DDJ and by Cobb J on 16 July 2014.</span></p>

The first was the payment to W of the capital orders made by the DDJ; the second was the payment to her of 50% of the spousal periodical payments with effect from 9 June 2014.  Permission to appeal the order giving W sole conduct of the sale of the FMH was refused.  Directions were made for the filing of skeleton arguments in relation to the substantive appeal and cross-appeal and a schedule was agreed in relation to the contents of the appeal bundle.  With the exception of the transcript of the oral evidence (which has not been made available), all the relevant documents have been provided within the two court bundles which were available to me, and I have read the contents of both.</span></p>

His salary (the fixed element from that employment) is &#163;87,714 per annum.  He is also paid an allowance in respect of the accommodation which he rents locally (just under &#163;38,000 per annum) and to cover car expenses (just over &#163;9,500 per annum which covers the cost of leasing and running a car for use in Dubai).  Because these allowances are paid in local currency, they fluctuate from time to time.  He has also received, at least for the last two years, a non-contractual discretionary bonus.  In his Form E, he made his financial presentation on the basis that his gross income for the preceding year was &#163;212,425 (net of any tax implications).  Of this sum, &#163;104,411 was salary; &#163;42,378 represented the housing allowance and &#163;10,686 the car allowance.  The balance of some &#163;55,000 represented a bonus payment.</span></p>

I was told by Mr Lyon that the figures in the schedule correlated exactly with credit entries recorded on the bank statements which H had disclosed in the proceedings.  From the schedule, it is clear that the housing allowance is paid in two instalments each year but notionally credited on a month by month basis as part of his income entitlement.  The car allowance is paid as a monthly allowance.</span></p>

His section 25 statement referred to his attempts to find alternative employment and the prospect of an imminent offer which, on the basis of a salary of c. &#163;85,000, would match his current salary, albeit that he was likely to have to pay UK tax on that income once he was living permanently in this jurisdiciton.  On the eve of the final hearing, W&#8217;s solicitors discovered that H was linked to a company called Y Co.  The website named him as a director and part of &#8216;the Dubai Team&#8217;.  In the period between the end of the hearing in March and delivery of the written judgment in May 2014, H provided a copy of an offer of employment dated 26 March 2014 from that company.  In the event, he did not take up that employment.  It is a cause of complaint by W that H has consistently refused to provide full, frank and up to date evidence as to his employment prospects.  I was told that during the course of evidence at the final hearing, it emerged that he might have been in line for promotion within X CO and short-listed as one of two potential candidates.</span></p>

It is agreed that this development is one which I cannot and should not take into account for the purposes of considering the respective merits of the permission sought and/or the cross-appeals in the event that they follow any permission I may grant.

As I remarked during the course of submissions, people seldom shine in their best light when finding their way through the emotional bereavement which divorce so often brings as its inevitable consequence, especially after a shared life together of more than 30 years.  I have read the transcript of a judgment delivered by DJ Alderson on 7 February 2014 in the context of W&#8217;s application for non-molestation and occupation orders.  It speaks volumes about the parties&#8217; approach to this litigation and the aggressive stance which each has on occasion adopted.  As the District Judge was to remark, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;The result as far as these parties are concerned has been, of course, an incredible waste of emotional energy, memory and, most of all, money.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">  I wholeheartedly endorse those comments.  I am told that, to date, the combined bill for legal costs in relation to the financial remedy proceedings and these cross-appeals now exceeds &#163;200,000.  A further &#163;80,000 has been spent on the proceedings relating to the occupation orders which does not include the anticipated costs of a further hearing January next year.  Against the DDJ&#8217;s finding that the non-pension assets in the case were unlikely to exceed &#163;577,000, this is a wholly disproportionate and unrealistic sum for these parties to have spent.  It demonstrates yet again how the impact of litigation in anything other than the &#8216;big money&#8217; cases (where parties must be taken to be entirely free to make their own choices about the investment they are prepared to make in litigation) will inevitably result in a much reduced standard of living in retirement for people who have worked hard and decently throughout a shared life together and who can, and should, expect more. </span></p>

In recent years, she has been involved in a local catering business but in all material respects was (and is) wholly financially dependent upon H.  The financial arrangements between the parties since their separation has been governed by an informal agreement where H pays to W a sum of &#163;700 per month and meets a number of specified outgoings, including the mortgage on the FMH.  Whilst W has no doubt had to &#8216;cut her cloth&#8217; in order to adjust to a reduced standard of living, she has only managed on this sum, it seems, by borrowing up to &#163;1,000 per month from her mother (who I am told has also made a contribution towards her legal costs).  Despite making two separate applications for maintenance pending suit, each has been vacated by consent.  Mr Brooks, on her behalf, tells me that she felt that she had little choice but to accept the arrangements which were imposed upon her by H since, until the final hearing, she did not have a full understanding of his financial circumstances in Dubai. </span></p>

H&#8217;s needs were set out in his Form E at &#163;4,750 per month (or &#163;57,000 per annum).  That figure included annual pension contributions of &#163;2,500 per month (although I was told he had made no such contributions since 1995 or thereabouts).  In terms of his own housing needs, he had advanced property particulars of houses costing in the region of &#163;400,000, although he was subsequently to update this evidence by including a range of properties costing between &#163;300,000 and &#163;400,000 which he contended would be suitable for either or both himself and W.  When asked what he would do if all he had to take into the market place was a sum of &#163;260,000, he said that he would buy the best house he could.  His evidence was that &#8216;the parties have got what they have got, and would have to make the best of it&#8217;.</span></p>

In the latter, Moor J took a slightly different view and held that &#8216; a real prospect of success&#8217; is one which is realistic rather than fanciful and does not require the court to be satisfied that there is greater than a 50/50 prospect of success.

This relates to an allegation that W was guilty of material non-disclosure in that, at the time of the final hearing before the DDJ, she failed to alert the court to the fact that she, her mother and brother were in active discussions with Wirral Metropolitan Borough District Council regarding a planning application to demolish her mother&#8217;s home (in which she had a 25% contingent interest) and to build on the plot seven new properties.  H also relies on the existence of an ongoing dialogue between W, her family members and the local authority during which they were advised to amend the application because the view had been taken that the extent of the proposed redevelopment on the site was unacceptable.  It is alleged that on 17 March 2014, they had received advice from an officer of the local authority to that effect.</span></p>

In the light of (i) the costs already incurred by these parties to date and (ii) the fact that W has already had an opportunity to respond (through Mr Brooks&#8217;s skeleton) to the allegations relied on by H, I propose to deal with the application to amend now on its merits.</span></p>

I should also point out at this point that counsel confirmed that, despite the reference in the above paragraph to W&#8217;s &#8216;siblings&#8217;, she only has one brother who has also inherited a 25% contingent interest under the terms of their late father&#8217;s Will.

He proceeded on the basis that W&#8217;s contingent interest was worth &#163;110,250.  That valuation was evidently based upon a gross sale price of &#163;450,000.  For these purposes, I will assume that figure to have been collected from the probate valuation produced by W which was contained within the 5 bundles of material put before the court for the purposes of the final hearing.  The DDJ did </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">not</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> find that W would receive no value from any future realisation of her contingent interest, or that it might not prove to be a more valuable interest at the point of realisation some time in the future.  He found only that her contingent interest was then impressed with a moral obligation to make a contribution to the financial costs of future care should the need arise in future.  He did not have before him evidence of any plan to maximise future value of that interest through a planning application and it is impossible at this point to speculate upon what findings might have been made had he known on 26 March 2014 or subsequently that some nine days earlier, on 17 March, there had been an informal meeting between W&#8217;s mother&#8217;s family representative and one of the local authority&#8217;s planning officers.</span></p>

I am certainly not intending to encourage either party to pursue further litigation and, as he will no doubt be advised, there are likely to be strict time limits on any prospects he may have of re-opening matters based upon a material change of facts in the future.

That is not to say that such an outcome in the circumstances of this case might not have been the appropriate conclusion in relation to income on the figures had this been a conventional case of a husband earning a net income of &#163;170,000 per annum made up entirely of cash.

He was aware that there was a finite amount of income available (or assumed to be available) which would in future need to provide for the independent domestic economies of two separate homes and lifestyles.  In these circumstances, given the wide experience of this particular deputy district judge over many years, both in professional practice and in judicial terms, I take the view that he cannot be criticised for not dissecting the budgets and/or making specific findings in relation to the various heads of expenditure claimed as an aspect of future need.</span></p>

He had before him the X CO schedules to which I was taken for the purposes of the appeal hearing.  In connection with a different question (the equalisation of the bank accounts), he had confirmed in his 6 June 2014 letter that he had received evidence that H&#8217;s rent in Dubai had been paid up front for a year.  When the case was opened to me on Monday of this week, it appeared to be common ground that the entirety of the housing allowance received by H was absorbed in meeting his rent in Dubai and related elements of what might be referred to as &#8216;roofing costs&#8217; (utilities and the like).  This was subsequently challenged by Mr Brooks on behalf of W and I was taken to various tenancy agreements into which H had entered over the years where the rent payable was said to be less than the sums received in respect of the local housing allowance.  I asked for an agreed position.  </span></p>

From a housing allowance of AED 237,000, the rent paid by H is AED 195,000 leaving a balance of some AED 43,000 per annum (AED 3,583 per month or &#163;597 per month).  From this sum, and in addition to his rent, H has to meet not only related contractual payments under his tenancy agreement but also his property-related expenses.  I accept, in these circumstances, that there is little disposable &#8216;benefit&#8217; to him in income terms from the housing allowance once the rent and other outgoings have been met.  There is no issue but that the car allowance can effectively be ignored as wholly absorbed by the costs of leasing and running a vehicle locally in Dubai.</span></p>

Whilst the X CO schedules show monthly sums credited to H&#8217;s account for the housing and car allowances, it is accepted they are simply &#8216;paper&#8217; credits to offset (and balance) the actual 6 monthly payments out of the allowance.  In terms of the guaranteed element of H&#8217;s income (his salary), some 90% is currently absorbed (or would be so absorbed) in meeting the order which the DDJ made in respect of spousal support.</span></p>

Returning to the X CO schedules, it is clear that these &#8216;special payments&#8217;, as they are referred to, had been paid consistently and at regular intervals from February 2012 to November 2013.  It appears to have been H&#8217;s evidence that the payment which might otherwise have been expected to be made in February 2014 (the month before the final hearing commenced) had not been received. I am nevertheless left in some difficulty in accepting that the DDJ fell into error in making the assumption which he plainly did that evidence of H&#8217;s past performance was a fairly reliable indicator or predictor of future performance and/or reward.  Mr Lyon relies on the specific evidence which H gave as to the reasons why there had been an interruption in the steady stream of discretionary awards.  Those reasons centred on the relocation of his department with the consequent redundancy of his own position within the company.  It is difficult to reconcile that evidence with the parallel evidence of a promotion within the ranks of X CO in Dubai.  On balance, I do not think that the DDJ can be criticised for assuming a fairly level income stream which was comprised of salary and bonus payments.  Where I believe he fell into error was in conflating his ex-patriate local allowances for housing and motoring costs as part of his disposable income available to meet spousal support.</span></p>

His bonus for 2012/13 was just over &#163;37,000 net, a total of &#163;127,000, excluding the local allowances.  Looked at another way, H can be taken on the basis of the DDJ&#8217;s findings to have had a disposable income of &#163;127,000 with all his &#8216;roofing&#8217; expenses met in full.  Mr Lyon submits that the correct approach is to focus solely on the fixed salary element and to deduct from that H&#8217;s outgoings in respect of mandatory loan repayments, litigation and joint debt expenses.  According to his Form E budget, these total some &#163;4,450 per month which would leave a sum of &#163;3,000 per month available for spousal support of W.  In terms of any bonus received, he submits that the DDJ should then have awarded her a &#8216;top up&#8217; element expressed in terms of a percentage of the bonus (if any) actually received by H.

That was precisely what the DDJ did in relation to the information he collected from the X CO schedules.

In this context, it is worth noting that the job offers which were either on the table or in the pipeline at the time of the final hearing were all based upon a similar bonus/commission structure.  I bear in mind, too, the finding of the DDJ that this husband was unlikely to move to new employment unless he was earning the same, or an equivalent, income.</span></p>

The mortgage is going to have to be paid and the order made by the DDJ provided, in para 11, for that expense and payments on a bank loan to be shared equally on a monthly basis.  It follows that W will discharge 50% of the monthly instalments from the funds she will receive from H.  The figure in her budget for the mortgage costs can therefore be reduced by 50%, a saving of  c.&#163;8,000 per annum.  As and when the FMH is sold, there will need to be an adjustment but I would hope that could be agreed on a voluntary basis.  I have looked in some detail at the other elements of W&#8217;s budget for herself and I find none to be objectionable in the context of this case.  The personal expenses are of a modest nature (eg. &#163;150 per month for clothes and shoes, &#163;30 per month for personal fitness and &#163;80 per month for entertainment).  With the reduction for the mortgage element, her monthly budget is just over &#163;6,300.  The children&#8217;s expenses consist of rent (&#163;420) and expenditure when they are with W (&#163;300).

I disregard in their entirety the allowances for housing and transport costs on the basis these are all but absorbed in the actual (necessary) expenses which he incurs locally in Dubai as a necessary function of his employment.  His base salary (net in his hands) is &#163;7,500 per month.  His bonus (which I shall take at &#163;37,000 net in his hands) increases his monthly income to &#163;10,583, or &#163;127,000 per annum.  His own income needs, set out in para 3.1.1 of his Form E, amount to &#163;4,750 per month (or &#163;57,000 per annum).  In the main these consist of the expenses of running a home in this jurisdiction, although there is also provision for general (and un-particularised) expenditure of &#163;1,000 per month and pension contributions of &#163;2,500 per month.  In the light of the fact that he has made no such contributions since the mid-1990s and the existing funds have already been divided, I take the view that expenditure on saving for retirement at this level by either party may not be achievable in the short term, at least until the parties know what sale price can be achieved for the FMH.</span></p>

At least one is in full time education or training and H is for these purposes living outside the jurisdiction.  The order made by the DDJ contained no separate provision for the children and I was not told how their expenses were being funded.  In any event, this global level of expenditure (with an element of pension provision) is only just affordable on an income of &#163;127,000 (which, I accept, includes the variable element of bonus payments twice a year).

Of course, in one sense, this exercise is both academic and hypothetical given what I now know about his employment status.  Nevertheless, it is the basis upon which the appeal hearing proceeded and I share the view of the DDJ as to H&#8217;s future earning capacity, even if his present employment contract has been effectively terminated.  In circumstances where the bonus accounts for such a small percentage of his income, I take the view that it would be unnecessarily cumbersome to import into any award of periodical payments which is designed to cover an interim holding position a &#8216;top up&#8217; element expressed as a percentage.

He simply gave each party an equal share of the assets and effectively &#8216;left them to do the best they could&#8217; with the resources available to them.  There is, as yet, no certainty as to what a 50% share will produce but, even on a best case scenario of a sale of the FMH at &#163;1.4 million, neither can expect to see much more than about &#163;288,500 (and this figure assumes that H will receive his service gratuity at the end of his employment term with X CO).</span></p>

It is predicated on the basis of the DDJ&#8217;s finding that H has a mortgage capacity of &#163;340,000 which would enable him to purchase an equivalent property to that which W wishes to buy.</span></p>

It is not clear to me from the judgment why the DDJ made his finding in relation to mortgage capacity if his intention was to leave the parties in a broadly similar position at the conclusion of these proceedings.  It is plain from his division of the income that he had not specifically factored into his thinking any requirement on H in future to fund a mortgage.  It surely cannot have been his intention that H would free to acquire a property in England which was worth more than double the value of W&#8217;s future home ?  The fact that such was not his intention seems to be borne out by his approach to the future funding of her maintenance.  It was not in dispute at the hearing that she had no effective independent mortgage capacity of her own.</span></p>

The plan had always been to demolish the existing property and build (and sell) a second property on the site.  He says there was no formal requirement on the DDJ to express a fixed figure in respect of W&#8217;s minimum housing need.  The approach he adopted in the circumstances (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;you cannot spend what you have not got&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">) was a perfectly acceptable manner in which to proceed.

He would have been aware that W would be a cash purchaser in a softening country market (in respect of which I take judicial notice) which might well have meant that vendors would be susceptible to offers.  He may simply have thought that if properties such as the ones he had seen were available, others at a slightly cheaper price would always be found.  He may have had somewhere in the recesses of his mind the fact that W retained her contingent interest in her late father&#8217;s estate, although I accept that further funding from this source would have been inconsistent with his specific finding in relation to that interest and the moral obligation with which it was impressed.  He may simply have believed that, at the end of the day, fairness required an even-handed approach as between the parties and that needs, such as they were, would be satisfied on this basis. I agree with Mr Brooks that, if this was indeed his approach, his finding in relation to H&#8217;s mortgage capacity is curious in circumstances where it is left simply hanging in the air as a finding unrelated to need or the division of capital.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I do not place much weight on the fact that H was then living in rented accommodation in Dubai.  It seems to me that any outcome which deprived H of the means to acquire a home of his own in this jurisdiction close to his children for any longer than a very short period would have been at risk of a successful challenge on appeal.  Equally, I am concerned by W&#8217;s current proposal that she should receive 80% of the parties&#8217; free non-pension capital without any corresponding reservation of interest for H&#8217;s benefit in part of that award in circumstances where she was also to be in receipt of a joint lives (and substantial) maintenance order.  In similar terms, I am by no means persuaded that, even had he retained his position in Dubai with X CO (which I must assume he has), H would be in a position to secure a mortgage of &#163;340,000 simply on the basis of an assumed income of &#163;170,000 net.  Whilst the DDJ&#8217;s finding in relation to that capacity is not the subject of any challenge in these appeals, his treatment of that income as being disposable income in H&#8217;s hands has been the subject of my finding that he fell into error.</span></p>

In this respect, I have my doubts as to whether the mechanism of simply top-slicing the cost of servicing that mortgage from H&#8217;s disposable income is adequate recompense for H.  W&#8217;s equity investment would be growing in the property market in direct proportion to the 100% investment she had made, whereas H&#8217;s investment return would be significantly less to reflect his much lower equity investment.  Given my view about the affordability of pension contributions, Mr Brooks&#8217; submission as to W&#8217;s lack of opportunity to save does not provide a complete answer to this point.</span></p>

That said, he gave each what he plainly considered to be a fair share after a very long marriage to which each had made an equal contribution.  Can he be said to be wrong in dividing the limited assets which remained in that manner when, as he found, they had identical needs and requirements going forward ?  If the pot was indeed limited as he found it was, can it be said that an approach which provides each with an equal share of the capital to invest as they see fit has no realistic prospect of being upheld on appeal ?  Or, to put in in the language of the test set out in FPR 2010, r. 30.3(7), am I satisfied that W&#8217;s appeal on this ground has a real prospect of success ?</span></p>

I am persuaded in the end that the DDJ was justified in his refusal to sanction a departure from equality to the extent sought by W both at the original final hearing and in the context of the relief sought on this cross-appeal.  Whilst I accept that the sum with which each of the parties will be left will mean they have to recalibrate their expectations in terms of the standard of accommodation they can afford, I am not persuaded that I should allow the appeal to proceed in order that I should exercise a discretion of my own and substitute a different award from the one made by the DDJ.</span></p>

First, he considered there were insufficient assets to justify making an order for security.  Secondly, he found that such an order would operate unfairly against H given the findings which he had made in relation to W&#8217;s &#8216;conduct&#8217; case.  Mr Brooks&#8217; response to the latter is that W was not running &#8216;conduct&#8217; as the basis for an enhanced share of the assets but simply in relation to her application for security.  Even in that event, it is clear from the judgment at pages 16 to 18 that the DDJ found that each of the ten allegations did not amount to conduct which it would be inequitable to disregard.  He found specifically that this was not a conduct case and that it was to be regretted that she had not followed advice to the effect that H&#8217;s behaviour was unlikely to be taken into account by the court in these proceedings.</span></p>

If that conduct case was indeed limited to an evidential platform providing the basis of an application for security, that did not seem to have been clear to the DDJ.  No point seems to have been taken following the handing down of his written judgment in May this year.  Indeed, prior to her advertised Respondent&#8217;s Notice which was eventually issued in July, there was no indication that W intended to appeal the order about which I have been made aware.</span></p>

I am also aware of two separate applications which W launched for interim provision which she subsequently abandoned by consent.  The arrangements which existed prior to the March 2014 hearing were therefore informal voluntary arrangements put in place by the parties themselves.  Further, Mr Lyon tells me (and there is no challenge from Mr Brooks) that at no point in the course of these proceedings has there been a specific finding that the evidence which H has produced in relation to his financial affairs has been inaccurate or misleading.  This may well be so but it has to be balanced against the specific finding of the DDJ that what emerged from H&#8217;s evidence in relation to his employment prospects was &#8216;a picture of deliberate and wilful non-disclosure&#8217; :  para 42 of the judgment.   I do not intend to descend into the detail of the allegation and counter-allegation which was clearly ventilated during the course of the final hearing because I have formed a clear view in relation to this aspect of the cross-appeal.</span></p>
