The allocated social worker, Gideon Zeti, was in the building but was not present to observe contact. The parents spoke to the contact supervisor expressing concern about a mark on O&#8217;s forehead. The supervisor contacted the social worker who, after speaking to his manager, went to the contact room to look at O&#8217;s head. When he went into the contact room he was carrying his notebook and mobile phone. With the consent of the parents he tried to take a photograph of the marks which were causing the parents concern. He had to put down his notebook in order to take the photograph. When his investigation into this incident ended he forgot to pick up his notebook. He left the building to go to a meeting. It was not until the next morning that he realised what he had done. He informed his manager. </span></p>

The history given by father of O falling off the bed on to carpeted floor was inconsistent with the bilateral parietal skull fractures. To sustain bilateral skull fractures it would need a significant amount of force. A fall on one side of the head would not cause skull fracture on the opposite side. Although a call would involve more than one impact, the force on the second impact during a fall would not be enough to cause a skull fracture.</span></p>

The presence of a skull fracture is evidence that there has been an impact injury to the head of sufficient severity to lead to the fracture. The commonest type of skull fracture seen following accidental or nonaccidental impact head injury is a simple linear parietal skull fracture. More complex fractures such as those that are diastatic (widened) or depressed are seen more commonly in the context of non-accidental head injury but it does not follow that simple fractures are due to accidental mechanisms and more complex fractures non-accidental; the appearance of the fracture is more likely to depend on the degree of force causing it than whether it was accidental or non-accidental.</span></p>

Everyday clinical experience would however suggest that trivial head trauma is unlikely to lead to skull fractures. However, domestic type impact injuries, such as a possible fall from a bed as described, do sometimes result in skull fractures. My understanding of O&#8217;s developmental stage is such that he would not have been able to have manoeuvred himself into a position whereby he could have caused the fracture himself. It follows from the above therefore that the causative event is likely to have occurred whilst O was in the care of another individual.&#8217;</span></p>

In this case although there was some initial variation in the history offered (falling off the bed versus being dropped by the father) it was consistently stated that the child fell in the course of changing a nappy. The father stated on one occasion that he dropped the baby but at other times in his statement he said that the child who was on the edge of the bed fell to the floor when he bent down to get a nappy from the floor. The preponderance of literature on childhood falls indicate that short falls rarely result in serious or life-threatening head injuries despite their frequency. Each credible study supports the conclusion that severe head injuries reported to be accidental unless related to a moving vehicle accident or fall from a very significant height are very likely to be the result of abuse particularly if the injuries are ascribed to falls from short heights that occur at home unwitnessed by objective observers. However, fractures may rarely result from short falls onto carpeted floors.&#8217;</span></p>

If one accepts that the soft tissue swelling to the scalp was associated with the fractures this would suggest that the fractures are recent. Soft tissue scalp swelling associated with fractures usually occurs over a period of hours or days after the injury and resolves within around 7-10 days. Therefore in this case it is likely that the fractures occurred no more than around 10 days before presentation. However there is no scientific basis for dating fractures on the basis of scalp swelling and it is not possible to use this as an indicator as to whether the two fractures occurred simultaneously or at different times within the timeframe.&#8217;</span></p>
