By an application issued on 25 March 2024, the parents of Y, BT (&#8220;the father&#8221;) and WS (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) apply under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court for what they term an &#8220;order for voluntary return&#8221; in respect of Y. The application names the Social Administration of Linkoping, Sweden, as the respondent.  At a hearing on 11&#160;April 2024, I discharged the Social Administration of Linkoping as a respondent and listed the matter today for determination of jurisdiction. The matter now comes before the court for that issue to be considered. </p>

The baby&#8217;s father is a British national (Overseas) and has arrived in England and live in London. Our baby was refused birth registration by the Finnish authorities two years ago and encountered police violence.  We exhausted all legal remedies. Due to escaping mistreatment by the Finnish authorities, we went to Sweden, but recently social services took our baby away and denied our right to visit our baby. The Swedish authorities even denied the extended family to visit our baby and disallows us to employ a psychologist to investigate our baby&#8217;s situation. </p>

Regrettably, our daughter remains in Sweden and under the care of the Linkoping social authority. According to the Swedish Migration Board&#8217;s decision, we are not allowed to travel with our daughter, but we need to seek assistance from a local authority in England to make the arrangement to travel our daughter to England. We sought assistance from the relevant social authority.  However, they had concern over legal issues.  Therefore, we need a court order to enable the authority to enable our voluntary care.&#8221;  </p>

The Finnish Administrative Court of Turku and the Supreme Administrative Court declined to grant relief with respect of refusal of the Finnish authorities to register Y&#8217;s birth for want of jurisdiction.

The document exhibited to the report includes a statement, dated 6 February 2024 made by legal counsel to the Social Administration of Linkoping and directed to the Swedish Migration Authority. That statement, whilst recognising that the Social Administration of Linkoping does not have competence in matters properly within the remit of the Swedish Migration Agency, asserts that Y requires care-givers who consistently meet her needs. The Social Administration relates that its assessment is that Y requires a placement in a residential setting before transition to foster care. The Social Administration further asserts that there are considerable risks attendant on Y being further uprooted at this point, given her presentation and emotional needs.  </p>

The Position Statement appears to suggest that the parents informed the local authority that Y&#8217;s sibling had died from a &#8220;congenital infection&#8221;. It would also appear that the parents informed the local authority that examination of the deceased child did not raise any concerns regarding the child being harmed in any way by the parents, with no concerns around physical abuse, and that it was not felt by the authorities that the child died because of parental abuse or neglect.

When the court indicated to the parents during the hearing that it did not consider that it had the power to order a local authority to return a child from a foreign jurisdiction and take a child into care, or to order ICACU to effect the return of a child to this jurisdiction, the father submitted that the court should order the summary return of Y to the care of the parents.

In <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">and another (Children: Habitual Residence)(Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and others intervening)</span> the Supreme Court made clear in a case concerning Council Regulation EC 2022/2003, but equally applicable to cases concerning the 1996 Hague Convention, as follows: </p>

Whilst it would not be appropriate for this court to make findings in respect of the matters set out in the Art 32 report provided in respect of the standards of the parents&#8217; care of Y, it is at least apparent that both the Finnish and Swedish authorities held grave concerns regarding the parents&#8217; care, the former considering that the parents were responsible for the death of Y&#8217;s sibling in Finland.  It is further important to note that, notwithstanding the duty of candour falling on litigants who seek relief from this court on a without notice basis, these matters were not dealt with in the statement of evidence provided to this court by the father.  Against these matters and, again, whilst not a matter on which this court can pass comment, notwithstanding the representations of the Social Administration of Linkoping it would appear that the Swedish Migration Board has made the decision to deport Y to another country that will receive her, with a condition that she should not travel with her parents under any circumstances.  It would therefore appear that, as matters stand and as far as the Swedish authorities are concerned, Y is neither able to return to the care of her parents or to remain in the jurisdiction of Sweden, albeit the father informed the court during his oral submissions that Y does have a lawyer acting on her behalf in Sweden. </p>

Y is not at present in this jurisdiction and has never been present in this jurisdiction. Whilst the parents submit that the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A and another (Children: Habitual Residence)(Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and others intervening) </span>is authority for the proposition that a child can be habitually resident in a country without ever having been in that country, that point was, in fact, left undecided in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>. The decision of the court in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> was that jurisdiction could be exercised in that case on the basis of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court if the child was a British national, whilst the question of whether presence was a necessary precursor to habitual residence was left open. In any event, even if it might be possible in certain circumstances for a child to be habitually resident in a place he or she has never been, whether that is the position in an individual case remains a question of fact to be determined on all the circumstances of the particular case. </p>

Whilst in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> Lord  Hughes stated at [92] that &#8220;If current physical presence is not essential, then so also can habitual residence exist without any physical presence yet having occurred, at least if it has only been prevented by some kind of unexpected force majeure&#8221;,  this is not a case in which Y&#8217;s presence in this jurisdiction has been prevented by extraordinary circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the parents.   Rather, on the evidence currently before the court, Y was prevented from being present with her parents in this jurisdiction by reason of her birth not being able to be registered in Finland, meaning she could not secure travel documents, and by her being removed from the care of the parents by the child protection authorities in Sweden due to allegations of parental neglect and concerns regarding the risk presented to Y by the parents&#8217; previous neglect of a sibling, who allegedly died as a result of that neglect. Those matters do not constitute extraordinary circumstances beyond the parents&#8217; control but, rather, circumstances that, on the face of it, derive from the parents&#8217; own actions.</p>

Rather, Y now shares a social and family environment, for the time being, with her current carers in Sweden.  In the circumstances, even if the social and family integration of the parents in this jurisdiction could be described as habitual since 12 March 2024 having regard to their particular circumstances, the question of<span style="font-style:italic"> Y&#8217;s</span> habitual residence is no longer totally dependent on her parents and their social and family integration in this jurisdiction. </p>

Whilst the parents dispute this, there is no evidence before the court that, as the parents would have it, Y is being &#8220;tortured&#8221; in care in Sweden.  In these circumstances, in addition to not being present in this country and having never been here, Y has no practical connection with this jurisdiction. Y is not a British national. The court has been provided with no evidence that Y has family and social relationships in this jurisdiction beyond those with her parents.  It is also not clear whether Y&#8217;s possessions have been transported to this jurisdiction and there is no evidence that Y currently has a right of abode in this jurisdiction, albeit the parents contend that Y is entitled to a British National (Overseas) visa to enable her to enter the United Kingdom. As matters stand, Y has no durable ties with the jurisdiction of England and Wales. </p>

Rather, I must and do conclude on the evidence that Y is not habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. As I have noted, on the evidence before the court it is not open to the parents to pursue either of two alternate bases for jurisdiction in circumstances where Y is neither present in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, nor a British citizen.

It is well-established that this court has no power to compel a local authority to take a child into care. I am equally satisfied that this court has no power to compel a local authority to take steps to recover a child from a foreign jurisdiction. The same applies with respect to ICACU. Whilst the parents moderated their case with respect to the order they seek, settling on a conventional return order made under the inherent jurisdiction, they were not able to specify against whom such an order should be made. In any event, even were the court to be able to overcome the significant forensic hurdles to concluding that such an order would be in Y&#8217;s best interests in the circumstances described in this judgment, for the reasons I have given I am satisfied that the court does not have jurisdiction to make such an order in circumstances where Y is not habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England Wales. </p>
