When DG was admitted to hospital in September 2013, it was impossible to leave his wife, FG, in the flat on her own, so David and Barry, with the agreement of Surrey Social Services and her General Practitioner, arranged for her to be admitted to a residential home for respite care. They never consulted Peter, and they used the excuse that they were taking her to the care home for a cup of tea, and simply left her or &#8216;dumped&#8217; her there, as Peter likes to put it.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8220;The applicants have followed the local authority&#8217;s advice and so believe it is in DG&#8217;s best interests for him to remain at [the residential care home]. He clearly lacks capacity to deal with his property and affairs and requires a deputy. The applicants have been assisting and supporting DG with his general care and finances for many years now and they see this as a natural extension of the support they have been providing.</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The respondent&#8217;s objections stem largely from concerns he raises that his brothers have not informed him about certain decisions and have not always shared information and documentation with him. The applicants accept with hindsight that they should have kept their brother better informed. However, it is clear that the applicants care deeply for DG (as indeed the respondent does), have devoted a huge amount of time and energy to supporting and caring for him, and have always tried to do what is in his best interests. The court can be satisfied that they will continue to act in this way. They have certainly not demonstrated the &#8216;dismissive attitude&#8217; towards their father that the respondent makes reference to. It is all too easy to criticise people in the applicants&#8217; position at arm&#8217;s length but they have had to make very difficult decisions about the care of their parents.</span></p>

It is not a criticism of him, but the geographical distance simply makes him a less suitable choice of deputy than the applicants.</span></p>

A relative will usually be familiar with P&#8217;s affairs, and his wishes and his ways of communicating his likes and dislikes. Someone who already has a close personal knowledge of P is also likely to be better able to meet the obligation of a deputy to consult with him, and to permit and encourage him to participate, or to improve his ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act done for him and any decision affecting him.
