It seems to me logically that if there is consent, then there is no breach of rights of custody and Article 3 is accordingly not engaged.  And yet, Article 13 appears to make provision exactly for that, on the assumption that Article 3 has been engaged and Article 12 requires a return.  These difficulties are addressed by Wilson LJ as he then was, in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Re P-J</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> with the very firm advice that the court should not trouble itself with this unresolved conundrum, but should simply focus on Article 13(a) which is sufficient to dispose of issues of consent in these cases.

I have come in the end to the conclusion that the evidence establishes that the father did indeed consent to the mother removing B to England and Wales in March 2011.  That conclusion is underpinned by a number of matters in the context of the case.  First, the fact that they were negotiating for a permanent separation, even if either or both of them retained the hope that it might not be so, because it is manifest that each has had, and probably still does have, some strong feelings for the other.  Secondly, it has to be seen in the context of the role of the mother in relation to B in the course of B&#8217;s life and the fact that when the mother left on a previous occasion, B went with her.  Thirdly, it also has to be seen in the context of the clear agreement that the father was going to remain in Belgium and the mother was going to be in England and Wales.&#8221;</span></p>

Having regard to the commencement by the father of an application for a residence order, and having regard to the content of that application, as referred to earlier in this judgment, I am satisfied that the father has expressly accepted, in an unequivocal manner, the jurisdiction of these courts.
