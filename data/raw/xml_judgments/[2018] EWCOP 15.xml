She refused to use the commode that was provided for her; she was unable to access the porch in her wheelchair; and she had difficulty in keeping the dog mess that at times pervaded the property out of the kitchen area.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There have been a series of assessments over the course of the past nine months.  They are set out at paragraphs 29 onwards of the position statement filed on behalf of the Official Solicitor.  I do not consider that I gain very much from the assessments made before September 2017.  I think it fair to say that the thrust of the assessments prior to September 2017 was that the professionals considered that CDM had capacity but that from September 2017 the broad consensus was a conclusion that CDM had a lack of capacity preventing her from using and weighing relevant information. At times the underlying diagnoses have differed as have some of the conclusions as to the extent of the lack of capacity.</p>

The last of these was on 10 April 2018 when CDM was in CC care home.  However, the records show clearly that the ambulance service had in mind that she was being visited often by district nurses and carers, or was already in a care home, and that she would within a matter of hours be seen again.  The ambulance crew could thus be satisfied that they were not leaving CDM unattended for any length of time. </p>

In particular she is so determined that she has to be at home with her pets at all costs that she simply cannot contemplate or think about the risks attached to her decision.

		<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fluctuating capacity raises particular problems.  There are a number of options open to the court including refraining from making any declarations at all and instead providing a plan to determine CDM&#8217;s capacity from time to time.  My view is that if I find that there is a fluctuating capacity, it is my duty to declare that is the case.  I set out my findings in that regard below.  I accept that this may cause complications until such time as a framework is established so that the loss of capacity can be recognised and calibrated as and when it occurs.  That may require further evidence and consideration at another hearing. </p>

But management of her diabetes is a different matter. It covers a wide range of different situations which may arise frequently or infrequently.  The treatment required may be of very different natures.  I cannot see that this particular form of fluctuating capacity can properly be managed other than by a decision being taken at the time that the issue arises. </p>

		  <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I accept that many people may have an emotional and unwise reaction to the suggestion that they should leave their home without there being any mental impairment.  It can be a deeply emotive issue.  But, that does not mean that an analysis of the merits of the decision by the individual in question is an irrelevant or unnecessary step.   This is all the more important when her situation at home can be so extreme in terms of the condition of the home and her life there and her inability to effect or accept change.</p>

This is not weighing up or using information about risk but ignoring it. I do not accept that she has determined that as carers call several times a day the risks are insignificant.  She simply cannot envisage any alternative to being at home. </p>

		  <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Treatment in the context of this case relates to ability to manage her diabetes and in particular (a) the ability to manage and control her blood sugar level and (b) the willingness to accept treatment when required.  At times she is willing to accept treatment and at other times she ignores the advice of experienced and well-meaning professionals.  I agree with Dr Series, as opposed to Ms S, that CDM has a fluctuating capacity.</p>

At 10.1.4 and 11.1.2 he explains that her personality disorder aggravates her diabetes because it leads her to poor diabetic control and to the making of unwise decisions about her treatment and an inability to cooperate with professionals about her treatment.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Property and affairs:  I am troubled by the lack of evidence on this issue.  Dr Series describes how CDM was able to give him a general description of her income and expenditure and that she appeared to be able to understand normal banking practice.  True it is that on one occasion a neighbour to whom she had given her bank card removed a large amount of money from her account without her authority.  Her revelation of her pin number to an untrustworthy neighbour is worrying but I do not think that is sufficient basis for me to say that she lacks capacity to deal with this issue.  The care home permits her to keep her bank card and manage her own money. Dr Series advises that her personality disorder may lead CDM on occasions to reject advice on financial matters or make her unable to weigh the relevant information. I do not think I have any satisfactory evidence on which I can conclude that she lacks capacity in this area.</p>

This decision is intimately bound up with her ability to make decisions about residence. I do not know what the long-term future will be for CDM but for as long as she is the tenant, she will have an obligation to pay the rent on the property. So emotionally attached is she to the property that I cannot see circumstances in which she could contemplate surrendering the tenancy however obviously sensible that might be.</p>
