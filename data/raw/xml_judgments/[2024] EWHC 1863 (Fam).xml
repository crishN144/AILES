	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the risk of stating the obvious, in proceedings brought pursuant to the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 for a summary return order under the 1980 Hague Convention, it is important not to lose sight of the child, in this case, a seven year old boy, whom I shall refer to as &#8216;P'. He is described as a confident, bright, young boy who has become anxious, and in my view, has undoubtedly suffered as a result of the dispute between his parents and extended family, leaving him insecure and unsure about his future. The acrimonious dispute between his parents is the subject of ongoing litigation in Italy. This case is a salutary reminder that the child should always remain at the heart of the proceedings and a swift resolution of all litigation is imperative for P&#8217;s welfare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application dated 23 May 2024, was brought by the applicant, the Social Services of Naples, (essentially the local authority) for the summary return of P. The applicant asserts that P has been wrongfully removed by the father (&#8220;F&#8221;), in breach of its rights of custody, which it acquired following the order of the Court of Naples North, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Civil Division, dated 14 July 2023. That order placed P in the care of the applicant, suspending parental responsibility of each parent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I had been provided with a hearing bundle, along with a detailed position statement filed on behalf of the applicant. On the evening of 15 July at 18.23, a further bundle of over 100 pages was lodged with the court. Neither I nor Mr Little had seen this bundle until it was forwarded to me shortly before the parties came into court. Mr Roy sought the court's permission to rely on this additional bundle, which contained a lengthy fourth statement from F as well as documents relating to the Italian proceedings. He also requested further time to take instructions from F. I allowed Mr Roy extra time to firm up his instructions, as there was no position statement filed on behalf of F and it was not entirely clear what F's final position would be.</p>

Whilst these documents should have been filed with the permission of the court at a much earlier stage, they were relevant (if repetitious in parts), no prejudice arose from the late disclosure (given Mr Little's stance), and I had sufficient time to consider them in full. </p>

That object is negated in a case such as this where the application is not determined by the requested State until the child has been here for more than three years.&#8221;</span></p>
