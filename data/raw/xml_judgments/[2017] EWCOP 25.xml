JT is supported in the community by a community psychiatric nurse.  She was initially referred to the Trust breast care services by her General Practitioner in February 2017.  She cancelled three consultant appointments offered to her.  In June she was the subject of an urgent referral to the breast services by the GP.

It was agreed JT had a malignant tumour.  On 21 June 2017 she attended an appointment with the locum consultant surgeon, accompanied by her brother, when she was prescribed a course of Anastrozole.  This medication could result in a slight shrinkage of the size of the cancer over a period of time.  Subsequently her brother notified the breast team that JT refused to take the medication.  Mr Marla saw JT with her brother on 26 July 2017.  By this time he had received a letter from Dr Hussain formally raising, for the first time with the breast care team, the issue of JT&#8217;s capacity to consent to medical treatment.  Mr Marla therefore undertook a detailed consultation and an in-depth review of her understanding of her medical condition.</span></p>

After discussion with JT&#8217;s psychiatric team, Dr Marla decided to convene a best interests meeting on 18 September 2017.  A plan was made to review JT at an outpatient clinic on 28 September 2017 to discuss the next steps with her, including making the application to this Court.  JT declined to attend.  However, a breast care nurse telephoned JT later that day.  JT said she would have the operation, but only privately, because she had been messed around by the Trust, which was not a real hospital, and further she did not accept that she had cancer and asserted that (i) her brother had told her that the lump was in fact  a control box that is inside her and (ii) that her brother was not her real brother.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;It is my view that JT meets the diagnostic test set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the NCA because there is a disturbance in the functioning of her mind and brain.  She has active symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia  -  a mental disorder that she has fixed delusional beliefs, which are persecutory in nature and she has a complete lack of insight into her psychiatric and physical condition.  When I reviewed JT in my clinic on 13 July 2017 my opinion is that she was not able to understand the relevant information regarding her cancer diagnosis.  Her understanding is that she does not suffer from breast cancer, and it is a conspiracy on the part of her enemies to pretend that she had the illness, so they can enforce some procedure or treatment on her of their own making.  She believes she had been taken to a fake hospital by a fake impostor brother who was seen by fake doctors and this is all part of a conspiracy.  She refused to accept any medication  for surgical treatment.  Her ability to weigh up information relating to her decision is impaired.  She cannot perceive there to be any benefits from the proposed surgery and as a result of her delusional beliefs described above, she has underplayed the risks, as her belief is firmly that she does not have any cancer.  On this basis I believe that she needs a functional test under Section 3 of the NCA.  She cannot weigh or understand or weigh the risk of not having the cancer treated or removed.  While she is able to communicate her thoughts back to the treated team, and is able to communicate that she does not want the operation,  I understand she prefers not to turn up to appointments instead.  She is not able to provide an explanation as to why she does not want the operation, although I understand from the treating team she said she would like to receive private treatment elsewhere and then does not&#8217;.</span></p>

In my dealings with her over the years she has never required restraint, and I believe once you make the legal requirement of co-operation, i.e. the Court makes a decision that is in her best interests to treat her, then she is likely to comply with the procedure, despite believing it to be part of a conspiracy.  Restraint is required to sedate her in order to get her to hospital for subsequent surgical procedure.  I believe the impact and distress is likely to be short lived.  In the longer term I believe this course of events, restraint, is likely to be included in her existing delusional beliefs, but her distress would not be any more than it would be if she did not have paranoid schizophrenia&#8217;.</span></p>

She was convinced she had been seen by actors on her last two visits and wanted a test to prove that she had a cancerous lump in her breast to be repeated.   She agreed to be examined by me.  I could feel an approximately 3cm hard lump in her left breast involving skin.  JT was convinced that the lump I was feeling was a cyst in her breast.  I took her to a mirror and showed her the skin changes and got her to feel how hard the lump was.  I then showed her the ultrasound images at the imaging port, her biopsy result stating that it was an invasive cancer.  She agreed with me but wanted the tests repeated again.  She was happy to come back for a repeat ultrasound scan to reassure her.  At this point I formed the opinion that she lacked capacity due to her psychiatric condition.  She openly explained to me that she had been seen by actors on her previous visit and this was not a hospital.  She also mentioned that people caring for her health and psychiatric problem, which she did not believe she had, was poisoning her with drugs&#8217;.</span></p>

JT accepted some of the information I gave her at an intellectual level i.e. that there is a lump in her breast.  However, she misbelieves the diagnosis and subsequently does not think she requires any treatment.  I do not believe JT can understand the information provided to her relevant to risks and benefits of not removing the cancer.  I believe she is able to retain some of the information discussed but cannot weigh that information as part of a decision making process and therefore I am of the opinion that she lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the treatment.  She is unable to fulfil the functional tests under section 3 of the NCA.  When I discussed the implications of not having treatment, JT does not appear to be able to communicate her reasons for refusing, although she is able to communicate her decisions back to me.  Her response appears to be an initial agreement, then declining to come in to hospital&#8217;.</span></p>

It is important to note that tumour cells can over a number of months or years, escape the effects of the anti- hormonal medication and the cancer can start to regrow.  Risks include side effects of the tablets, depending on the type of anti-hormonal medication.  This can include deep vein thrombosis, cancer in the womb, joint pains from vein filling, causing osteoporosis and fractures&#8217;.</span></p>

Risks include requiring further surgery, the margins of the first specimen are [inaudible] this happens in one out of six cases.
