	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application to revoke an adoption order in respect of two children, X and Y, aged 17 and 16 respectively. The application is made by their adoptive mother, AM.  I note that both girls have been assessed as being Gillick competent, and were represented separately from the Guardian. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue in the case is whether I should accede to AM&#8217;s application to revoke the adoption orders. That in turn raises two sub-issues; whether I have power to revoke in these circumstances, and if I do have the power, whether I should choose to exercise it in respect of one or both children. The primary argument put forward by Mr Day is that there is a power to revoke under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, but in the alternative, he submits that there is a power to revoke an adoption order in s.31F(6) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (&#8220;MFPA&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X and Y were placed for adoption at the conclusion of public law proceedings in 2010.  Care orders and placement orders were made on 12 August 2010 and both children were placed with AM on 6 August 2012 when X and Y were just over 5 and 4 years old respectively. It is relevant that the children had spent a prolonged period in foster care, in at least two placements, during which they had significant contact with their birth mother, BM. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AM&#8217;s statement in support of her application discloses a picture in which both children struggled with being in an adopted placement, with them having little understanding as to why they could not spend time with their birth family. AM describes difficulties with managing the children&#8217;s behaviour from a very early stage of the placement. AM decided that the children should spend time with their birth mother, BM, and extended birth family, following a programme of Therapeutic Life Story Work.  This unusual situation resulted in the girls calling BM &#8220;mummy B&#8221; and AM being called &#8220;mummy&#8221; or &#8220;mum.&#8221;  AM states that from this point on, X felt more settled in her care and it &#8220;felt like she was finding the missing pieces of who she was.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AM says that in the period between 2017-2019 X was saying she wanted to live with BM, although Y was clear she wanted to remain with AM. Therefore, from quite an early stage there has been a difference in the position of the girls in this regard. </p>

Z returned to live with BM in September 2015.  BM then had two more children, with a different father, who have lived with her throughout. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During 2020 AM allowed BM and her youngest children to move in with her and the girls during lockdown, to escape an abusive relationship. In June 2021, the relationship between AM and BM broke down.  In July 2021 Y alleged that AM had hit her with an iPad.  According to AM, Y &#8220;clearly felt being back with her birth family would be helpful and has continued to state she no-longer wants a relationship with me.&#8221;</p>

Y made allegations of physical and emotional abuse against AM.  At that point both children said they wanted to live with BM. A parenting assessment undertaken by the LA recommended the children stay with BM.</p>

The LA sought supervision orders and invited the court to grant child arrangements orders in respect of both girls, presumably to regulate their existing placements with their birth mother and father respectively. This would provide parental responsibility to their caregivers, it not in effect being exercised by AM. </p>

The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person.

(R.) (An Infant) [1970] 1 Q.B. 385, In re R.A. (Minors) (1974) 4 Fam. Law 182 and In re F. (Infants) (Adoption Order: Validity) [1977] Fam. 165. Those cases concern a failure to effect proper service of the adoption proceedings on a natural parent or ignorance of the parent of the existence of the adoption proceedings. In each case the application to set aside the order was made reasonably expeditiously. It is fundamental to the making of an adoption order that the natural parent should be informed of the application so that she can give or withhold her consent. If she has no knowledge at all of the application then, obviously, a fundamental injustice is perpetrated. I would prefer myself to regard those cases not as cases where the order has been set aside by reason of a procedural irregularity, although that has certainly occurred, but as cases where natural justice has been denied because the natural parent who may wish to challenge the adoption has never been told that it is going to happen. Whether an adoption order can be set aside by reason of fraud which is unrelated to a natural parent's ignorance of the proceedings was not a subject which was relevant to the present appeal...As the case law stood, certainly in 1976, the powers of the court to set aside an adoption order as known to Parliament would, in my view, have been limited to the power to set aside such an order on the basis of a breach of natural justice such as I have described above, and not an inherent power to set aside an adoption order by reason of a mistake or misrepresentation."</span></p>

Nor in these cases is there any consideration of the use of the inherent jurisdiction in the context of a statutory scheme, which gives a very limited power to revoke. However, these cases are in the Court of Appeal and therefore binding upon me, and there is no argument in this case as to there having been a substantial miscarriage of justice, so the ground for revocation accepted by the Court of Appeal does not arise in the present case. </p>

For present purposes it is enough to draw attention to a few key propositions: (i) Under the inherent jurisdiction, the High Court can, in an appropriate case, revoke an adoption order. In relation to this jurisdictional issue I unhesitatingly prefer the view shared by Bodey J in In re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order), para 6, and Pauffley J in PK v K, para 4, to the contrary view of Parker J in In re PW (Adoption), para 1. (ii) The effect of revoking an adoption order is to restore the status quo ante: see In re W (Adoption Order: Set Aside and Leave to Oppose), paras 11&#8211;12. (iii) However, "The law sets a very high bar against any challenge to an adoption order. An adoption order once lawfully and properly made can be set aside 'only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances'": In re C (A Child) (Adoption: Placement Order), para 44, quoting Webster v Norfolk County Council, para 149. As Pauffley J said in PK v K, para 14: "public policy considerations ordinarily militate against revoking properly made adoption orders and rightly so." (iv) An adoption order regularly made, that is, an adoption order made in circumstances where there was no procedural irregularity, no breach of natural justice and no fraud, cannot be set aside either on the ground of mere mistake (In re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside)) or even if there has been a miscarriage of justice (Webster v Norfolk County Council). (v) The fact that the circumstances are highly exceptional does not of itself justify revoking an adoption order. After all, one would hope that the kind of miscarriage of justice exemplified by Webster v Norfolk County Council is highly exceptional, yet the attempt to have the adoption order set aside in that case failed."</span></p>

Once an adoption order has been made the adopted child ceases to be the child of his previous parent and becomes the child for all purposes of the adopters as though he were their legitimate child. </span></p>

The position could not be set out more clearly. The court's discretion under the inherent jurisdiction to revoke a lawfully made adoption order is severely curtailed and can only be exercised in 'highly exceptional and very particular circumstances'. The permanent and lifelong nature of adoption orders and the very powerful public policy reasons, as articulated in the cases, underpin this rationale. The cases, Webster included, have given examples of when, on the very particular facts of the case, the discretion has and has not been exercised. Obviously, each case is highly fact dependent. In my judgment, there is no exhaustive category of cases where the court may exercise its discretion, although Webster and other cases make it clear the very steep hill that has to be climbed and why.</span></p>

It is not necessary for me to determine whether welfare in the exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction should specifically be guided by the statutory framework for welfare as set out in s 1 ACA 2002, although I agree with the submissions that it should not be inconsistent with it.&#8221;</span></p>

The question is always whether the eviction is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Where a person has no right in domestic law to remain in occupation of his home, the proportionality of making an order for possession at the suit of the local authority will be supported not merely by the fact that it would serve to vindicate the authority's ownership rights. It will also, at least normally, be supported by the fact that it would enable the authority to comply with its duties in relation to the distribution and management of its housing stock, including, for example, the fair allocation of its housing, the redevelopment of the site, the refurbishing of sub-standard accommodation, the need to move people who are in accommodation that now exceeds their needs, and the need to move vulnerable people into sheltered or warden-assisted housing. Furthermore, in many cases (such as this appeal) other cogent reasons, such as the need to remove a source of nuisance to neighbours, may support the proportionality of dispossessing the occupiers.&#8221;</span></p>

Counsel remind me of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR's famous description (In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1, 13) of the common law &#8211; here, the inherent jurisdiction &#8211; as the "great safety net which lies behind all statute law, and is capable of filling gaps left by that law, if and insofar as those gaps have to be filled in the interests of society as a whole." But the choice of metaphor is revealing: the inherent jurisdiction is a safety net, not a springboard. And Lord Donaldson would have been the first to acknowledge that the inherent jurisdiction, whatever its theoretical reach, is, in settled practice, recognised as being subject to limitations on what the court can and should do. For an example, see his observations in In re R (A Minor) (Wardship: Criminal Proceedings) [1991] Fam 56.</span></p>

Between them, the 1973 Act and the 1989 Act provide a comprehensive statutory scheme dealing, along with much else, with the circumstances in which a child, including, as here, an adult child, can make a financial claim against a living parent (I put the point this way to make clear that I have not overlooked section 1(1)(c) of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975). More specifically, the legislation, in its general reach, applies to the applicant, as to every adult child, and is comprehensive in relation to cases falling within its ambit. Furthermore, as Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney point out, the legislation deals explicitly with the very claims the applicant seeks to make; indeed, in the case of the 1989 Act it explicitly prohibits the claim he seeks to pursue. There is accordingly, in my judgment, no scope for recourse to the inherent jurisdiction. To exercise the inherent jurisdiction in these circumstances would simply be to do what Lieven J has rightly said is impermissible.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal has accepted a power to revoke under the inherent jurisdiction in cases where there has been a &#8220;fundamental procedural irregularity&#8221;, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Webster</span>. It is not entirely clear why those are not cases where an appeal against the order could not have been allowed out of time, on the grounds of breach of natural justice. On one analysis the orders were never validly made because of procedural error and therefore are either void or voidable. Revocation is one legal mechanism to achieve this result. If the order is void in public law terms, then there would have to be some legal mechanism to set it aside.   In any event, the caselaw is binding upon me, and there is therefore undoubtedly a category of case where the power to revoke or set aside an adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction exists. </p>

They do not relate to the validity of the adoption orders when made, but are based on a subsequent change of circumstances, namely the breakdown of the adoption. The application is made solely on welfare grounds, and not on any procedural irregularity, and therefore falls outside the scope of any of the binding Court of Appeal authorities. </p>

It is very tempting to use the inherent jurisdiction in this case because it is almost certainly in Y&#8217; best interests to revoke the adoption order, although I am less sure about X. However, if there is no power to do so, the issue of best interests does not arise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from the caselaw cited above that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be used where there is a statutory scheme which covers the same ground, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">FS v AM</span>, but fundamentally going back to the principle set out in in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">De Keyser Royal Hotels</span>.  That cannot mean that there has to be a statutory provision that covers precisely the same issue, or there would never be a need to use the inherent jurisdiction. The point of the cases referred to is that where Parliament has created a comprehensive scheme, then the Courts cannot use the inherent jurisdiction to add provisions which &#8220;cut across&#8221; that scheme. The words &#8220;cut across&#8221; come from Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span>, where he was dissenting, but the point he was making there is not itself controversial. Effectively the same point is made by Sir John Dyson YC in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">CPAG</span> when he says that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be used when it would be &#8220;incompatible with&#8221; the statutory scheme. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case the ACA is a comprehensive scheme, which covers the entire process of legal adoption. Critically in my view, it expressly deals with revocation of adoption orders, but only in a very limited category of case, that of legitimation.  This must have been a deliberate choice by Parliament and fits with the overall scheme of adoption being a lifelong status. The entire tenor of the statute, and the &#8220;mischief&#8221;, or to put it another way, the fundamental philosophy, of the ACA is that it creates a permanent and irrevocable change of legal status for both adoptive parent and child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I am very conscious that at least three judges in the High Court have found a power to revoke an adoption order on welfare grounds.  However, in none of those cases was the caselaw on the limitations to the use of the inherent jurisdiction cited in the judgments. There was no consideration on the restrictions on the use of the inherent jurisdiction described by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">FS v AM</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In each of those cases the judges referred to the power to revoke on welfare grounds only being used in exceptional cases. It might be argued that it is appropriate to use the inherent jurisdiction in something that is truly an exceptional case, because Parliament cannot have been expected to contemplate such a situation arising, and therefore in a sense it falls outside the statutory scheme. However, in my view such an argument would be wrong. Firstly, as I have set out above, the prospect of an adoption breaking down and it being in the welfare interests of the child for the order to be revoked, is something that would have been well within the contemplation of Parliament. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it is not clear to me how truly exceptional the situation that arises in the present case actually is. The Court ordered the parties to investigate the evidence on the breakdown of adoption placements. However, producing a solid statistical basis has proved impossible. The only statistics produced have a figure of 4-9% of adoptions breaking down, although it is not clear precisely what that means. In any event, this figure suggests that adoption breakdown is far from being an exceptional situation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, such failed adoptions have probably become more common with somewhat older children being adopted, and with social media making it much easier for children and their birth parents being able to trace each other. This will be particularly the case where the children are old enough to remember their birth parents when they are adopted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is submitted in this case that the exceptional circumstance is that it is the adoptive parent who is seeking to revoke the adoption orders. I accept that this is likely to be unusual, but the principle of whether the court has the power to revoke an order on welfare grounds cannot depend on the nature of the applicant. It might well be the case that in circumstances where the children were the applicant, an adoptive parent would agree to the revocation if they thought it was in the children&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can deal much more swiftly with the submission that s.31F(6) of the MFPA gives a power to revoke an adoption order. This has been a controversial provision, where the breadth of the language used has led to considerable litigation and uncertainty over the scope of the power and whether it applies to final orders, see Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">CB v EB</span> 2020 EWFC 35; MacDonald J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">N v J</span> [2018] 1 FLR 140 and Cobb J <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A &amp; B (Recission of Orders)</span> [2021] EWFC 76.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I have no doubt that s.31F(6) was never intended to apply to the revocation of adoption orders under the ACA. Although the language is unconstrained, so on a pure linguistic approach it could apply to such orders, there is nothing in the terms of the amendments to the MFPA that suggest it was intended to apply to such orders. It would have been little short of extraordinary for Parliament to have introduced a power to revoke adoption orders, with no limitations or process, without including any further provisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A broad and unfettered power to revoke pursuant to s.31F(6) would be obviously contrary to the public policy considerations in respect of the finality of adoption orders, that are referred to in the caselaw set out above. Such a significant change to the statutory scheme for adoption would surely have included discussion papers and a broader public debate, none of which happened.</p>

This has been her position consistently for a long period. The position is less clear cut in respect of X. I do not intend to carry out a detailed analysis of her welfare interests given that I have found I have no power to revoke. There may be strong grounds for Parliament to create a power to revoke adoption orders in very particular circumstances, but that does not change the important constraints on the use of the inherent jurisdiction. </p>
