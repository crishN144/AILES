This has been a difficult hearing for all concerned. It has inevitably involved consideration of a great deal of highly specialised and technical medical and clinical evidence.  It may have seemed to those who love this child and who sat through that difficult and often very distressing evidence that we in this court room may occasionally have lost sight of the fact that it is all about him. I repeat here what I said to his parents at the start of the case. Even if it may sometimes seem so, no one has lost sight of that. I have held in my mind throughout this hearing that right at the centre of everything is their child.</span></p>

He is firmly of the view that there is still hope of his recovery even and although that may be a long and drawn-out process and that therefore treatment should continue. A component of his thinking though not advanced as the headline point of his position is his own Roman Catholic faith and his belief that life &#8211; and so here C&#8217;s life &#8211; is sacred. His primary position is that I should make a declaration that it is in C&#8217;s interests to continue to receive life sustaining treatment. His secondary position is that I should adjourn before reaching a final conclusion and permit him to obtain expert evidence in the form of independent second opinion report(s). </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">So it is that the matter comes before the court. An application was not made until January 2023 because it had been hoped it could be avoided. There have been discussions and meetings at which those who treat C, his parents and wider family have sought to reach agreement about whether it is in his interests to continue to receive ventilation. The Trust&#8217;s ethics committee has met and given its own conclusion. Best interest meetings and reviews have been held.  In respect of one discipline second opinions have been sought by the hospital to feed into that process. Since in the absence of consensus an application has been made to the court it must be determined. In making the determination I hold in my mind that the power of the court is to decide whether the course proposed is lawful or whether it is unlawful. Specifically, since during the course of the hearing the parents have each made references to what &#8216;anyone&#8217; would want for themselves or their child, I make it explicit that I have not allowed to infect my thinking consideration of what I might wish were I, or someone I cared about, in C&#8217;s position. The question which I must decide is what is in C&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

Another unusual feature of it is that the dispute is not between the medical profession on one side and the parents on the other; or even the result of differing conclusions reached by clinicians but arises essentially between his parents. C's mother is supportive &#8211; in a positively active sense rather than weary resignation &#8211; of the approach invited by the Trust and the Guardian. C&#8217;s father is passionately and strongly opposed to it. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In February 2022, C who was then 13   fell ill.    He had recently recovered from Covid 19 which he had had the previous month and had made him feel unwell but which he did not seem to have had terribly seriously and apart from that he had previously been in robust good health.  C developed a rash at the end of February and was taken to his local hospital on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000">  February. The rash got worse, and he went back the next day. He was admitted and the working diagnosis was Steven-Johnson Syndrome and later there was a working diagnosis of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TENS). These are both autoimmune response conditions which manifest themselves as blistering and degradation of the surface of the skin. The distinction that tips broadly similar symptoms from one diagnosis to another is one of degree. Where up to 30% of the skin is affected, it is characterised as Steven-Johnson Syndrome. Where is exceeds 30% it meets the definition for TENS. It is an incredibly painful condition; such that dressings applied to the skin sometimes must be changed under anaesthetic. That has been the case here. In C&#8217;s case 90 % of his body was affected. He was transferred for admission to a major teaching hospital. The working diagnosis of TENS was confirmed by skin biopsy. Those who have been responsible for his care are confident in the diagnosis but remain uncertain of the precipitating cause. It is thought most likely either that it is linked to his infection with Covid 19 or that is linked to a reaction to ibuprofen. Following his transfer, he was, on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> March, ventilated. That is to say reliant on mechanical means to maintain his breathing. He has remained ventilated throughout the period save for two occasions when attempts have been made to extubate him. Neither has been tolerable and he had to be reintubated. </span></p>

Those with TENS are therefore vulnerable to infection &#8211;notably sepsis.  On 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> March C had an episode of septicaemia. His temperature reached 43 degrees centigrade, and he was established on a renal support machine. He had overt multiorgan system failure. Three days later C developed low blood pressure and experienced major bleeding from many sites including his mouth. An MRI scan carried out on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">rd</span><span style="color:#000000"> March suggested a toxic neuropathy causing localised bilateral symmetrical signal change affecting the dentate nuclei within the deep cerebellar white matter. Those treating him were unable to identify a clear cause for these non-specific changes. From this time on there has been persistent hypertension requiring monitoring and management.

To the extent that it was possible to test the relevant auditory areas of the brain there was no sign of response but it seemed that C was able to hear. That remains so to date.   There is no dispute about this, and from some of the recorded clips of him produced as part of his father&#8217;s evidence which I have watched and which will be considered later in this judgment, it is clear that he has hearing. As to sight, it is thought that he retains some vision. On testing electrodiagnostically (undertaken much later in his hospital stay on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> September) it was found   that the study undertaken showed &#8216;abnormal visual&#8217; which was thought to equate to him having &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">rudimentary vision with likely at least some impairment and moderate retinal change</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8217;.

Which is why, if other methods of delivery can be found it is generally preferred to avoid it.  It could not be avoided for C. In the period from June to October, attempts were made to reintroduce enteral feeds.  Those attempts were unsuccessful and were accompanied by pain and discomfort for C. Although he cannot speak, he is able to express when he is in pain and at this hearing I have heard graphic descriptions of how he does this by grimacing, moving his head, squeezing his eyes tightly shut, clenching his mouth or by crying. </span></p>

One of the descriptions given to that meeting was that C was described as appearing pervasively sad day to day with episodes of pain every day. Within the material provided to me in advance of this hearing I had read already of prolonged episodes of what appear to be a combination of pain and distress. The identification of &#8216;sadness&#8217; at that meeting is congruent with parts of the evidence in which I had read of occasions noted by the nursing staff when C is noted for long periods to be crying without a cause that is obviously pain related and when he is inconsolable. At this hearing I heard from Dr L a consultant in palliative medicine that for her, these episodes in which she could not attribute or link his obvious distress with pain or with discomfort from some cause which could be identified and so alleviated were the most worrying aspects of C&#8217;s presentation.</span></p>

From Dr K at this hearing, I have heard how that change of emphasis was one which those working with him found helpful because, for instance, it impacted upon the physiotherapists&#8217; approach to the interventions they were giving him and the extent to which those interventions included handling and movement which was often causing pain. The necessity and purpose of pain and discomfort experienced for a rehabilitative goal was he said one thing but when the goal changed the balance of what was in effect inflicting pain and discomfort to no purpose tipped the other way.</span></p>

He is the only child of his parents, but he has two half siblings on his mother&#8217;s side and three on his father&#8217;s. As is the way of things, the characterisation of them as half siblings is neither here nor there and to him they are his brothers and sisters. C is at secondary school and had hopes &#8211; more rooted in reality than is sometimes the case &#8211; of being spotted by a scout to play football professionally. As well as being interested in sport, he had recently found himself more motivated to work hard academically because he was ambitious to study architecture and had realised that he would need the grades to do that. He had been both baptised into the Roman Catholic faith and had during his primary school years, so his father told me followed the path familiar to those of that Faith, of making his first confession; first holy communion and then being confirmed.   He had as he became older practised his faith with a lighter touch. </span></p>

His father straightforwardly told me his son was a boy who believed in God. I will return to the way in which the father invites me to consider the question of religious faith elsewhere in this judgment. His mother is not someone who practices the Roman Catholic faith and told me that she had not regarded C as having any belief in God and certainly he never spoke to her of religion. I noted however with some interest that part of her evidence in which she described to me how in the early days of his illness she had come in to find the parish priest at his bedside and blessing him. She told me that she had instantly worried that if C had woken up and seen a priest at his bedside he would have thought he was dying.  That vignette inclines me to the view that whilst his mother does not see religion as something that was especially important to C, she recognised it as a part of his life.</span></p>

Prominent amongst her thinking was the prospect of C who had previously been frightened by being in hospital being given however sensitively information that one possible outcome for him now was death. I had found her view on that and the way she expressed it difficult to square with what had been her written evidence in her report as to what should be the approach to C if he became more unwell and showed signs of active dying or were Life sustaining treatment not to be continued. This had been expressed in the following terms: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">At this stage, it would be important to explain in simple terms that he was imminently dying and offer reassurance that his family were present, and we would continue to look after him</span></p>

In the otherwise uniformly excellent and careful evidence from the hospital this was unfortunate. Within the court room when consideration came to be given to that part of the report, there was a very obvious increase in the distress of family members present at the thought of someone telling C he was about to die.   I have heard nothing at this hearing that suggested to me that it would be in C&#8217;s best interests to be told, if for whatever reason the time comes, that he is imminently dying.</span></p>

She said that she felt in some ways guilty because here she was, a mother advocating for the death of her child. When first he had gone into hospital like everyone else, she had hoped for a recovery. She had not left the hospital for the first six weeks.  She could not praise enough the doctors and nurses who have looked after him so well. As time went on however, she had realised that this hope was not going to be enough and gradually she realised he wouldn&#8217;t get better. She had known in her heart that he was not going to recover even before the clinical decision-making meeting on 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> August. Since then, she thinks the reality is that C is dying and is being kept alive in a way that is cruel. She still visits him but goes now several times a week. Sometimes her daughter, C's older sister goes with her. His younger brother, with whom C has always had a close relationship, has visited but does not really understand what is happening. As a snapshot of the impact on the family as a whole she described to me how she had dissuaded her own mother now in her 70s from visiting C and had lied to her about his condition so as to protect her describing him as &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">mostly sleeping&#8217;.</span></p>

It was not just wishful thinking that he might have gone further with his football. She told me that even though he was only 13 he was also really serious about architecture and had asked about extra tuition. All of that life she said was lost to him now.

Although she had heard the word &#8216;settled&#8217; used at this hearing by others what that meant to her was that because he had needed morphine to kill the pain that had settled him. C&#8217;s mother was especially keen that people should realise that his pain and his situation is being </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">normalised . &#8216;It is not normal to need morphine. It's not normal to be lying in a bed blind not able to move not able to even itch his nose or tell someone he needs to itch his nose&#8217;. </span><span style="color:#000000">It was evident from the way she spoke that C&#8217;s mother was distressed by the pain he is suffering as a result of his polyneuropathy, but the more her evidence continued, the more I had the strong sense that for her, at least as much if not more than the pain, it is the indignity of his situation which she regards as so intolerable. Her clear view is that C also would find &#8211; and she thinks is finding &#8211; it intolerable. Since he was quite a small boy, aged 7, he would not allow his mother into the bathroom with him. Each of his parents and both his step-parents described him as a shy boy. His mother says that he would find being washed and changed by nurses beyond difficult. He would be embarrassed, she said to be having his pads changed and to be reliant on a catheter. She couldn&#8217;t imagine any 14 year old who wouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed but she knew for sure C would. With just as much force and conviction as his father had said the contrary she said &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">I know C wouldn&#8217;t want to live like this&#8217;.</span></p>

Not quite because the father told me that one of his other sons disagrees that C should be maintained on life sustaining treatment. The overall impression I have formed of the wider family view is that they all of them love C, he remains an important member of their family and they want the best for him but they have arrived at different views of what that is.</span></p>

He has been involved in C's care since and taken part in best interests meetings and discussions. In terms of recovery, by May last year C has been able to open his eyes, turn his head to mid-line and show responses to questions by eye blinking, putting out his tongue or opening his mouth. Dr M was clear that recovery in those who do recover from polyneuropathic critical illness is slow, for him the lack of any significant steps to recovery during the last 12 months was a very discouraging indicator. Since neuropathy was so widespread here and there have been no steps to recovery he was doubtful that there would be meaningful recovery within say the next 3 months. Notwithstanding his caution, cross-examined by Mr Mant about the MDT records to which Dr K had been taken Dr M when asked by Mr Mant if there were to be a further EMG and clinical analysis and a consideration of the amount of independent breaths that would give more confidence either way as to prognosis, agreed that it would.

It has been challenging and ultimately impossible to reinstate him on any form of enteral feeding successfully.  He is currently reliant on TPN for all his nutritional requirements. Successive attempts to reintroduce enteral feeds have been unsuccessful. Further attempts could, she thought, be considered if the collective MDT felt appropriate and in conjunction with a clear plan for increasing or reducing depending on his symptoms. However, it has been difficult to find a suitable opportunity for restarting feeds due to C&#8217;s baseline level of discomfort/distress, and the potential negative impact on his symptoms and quality of life that it would have. Furthermore, even if feeds are restarted, it is likely that C will continue to require TPN in the medium to long term based on his previous response to feeds. Notably that response has been characterised by the experience of very significant pain and discomfort. </span></p>

For children to be discharged on TPN, the family needs to be trained to administer it at home and then a request is sent to NHS England to be approved. As it relies on tubes into the veins to provide TPN, there can arise issues with the lines blocking and needing to be replaced, if this occurs often then it can be difficult to identify new veins to be used. All of the above would only be possible if C was considered well enough to be discharged home. He is not of course a gastroenterology patient only and the wider clinical evidence of his condition means that discharge home is not an option.</span></p>

His evidence, however, illustrated how subjective a concept pain is not only for those experiencing it but also for those observing it. He did not agree when asked that his experience of C matched what appeared from the pain charts to be some days when there was little or even no pain. His own experience was of pain or discomfort a good deal of the time. He could not recall the last time he had seen C smile. In the earlier stages of his admission to PICU Mr R had seen C on a near daily basis. The fact that he is now in a more senior role with management responsibilities means that his contact though continuing is less.

C appears to be able to follow one step commands such as stick out your tongue. C is inconsistent when asked to follow two step commands such as, stick your tongue out then blow a kiss. Asked if she agreed that the videoclips of responses to his family showed more than that, she was unconvinced.  There are significant restrictions in what assessments can be undertaken due to C&#8217;s limited movements and limited communication. He responds to people&#8217;s voices using head movement and facial expressions. His level of understanding cannot be assessed, and it is difficult to know whether he is understanding the content of a conversation or responding to familiar and/or animated voices. Expanding on this it might be that C, who is of course not a toddler, may be interacting with loved ones in the way a toddler might and what he is responding to is familiar voice, modulations and tone. Mr Mant, whilst reminding her that the father&#8217;s experience is of interaction at a higher level than that, asked Dr L whether she would not agree that even the &#8216;toddler&#8217; interactions she thought these might be are a valuable and meaningful human interaction and she readily accepted that they are.</span></p>

This is corroborated by the therapist assessments as well as outside formal sessions by nursing staff that care for C. Understanding the reasons why can only be assumed but therapists have considered mood, distractions, fatiguability, impact of medications and motivation. In this respect she was unable to assist in her oral evidence with whether what she perceives as a diminution in his responsiveness is an inability to respond or a decision not to &#8211; i.e. can't or won't. She used to be far more confident in knowing what he had understood and what he was communicating &#8211; a clear example she gave was of him rolling his eyes up to the right which was an indication of displeasure/boredom/disinterest with whatever he was being asked. She had not seen that latterly. Though it seemed on the recordings that some others working with him had seen something similar. </span></p>

Within this context the wise words of Hedley J in Portsmouth NHS Trust v Wyatt and Wyatt, Southampton NHS Trust Intervening <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 21" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 21</ref> should be recalled: &#8220;This case evokes some of the fundamental principles that undergird our humanity. They are not to be found in Acts of Parliament or decisions of the courts but in the deep recesses of the common psyche of humanity whether they be attributed to humanity being created in the image of God or whether it be simply a self-defining ethic of a generally acknowledged humanism.&#8221; </span></p>

I also bear in mind that Ms Parfitt has an Article 8 right to family life which ought to be considered. If so, parental wishes are not &#8220;wholly irrelevant&#8221;.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I had watched carefully several times before starting this hearing the WhatsApp videos exhibited by the father to his statement. Since the hearing I have watched carefully those sent in by agreement following the conclusion of submissions. There is a danger in overreliance, or over interpretation, of such recordings, whether that is by someone who very much loves C and risks seeing what they want to see, or by a Judge whose viewing of them is from a clinically uninformed perspective. To me it appeared that C was smiling and/or responding by raising an eyebrow to questions asked about his sister and so I asked Dr K if I should understand what I was seeing as something more than a reflex response. His evidence was that within the context of those clips what was being seen was that </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">he is responding and on two of the videos obviously responding with a smile. </span><span style="color:#000000">Accordingly, whilst I caution myself about over-reliance on the video evidence, I proceed on the basis that it is safe to regard those clips as showing what they appear to show at face value of C in the seconds or minutes to which they relate. I bear in mind also of course that they show only one aspect of his experience and not those aspects of his life described by others of pain, discomfort and distress.</span></p>

There is good evidence that he experiences pain. Dr L in her evidence explained that it had not been possible to manage that pain as effectively as she would wish. Her oral evidence was that he is on a complex mixture of pain relief medications including intravenous morphine yet is often assessed as experiencing mild or moderate pain. Sometimes the assessment is that he is experiencing severe pain. By comparison with pain management in other children, of which she has wide experience because of her particular specialism, Dr L does not think his pain is acceptable.</span></p>

Mr Mant&#8217;s submission that on what has been disclosed what emerges is that March 2023 shows fewer recordings of severe pain than was recorded in February is one I accept. I accept also the submission that there is overall more pain than had been shown in November, but the absence of the intervening months, and the question of how that should be interpreted when the absent notional &#8216;zeros&#8217; are added in makes it impossible to say what that means if anything by way of progress or deterioration. Medication records for January show that there is medication prescribed for pain on about half the days. This does not match the written evidence on which the Trust relies that it was needed on average &#8216;every day or so&#8217;. The fact that at this hearing not only parents but also professional witnesses have described to me how their own subjective impression or interpretation differs from the recordings underscores the need for as clear an objective picture as possible. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">At this hearing there has been a focus not only on pain and discomfort but also of distress. There are occasions also when C has been described as being withdrawn or showing what has been described as &#8216;pervasive sadness&#8217; and this has led to him being prescribed medication with an anti-depressant component. There are also recorded instances when he is noted to be exhibiting &#8216;distress&#8217; which is not objectively associated with pain or discomfort from handling or interventions or from obvious gastric pain (such as the Guardian's report records witnessing) but which appears to be distress. I of course accept the submission made on behalf of the father that I must not speculate on the cause of his emotional distress. In closing submissions Mr Brownhill drew attention to the fact that Nurse R thought he might be </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">scared or missing his family. </span><span style="color:#000000">that is exactly the sort of speculation to be avoided.  To the extent that the Trust relies in oral submissions by counsel on the evidence of Mr R that C had, at the time he was still able to make movements, made a movement that might be interpreted as seeking to shield his body from view during intimate care. I do not regard that as one it is safe to weigh in the balance (not least because it was not a recording identified for me in the records). I similarly apply caution to the views expressed by some that he had seemed to them to flush with embarrassment when intimate care tasks are undertaken. It would be too easy to read into those subjective observations. </span></p>

Recognising that those had taken place the Trust obtained a short update from Dr Varma before the start of the hearing and within the hearing from Dr N. Mr Mant&#8217;s complaint that second opinion Drs were not called and there was no opportunity to cross examine them is one that is solidly met by the riposte that they were not asked for but his better point is that those short updating reports are not ones which address the best-case scenario or the possibility of recovery so far as reinnervation may translate to clinical terms. That is a submission made within the context that even by the time it was being made there had still not been disclosure of full neurology notes and MDT meeting. </span></p>

Here although there were second opinions obtained from neurologists there has never been a second opinion or any other review from an intensivist or PICU consultant. I interpreted the submission that it is &#8216;routine&#8217; as permitting of the contemplation that there may be cases in which as Mr Brownhill put it in opening the clinical situation of the child concerned outweighs the procedural rights of the party putting their case, but I have not concluded that this is the situation here. </span></p>

In fact by the conclusion of this hearing one of the matters which became the subject of the greatest dispute was the extent to which he continues to experience severe episodes of pain. It would be tempting in making the decision to permit further evidence to lean on the fact that, to the extent that I have an </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">objective</span><span style="color:#000000"> picture of pain it is that the most recent month is better than that which came before. I know however that those whose expertise lies in pain management have not accepted that and I also know that on occasion little or no apparent pain may  be only reflective of increased opiates. It is therefore a more honest approach to the decision, to take it knowing that C is likely to continue to experience pain in the intervening period. I recognise also that the precarious state of the Broviac line &#8211; to the extent that ceilings of care have had to be agreed or determined in a range of forms &#8211; means that there is scope for that pain to increase. It is not speculation for me to say that it is informed by up-to-date evidence</span></p>

This to address the uncertainty which has emerged from neurologists at this hearing as to what the 5 &#8211;10 % recovery in terms of axonal reinnervation means and to how most especially in the light of Dr K&#8217;s &#8216;joystick&#8217; evidence (from the MDT meeting) that might translate if at all into clinical recovery and the wider neurological prognostication. Should it be the case that it is impossible to find within a tolerable timescale someone with sufficient expertise to undertake the task then that may yet be the route to further and more detailed second opinion evidence. In the first instance, however I will give the opportunity for an independent expert to be identified.  </span></p>

That comes about in the following way. In respect of the applications before me C&#8217;s mother and father are not eligible for non-means non-merit tested funding. C&#8217;s mother does not oppose the Trust&#8217;s application and so might be thought to be less in need of representation. C&#8217;s father, who does not agree with the application made, has been represented pro bono by Mr Mant with conspicuous skill, ability and a professional generosity that has been unstinting. It was obvious, however, that were I to accept his case on independent expert evidence there would be no source of funding for it. </span></p>
