The purpose of the restriction on statement length is partly to focus the parties' minds on relevant evidence, and partly to ensure a level playing field. Why is it fair for one party to follow the rules, but the other party to ignore them? Why is it fair for the complying party to be left with the feeling that the non-complying party has been able to adduce more evidence to his/her apparent advantage?&#8221;</p>

There are predictable disputes as to the true beneficial ownership of one of the properties and of the sum in the Coutts account. The wife also discloses properties in Siberia worth a little over &#163;1 million. The husband, who has next to nothing in his name, says that this is an entirely false presentation and that the wife is correctly ranked by Forbes as the 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> richest woman in Russia, with vastly valuable interests in supermarkets in Siberia. Even if this were true (and the suggestion is hotly contested) to run up in domestic litigation costs of between &#163;7 million and &#163;8 million is beyond nihilistic.

Furthermore, the solicitor is an officer of the court, and should know that the defendant can only be required to pay reasonable costs and any order made today will reflect that.

Whilst I am not in a position to determine conclusively whether the war in Ukraine has restricted the wife&#8217;s finances in the way she says it has, it seems to me that, as a matter of common-sense, it is likely that it has had a material effect. The husband&#8217;s express case is that he does not accept this, but he does accept that the only source of payment at this time for any legal services payment would be from the Coutts account. </p>

The two authorities I have been referred to by Mr Calhaem are clearly against the court policing a party&#8217;s payment of her own costs from her own money.  I acknowledge that to give the wife this freedom is hardly consistent with my strong criticism of the amount of costs that has been run up hitherto. However, the authorities give the wife the freedom to spend her own money on her &#8220;proper costs&#8221;. Whether there can be introduced some measures whereby the court can restrain a party from spending their own money on costs is a matter for the Lord Chancellor and the Rule Committee to consider.</p>

That set of rules was further intermittently augmented so that by 1903 it ran to 220. These are the rules printed in the first edition of Rayden (Butterworth &amp; Co 1910). The 1865 Rules provided that many financial remedy applications were by separate petition and heard by the judge on motion in court (sometimes following a report from the Registrar) and that consent orders apart, the Registrar would usually not make a substantive order. The work of the Registrars was overwhelmingly procedural, dealing with applications to amend pleadings, extend time, and the like. The great bulk of the financial remedy work was done by the judge, some in court and some in chambers as if sitting in open court. The judge&#8217;s work in chambers largely seems to have been the dispatch of procedural summonses. </p>

In contrast, an application for variation of settlement, the only capital award available, remained the subject of the Registrar&#8217;s report procedure (Rule 71). I have not researched when the power to make an order disposing of that type of application was also vested in the Registrar. By the time of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973 the only remaining application which was the subject of the report procedure was an avoidance of disposition application and any related ancillary relief application being heard at the same time (see Rules 77, 78 and 79). The Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977 removed that final exception. From that point the default position was that all applications were to be heard by the Registrar, but, of course, any application could be referred to the Judge. The rules do not say that the Registrar must hear the application in chambers because from time immemorial they had only sat in chambers. RSC Order 32 r 11 provided that the jurisdiction of the Registrars of the Family Division (subject to certain exceptions such as matters relating to the liberty of the subject) was &#8220;to transact all such business and exercise all such authority and jurisdiction as &#8230; may be transacted and exercised by a judge in chambers&#8221;.</p>

The House of Lords allowed the appeal and essentially endorsed his reasoning. The judgment is a tour de force, and such is its exceptional logical and literary quality that I am unapologetic for quoting from it at some length. The core issue was what the words directing that the suit be heard in camera actually meant.  Fletcher Moulton LJ held:</p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I shall proceed to shew that an order that a cause shall be heard in camera never could have and never has had the meaning contended for by the respondent. Before doing so I wish to say a word about the two interpretations themselves. It has become evident to me in the course of the argument that there is much confusion of thought as to their respective effects and that the radical difference between them has often been forgotten. <span style="font-weight:bold">The language of the order provides for privacy at the hearing. It has nothing to do with secrecy as to the facts of the case.</span> The learned judge interprets it as enjoining such secrecy. He realizes that having done so he is logically compelled to put all hearings in chambers on the same footing, and he therefore declares that under the procedure of our Courts there is an absolute obligation to perpetual secrecy as to what passes at the hearing of all summonses in chambers. No one has ventured to say before us a single word in defence of this part of the judgment. It is not too much to say that it is ludicrously at variance with the actual practice. Many thousands of summonses in actions are heard in chambers in the course of each year, and <span style="font-weight:bold">during all my experience at the Bar and on the Bench I have never heard it suggested that there is the slightest obligation of secrecy as to what passes in chambers. Everything which there transpires is and always has been spoken of with precisely the same freedom as that which passes in Court</span>. Yet, as the judge acknowledges, the phrases &#8220;in camera&#8221; and &#8220;in chambers&#8221; are synonymous. We start, therefore, from the datum line that&#160;the judgment which we are asked to declare unappealable is confessedly based on reasoning which makes the whole lives of those who are professionally engaged in litigation one long series of criminal contempts of Court.</p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The first and to my mind the all-sufficient reason for giving to the order the plain meaning of the words used is that the interpretation which is suggested on behalf of the respondent would make it an order which would be ultra vires of any judge or of any Court. Civil Courts exist solely to enforce the rights or redress the wrongs of those who appeal to them and for no other purpose. They have ample powers for so doing. They summon the defendant to come before them, they give both parties assistance in obtaining the necessary evidence, they hear the rival contentions, and finally they decree the appropriate relief if any. But they can do no more except that when called upon to do so they enforce the relief that they have granted. <span style="font-weight:bold">Beyond and besides this the Court acquires no power or jurisdiction over an individual by reason of his having become a litigant. He remains in all other respects as free and as independent of interference from the Court as he was before the suit was instituted or as any other member of the public is who has never been a litigant.</span></p>

		  </level>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The suggested interpretation of the order is in direct violation of all this. Take for example the case of a suit for separation based upon grave moral charges, or (as in this case) a suit for nullity of marriage, where the defendant has been successful. He was brought into the suit by no act of his own, but by the summons of the Court. He has been present at the hearing not by bargain with the judge, but of right. And now it has been declared that the charges were unfounded. In virtue of what authority can the judge control the future actions of that man and say that he shall never speak of that which has passed at the hearing, including of course the oral judgment pronounced by the judge? How has that defendant surrendered or forfeited any part of his personal freedom of action? He is sui juris and remains so, and <span style="font-weight:bold">the fact of his having been compelled to be a litigant cannot put him for all time in the position of being in statu pupillari to the judge before whom&#160;the cause has come</span>, so that such judge can impose upon him his personal views as to propriety or duty. I say &#8220;propriety or duty&#8221; advisedly, because in my opinion it is often not merely a solace but a duty which a man owes to himself and to those about him to inform them fully of all that has passed in these inexpressibly painful cases. It may be vital to him to clear away misconception in the minds of those who are dear to him or whose good opinion he values, and to obtain from them the sympathy and support that he needs. And I own that, not only as an individual but as a member of the Judicial Bench<span style="font-weight:bold">, I rebel against the suggestion that according to English law he may do this only so far as it may accord with the notions of some judge who, as such, has no more authority to act towards him as a moral director in his behaviour in life after the suit is over than has the man in the street.</span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I have taken the case of a defendant who is dismissed from the suit. But the argument is equally strong in the case of the petitioner. She comes before the Court as of right to obtain its aid in enforcing her rights. In accepting that aid she no more relinquishes her personal freedom of action than does the defendant in entering an appearance. The Court can impose no terms as a condition of its rendering its aid to parties in the enforcement of their claims. They have the right to demand that aid of the Court and it is there to give it without conditions. The same considerations apply to a defendant who is unsuccessful. The Court has the right and the duty to decree the proper relief against him, but it can do no more. It cannot add to that relief directions or commands as to his future conduct. If they are not part of the relief itself they are pronounced without authority. <span style="font-weight:bold">The conception of the Court interfering with litigants otherwise than by granting the relief which it is empowered and bound to grant is wholly vicious and strikes at the foundation of the status and duties of judges.</span> We claim and obtain obedience and respect for our office because we are nothing other than the appointed agents for enforcing upon each individual the performance of his obligations. That obedience and that respect must cease if, disregarding the difference between legislative and judicial functions, we attempt&#160;ourselves to create obligations and impose them on individuals who refuse to accept them and who have done nothing to render those obligations binding upon them against their will.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is this which makes me take so serious a view of the present appeal. The Courts are the guardians of the liberties of the public and should be the bulwark against all encroachments on those liberties from whatsoever side they may come. It is their duty therefore to be vigilant. But they must be doubly vigilant against encroachments by the Courts themselves. In that case it is their own actions which they must bring into judgment and it is against themselves that they must protect the public. The magnitude of the danger is illustrated by the present case. <span style="font-weight:bold">The serious encroachment on personal liberty which is here proposed is not supported by a single decision. There is on record no case where the Courts have asserted a right to control the personal acts of litigants after the conclusion of the suit except to enforce the relief granted.</span> Yet without the support of any precedent the learned judge has in this case arrogated to judges the power to do so and we are asked to support him. The nature of the encroachment emphasizes the warning. Most people feel that the unrestricted publication in newspapers of what passes at the hearing of certain types of cases is a great evil, and many proposals have been made for regulating it. But all agree that this must be done by the Legislature. The judges are not the tribunal to decide on the proper limitations of public rights. The order in the present case is an attempt to assert for judges indefinitely wide powers in this respect. Not even the strongest partisan of legislative action has ventured to propose that private communications between individuals as to that which passes at the hearing of a suit should be interfered with. This order proceeds on the basis that a judge can of his own initiative absolutely forbid them. I have here to discuss the legal justification for such a doctrine and not its expediency, but <span style="font-weight:bold">I cannot forbear adding that in my opinion nothing would be more detrimental to the administration of justice in any country than to entrust the judges with the power of covering the proceedings before them with the mantle of inviolable secrecy.&#8221;</span></p>

(2) What happens during the proceedings in chambers is not confidential or secret and information about what occurs in chambers and the judgment or order pronounced can, and in the case of any judgment or order should, be made available to the public when requested. (3) If members of the public who seek to attend cannot be accommodated, the judge should consider adjourning the proceedings in whole or in part into open court to the extent that this is practical or allowing one or more representatives of the press to attend the hearing in chambers. (4) To disclose what occurs in chambers does not constitute a breach of confidence or amount to contempt as long as any comment which is made does not substantially prejudice the administration of justice.

However, in civil proceedings the concept of a hearing in chambers was superseded  when the CPR took effect on 26 April 1999. CPR 39.2  provides that, subject to specified exceptions, all hearings should be, formally, in public. The 2022 White Book explains at 39.2.8 that many hearings other than trials continue to be held in rooms in which the public are not accommodated. For such hearings the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Hodgson </span>continue to apply.

I have come to realise that the problem with this reasoning is that it ought to have applied equally to civil proceedings held before April 1999 in chambers. But we know from <span style="font-style:italic">Hodgson v Imperial Tobacco Ltd </span>that while such proceedings were private, they were not secret, and information about what occurred during the hearing and the judgment or order pronounced could, and in the case of any judgment or order should, be made available to the public when requested.  If the freedom to report information about civil proceedings heard in chambers (i.e. in private) in 1998 did not &#8220;make a nonsense&#8221; of the implied undertaking, why did it do so for financial remedy proceedings heard in chambers (i.e. in private) in 2002?

Those rules introduced into the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 a new rule 10.28. Rule 10.28(3)(f) permitted journalists to be present during the hearing unless the court exercised its power to exclude them under rule 10.28(4). Rule 10.28 has now been identically re-expressed in FPR 27.11 and elaborated in FPR PD 27B. The right to attend has been extended to legal bloggers under FPR 27.11(2)(ff).

That permitted presence means that the proceedings are to be treated as if in open court for the purposes of  para 106 of Thorpe LJ&#8217;s judgment. In my opinion, in the absence of a specific reporting restriction order, a journalist or blogger who receives information by virtue of being present during the proceedings, is fully entitled to publish that information. That entitlement is proved conclusively by the existence of FPR 27.11(3)(b) which allows the court to make an order excluding a journalist or blogger so that justice is not &#8220;impeded or prejudiced&#8221;. As an example of where justice necessitates the exclusion of a journalist or blogger, PD 27B para 5.4 cites a hearing where the court is considering confidential price sensitive information, exposure of which could affect the share price of a publicly quoted company. This rule and this example are only explicable if the journalist present in court was entitled to report that information. The rule would be entirely otiose, indeed nonsensical, if the journalist was anyway barred from reporting what he or she heard.</p>

As Fletcher Moulton LJ and Lord Woolf MR unambiguously explain, the general rule is that, save in the clearly defined types of case specified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1960 Act</ref>, the principle of open justice permits information about all proceedings, including proceedings heard in private, to be published, in full, on a non-anonymised basis. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second reason is a classic example of the law of unintended consequences. In about 2002 the standard Family Division judgment template was introduced. A blank judgment would be generated on judicial computers at the click of a mouse. The template contained the standard rubric. There was only one standard rubric irrespective of whether the case directly concerned the welfare of a minor, and therefore was subject to statutory secrecy under the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>, or whether it did not.

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree that this passage reflects current practice. But for the reasons I have set out above, current practice does not correctly reflect the terms of the law. I repeat: the law, when properly understood, permits information about financial remedy proceedings and judgments (in cases which are not mainly about child maintenance) to be published unless the court has made a specific order preventing publication. The premise of the quoted passage is that financial information disclosed, and referred to, in the proceedings is confidential or secret and therefore cannot be reported without the court&#8217;s express permission. The correct position is the other way round: financial information referred to in the proceedings is not secret and can be fully reported unless the court makes a specific order preventing publication. The difference is that under the (erroneous) former position the journalist has to ask for permission to report something heard in court whereas under the (correct) latter position a party has to ask for an order preventing the journalist from reporting it. </p>

The grounds, which were advanced orally and extempore, fell well short of the type and quality of evidence needed to justify a departure from the starting point of open justice. The risk of indirect identification of children is always a consequence of any decision which is not anonymised. If that were a good reason for anonymisation then it would apply in almost every case, including most civil cases. There is no evidence at all to suggest that the supermarket business in Siberia would be remotely affected if people knew that the respondent wife in this case was involved in no-holds-barred litigation in London.</p>
