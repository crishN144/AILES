The inherent probability or improbability of an event remains a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. As has been observed, &#8220;Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities&#8221; (Re B[2008] UKHL 35 at [15]).</span></p>

Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as &#8220;last resort&#8221; or &#8220;draconian&#8221; cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the s1 (3) welfare check list which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child's welfare needs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.&#8221;</span></p>

Both these examples relate to public law proceedings but have no less application to private law cases, particularly where there are child protection issues but there is no need of local authority involvement because the caring parent, as here, has proved that they are capable of protecting their child. The reality is that, with ever-decreasing resources and the closure of contact centres, long-term supervision will rarely be a realistic option in private law cases such as this; that does not mean however that in an appropriate case such a route should not be deployed as a means of allowing a child to continue to have a relationship with her absent parent</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.&#8221;</span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.</span></p>

The well-known authority is the case of R v Lucas (R) [1981] QB 720 in which the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, after stressing that people sometimes tell lies for reasons other than a belief that the lie is necessary to conceal guilt, held that four conditions must be satisfied before a defendant&#8217;s lie could be seen as supporting the prosecution case as explained in the judgment of the court given by Lord Lane CJ:</span></p>

Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.&#8221;</span></p>

If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe X or Y on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness's reliability of recall on a particular issue.&#160;</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process which might inelegantly described as &#8220;story creep&#8221; &#8211; may occur without any inference of bad faith.&#8221;</span></p>

He was concerned that we may already be too late to reverse the harm that has been caused to P but felt there was enough hope that everything should be done to try to protect her now. He felt that the window of change would close at approximately the age of 15. Dr Willemsen&#8217;s evidence was that the only way to protect P&#8217;s relationship with F and to address the matters which are causing P to self-harm and be at risk of CSE would be for P to live with F. He summarised this case as follows;</span></p>

We need to bear in mind that the consequence of the two findings on the parents have very different consequences for this child. I do not see the high conflict as the sole factor in this case, instead it is the problem belying the conflict which is hard to resolve, and here we have clear findings about hostility.  We need to keep in mind that forms part of what P is exposed to, if this were just high conflict it doesn&#8217;t explain P&#8217;s behaviours, neither does just parental alienation&#8230;it is M&#8217;s implacable hostility which shows her approach to conflict which is key for this child.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">M raises concerns that Dr Willemsen should not be relied upon due to him only having met P once and that was over year ago, furthermore his main report predates the FFH. M&#8217;s position is that instead I should rely on the evidence of the multiple social workers who have worked with P and state her wishes and feelings are to live with M and spend alternate weekends with F. I do not find this argument persuasive, firstly the social workers are reporting P&#8217;s wishes and feelings, as expressed to them, that is not in dispute. However, Dr Willemsen is an expert who addresses the dynamic between P, F and M, how this impacts P, reasoning behind P&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings and why they shouldn&#8217;t be taken into consideration. He is an expert, he brings to the court all of his expertise and experience, in my judgment he provides a perspective wholly unique to any of the other witnesses. The evidence he gives holds considerable weight as he is independent, has considered all of the papers (which was demonstrated by making reference to specific documents throughout his evidence) and he has had the opportunity to assess both of the parents. Additionally, when this point was put to him in cross examination Dr Willemsen&#8217;s response was that he &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">went through all of the reports where she (P) swings from one view to another</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221;,  he then went further to say one of the reasons he hadn&#8217;t seen P was that the judgment of the court was if P doesn&#8217;t need to be seen then he should not see her. He balanced that with the fact there is so much evidence in this case, he was able to meet and speak to the parents which gave a clear picture as to the environment around the child, and this case had &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">proper multi professional work&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This approach seems eminently sensible given the specific circumstances of this case.</span></p>

The suggestion being that by not hearing TBR&#8217;s evidence, Dr Willemsen&#8217;s evidence was unsound and therefore I should not place too much weight on it. This was put to Dr Willemsen and he explained that the reason he wanted to hear the evidence of TBR was to establish if he had missed any areas where M may have developed, so that he could give them full consideration, however, he didn&#8217;t believe it would have impacted his final position. I was able to consider this answer in light of TBR&#8217;s evidence, which was that M had made very little progress and not in the areas which were required. As such I concur with Dr Willemsen, that it is unlikely hearing this evidence would have impacted on his final recommendations. He also stated that he didn&#8217;t overly rely on TBR&#8217;s report and when asked if he sided with TBR because she was a professional he stated that he regularly gives evidence contrary to that of other professionals, he stands by his professional opinion and isn&#8217;t swayed by others. However, in this case he felt there was a general shared concern about P. </span></p>

She was timetabled to give evidence first but due to delay in commencing the evidence and her being unwell she gave evidence after F. While giving evidence she continued to feel the effects of her illness, however she was given breaks when she requested them and did not suggest that she was unable to continue or that she felt her evidence was being compromised in anyway. If she had raised these issues or if I felt she was unable to continue I would have acted immediately. Additionally, she was supposed to give evidence in person, however due to the above issues she gave evidence remotely. Initially M questioned this approach however I was provided with an earlier email from her solicitors agreeing to TBR&#8217;s remote attendance on the grounds of cost and therefore when considering the impact of delay and the proportionality of waiting for TBR to attend in person, I determined that we should continue with her evidence via CVP. At no stage during TBR&#8217;s evidence did M raise concerns with the way in which TBR&#8217;s evidence was given which would cause me to consider if it could be relied on or the extent to which I could rely on it. </span></p>

It seems to me that M is advancing circular argument here, if TBR is an expert in parental alienation then she is best placed to advise the court as to if features are or aren&#8217;t present in the case. Being an expert in a matter does not mean you are bias in identifying it within a situation, it merely means greater weight should be given to your evidence regarding that area of expertise. At no point was any evidence adduced that could lead me to conclude TBR was agenda led, that she finds parental alienation in all of her cases or that there was any bias towards finding parental alienation over another explanation. M&#8217;s citation of the terminology used in TBR&#8217;s reports is pedantic and doesn&#8217;t in and of itself show any bias, for example she refers to &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">alienating behaviours</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; but at no stage does TBR claim there is parental alienation and instead, correctly, leaves it for the court to determine.

I do not consider this unusual or worthy of criticism, we must remember this is a case where P has had a high level of professional involvement, she has had numerous social workers, school support, Dr Willemsen, TBR and the G. She herself has expressed a desire to be &#8220;normal&#8221; and to have as little involvement with professionals as possible, specifically she did not wish to have any involvement at school. Both parents agreed with the approach of limiting the visits by professionals which is the reason Dr Willemsen was asked to only have a second meeting with P if he considered it necessary. The G&#8217;s remit is not solely to meet with the child and inform the Court of their wishes and feelings, it is to consider the entire case from the perspective of the child and to provide independent advice about what is in their best interests.

While at points during the evidence M claims that P and F have a good and positive relationship and there have been no issues for some time, she also seeks to blame F for all of P&#8217;s difficulties and states that she is trying to get P to tell him why she struggles at F&#8217;s home and that she tries her best but it is &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">difficult&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and F is too strict. Her answers depend on if M is trying to support her plan for the final order or if she is talking about F and his parenting.

M seems to have no insight into the concerns and her initial reaction was to push against F instead of work towards an immediate plan which would safeguard P, latterly her priority has been to minimise the impact on P rather than ensure her safety. An example of M minimising the impact of the safety plan with no regard to the consequences was the Halloween party (October 2023). M held a party for 35 children despite the concerns raised about CSE because &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">P is missing out on her freedoms&#8230;her Snap Chat and Tik Tok is off, she has had all of that freedom taken away due to the concerns, but I am allowing her to have all of that fun&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">A further example is the pregnancy test, M just accepted P&#8217;s explanation with no thought or analysis save for checking the cost of the test. Until the questions were put to her in evidence she didn&#8217;t query why it was a joke, why they would urinate on the test or how it would be considered a joke unless one of the girls had a reason to take it (by virtue of having sex). Additionally, she didn&#8217;t see the link between the test and the CSE until it was pointed out to her and even then she continued to deny it.</span></p>

At worst she is using P to further her own agenda with no understanding of the impact on P. I fully believe that M would never allow P to be harmed on purpose but her lack of insight and understanding mean this is what is occurring. There are further examples, including not accepting the number and ages of people P is messaging, but this quote from M sums up her approach to P being at risk of CSE &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I haven&#8217;t said I don&#8217;t believe she is at risk, all children are at risk of sexual exploitation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221;, from this it is clear that M doesn&#8217;t see P as any different from a &#8220;normal&#8221; child, she doesn&#8217;t accept the damage that has occurred as a result of the animosity or the risks she is exposed to due to her vulnerability. As such she cannot protect her from that harm or those risks, let alone help her move through them therapeutically to enable her to move forwards.</span></p>

She had no insight and could not accept any blame or wrong doing, instead she sought to distract or deflect that blame on to the professionals or F. When discussing any contentious issues her focus is predominately on placing herself as the victim and F as the villain, while pursuing this narrative she loses sight of P, her needs and the impact on her. When I combine this with the parentification of P and M&#8217;s permissive parenting which is continually seeking to appease or place P at the centre of the decision making, it seems obvious to me that this has and is continuing to cause P to be vulnerable and is placing her at real risk of further harm.</span></p>

Furthermore, TBR gave evidence that the &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">spoilt image</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; of F and P&#8217;s &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">splitting</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; of him creates a deep anxiety and uncomfortableness within her. She can only get away from this by absconding from, or not going to, his care (this is set out in greater detail above). However, if the only reason P was running away from F was due to her internal turmoil then it would not have stopped suddenly as a result of a report which she shouldn&#8217;t have been aware of. Therefore, the reason why I find M has been explicit or encouraged P (instead of P acting solely as a result of her internal turmoil) is because of the direct correlation between TBR&#8217;s interim report and P willingly spending time with and no longer absconding from F&#8217;s care. M has reinforced P&#8217;s knowledge that she doesn&#8217;t support P&#8217;s relationship with F by collecting her when she has absconded and not returning her to F&#8217;s care, M has accepted this has taken place although not the reason why.</span></p>

In that recital she was given a warning that an adverse inference may be made due to snapchat messages disappearing. This was concerning due to a lack of transparency in a case where serious allegations are made against M of coaching and encouraging P to abscond. M refused to give an undertaking and during evidence she accepted she had been communicating with P via snapchat. Additionally, I have considered M&#8217;s dishonest evidence about text messages. Firstly, F being cross examined about the appropriateness of a text message &#8216;rant&#8217; being from him, before M accepted it was from her and secondly, all messages between M and P having been deleted after 30.10.2023 phone call. In the contemporaneous OFW messages between the parents where F is requesting M to stop messaging P constantly while P is with him, M ignored his pleas. Combined all of this evidence leads me to the conclusion that this allegation occurred. </span></p>

F in evidence was clear that he used to believe M was alienating him from P but now accepts the FFH decisions and the evidence of the professionals. In accepting their evidence he also accepts that M exhibits alienating behaviours, which is not the same as alienation.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Before I go through the Welfare Checklist in relation to both of the suggested plans it needs to be highlighted that this is no longer a matter of determining if P should live with M or F and which would better meet her needs. As Dr Willemsen put it this case is &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">much, much more complex&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> than simple animosity or parental alienation. P is on a CPP and is considered to be at risk of CSE. The experts&#8217; evidence is the risk is as a result of the emotional harm from the animosity in the parental relationship, and that animosity is underpinned by M&#8217;s implacable hostility to F. P is particularly vulnerable due to her emotional immaturity, fragility and risk-taking behaviours which are a result of not feeling heard, being put at the centre of the parents conflict and having a spoilt and split image of F. They are concerned that P is beyond M&#8217;s parental control, or soon will be, due to M&#8217;s permissive parenting and her parentification of P and that if something is not done now then P is likely to become beyond the parental control of both parents and the risks of sexual harm will increase. I made a finding (above) that if something doesn&#8217;t materially change for P then the implications of continuing to be in her current state of emotional turmoil could be life long and affect her future relationships not just with her parents but with the wider world. </span></p>

Throughout these proceedings P has said a number of different things to different professionals and as recently as during this hearing (31.10.2023) said to the G within the same phone call that she wanted M&#8217;s plan and then changed to wanting the current 50/50 shared care arrangement. However, I accept that the wishes and feelings P states with the most regularity recently is M&#8217;s plan. When P was informed of TBR&#8217;s plan and that the G was supporting this she became distressed and communicated this is something she didn&#8217;t want and considered would have a wholly negative impact on her. </span></p>

Further, I accept the G&#8217;s view that P wishes to have a good relationship with both of her parents but she does not know what is required to make this happen. It is a mark of her emotional immaturity and internal conflict that she cannot understand the position she is in. It was the view of the experts and the G that TBR&#8217;s plan is most likely to result in P having a positive and healthy relationship with both of her parents, as F has the ability and is willingness to promote M.</span></p>

If I were to order M&#8217;s plan P would continue to be at risk of this harm.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">P&#8217;s emotional needs have been greatly impacted by the high conflict between the parents, being at the centre of that conflict, M&#8217;s implacable hostility towards F, M&#8217;s permissive parenting and M&#8217;s parentification of P. All of these have created an inner turmoil for P which is causing her to self-harm and engage in risky sexual behaviours. Were I to order M&#8217;s plan all of these concerns would continue and P would continue to experience emotional harm, the long term impact of that was set out by both experts. If I order TBR&#8217;s plan it would remove all of the elements that are causing P emotional harm and by only having supervised contact until therapeutic work was undertake it would allow P time to settle, process and work through those issues. It would allow an opportunity for F to continue his progress and for M to gain understanding and insight but I accept that it would cause P distress initially and this may be a difficult time for her and F. TBR&#8217;s plan is the only approach which allows material change for her to cease her inner turmoil and when I balance the short term difficulties against protecting P from long term harm which is likely to escalate and affect her relationships beyond the family and into adulthood, I find that the long term damage outweighs the short term distress. </span></p>

I have already set out the long-term impact of P remaining in the current conflict, it would be equally, if not more damaging to her should F withdraw. At the current time F is the parent that is providing a safe, calm space for P away from the behaviour and influence of M. He is the parent that is providing the boundaries which the professionals state she requires. Without F, there would be no-one who has insight into, and appreciates, the risks that she is at. P would be unlikely to receive therapy which contains the narrative she requires and therefore her long term well being will be compromised. She is likely to continue to participate in risky behaviours such as self-harm and continue to be sexually exploited which impact on her into adulthood. </span></p>

Both experts felt that there was enough of a prospect of this plan succeeding that it should be attempted as the alternative of remaining in the current situation would almost certainly be negative. </span></p>

All of these concerns have been set out above. I have found that P requires a material change in her circumstances as they are responsible for the inner turmoil she is currently experiencing. Therapeutic input is required but it must be the right therapy, which is informed by the findings of the court and which helps her make sense of her parents actions and the court decisions. This cannot be a generic therapist and needs to be someone with specialist training and knowledge of these proceedings. While that is ongoing she needs boundaried parenting which seeks to protect her from her own poor decision making. The evidence is M cannot support that approach as at the current time as she is in denial about the risks and extent of P&#8217;s vulnerabilities; throughout her evidence M minimised the concerns. M lacks insight into herself, P and the conflict which has caused this situation and therefore cannot assist P in gaining this insight. All of the professionals agree that F is the only parent who can provide an environment for P which she requires. While it is not the perfect solution as it will cause P distress and F is still working on his difficulties, it is the only option that addresses P&#8217;s characteristics and gives her the best chance at an optimistic future and positive relationship with both parents. </span></p>
