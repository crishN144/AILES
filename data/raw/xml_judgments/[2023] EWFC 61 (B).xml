This judgment is reported within the National Archives with NCN </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/190" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 190" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 190</ref>. </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">My essential findings were that the father in this case (FF) is a paedophile and has a sexual interest in children. Further, I found he acted on that interest and had in concert with another sexually abused a child. The full details of my fact-finding is set out within the written judgment. I do not intend to recite that detail within this judgment.</span></p>

Prior to final submissions during fact-finding, she informed the Court she was troubled by the evidence she had heard about the father and had separated from him. Before me today there is common agreement that the child is safe in her care, and she is providing him with good care. It has been agreed for some time that there should be a final order in this case confirming his living arrangements in his mother&#8217;s care without need for a public law order.</span></p>

However, following the evidence of the social worker and the expert the father modified his position such that no further issues remained in dispute. Notwithstanding this agreement I considered I should provide a judgment setting out my reasons for approving the final orders approved by the parties. I consider the circumstances of this case merit clarity as to the manner in which the case ends both to inform the parties as to my conclusions and to inform any future litigation. Finally, I continue to bear in mind the significance of the decision I am being asked to make and consider the rationale for such should be set out in an appropriate manner. It is the least the parties deserve of the Court.</span></p>

The mother accepts the findings. The father applied for a specialist risk assessment from the well-known Lucy Faithfull organisation. On 17 June 2022 I approved such assessment notwithstanding that this would necessitate delay within the proceedings given the report would not be available until November 2022. I fixed an IRH for 5 December 2022. This delay was problematic but on balance justified given (a) the security of the child in his mother&#8217;s care, and (b) the fundamental need for a specialised risk assessment if contact between child and father were to be considered. In making this direction it was understood the assessment might proceed notwithstanding the denial of culpability. In due course Dr Andrew Smith (&#8220;the expert&#8221;) conducted the risk assessment and gave evidence before me.</span></p>

I was informed the father had failed to engage with the assessment. The applicant returned the matter to Court and on 4 October 2022, I discharged the direction for the assessment and fixed a final hearing for January 2023. Then 3 weeks later the father applied to recommence the assessment process. On 10 November 2022 I heard this application. There were many reasons for refusing this application but on balance I permitted the work to recommence. I reset the final hearing to this week. The father engaged with the assessment and the report is dated 26 January 2023.</span></p>

However, I recognise he has throughout remained in the care of his mother and continues in this secure environment. This final hearing could have been resolved earlier but that would inevitably have been based on less clear evidence. As such it would have potentially left the parents to litigate these issues at a later date within private law proceedings without the support, funding and professional input provided within these proceedings. With reservations I consider this delay has been necessary. In making this point I do not lose sight that the mother has also had to await the conclusion of these proceedings and this delay will have impacted on her emotional wellbeing.</span></p>

The applicant became concerned as to his safety in January 2021 when it became aware of a finding (analogous to my own) made against the father in proceedings in another part of the country. Prior to this the child had been raised by both his parents whilst they lived together in a relationship. The applicant engaged with the parents and agreement was reached that the father could not continue to reside with the mother and child whilst further investigation was undertaken. He moved out and contact was then supervised between the father and child by the paternal grandmother. At this point in time the applicant considered her able to safeguard the child from harm. Proceedings commenced in May 2021.</span></p>

However, the grandmother advised she could not discuss the allegations as she had been advised not to do so. This prevented a risk assessment being completed and led the applicant to conclude the grandmother could not safely supervise contact. Instead, the contact would need to move into a supervised setting. The father opposed the same and applied for the arrangements to continue. In the interim the applicant planned for and offered supervised contact. The father refused to attend / claimed he could not attend due to mental health issues. </span></p>

I should note the current expert evidence is supportive of this decision-making concluding that pending a reduction in risk levels with respect to the father it would be unsafe for family members to supervise contact.</span></p>

This paragraph sets out the approach a Court should take in cases in which domestic abuse is said to apply, both in the management of a hearing prior to any determination of the same, and, in the fall out from a finding that domestic abuse is a relevant factor for the court&#8217;s consideration when considering child arrangements. In this case there is no allegation of direct abuse of the mother or the child by the father and there is no evidence of the same. However, PD12J r.2 makes clear this practice direction does not require actual abuse to have taken place re the child in question or another party, the practice direction is also engaged in circumstances in which there is &#8216;risk of abuse&#8217;. For the avoidance of doubt risk of sexual abuse is an understood component of domestic abuse.</span></p>

The expert confirmed this work would have a timetable of commencing in July and finishing in November 2023. A report would be provided in December 2023/January 2024. The information indicated that such costs would not be met by public funding. This is undoubtedly the case in that it amounts not to an assessment but rather to therapy or quasi-therapy. This falls outside of such funding. The expert advised that there is no room for discounts for those who are impecunious. In his experience funding generally arose from those individuals who had the private means to fund the same or through local authority funding.</span></p>

The key positive prognostic indicators were the father&#8217;s relatively young age and the judgment of the expert that he has emotional intelligence and insight. It was a positive that the father was willing to do the work albeit the motivation for doing so might be that this was seen as the last hope of achieving contact rather than a more inward-looking reason. Against this though were a number of negatives which centred around the father&#8217;s sense of grievance and disempowerment and of having been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

I pause to observe that this work was commissioned in the understanding that this would likely be the position. However, for the avoidance of doubt I do not consider the assessing expert loses sight of the fact of denial. It is undoubtedly the case that this remains part of the overall assessment of ongoing risk. But it does not prevent work being done or risk being reduced.</span></p>

The key focus was on the potential for third party (family supervision) to be put in place. The expert was quite clear that for this to happen and to be safe the risk from the father would need to be reduced to a low level. This reflects the potential for a family members safeguarding ability to be compromised by split loyalties and by their personal relationship with the father. In cases of child sexual abuse, the perpetrator will breach boundaries of normative behaviour, and this can be done in a creeping and insidious fashion rather than in a stark and open manner. Close interpersonal relationships can be exploited by reason of the deeply seated personal bonds and ties.</span></p>

It is by no means uncommon for a Judge to ask local authorities to reflect on the provision of services and funding of needs within proceedings. However, in this case (i) the costs are significant in the context of stretched resources; (ii) the work falls entirely outside of proceedings; and (iii) the prospects of success are judged as being less than likely by the instructed expert. Realistically, I do not consider the applicant would modify its position in any event and its stance is justified. I do though agree there is a benefit in the work at both a micro and societal level. But it is for the government to make provision for the funding of such services and not a local authority in the position of the applicant.</span></p>

I would consider she would approach the question of such contact with appropriate care. She must be mindful of the potential benefits to the child but also as to the possible issues that may arise in circumstances in which the family may be advocates for the father and may directly or indirectly place emotional pressure on her so far as future contact with the father is concerned. Undoubtedly until such time as there is clear evidence to the contrary, she must keep in mind that they reject the findings of the court and in doing so do not consider the father to pose any risk to the child.

In the course of the hearing, I asked Ms Connolly KC what she would be seeking at the end of the hearing. The options appeared to include either adjourning for the work to be undertaken or making final orders with or without contact. I was not asked to adjudicate on this but would been most reluctant to agree to a further delay in the proceedings. To countenance a delay for the best part of a year would have required the most compelling reasons. I cannot identify on the evidence where they would have been found. This child demands finality. These proceedings have now endured for nearly 2 years. It has been many months since the mother and child have been ready to leave the proceedings. To adjourn to see what if anything happens with the rehabilitative works would be very difficult to justify let alone explain. To avoid any doubt at no point was I asked to do this.</span></p>

It would not have been right to proceed on the basis of professionally supervised contact as the only safe means of contact where there was no reasoned basis for a future exit strategy for the same and where the applicant would not be intending to remain in the parties lives outside the short to medium term. Further, such contact would have been analogous to a reintroduction of the father to the child given the gap in contact. It would have required some specific role for the mother to assist in the same. In my assessment there would have been strong countervailing arguments deriving from PD12J arguing against such a role. Furthermore, on the evidence received I would have had little if any confidence that the father would in fact have engaged with the works and I would have limited grounds for believing if he had, that this would have been successful in changing his risk profile. Finally, even were that the case there are no grounds for considering the family members would have shifted their attitudes such as to become safe supervisors of future contact. That would have left the applicant as supervisor or contact coming to end for want of practical support. Finally, I accept there would be real issues with obtaining a venue that would be willing to permit supervised contact given the findings in the case. Whilst the risk to the child could be managed, I accept the venues in question support other vulnerable individuals and the father&#8217;s risk profile is such as to cause any venue to be unwilling to assist.</span></p>

This is not a decision following which I consider the mother should feel free and unencumbered to choose equally between contact with the father or not. I have not reached a neutral evaluation as to contact. Rather the order is phrased in the manner it is because she has expressed a clear understanding of the Court&#8217;s findings and agrees these concerns place the child at risk. It is quite clear to me that the mother should not be contemplating any direct contact with the father without the clearest evidence of progress with respect to his risk profile. I would expect this to include some form of professional work and re-evaluation of risk akin to that proposed by the Lucy Faithfull organisation. Were it to be suggested that this had been undertaken then I would not suggest she simply rely on statements to the same but should require sight of the same </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">and should</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> seek professional advice from children&#8217;s services before acting upon the same? A failure to self-protect in this manner may in future call back into question her ability to safeguard her son.</span></p>

Within my fact finding I found evidence tantamount to grooming and expressed concerns as to the father&#8217;s approach to encouraging/coercing the woman involved with him to act in line with his personal sexual preferences. At times this behaviour verged on the bullying. I consider the mother has some vulnerabilities and she must continue to keep in mind the potential for this to be exploited. I consider any cards should be short and focused and should not draw the mother into a dialogue. I consider any updating from the mother should be also focused and clear. It should not encourage a dialogue. The mother has left these proceedings successfully. I now want her to build on this. I do not want her care to be questioned.</span></p>
