	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are private law applications concerning two children, S (a boy of thirteen; born on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004) and N (a girl of eleven, born on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2005), under the Children Act (CA) 1989. Their parents are separated and the children live with their mother in England. They are of dual heritage; their mother is British and their father is Swedish. This judgment concerns the complaints made by the children about physical abuse and bullying by their paternal grandmother and father when they have been spending time with him in Sweden. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The complaints centre on the allegations made by S that he was physically abused by his grandmother during the summer of 2016. N complains of bullying by her father. Both children complain about the behaviour of the paternal family and are adamant that they do not want to go back to Sweden at all. Their father (P &#8211; the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent) applies (by an application dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016) for a child arrangements order that the children live with him in Sweden and spend time with their mother, step-father and half-siblings in England. Their mother (C- the Applicant) applies (by an application dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016) for the previous child arrangements (contact order) to be discharged. There have been numerous other applications over the past seven years in respect of these two children; some of these have included very serious allegations made by C, most of which have been investigated by the authorities in Sweden and in England. None of them has been found to have any substance.</p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of this application by C, findings are sought that the paternal grandmother physically harmed S by grabbing his left arm and swinging him round in an unwitnessed incident during a holiday in Sweden in August 2016; and that P has failed to protect S from his grandmother&#8217;s behaviour, and has bullied the children. It is alleged that prior to that incident, in late December 2015, S suffered a &#8220;fracture&#8221; to his elbow while sledging in Sweden, and that P failed to ensure that S received any or adequate medical assistance and treatment. In addition, there has been reference to an incident at Manchester Airport in May 2015, when P came to collect the children to take them on holiday, during which the police were involved. N has, in the past, complained to her mother that children visiting her at her father&#8217;s home have involved her in sexual play on more than one occasion. C&#8217;s case is that the children are not adequately parented or safe when visiting their father, in addition to which they both say that they do not want to see their father or to visit Sweden again. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P and his mother G (the paternal grandmother) deny all of the complaints and allegations made against them. P seeks a change of residence and relocation of the children to Sweden to live with him as he says that is the only way they can maintain a relationship with him. G has been joined as an intervener to these fact-finding proceedings. They both appear in person before this court and have chosen to remain unrepresented. The children are represented by counsel (Ms Sweeney); as is C (by Ms Kansal).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant C (aged 37) is English and met P (aged 42) when they were both travelling in New Zealand in 2002. They returned to Europe and lived together in Sweden where they married in 2004. The children were born in Sweden, S in 2004 and N at the end of 2005. The marriage was short-lived and by the end of 2006 their relationship had ended. In 2007 C unsuccessfully claimed for damages for assault by P in the Swedish courts; P was to tell the family court reporters in Sweden that as a result he was fearful of being alone with C because she might repeat her accusations against him. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end 2007 there was an order for shared residence and care of the children in the former family home made by the Swedish court. Both parents were seeking a court order that the children live with them; P in Sweden, C in England. An investigation was carried out by the child welfare authorities who reported to the court, recommending custody be granted to P. This report was prepared almost ten years ago and no longer has direct relevance to the matters that I am asked to consider and decide in 2017. Nonetheless it was a thorough report and their conclusion as to the poor relationship between the parents; <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Communication between the parents in the current situation is virtually non-existent, which affects [S] and [N] in a negative way&#8221; </span>is an accurate reflection of a situation that has persisted until the present day. S&#8217;s learning disabilities were already apparent and it seems there was a provisional diagnosis of Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2007 divorce was granted and the Swedish Court (by a majority decision) awarded custody to the children&#8217;s mother with substantial visiting rights to their father. C was granted permission to move to England with the children and they have lived here since, albeit visiting their father in Sweden regularly. P unsuccessfully appealed this decision. Under the terms of the order C was to pay for the children&#8217;s travel to and from Sweden and P was to cover the costs of his travel, accompanying them. In October 2008 C stopped paying the children&#8217;s travelling costs. In December 2008 C contacted a domestic violence service in England complaining of harassment by P. In 2009 she stopped contact taking place altogether, a state of affairs that continued until March 2010 when an order was made by Mrs Justice Parker in much the same terms as those of the Swedish Court.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of Mrs Justice Parker was made as a result of P bringing proceedings to register and enforce the Swedish order in England. The children&#8217;s contact with their father resumed. In May 2010 P stopped paying maintenance for the children, a decision about which he has never given a satisfactory explanation. In June 2011 S was assessed in respect of his educational need and found to be autistic. It is an accepted fact that S is on the autistic spectrum; he has a statement of Educational Needs prepared in 2012 and reviewed annually since. Since he moved to secondary education he has attended a special needs school. He has a literal approach to life and an especial need to feel safe and secure in his surroundings. N is an intelligent girl who has attained a high level of scholastic achievement; she has managed to get a place in a highly sought after local secondary school which she is due to move to in September 2017. I shall return to the children&#8217;s individual needs in due course; keeping in mind throughout the welfare checklist as set out in s1 of CA. </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although contact continued to take place until August 2016, the relationship and communication between P and C remained very poor, characterised by mutual antagonism at best; at worst, harm is deliberately being caused to these children by a refusal on the part of their parents to reach some level of cordiality to enable reasonable communication with each other. It would be crass to suggest that the children are anything other than detrimentally affected by the poor relationship between their mother in England and their father in Sweden. Sadly, the documents filed in the case reveal persistent and repeated attempts by C to disrupt and/or stop the time the children spend with their father. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be virtually impossible for these children to fail to pick up on their mother&#8217;s hostility towards their father and her disapproval of their spending time with him. Whatever findings this court is able to make will not bring the case to an end as it is in the interests of the children that they are able to resume their relationship with their father and their paternal family with whom (on their own accounts) they have spent many happy times in the past. At its height, if the court accepts that S&#8217;s ABE interview is an accurate version of events, it appears the child was accidently injured by his grandmother when she became angry with him; he does not give any detailed or accurate description of any other incident. S says his father was not in the house and does not say that he complained to his father about the incident. The allegations of bullying made by the children about their father and the parental family are noticeably bare of any detail or description. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What will remain of concern, whatever the findings, is their vocal rejection of their father, their Swedish family and their refusal to go to Sweden again. They are, after all, half Swedish and need this side of their heritage to play a beneficial part in their lives, so as to construct both a wholesome and positive self-image and self-esteem.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meanwhile, the children&#8217;s English family life had substantially altered and grown in size. C met her present husband WC in 2008 and they began cohabiting in 2010. They married in September 2012. Their son [L] was born in July 2013 and their daughter [J] in June 2016. C is presently on maternity leave and is undecided about returning to work. There is no evidence before this court that there have ever been any concerns about either L or J and there are no concerns about S and N at home in England; where they appear to be well looked after and are settled into school and their own routines. Nonetheless these two children have another part to their family and it is their right to be a part of their Swedish family. It is worthy of note that, that this was another instance of C failing to keep P informed; both when she and the children began cohabiting with WC and later when they married; she should have done so. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As alluded to above, these particular applications arose out of the complaints of S following a summer holiday in Sweden in 2016. Some of the history of the proceedings prior to these applications has been set out above. After the order made by Mrs Justice Parker in March 2010, in May, P stopped paying child maintenance. In 2012 C made a further application to vary the contact order saying that there should be no contact at all. She had referred the case to the police regarding unspecified threats from P; which resulted in another MARAC (multi-agency risk assessment conference) in January of that year. No action was taken as a result of the MARAC. The case returned to court and was referred to Cafcass: a report was prepared, and a hearing took place and on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused C&#8217;s application to vary the contact order (C was no longer seeking a total cessation of contact). The children had told the Cafcass officer that they enjoyed being in Sweden and missed their &#8220;papa&#8221;. N told the Cafcass officer that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Mummy is kind of cross at Papa having to see us.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his judgment, the judge found that C&#8217;s attitude towards contact and the stipulations she made about P&#8217;s care of the children were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;patronising and unnecessary&#8221;</span> and rejected her assertions that P put the children at risk. He described as regrettable the fact that C had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;quite deliberately&#8221;</span> decided on the arrangements for the children&#8217;s schooling, in particular for S, without consulting their father. This criticism of C&#8217;s behaviour and the judge&#8217;s comment that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;this must change&#8221;</span> have gone unheeded and ignored by C over the past, almost five, years. P was unaware, until he heard it in court, that N had gained a place in a prestigious local secondary school. Despite the fact the court order included an undertaking from C that she inform P in writing of any intention to move the children&#8217;s schools she failed to do so in respect of N, and as such could be considered to be in contempt of court; more to the point, in terms of C&#8217;s behaviour, history has repeated itself. </p>

In order to do so, when the case was before the court in May 2012, C had taken pictures of the children&#8217;s genitalia, to show inadequate hygiene. C claimed that she was told to do this by a social worker, something the judge said that he very much doubted, and there is no evidence that she was ever told to so. In the course of this hearing C claimed that she had stopped the children seeing their father or even talking to him, despite a court order being in place, because she had been told to do so by social workers. This was subsequently denied by the social. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before Mr Justice Peter Jackson, and for the first time, C made extremely grave, and unsubstantiated, claims against P, including that he had raped her while in Sweden. During the hearing, she said he tried to kill her. There was no evidence to support her allegations. His judgment dealt with what were apparently further unsubstantiated claims made by C which lead to her being assessed as at high risk following the MARAC, but, there was no evidence to justify the assessment before the court. The Cafcass analysis carried out by a very experienced officer of the Cafcass High Court Team, John Power, was that C&#8217;s application should be dismissed and that the children should continue to see their father regularly and frequently. He considered C&#8217;s allegations to be ill founded and, in essence, malevolent or ill-motivated. The Cafcass officer, sensible of C&#8217;s apparent over-anxiety, suggested she seek professional help; a suggestion she rejected.  Mr Power said that C had done everything in her power to excise P from the children&#8217;s lives. Mr Justice Peter Jackson considered, at that time, that C was capable of moderating her hostility towards P; sadly, it seems, this has not proved to be the case. </p>

It ordered P to cover all the costs of contact which were to be set against any payments he may have to make for maintenance. P was seeking an order that the children travel by air unaccompanied. The Cafcass officer and the children&#8217;s schools expressed concern about this given their ages and S&#8217;s vulnerability; as did C. The court did not grant P&#8217;s application for unaccompanied , and it was, given their ages and S&#8217;s difficulties, more than a little premature. In this P demonstrated a lack of insight of the children&#8217;s feelings, and an over-pragmatic approach to S&#8217;s ability to cope with new or potentially difficult situations.</p>

Her Honour Judge Newton found that C arrived at the airport far too late for a comfortable handover to P and had contrived a scene when the children, unsurprising, became upset, and their father, who was anxious he would miss their flight, grabbed at N to try to get on the plane. C tried to proffer this court a different explanation from that which she had given the judge in June 2015, namely that it was the Bank Holiday traffic that held them up. To this court, in her written evidence, and to the social workers investigating S&#8217;s complaints in 2016, she repeated her story that a Police Protection Order (PPO) was issued despite the fact, as the judge had made clear in 2015, no such order was issued. The judge found that the circumstances which had led to the police involvement at the airport were &#8220;instigated&#8221; by C. I remind myself that C is the children&#8217;s mother and to deliberately put them in such an unpleasant situation so that contact could not take place, was antipathetic to their welfare. </p>

As I have said, C repeated this in her statement to this court dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016. This conduct of C, when she had attempted to seek professional &#8220;support&#8221; to justify breaches of the contact order, is something she has repeated in these proceedings, when she has sought to rely on the fictitious advice of a social worker as a justification for suspending all contact in the face of the order from August 2016 until she finally made an application in December 2016. Again, in June 2015, C was urged to seek professional help to deal with her inability to cope with the children&#8217;s contact with their father.</p>

The circumstances which arose in respect of this injury (which was not serious and had no lasting effect on S) on S&#8217;s return to England, are instructive and illustrative of C&#8217;s reaction to an accidental injury received by S whilst with his father. The day after his return to England, on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016, C took him to the local hospital. He was examined and the diagnosis was of a possible distal humeral fracture. He was found to have no bruising, some soft tissue swelling and moderate tenderness on palpation, with some limited restriction on his ability to fully flex or extend the limb. S was discharged with a collar and cuff, simple analgesic and referred to the fracture clinic, where no fracture was found or diagnosed. Despite this both C and WC continued to say in their evidence to this court that S had had a fractured elbow; indeed, WC described it as such in the statement he prepared and signed during the currency of this trial.<span style="font-style:italic"/>Of great concern to this court is the fact that S now believes that he suffered a fracture and that his father failed to get him the medical assistance he should have done.

This evidenced, filed by C in support of her case, was notable not only for failing to deal with S&#8217;s complaints to her in any detail, but also for once more seeking to implicate professionals in her decision not to return the matter to court as soon as she had decided to suspend the children&#8217;s contact, as she said she had been &#8220;advised&#8221; to cease all contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is be more than one possible reason for S&#8217;s undoubted anger and distress; he could be angry and distressed with his grandmother because she had hurt him. He could be angry and distressed because he has felt that he had been obliged to give a version of events which he knew not to be truthful, or wholly truthful. He could be distressed and angry because he has been placed in an impossible situation and has been forced to take sides. This court is aware that it is clear is that S believes that he suffered a fracture to his left arm after Christmas 2015; and that he was denied medical attention; in fact, this is simply not true but it is a repetition of an allegation made by his mother. I can only conclude that S now believes his mother&#8217;s story it to be the case as it is what he told the police officer in interview. C has repeatedly exaggerated the elbow injury and, in another deliberate attempt to call in to question P&#8217;s parenting of the children, has suggested, time and again, that S was denied appropriate care. The medical evidence before this court does not support her case; unfortunately, she has repeated it so often that S has now come to believe it himself. To this complaint he has added that at the time (December 2015) his grandma had manipulated his arm and hurt him; this was something that he had not complained of before, certainly not at the time. Had he done so I have little doubt it would have been used by his mother as a complaint against the paternal family in January 2016.</p>

In this C says S must be mistaken (or presumably not telling the truth) because he did not tell her but WC, and that was not until Sunday evening. C told me that S often mixes up days and times, but that he seldom mixes up places or where things happened and I accept her evidence. If this is the case, then S clearly told the police that his grandma had grabbed his arm at his dad&#8217;s house when his dad was a party down the street. It is the evidence of P and G that this could only have been on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016. The unchallenged medical evidence of Dr Mahmood is that it is highly unlikely that the bruises would have had the appearance they did when they were seen on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2016 if the incident which caused them had occurred over two weeks previously; namely on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016.<span style="font-style:italic"/>In his<span style="font-style:italic"/>S made some other generalised complaints about bad treatment and bullying by his father none of which he particularised; he said his dad bullied N and his grandma bullied him but did not give any details at all of what form this bullying might have taken.</p>

He produced pictures of the children in Sweden which he had taken for them, and which he said were evidence that they were happy there and enjoyed their time with their Swedish family and friends.

His previous insistence that the children should fly unaccompanied did not, in the view of this court, meet with S&#8217;s needs and could not work where parents are so adrift in their approaches.

Allowing for the fact that P was not legally represented, this is unsurprising. P told the court that he believed his mother when she told him that she had not hurt S; whilst this is also unsurprising he gave the impression of having sought an explanation and it is clear that he did confront her about it; he did not reach a forgone conclusion. P described the children&#8217;s Skype contact taking place when they were with their mother in England and when they were with him in Sweden. In Sweden, he told me they &#8220;Skyped&#8221; from upstairs in his house and that he left them to it as he believed that the children should have privacy when talking to their mother. He said he had explained this to them, and that it was in contrast to when they Skyped him from England when C (and the other children) were invariably present, their conversations were interrupted and curtailed, something else would be happening or they had to have their meal. I accept his evidence about the Skype contact. I do so in part because it is a fact C has complained about P&#8217;s parenting for years and it is more likely than not that she would not trust him when he spoke to the children and would remain in the room, or look for reasons to cut the conversation short.</p>

Dr Mahmood&#8217;s evidence was entirely straightforward and matter of fact. He said that he had taken the history from C which was given in the presence of all four children. The history given by C, as noted by the doctor included the repetition of allegations of domestic and sexual abuse of N, and that S had fractured his arm and that the paternal family had not taken him for any medical treatment. He was asked, by counsel for the mother if she had, filled out a form and not told him the history verbally, but the doctor said that C had not been required to fill out a form; that it was not his practice and that she had told him the history when the children were present. Dr Mahmood&#8217;s evidence was that the bruising he saw was likely to have occurred within in the past two or three days, at most, but he was punctilious in pointing out that bruising is not possible to date accurately. He could say that it was very unlikely to have occurred as long before as the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016.

There is no independent medical or other professional evidence to support C&#8217;s case that P neglected to get S proper or adequate medical care. The court is concerned that, far from being relieved that the child did not suffer a fracture, both C and WC have persisted in describing the relatively minor injury that S had in January 2016 as a fracture. No regard was given, by C or WC, what the effects on S may have been from the way they have chosen to deal with a minor injury which happened when he was sledging on holiday with his Papa; at the very least it will have gone some way to undermine his trust in his father.</p>

She said that she was scared and does not want to go to Sweden again. When asked, she said her father was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not nice&#8221;</span> and became more upset. She said that he only talked about himself and bribed them saying they would not get &#8220;DS&#8221; if they did not Skype him. That was the apogee of her complaints. She made no reference to anything else, but did say that P was not there when it is alleged S was grabbed by her grandmother. In this N was, I find, quite careful to make clear her father was not involved in the incident. The difficulties that the social worker had in engaging the children would have been considerably exacerbated by them being seen at home with their mother in the house, if not present for some of the time in the same room. This is not a neutral setting and would not have assisted in helping the children to speak to anyone independently. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The distress and fear was seen to be genuine by the social worker. If there is no basis for it; and there is no evidence that N has been bullied at all as even she cannot give any example of bullying; then either they genuinely believe themselves scared or they are putting it on.  If their mother has manipulated, allowed or encouraged them to feel scared and fearful of their father it is an act of real cruelty and emotionally abusive. Their seemingly total rejection of Sweden and their Swedish heritage is something they have both expressed and there is no evidence or indication that C (and by extension WC) have made any attempt to instil or encourage pride in them of that half of their identities. This may cause longer-term psychological harm and is also emotionally abusive. </p>

Although she was now represented by counsel she had previously been acting in person and her statements had been prepared without legal advice and assistance. I asked her about her husband and her family as she had not dealt with that in her written evidence; I have set out some of what she told me above. Additionally, missing from her evidence was any detail about how and when the allegations concerning S&#8217;s bruises came to light. S arrived back in the UK at about seven o&#8217;clock in the evening on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016, yet over two days were to go by before he was taken to the doctor or for medical attention. Going by her previous reaction to S&#8217;s slightly swollen elbow in January 2016 it is remarkable that no action was taken by C on Saturday morning, if she had, as she said the bruises had been seen on Friday evening. I reject her evidence of an insouciant approach to any such injury seen on S when he returned from staying with his father; on the contrary her previous reaction when S had hurt his elbow was to take him for medical attention the next morning.</p>

I have already made references to C&#8217;s repeated allegation that S&#8217;s elbow was fractured. Dr Mahmood brought a letter from the Orthopaedic Directorate to S&#8217;s GP to court dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 from a clinic held on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, written by Dr Lixenfeld.

S had been wearing a collar and was told to wean off it and refrain from sport for 3 weeks. From the outset, it should have been plain to this mother that her child had suffered a pretty minor injury. There is no evidence, whatsoever, that she was ever told either that it was a fracture or that it was serious, yet she has encouraged and allowed S and N to believe that not only was S&#8217;s arm broken but that their father did not look after him properly and that S should have gone to hospital. </p>

The continued allegation that P did not seek appropriate medical assistance was not supported by the evidence of Dr Mahmood who, as I have said, carefully explained to the court that carers or parents could have dealt with the minor injury to S&#8217;s elbow either by rendering first aid and monitoring the injury at home or by taking the child to hospital. As the guardian pointed out in her evidence, carers may well decide not to take a child to A &amp; E if it is not apparently necessary as it would avoid a likely long, stressful wait in a hospital. The fact that there was little to be seen (there was no bruising only minor soft tissue swelling) and that S had almost unrestricted movement in his left arm raises questions not only about the wisdom and necessity of taking him to be treated, but also the motivation behind C&#8217;s decision to do so. The message she gave S was clear and he, equally clearly, picked it up. Moreover, it is evidence of her likely reaction to any injury sustained by S which is visible on his return from Sweden.</p>

C said that the extent of the bruising was not seen by either her husband or herself until Sunday evening when S and WC had been playing a game involving sitting in each other&#8217;s chairs. WC had then seen the bruises and pressed S for an explanation, whereupon S broke down and said it was his grandmother who had caused it. Both C and WC gave very similar evidence about the circumstances in which they say they found out that S bruises had been caused by G. The fact is that this important evidence only emerged during this hearing.</p>

It is likely, and I accept, that S does not being liked questioned, but it is very unlikely, given the history of this case, that he was not asked repeatedly asked questions about how he came to have a bruised arm on his return from holiday. If the bruising had become more extensive or visible over the weekend that suggests that either it had occurred just before S left Sweden (perhaps when he was swimming or playing in Uppsala the day before he left Sweden) or that it had occurred shortly after he arrived back in England on the Friday. If S&#8217;s mother had seen any bruising on the Friday evening I do not accept that she would have left it at that; she would have kept asking S questions until he responded with an explanation she found acceptable. It is more than likely that she would have framed her questions in such a way as to suggest that P and/or his family were at fault.</p>

Her antipathy towards P throughout was palpable; I found her evidence in respect of the children&#8217;s contact with their father to be particularly telling; she was utterly unable to give one instance of when she had been happy for S and N to have contact with their father. During her oral evidence, she at first denied having stopped contact previously (in 2009/10) and only accepted that she had done so when reminded by counsel for the children. C was at times almost petulant when being asked questions and she was frequently evasive and dissembling; even when she spoke about the children her evidence lacked the spontaneity and warmth of P. That may well have been because she found giving evidence difficult but it was of concern to the court that she appeared to be so single minded that she was not able to put the children to the forefront of her mind.</p>

C said she had been upstairs and that they had just done it by themselves. I find this hard to accept; not only is S unable to write a letter (his was written by N) it is highly unlikely that he would have thought of doing any such thing on his own. This would mean that N had thought of and arranged it all. I do not accept that she did so; it was much more likely that their mother orchestrated the letter writing and then presented it to the court as something that had occurred to the children of their own volition. The contents of the letters are not childlike. This manipulation of her children is a further example of C&#8217;s inability to consider the children&#8217;s welfare before her own need to control events and eliminate their father from their lives. She is teaching the children to fear their father and to lie about their feelings for them. I found C&#8217;s evidence as to the circumstances in which S came to tell WC, and then her, that he had been injured by his grandmother in Sweden is neither reliable or credible. </p>

In essence, WC was called to corroborate C&#8217;s oral evidence, evidence which she had omitted from her written statements, about how and when S came to tell C and WC that his grandmother caused his bruises to his upper arm. I can accept that WC did not see the bruise on S&#8217;s arm while he was driving the car on Friday on the way back from the airport. I cannot accept that nothing was said or done about it then, still less that they did not discuss it that evening and did not ask S about how the bruising had come about when they arrived at home, or at all the next day (Saturday).</p>

The decision both C and WC took to deal with the minor injury to S&#8217;s elbow in the way that they did; and their constant repetition of the fiction that his elbow was fractured and that he had been denied adequate medical assistance calls into question their ability to put S&#8217;s interests first. Moreover, it gives lie to their assertions that they take a relaxed and easy approach to bruises and minor injuries. The effect that it has had on S is that he now believes himself to have suffered a broken arm, this can be seen in his ABE interview; the evidence before this court is that they have contrived to influence S before when it comes to injury that has been sustained on holiday in Sweden.</p>

In her oral evidence G appeared to be very fond of her grandchildren and of her family. In the summer of 2016, she told me, she saw S and N somewhat less than she had before; they would normally take a trip away and rent a house or cottage for a week during the summer holidays. There were two reasons why she did not spend as much time with the children; the first was that her husband, and the children&#8217;s grandfather, had been seriously ill after breaking his neck in May 2016, his mobility and memory have been affected. The second was that she was working on the end of a project on the restructuring of local authority taxation and finance for the Swedish Government; she spent several days at the end of the children&#8217;s holiday in consultations in Stockholm. As a result, she was more aware than normal of when she actually spent time with her grandchildren. She told me that she had to be at home in the evening to look to her husband&#8217;s needs.</p>

In their guardian&#8217;s estimation, the pictures were lovely and the notes entirely appropriate loving notes from members of the children&#8217;s family in Sweden. The guardian described the reaction of the children, S in particular to be, to use her word, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;extreme&#8221;</span> to her showing them <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;lovely photos and letters&#8221;.</span> S became distressed and read and tore up each letter and the photos having made sure he showed them to N first. He said he would like to burn them. When asked why, he said that he believed his father and his paternal family were lying by trying to prove they cared for him when they did not. They were, he said, trying to get them over to Sweden again, which he did not want. N was equally clear that she did not want to see her paternal family again. </p>

They told the guardian that they did not want her to visit again for a long time.  She has not seen them since. The guardian told me that the children&#8217;s reaction to the photos and letters was the most extreme she had seen in her experience as both a social worker and guardian. She said to me that she had seen children who had been very seriously abused by the parents who often exhibited conflicted feelings unlike the reactions of these two children to their parent and their Swedish family; there was, said their guardian, absolutely a wall put up. The children did not even think of their other country or align themselves with that country but, as she said, it was part of each child&#8217;s identity; the position that the children were in, whatever the cause, must be causing them significant emotional harm.</p>

The guardian said she was open to the possibility that their mother was over influencing the children. In answer to questions by counsel for C, the guardian said that the letters she had delivered were very general and very appropriate letters and that she did not consider it appropriate to deliver a message saying sorry from P or from G. S had reacted in an extreme manner to the whole situation, while N was very quiet and would rather the guardian just left. The guardian, in keeping with the current orthodoxy, accepted what the children told her as the truth. She told me that it is her view that S himself believes it to be true and she found the situation upsetting on the children&#8217;s behalf. Although she did not know the reason for the children&#8217;s distress and there was parental conflict theirs was an extreme reaction.</p>

It is C&#8217;s case that the children do not speak or understand much Swedish and that N cannot read it. This video would seem to suggest that she is lying or deluding herself about N&#8217;s linguistic abilities. Undoubtedly, N will be losing that skill and that her mother will be doing nothing to ameliorate that loss. </p>

The combination of P&#8217;s down-to-earth, no-nonsense approach towards C and C&#8217;s hyper-anxious approach towards P have not helped and they have become more and more distrustful and antagonistic in their dealings with each other. It would not be accurate to describe C as sensitive, or even over-sensitive, except in relation to herself; she has shown a complete lack of sympathy, little or no empathy and offered her children no support in respect of their emotional needs which includes a need to love their father, to enjoy his company and to spend a happy time in Sweden with their Swedish family.

It is more likely than not that she has repeatedly done so in front of the children at home. I find that C has repeated the story about S&#8217;s &#8220;broken arm&#8221; so often that S believes it himself and so he repeated it to the police, when he was interviewed. In fact, C over-reacted to a minor injury to S&#8217;s elbow sustained during play and deliberately set out to use it to try to build a case against P. There is no objective evidence or opinion before me on which I could base a finding that P failed to get S appropriate medical assistance or treatment in December 2015. I accept P&#8217;s evidence that S continued to use his arm without pain or ill-effect and that he continued to use his arm whilst playing until his return to England in January 2016.</p>

If C saw any bruising in the car, then it could have been bruising developing from some unidentified or forgotten accident that had occurred shortly before. It would not have been as a result of the incident complained of by S in his interview as his grandmother had only seen him at his aunt&#8217;s home the previous day and S made no reference to that in is ABE interview; the previous occasion G had spent time with S was on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August some nine days before he saw Dr Mahmood.

If he did so and did not, or more likely, was not, able to explain how he got them to his mother it is more likely than not that she would have continued to press him for an answer. Given her previous over-reaction to S&#8217;s elbow injury there can be little doubt that she would have continued to question the boy and it is very likely that she would have at the very least implied to him that the bruises must have been caused by P or as a result of his negligent care. I have little doubt that because of the years of antipathy and hostility S has seen and heard from his mother aimed at his father S would be well aware that blaming his father was what his mother wanted to hear. S must know that is what she wanted him to say and that he implicated his grandmother in order to exculpate his father. Once he did so there would have been no turning back as his mother would have believed she had found the excuse she wanted to stop contact taking place.</p>

Ironically WC bashed his own arm against the witness box when demonstrating what had happened on the Sunday evening. I do not think it likely that either C or WC deliberately hurt the child themselves to manufacture this story as they would have required S to go along with it, but it is likely that if S got hurt that weekend any injury that occurred would have been added to the complaint. It is more likely that S sustained a minor injury that neither he nor anyone else noticed before he left Sweden or even during the journey, which did not become apparent until later.  His mother noticed in the car coming from the airport as S, C and WC said and I accept that evidence. After that she then did not relent until S had given her the response she wanted; and which he would have known she wanted. It is very likely that, just as she did with the elbow injury, she then repeated and embellished whatever S may have said; albeit that he had done so to please her and to stop the distress he would have felt on repeated questioning. It is more likely than not that by the time S came to be interviewed over three months later the version of events acceptable to C was the accepted version within the family in England and what S had come to believe himself because it was easier.</p>

He had not dealt with it in his written statement. C sought to paint a picture of an uncaring father who dropped his children off without a word or loving farewell to them and without checking they had been safely met by C and WC. WC said that the drop-off was quick as he believed that P had to get the turnaround flight back to Sweden. He said that P and the children exchanged a few words and that P looked around to check that C and WC had seen the children before turning to get back on the plane. I accept WC&#8217;s evidence. I find that C was lying about this scenario; at best, she sees what she wants to see and retains that memory, but more likely she is being deliberately disingenuous and not only ignores the inhibiting effect of her presence on P and the children, but deliberately seeks to malign P in her evidence as she has done throughout. I have kept in mind that witnesses and parties may lie for many reasons, some of which are not easy to discern, and the fact that a witness has lied about something does not mean they have lied about everything; but, in respect of C all of her evidence is intimately bound up with her case and the lies she has told have all related to the version of events which she seeks to promote. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that C has never wanted contact to take place and has constantly and repeatedly tried to stop or undermine the time the children spend with their father. Her antipathy towards P and the children&#8217;s contact with their father has been so blatant and long-standing that that her six-year old daughter told a Cafcass Officer about it in 2012. The children are, I find, well aware of their mother&#8217;s attitude and hostility and they have been so for many years. <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>Finally, by manipulating her children, C has achieved what she has always wanted and stopped contact with their father. She has done so either because she cannot help herself or because she had quite deliberately set out to expunge their father from their lives. These children have suffered significant emotional harm as a result of their mother&#8217;s manipulative actions; aided it would seem by WC; he has certainly taken no steps to prevent it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact is that these two children have been emotionally abused by their mother. They are unable to contemplate the Swedish half of their own identity and exhibit such distress when asked about Sweden or their father that the professionals who have spoken to them since August 2016 have recommended to the court that the children will need expert help in order to rebuild their relationship with their father, their extended family and their Swedish heritage. Before August when the children were spoken to they were able to tell the Cafcass officer that they enjoyed seeing their father and spending time in Sweden but by August 2016 after years of experiencing their mother&#8217;s hostility they did what children in such situations often do, they chose to take sides in order to escape from the conflict, and, as is invariably the case they chose the parent with whom they lived. They will need assistance to be able to revert to their previously expressed desire to see their father and spend time with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is likely that C, who is more experienced than most as a litigant in person, did not return the case to court immediately in August 2016, as she knew she should have done and was advised to do, because she had not found the previous decision of the family court to her liking. C then sought to build professional support to justify her suspension of contact. The court is driven to conclude that she was likely to have ensured that the time elapsed was used to engender the alienation of each child from their father and the Swedish half of their identity. What she has done will have caused significant emotional and likely psychological harm to both children. S is a vulnerable child because of his autism, but it is not possible for this court to conclude that the harm caused to him is the greater, as N is an intelligent girl who is more likely to be aware of what is going on and of what her mother is contriving to do in undermining her relationship with her father. S too was aware of his mother&#8217;s stance. I accept the evidence of P that S complained to him after talking to his mother on Skype during the 2016 summer holiday in Sweden and on other occasions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept the recommendation of the guardian and social worker, Ms Clark, that to move the children precipitately and without preparation would be extremely distressing for them and probably cause further damage. Their father accepts that it would be very difficult for them to move, and that they, and he, would require professional support. That there would be appropriate professional and psychological support in available Sweden cannot be a matter of dispute; there are good schools, some of which are English medium, and it is more likely than not that an appropriate school place could be identified for both children, but none of these resources have yet been identified or put in place. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that N has achieved well at school and gained a place at a good school is an matter that I take into account, but it must be weighed against the likelihood of long term psychological damage caused to her by the continuing influence of her mother on her ability to form and maintain relationships (other than ones her mother approves of), and to have a healthy and positive view of one half of her own heritage and background. Education is a matter that I must have in mind by virtue of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1</ref> CA welfare checklist, but, N is only just to move to secondary education and it would not do irreversible damage to her education to move schools again later particularly if she was then able to attend school against the background of a more positive and inclusive home-life. As the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">J-M, </span>too much weight should not be given to short-term problems and the court is to take the medium and long-term view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no evidence that P has caused either child any harm and there is no reason for them to be scared or frightened of him; the fear they express has been induced in them by their mother. Contact is to resume as soon as arrangements can be put in place for the children to receive independent professional support. The local authority has knowledge of this case and in light of the court&#8217;s findings regarding the significant emotional and likely psychological harm being caused to them they are to prepare a s37 report by 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017; this is to include consideration of whether the children should be removed from their mother&#8217;s care and placed in foster-care to enable them to re-build their relationship with their father and their Swedish heritage. It is overwhelmingly in their best interests that they are able to resume their relationship with their father.</p>

At present, any work with the children should not take place at their mother&#8217;s house. Unless their mother can demonstrate that she can put into reverse the damage she has done, and she will need assistance to do so before the matter returns to court, active consideration will be given in respect of removing the children with the aim of their relocation to live with their father. They will have to move to live with their father in order to meet their needs and in the best interests of their long-term welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P has demonstrated considerable commitment to his children, travelling to and from Sweden many times each year. There is no evidence that he and his family have sought to undermine the children&#8217;s relationship with their mother, or any of the decisions she has taken without consulting P. It is the view of this court that P would be better able to promote contact and the children&#8217;s relationship with their mother and maternal family. P has a good relationship with the maternal grandfather and contact could resume there in the first instance; before the court gives final consideration as to the children&#8217;s long-term location. </p>
