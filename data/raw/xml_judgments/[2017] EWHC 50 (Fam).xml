Y is wholeheartedly supportive of X&#8217;s application. The clinic, the HFEA, the Secretary of State for Health and the Attorney General have all been notified of the proceedings. None has sought either to be joined or to attend the hearing. Given the nature of the issues (see below) I decided that there was no need for C1 and C2 to have a guardian appointed. </p>
