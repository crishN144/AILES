	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 August 2016 B, then aged three months, was admitted to hospital suffering from life-threatening head chest and abdominal injuries. The uncontested medical evidence is that they were inflicted injuries consistent with shaking, serious impact, or squeezing by human agency. For the last two weeks I have been embarked on the process of seeking to establish how B came to sustain those injuries. Two individuals have been identified as the possible perpetrators. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">B was born prematurely at 30 weeks on 10 May 2016. On 8 August 2016 a lodger at the premises where the family were living called 999.  B was admitted to the Gloucester Royal Hospital with reduced consciousness and unexplained bruising; she required resuscitation and her injuries were considered to be life-threatening. Further investigations revealed B had multiple fractures to her ribs, a capsular tear and laceration injury to her liver, a lesion in her spleen and trauma to both frontal lobes of her brain.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The injuries were considered to be inflicted injuries and as a result, care proceedings were commenced by the Local Authority. In a judgment delivered on 8 June 2017, His Honour Judge Marston concluded that the vast majority of her injuries had been inflicted by JL, the landlady of the premises where the family were living. He concluded that lies told by the mother did not shed light on whether she was the perpetrator. However he concluded in respect of JL that her lies were so consistent and pervasive that she must be trying to hide something and that she was trying to put the blame on the father and on the mother in particular in an attempt to protect herself. He accepted that an injury to her clavicle and her left sixth rib were caused accidentally by AC when B slipped when he was changing her and he grabbed her arm.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">I find taking everything into consideration that it is highly unlikely that this mother was responsible for those terrible injuries inflicted on her daughter. I can see no motive or reason for the assault, no emotional or psychological crisis or stress which would have induced her to do this and no diss inhibiting factor like drugs or drink which might have caused it. I find she lied out of desperation, fear and anxiety trying to set up an explanation that would bring the whole process to an end as quickly as possible. I do not find that this light casts doubt on her credibility on the other areas of the case. I believe her evidence that she did not hurt her baby daughter in any way and I therefore remove her from the pool of possible perpetrators on the basis that there is no realistic chance that she was responsible for the injuries of 8 August. That leaves us with a pool with one person in it, JL. I&#8217;m told not to speculate and I don&#8217;t intend to, however I have accepted that she had consumed drugs within 24 </span></p>

I know this is an extremely serious finding to make against someone who is unwell and unable to speak for themselves however all of the evidence leads me to a pool with only one person in it. I also have all the concerns about her evidence and conduct I have set out above. In those circumstances I find that the injuries sustained by eye on 8 August 2016 were inflicted by JL either in one or two incidents upstairs at house they all occupied, when she was alone with the baby.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the hearing JLwas suffering from psychiatric ill-health and was an inpatient in a psychiatric unit. Although some attempts had been made to engage her in the process the issue of her lack of capacity was not properly grasped and thus she was not represented by the Official Solicitor and was unable to give evidence at the hearing. Shortly after the judgment was delivered the Local Authority contacted the offices of the Official Solicitor, and requested a capacity assessment which at that stage concluded that she had fluctuating capacity and the psychiatrist recommended that she would benefit from a litigation friend and a reassessment.  By 1 August 2017 a further psychiatrist instructed by the Official Solicitor concluded that JL lacked capacity which continued when further assessed on 22 January 2018. On 5 December 2017, the Local Authority applied to reopen the judgment of His Honour Judge Marston. </p>

However, on 17 November 2017, she was seen by the health visitor who noted bruising on her face. When she was further examined, further extensive injuries were seen. The children were voluntarily accommodated under Section 20 and on 23 November the Local Authority issued a further application for care orders. Expert evidence was obtained from Dr Robinson and from Professor Kinsey. The Local Authority sought findings against the mother [ JD] in respect of the injuries B was found to have sustained in November.   </p>

When B was seen on 29 November 2017 in the company of her foster carer all her bruising disappeared and there is no evidence of new bruises.

She also concluded that the mother had deliberately missed appointments because she was reluctant to allow healthcare professionals to observe the extent of the bruising that B had sustained. She observed that the mother lacked insight into the physical needs of her children in terms of basic medical attention and found that the mother demonstrated a cavalier and peculiarly insensitive lack of understanding or empathy for B&#8217;s needs. She concluded her lack of engagement in securing appropriate medical assistance for B amounted to physical neglect and emotional neglect as well. She found that the mother was under significant pressure and could become angry under pressure. Whilst she had shown love towards the children she concluded that she had caused most of the injuries noted. She also noted that the mother had withdrawn from the children since 8 March 2018 and concluded that this was a further indication of her inability to prioritise the children&#8217;s needs over her own. </p>

In doing so, I make it plain that I am interfering to a minimum extent with any further decisions or findings which the Judge made in his Judgment of 8 June 2017.  Any challenge to these decisions (and particularly those which affect the mother) will be the subject of the next stage of this enquiry.  However, I am entirely satisfied that the next enquiry must proceed on the basis that JL continues to be represented by the Official Solicitor who has provided his consent so to act.  The extent to which his client will be in a position to participate in that forensic enquiry will be a matter which will be kept under review in the intervening weeks.  If JL &#8217;s condition has not improved by the date of the next hearing, she will nonetheless have the opportunity through her legal representation to test the evidence and protect her interests through Counsel instructed for the purposes of that hearing.  The essential safeguard was not available to her at the previous factfinding hearing and it is the reason why the findings made on that occasion cannot stand. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hyde QC on behalf of the mother raised the issue as to whether I should embark upon a determination of whether the mother was responsible for the August 2016 injuries or whether the appropriate course is to conclude that it is impossible to determine on the balance of probabilities whether the mother or JL was the perpetrator of the injuries but that both remain in a pool of possible perpetrators. Mr Hyde QC has argued that the evidential landscape is now such that it is so different to that which was available in the months after August 2016 or indeed up to the point when His Honour Judge Marston gave judgment in June 2017 that it is now not possible for the mother to receive a fair hearing of the issue of whether she was on balance of probabilities the perpetrator. Mr Hyde QC argues that the fact that the other possible perpetrator cannot give evidence and be cross-examined and the absence of other evidence and the passage of time means that it would be a breach of the mother&#8217;s article 6 ECHR rights to a fair hearing to embark on the process of seeking to determine whether she was the perpetrator. It is also argued that it is not necessary to determine the perpetrator of those injuries given that the threshold is admittedly crossed in respect of the November 2017 injuries. </p>

The nature and extent of the November 2017 injuries a wholly different in magnitude to the August 2016 injuries. It is not simply a matter of pragmatic use of court time. The circumstances in which those injuries were sustained are of interest not only to B and P as they grow older, but also of potential relevance to the mother and any partner with whom she has a child in the future at but also of critical relevance to child protection authorities in relation to any child that the mother care for or have in the future. Equally they are critical to anybody involved with JL. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In family proceedings, in particular, it is often the case that witnesses who are central to a factual allegation cannot be cross-examined. This will be particularly the case where an allegation is made by a child witness who the court concludes should not give evidence after a Re W hearing. However there may be cases where central witnesses have died or indeed where they have come to lack capacity and so cannot or should not give evidence. In the family court arena where hearsay evidence in the form of written statements is admissible as of right the contention that it would be a breach of a party&#8217;s article 6 right even to embark upon the evaluation of evidence in order to ascertain whether a conclusion on balance of probabilities could be reached seems to me to be a very high hurdle to leap. Of course, in evaluating the evidence and deciding whether a conclusion can be reached on the balance of probabilities the court must weigh all of the evidence including hearsay evidence and must take into account the fact that a party has not had the opportunity to challenge a witnesses account. That of course will be even more important where the witness is a central one; for instance as here the only other possible perpetrator. </p>

The conclusions on both the mother&#8217;s credibility and her responsibility for the injuries inflicted on B in November 2017 both support a conclusion that she was the perpetrator. However that only goes so far and the qualitative difference between the injuries inflicted in November 2017 and those inflicted in August 2016 reduce the weight that should be given to those findings. In this case the evidence suggests either that B was shaken and then thumped or suffered another severe blow to her chest or that she was shaken and severely squeezed at the same time. Although there may have been two incidents separated by a period of time it is more likely on the evidence the head and chest/abdomen injuries were inflicted at about the same time </p>

Surely if she thought B was very unwell at that point and had no idea why she would have immediately called the mother. </p>

The medical evidence is that B would have cried vigorously for some time. Whilst the mother from an early stage told people that she heard a weird cry JL  offers nothing which would indicate an assault by the mother on B. Aspects of her account as recounted by RL  are hard to reconcile with the timeframe that the contemporaneous evidence suggests events took place within (i.e. 10:04am through to 11:57am. RL &#8217;s suggestion that JL  had to hide at a neighbour&#8217;s home does not fit with JL &#8217;s account. If JL  was genuinely concerned about P why did she not immediately take him to the hospital as she had indicated to the paramedic that she would? This would be more consistent with an attempt to divert the focus away from her by suggesting that not only had the parents injured B but they had also injured P. Her allegation of gentle cruising was also without foundation. </p>

Mr Gammon emphasised that the court is hampered by the limitations arising from the evidence and the lack of clarity that has arisen as a consequence. He identified points where aspects of the mother&#8217;s evidence were consistent with other known facts but also that the mother has failed to give a credible explanation for some of Bes other injuries. There are aspects of the father&#8217;s evidence which appear hard to understand; why would he leave the house if he were so concerned about the state that JL was in in the state of the house? On the other hand his evidence about JL &#8217;s reaction to the possibility of them leaving appeared to be credible and genuine.

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion.  </span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reason.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one-person hearing accounts given by others.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a most significant feature of this case that one of the key witnesses and one of the two possible perpetrators JL has not been able to give evidence. This of course is relevant both to her but also to the mother, the other parties and the court. She has not been able to give oral evidence in support of her own account that she had nothing to do with the injuries to B but rather was at all times acting out of concern for her and to protect her. However her incapacity has also deprived the mother in particular of the opportunity to test and challenge her evidence. Given some of the unusual features of the case in particular JL &#8217;s admitted assault on the mother in the minutes before the ambulance arrived but also her drug misuse, her mental health, and medication use and their potential relevance to how B came to be injured have meant that the mother&#8217;s team have not been able to tease out inconsistencies, challenge the motivation for lies or to explore the possibility of irrational and violent behaviour. Inevitably considerable criticism has been directed at the mother in relation to inconsistencies in her account, lies she has told and violent acts she has committed to B. Had JL  been in a position to give oral evidence it seems inevitable that some of the focus on the mother&#8217;s oral evidence and credibility issues would have been either diluted or to a greater degree balanced by similar points that would have been made about JL . Of course to a degree this must be speculation but the nature of the evidence is such that there is an evidential foundation for these points and in my overall assessment of the totality of the evidence and the weight that I give to it I must </p>

However he was present during the minutes leading up to the arrival of the ambulance and appears to have been present in the house after the mother and B departed and for the two hours prior to the police arriving to collect P. He was clearly closer to JL than he was to the mother and father. They appear to have had a common interest in the drug scene. JL told the police that she knew he wanted to be as she put it &#8220;off grid&#8221;. It seems probable that between the departure of the ambulance and the arrival of the police that he and JL were cleaning up her home most probably to remove some of the drug related items that might have been there. What evidence might he have given as to JL &#8217;s demeanour and conversations in that critical period. By 9 August he gave a statement to police which contained information which was more consistent with the mother&#8217;s account than with JL &#8217;s and she had given an account probably late on 8 August.

The absence of any material from the phones of the father and the mother and the subsequent destruction of the phones by the police is a surprising void in a case such as this. In his evidence before His Honour Judge Marston the father appeared to recall spontaneously that he may have taken a photograph of JL that morning given his surprise at what he says confronted him. However enquiries by the Local Authority with the police did not result in the production of any material but rather it seems confirmation that the phone had been destroyed. It would be bold indeed of the father to make such an assertion were he to have known both that the account of her condition was fabricated and that no such picture could exist. Given my conclusions on his general credibility in my view it is unlikely that he did make it up deliberately although of course it is conceivable that his memory was playing him. Furthermore there was no evidence as to what passed between the father and JL  at the hospital when P was handed over to the father. It seems as though police were present and there is no police statement which sheds any light on either what was said or how each acted towards the other. In his oral evidence the father was asked about it and appeared to have difficulty recalling although was able to say that he had kissed P and had exchanged words with JL  that he could not recall the detail of what was said although he said that she appeared to be running off. </p>

For instance the father describes taking one of the children to the health centre whilst they were at JL &#8217;s but this does not appear as far as I&#8217;ve been able to ascertain in any of the documentary evidence. It appears likely that he was giving accurate information about this given the context in which he described it and it is of some relevance in that it would tend to contradict JL &#8217;s evidence that the parents, in particular the mother were disengaged from or reluctant to engage with health services.  </p>

In other respects though complete and clear sections are present. In reaching my final conclusions as to whether the Local Authority have proved that the mother or JL  probably caused B&#8217;s injuries or whether there is a real possibility that they might have I am conscious of the limitations in the evidence and the associated limitations that that has placed on both the mother and JL &#8217;s ability to have a full hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother gave evidence through an interpreter. Apart from some very minor issues in the spectrum of interpreters I thought he was careful and accurate. He explained that when the mother and father used the words &#8220;little girl &#8220;that it was an affectionate expression commonly used in Portuguese. Overall I thought the mother was able to give her evidence well through the interpreter. Her presentation came across as rather detached - there were rare flashes of emotion when some question required her to connect more closely with the subject matter; for instance when I insisted that she looked properly at the photographs of B&#8217; bruised abdomen and try to explain how she had sustained those injuries. There has been no psychological assessment of the mother which might shed light on this appearance of detachment from her emotions. If it is a more general feature of her personality it might go some way towards explaining the concerns that various people have raised about her detachment (or lack of interest or lack of warmth) from B and P. She explained that she had been the victim of abuse herself at the hands of her mother in Portugal and that she herself had been put in a coma by her mother. This is not been verified one way or the other but nobody suggested it was fabricated. It again though was described in a detached unemotional manner which again suggests that the mother does not connect readily with her emotions or has disengaged herself from them. The account she gave in her oral evidence was largely consistent with the evidence she had given in 2017 and with her account in her witness statement and earlier in her police interview. She was pressed hard during cross examination on the events of the morning of 8 August but there was no significant alteration in her account. In the main she appeared to be able to hold her own although I thought there were occasions when she tired or appeared to flag or give up and so on occasions her responses were tinged with resignation. At times she paused and appeared to try to recall matters where I thought she was genuine rather than seeking the answer which she thought best presented her case. She</p>

There were occasions when she might have sought to shift responsibility to others; for instance who gave the history to clinicians that hospital but she accepted that it was she who had provided most of the details not the father. On the other hand, she suggested that JL  had done most of the talking with the paramedics and at one stage seem to suggest that she had not spoken to them. I do not accept that this can be right and it may have been an attempt by her to provide a false explanation for how the paramedics came to record what they did about her apparent lack of concern for B. Ultimately, I conclude that it is a mixed picture with the mother in terms of her credibility as a witness. Parts of her evidence would appear to be true; they are consistent with earlier accounts and consistent with other known facts or common sense. Other aspects were less reliable and of course she has told frank lies in relation to this set of injuries and has been found to have lied and behaved deceptively in relation to the November 2017 injuries. Thus no one size fits all rule can be applied to the mother&#8217;s evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has undoubtedly got problems with her credibility. Mrs Justice Roberts found and Mr Norris rightly emphasises that not only has the mother lied about important matters relating to the November 2017 injuries, but she has lied about her willingness to take B to medical professionals. She has been found by Mrs Justice Roberts to have inflicted nasty injuries on B on a number of occasions by the use of clearly inappropriate force which would have been distressing to B. She continues to date to deny that she inflicted those injuries notwithstanding those findings. Mr Norris rightly points out that the mother frankly accepts that she lied to the social worker in August when she gave the account of JL &#8217;s Akita dog treading on B as being a possible explanation for her chest and abdominal injuries. This is particularly germane to the question of who inflicted the injuries and why this lie was peddled.  It emerges from her evidence that other lies have also probably been told. She told the police that she had not called an ambulance because she did not have credit on her phone but this is rapidly exposed as a lie because she called the father. In her witness statement she said that B had been with JL  overnight for nearly a week. This contradicted what she had said in police interview. In her oral evidence she also said that it was only for a couple of nights. The father also was clear (and the way he gave that evidence it appeared to me spontaneous and connected with his recollection) that JL  had only looked after her for a couple of nights. JL  herself said in her first statement that she was caring for B every night which appears both unusual but of course incompatible with anyone&#8217;s account of the morning of 8 August. At the time the mother made her statement the medical evidence as to when the injuries were caused was not clear and so the mother may have had a motive to maximise the amount of care that JL  was providing. By that time the mother was of course aware of the contents of JL &#8217;s second statement which was so very critical of the mother. </p>

Individuals connection with time varies considerably in any event and unless there is any particular reason to be clock watching many people will be unaware of the precise time and will not be noting how </p>

If anything the mother&#8217;s lack of accuracy about times is more suggestive of nothing significant having happened until sometime after 10.  At this distance from events anyone&#8217;s recall of timing is likely to be severely hampered.  It emerged that the reference to B vomiting in the days before the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> was nothing more than &#8216;posseting&#8217;. This was consistent with the father&#8217;s evidence. His reaction to the suggestion that he had routinely been adding baby rice to B&#8217;s milk to make a porridge -like substance was revealing. It was spontaneous and I thought genuine when he responded with surprise and a degree of indignation at the suggestion that he would have been doing that. He accepted that he had added a little baby rice because they thought B needed more than just formula. That also would be consistent with them having altered the teats on the bottles to increase the flow of milk. The mother in her oral evidence was similarly indignant; it was one of the rare moments of animation. Overall I did not consider that the evidence from the mother and the father indicated a lack of care in their feeding of B. This of course is in complete contrast to the picture painted by JL  and supported by RL . I conclude that the reason for the differences is probably to be found in a combination of JL  considering she knew best, some cultural differences, a tendency of JL  to dramatise and evidence being given in the hothouse of concern over who injured B. </p>

She was cross-examined on why she would have put B back upstairs when she had already had some concern about JL &#8217;s behaviour as a consequence of what the father had told her that morning and her finding JL  in B&#8217;s room shortly before. With the benefit of hindsight, it is understandable that the mother&#8217;s actions in putting B back upstairs would be challenge. However if one attempts to put oneself in the mother&#8217;s shoes on that morning before any serious concern had emerged putting B back upstairs is hardly unusual even if the mother had been told that JL might be a little the worse for wear or behaving slightly oddly. No one would have thought B would end up near to death that day. </p>

She said that by the time the ambulance came her colour had deteriorated. There was some testing of what was said by the mother and JL  at this point.

I am left unsure as to whether she did say this at all notwithstanding her saying she remembers saying it.

She said she used the word &#8216;ambulancia&#8217; and that JL  was talking putting sugar under her tongue. She also said that JL would not give B to her. Her account of why she had not called the ambulance was hard to follow. She plainly had a phone and a phone which had credit on it as she called the father. Thus the account she gave the police of not calling an ambulance because she had no credit was not true.  It is during this phase that she describes again how JL was sitting on the sofa holding B and she was trying to get B from her and that JL punched her and kicked her in the stomach. A possible discrepancy in this account has given to His Honour Judge Marston was explored but I was satisfied that the mother had gestured during that hearing and this accounted for the apparent discrepancy. This aspect of the mother&#8217;s evidence at first blush might be dismissed as the fabrication of a desperate woman seeking to divert attention from herself and to create an image of another possible perpetrator behaving violently in order to raise the possibility that they had also hurt the baby. However we know that she is telling the truth on this not least because JL  in her statement of 28 October agrees that she punched the mother. It was also corroborated by what the mother told the father when they spoke at around midday and also by what the father told EC when they spoke shortly thereafter. </p>

In general I thought the combination of the interpreter and the video link worked well and the father was able to give good evidence. Overall he appeared to be trying to give as accurate an account as he could. He appeared to be quite child focused (for instance talking about the loss of the children&#8217;s possessions being more important than the adults and how he was sad for B that her mother was not seeing her). He was balanced in relation to the mother being neither overly hostile to her or obviously protective of her. He expressed sadness at the fact that she had been found to have hurt B. He made clear that much of what he had said was based on what he had been told by the mother and said that he had trusted her. On various occasions throughout his evidence he said that he wanted to know what happened, when he was unable to remember something he generally said so and explained that he didn&#8217;t want to mislead and on a number of occasions he either corrected himself or corrected counsel if they had made an error. In those ways I concluded that his oral evidence was in most ways honest. However it was equally clear that the passage of time had dulled his memory. There were many occasions when he said he could not remember or could not remember clearly and then occasionally some factual matter might spur his memory. However I do not think he now has a clear recall of what was said and done on 7 August, nor the morning of 8 August, nor precisely what was said on the telephone by the mother on 8 August or what was said at the hospital. A combination of the passage of time and perhaps the stress and distress of events on that day and subsequently mean that as at December 2018 his recall of events is more limited than it once was. </p>

At [G208] he set out a narrative account of the circumstances leading up to 8 August and the events of the day before and the day itself. He explained that he had not been in the house himself but said that he got up to go to work at 6am and that during the night B had woken up for a feed eaten and then gone through the normal procedure and she had gone back to sleep. He said that after leaving for work he would be checking on the mother and children by sending messages or by calling and that on the morning of the eight the last time he had called all was fine. He said just good gone downstairs with P and B was sleeping upstairs. He said JD heard the baby crying and she went upstairs and saw that JL was with B he was pale. He interpolated that JL &#8217;s had punched and kicked JD before returning to the narrative of JL going downstairs and an ambulance coming. He said that the mother had called him and said B was not well and so he left his work and went to hospital. At the hospital he found the mother on the phone to somebody who was a translator. In the course of the interview the father was clearly anxious and concerned about what he should say. He did not seek to make accusations and was reticent about making allegations of any sort. He appears to have been somewhat reluctant to talk about JL and her drug use he was more inclined to look for explanations in what he might have done to B than to accuse others. He identified that he might have injured Bes shoulder when she fell from his lap. He wondered whether he had caused her internal injuries when he had massaged her stomach to deal with her colic. He said that he had left finger marks on B when bathing her as her skin appeared to be more sensitive although he did go on to say that they usually disappeared. When questioned on his account he repeated his narrative of B waking in the night and being fed by JD, him waking at six and leaving. He said he had to get the bus although it appears actually he was collected by a colleague that day. He said during his first interval he had called home and everything was fine. </p>

On the other hand the account given by JL and LB may be slightly overdramatised. Does that mean that he is lying about other matters? An incident of domestic abuse is likely to result in the perpetrator seeking to minimise or cover up what they have done.

Mr Norris is right to point out that in his evidence he prefaced it during the early part of his evidence by saying he wasn&#8217;t sure it was that day but then recalled clearly that it was that day. He again made the connection with having remembered that he took photograph of her passed out and in his evidence to His Honour Judge Marston when he recounted it it prompted him to laugh for which he apologised.

I got up at 7:45 AM and no one else was up. After about an hour I heard the children waking up and about half an hour later JD bought P downstairs with me. I asked her where B was and she replied that she was sleeping. JD fed P and gave him a drink and then she went to the bathroom on the ground floor. I then took the opportunity to go and check on B and I went upstairs with P into AC and JD&#8217;s room and B was in the Moses basket on the floor. The basket was leaning across piles of clothes with the head end of the basket raised. This was approximately 10 AM. I noticed immediately that B&#8217;s complexion was grey and her lips were bleached of colour and very pale. When I saw B she was awake with her eyes open, however she was silent and not making any noise. I noticed that her breathing was unusual-I would describe it as a fast pant. I bent down and removed the blanket and picked her up. She was nonresponsive to anything that I did, for example stroking her cheek usually makes her smile and tickling her ear usually makes her shudder. When I touched her body, her temperature body colour seemed okay, however her face, fingertips and ears were grey. After approximately five minutes, JD came into the bedroom behind me and saw B and agreed that she was a bad colour. We decided to take B outside to try and boost her oxygen and improve her colour. As we walked downstairs to go outside, B started to stir and wake. We went outside into the rear garden and whilst I was holding her I patted B softly on her back. She did bring up some wind and appeared to relax and got a bit more colour in her face. After approximately 10 minutes we went back inside my handed B to JD. She then sat down on the sofa and cuddled her so I went upstairs to check the room that B was in. This was when I noticed a bottle on the side next to the Moses basket, which had approximately 2 &#189; ounces left in the bottle. I took the bottle downstairs in the kitchen to make a fresh bottle and when I opened it to pour it in the sink I noticed that it was thick and had baby rice in it. I went back into the living room and gave JD the fresh bottle and she started feeding B. P was with us the whole time. I returned back to the kitchen to clean the other bottle and about 30 minutes later I went back into the living room and JD was winding B as she had drunk about half the bottle. I noticed that B looked grey again and the colour in her lips had gone pale. I said to JD that B was not right and that we needed to take her to the hospital. JD said </span></p>

We were both looking at B and I turned up her top lip to see the colour of her guns and I noticed a bruise under her tongue where the skin joins the bottom lip. The bruise was not present to the day before because I had fed B the day before and would have seen it. JD seemed surprised to see the bruise and could not give an explanation for this bruise. I kept saying to JD that we needed to take her to see a doctor and I was getting upset because she was refusing. I pulled up B&#8217;s vest to check her colour and see if she had any pain in her tummy and I noticed that she had about five individual bruises on her chest between her throat and abdomen. The bruises look like finger pokes. JD did not seem surprised to see these bruises and said that these bruises were from lying on the blanket. I would doubt that this was a feasible explanation as B sleeps on her back. JD tried to take B upstairs and she took a few steps up the stairs. I managed to talk her into coming back down and I took B off of her. JD was insisting that I gave B back and as I was going out of the front door, Lee arrived home from work. I told Lee that the baby was ill and to ring an ambulance straightaway which he did. I waited in the doorway for the ambulance and it arrived within about 10 to 12 minutes. JD was screaming behind me not to take her baby. When the ambulance arrived they examined B inside and JD started to cooperate.</span></p>

Others in particular the events of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of August standalone. In other respects her statement is silent on some matters of significance. Given the inability to test the evidence it is much harder to know what to make of JL &#8217;s accounts. The length and detail of her October statement suggest either an incredibly meticulous and detailed memory, a degree of obsession or a partly created narrative. The language used in it at times feels overdramatised. She talks of incidents being horrendous or B&#8217;s hand being all bloody from her nails being cut, the father being proper spiteful in the way he jammed B&#8217; bottle into her mouth. Although critical of the father she was also complimentary of his ability to learn. She was highly critical of the mother in terms of her childcare or ability to take advice from JL. The level of criticism she directs at the mother in terms of her interest in B or her capacity to care for her is not corroborated by anything the health professionals observed. His Honour Judge Marston thought this was a very significant feature and it forms a central component of his conclusion that JL was lying about the mother and that the reason underpinning that must have been connected with her desire to cover up her own actions and divert attention to the mother. She talks about how she took over the care of B who then made glowing progress being much happier and more alive than she had been before. Again this sounds like an exaggeration and does not find any parallels in the health professionals observations. She is critical of the mother&#8217;s willingness to engage with medical services; regrettably the red book which would demonstrate the involvement that B had with health services in the three weeks prior to 8 August is not available. In her statement she complains that the mother and father had not paid her rent because they wanted to spend the money on shopping. This is wholly at odds with the mother and father&#8217;s account and I think at odds with the father&#8217;s nature. It seems likely that she was aware by this stage through DC McGurk that they were accusing her of having stolen money from them. She deals with her dog and his attitude to children which suggests she had been made aware of the mother&#8217;s lie that the dog had trod on B.   </p>

This seems neither likely or consistent with the mother and father&#8217;s accounts of that day and is an exaggeration. She says that the father became irritable in the course of the Sunday evening but does not say anything about why that might be. The other evidence shows that it is likely to be connected with his money going missing, the presence of a group of individual smoking drugs and the ill feeling that was generating together with JL &#8217;s concern over their probable departure.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">mother did not bring B down with her in the morning. It appears from the mother and father&#8217;s accounts that the general routine was that after her 10am feed B would go down for a sleep. Her account of the events then broadly follows the account she gave in her 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of August statement although she includes a lot of further detail about the conversation including attributing many direct quotes to what she and the mother said. It seems unlikely that those could truly have been recalled by her some three months after the events. Her account of the interaction between herself and the mother ranges from her yelling at the mother through to her crying in this causing the mother to become upset she then describes wrestling with the mother to get B back grabbing hold of the mother to stop her going upstairs and said that the mother then got physically aggressive at her which resulted in her punching the mother when the mother grabbed B and took her from her. She said that she thought about 20 minutes past between her first noticing that B was ill to the point of calling the ambulance. This is not at all consistent with her first statement in which she says that she was in the kitchen for around half an hour after they had come downstairs spent some time in the garden and then come inside again. She gives a very dramatic account of JD putting on an act wailing oh my baby my baby my baby but it all appearing an act and made her feel quite sick to be honest. She describes the mother as being hysterical when the ambulance arrived which is wholly inconsistent with the paramedics&#8217; accounts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The second statement in particular has an overdramatised quality to it. This does not necessarily mean that the core factual account is not true but is simply illustrated in florid language. On the other hand it may be an indication of a concerted effort to paint the mother and the father in a bad light and to ensure the focus of concern is directed at them. Having been unable to see JL give evidence it is almost impossible to gauge where the truth lies. The absence of any other contemporaneous corroborative evidence as to the period between 10am and midday makes the assessment of JL &#8217;s account of that period and the mother&#8217;s account of that period a largely self-contained process. Of course, one can draw on other evidence which might illuminate how the individuals might be expected to behave. The overall picture though is so extraordinary and unusual that it is difficult to draw inferences by comparing it to what might usually be expected or by reference to common sense. </p>

Mum told me that whilst the paramedics were there and putting B in the ambulance JD appeared to display concern and was crying saying my baby.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">RL gave evidence about her mother as a person but also spoke about her experience of her mother&#8217;s relationship with the mother father B and P in the just under three weeks prior to 8 August.  In the limited parameters of the period over which she gave evidence and the issues on which she gave it I thought that she was attempting to give an accurate account. Clearly much of her evidence was either derived from what her mother had said to her or was to some degree influenced by what she had picked up from her mother. In a strange reversal of roles it appears that JL was hiding from RL  both her financial difficulties but more importantly the extent to which she was abusing cannabis. It was clearly the case that RL had gained the impression both from her mother but also from her own experiences that the mother&#8217;s and the father&#8217;s parenting of B and P was a cause of concern. Having said that RL attributed this to cultural differences and the concerns were not so great that it caused her to do anything. Given that even then she had been working in a nursery for some two years had she been really concerned it seems probable that she would have raised her concerns with social services who were already involved in the family. Some of the concerns her mother raised appear to have been unfounded or exaggerated; notably the alleged bruising to B&#8217;s genitals. It was clear from RL &#8217;s evidence that notwithstanding her mother&#8217;s concerns this became a non-issue. Although only one example it does suggest that JL was capable of either misinterpreting or overdramatising concerns.  It seems clear from RL &#8217;s account that her mother did become very quickly attached to B; perhaps the absence of her children created a void which was filled by B and P. The extent of her interest in them and her willingness to take on their care and her enlisting others suggests she had very quickly developed an attachment to them which is not entirely easy to understand. She clearly was concerned for them but equally did not raise any concerns with social services or the health visitor or a doctor all of whom were either visiting or a short call away. This might simply be a natural reticence to involve authority or might indicate that the stated concerns were actually not at the level JL &#8217;s statement depicts. Given RL &#8217;s evidence based on text messages corroborates a level of concern prior to 8 August it seems inconceivable that JL&#8217;s later statement about her concerns was entirely an artifice to deflect attention from herself onto the parents. There may have course be an element of playing up the concerns at a later date but they are clearly not entirely manufactured. RL gave her statement on 5 September some four weeks after. The account set out of how the mother explained that she had found B grey and tried to comfort her and encourage JD to do the same and put B inside her top for physical contact and warmth followed by her telling that she needed an ambulance is a very condensed version which is consistent with both JL &#8217;s and with the mother&#8217;s accounts. The additional detail of her mother having told her that she thought B would die does not appear in JL &#8217;s first statement nor does the suggestion that it was LB who took matters into his hands by phoning an ambulance. The suggestion that JL  had to hide at a neighbour&#8217;s home finds no corroboration in any other statement. RL  says that her mother told her that when the ambulance arrived JD appeared to display concern was crying saying my baby. Her mother appears to have told her that P went with the paramedics and that the mother followed shortly afterwards with the police. Given the passage of time and that the account is in any event a summary of what she recalls her mother saying to her in a telephone conversation it is of relatively limited help in understanding precisely what happened on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. Some parts are consistent with other accounts. There are some aspects for instance JL hiding at a neighbour&#8217;s home which can only come from JL and yet it does not appear in any other account. Either RL &#8217;s memory is playing her false or her mother told her something which was not true. The absence of any reference to her mother punching JD also illustrates that this is far from a full account. </p>

The effect of her evidence was that it was very quickly apparent after her mother moved in with her that her mental health was deteriorating. Although RL  said that her mother had seemed fine over Christmas this would not be inconsistent with the variable presentation that Dr Sanikop notes. It seems clear from her evidence that JL &#8217;s mental health took a clear downward path from January 2017 onwards. What is not clear is what the pathway was prior to that point. </p>

She said she made a good recovery and had no further contact with mental health services until recently. She attributed her recent break down to a lot of different problems; the family leaving home, empty nest syndrome, struggling to live alone. She also said she had been on antidepressant medication for 20 odd years and that attempts to change this led to a significant deterioration in her mental condition.

A reduced level of consciousness on eighth August was because of blood loss. The possibility of a severe head injury on that day cannot be excluded but she recovered from it rapidly once she&#8217;d been resuscitated from the other injuries if that were so. The clinical shock appears to be more probably connected to the liver lung and cardiac contusion. </p>

The father&#8217;s evidence together with EC&#8217;s recollection of the telephone call the night before (and where he could not have been got at before he gave his statement) supports this conclusion. If there had been a dispute with the father and if there were other individuals around smoking cannabis which I conclude there were, I infer from that both that JL was likely to be upset to some degree and participated in cannabis consumption to a greater degree than she might on a normal evening. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">However of course the fact that there may have been a big party the night before proves little on its own. JL  may have had a very messy house and may have smoked cannabis on the night of the seventh; possibly a significant amount of cannabis. However that does not prove that she assaulted B. There is no evidence from Dr Sanikop that addresses the issue of whether the consumption of cannabis in combination with paroxetine and/or tramadol might lead to irrational, aggressive or other negative behaviours. Nor does Dr Sanikop address the question of whether the aggressive behaviour that is so clearly present in 2017/2018 might have had an early flare-up in August 2016. It is right that Dr Sanikop notes that a particular feature of JL 's psychiatric presentation was a fluctuating degree of cognitive awareness but he does not shed any light on whether this might have had some relevance to her behaviour on 8 August. By January 2017 she had lost her home and had had to move in with her daughter. Whilst at her daughter RL noted worrying behaviour. RL said that in her view her mother was fine at Christmas time and it was the eviction on or about 7 January that marked a turning point. In this respect I think it would be speculation to somehow seek to back count or predict anything in relation to JL 's psychiatric condition in August 2016. All one can say is that by then it is probable she had significant rent arrears which put her occupation of that property in jeopardy. It must have been a stress. It also seems probable that as a result of the meeting between social services and the mother and possibly JL  seeing documentation that she was aware that the mother and father would not be staying long with her. This would have had a number of consequences. First of all it would lead to further financial pressure, secondly it would mean that P and B to whom she had become attached would be leaving. From what JL  and RL  have said it seems clear that she missed having children around her and say their departure would have been upsetting. If she was concerned about the parents care of the children whether at a lower level arising from cultural differences or at a higher level this might have added to her upset. Her misuse of tramadol apparently in conjunction with paroxetine together with her abuse of cannabis is likely to have had some effect on her mental state although it is impossible to delineate or identify any particular way in which this might be so. As I have already concluded it is probable that there had been a party of sorts during which she had consumed cannabis and probably more than she would usually consume in the course of a day. Thus on the morning of 8 August 2016 there are a number of factors which would be likely to have affected her state of mind that morning. One particular piece of evidence demonstrates how these matters may have affected her which I shall return to later.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The accounts of the mother and JL  as to the precise sequence of events on 8 August is in fact not so far apart as might be expected. Both agree that the mother and P came downstairs after B&#8217; 10am (roughly) feed. This probably puts the mother and P downstairs at 10:30 to 10:45 allowing for making up the bottle, feeding B, winding B (or assaulting B) changing her and settling her. They both agree that JL  went upstairs to B&#8217;s bedroom and that after a short interlude the mother followed her up and found her with B in her Moses basket appearing to be poorly. JL  had not heard anything prior to that point which indicates an assault by the mother upon B.  The mother did not hear anything at this point (if her recollection is accurate) which indicates an assault by JL  upon B. However if both of them agree that B appeared pale and unwell </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">at that point it seems most probable that B was already injured by then. If her injuries were, as is agreed by the parties, most likely inflicted on one occasion then it is most likely to have been then. Whilst the medical evidence did not rule out the possibility of two events separated in time that is less likely. They both also agree that B was then taken downstairs. The precise details of what happened downstairs then diverge with the mother having her winding B, B being sick and appearing better and her then falling asleep on the mother and being put upstairs again. JL  has being brought downstairs has them going outside and her winding B who appeared better after burping. JL  has the mother giving B another bottle; JL having noticed that B had not drunk all of her 10am bottle. This itself seems curious; if B had drunk some 3 &#189; ounces of her bottle shortly before why would one try to give her another full bottle? JL then has the mother and B downstairs in the living room for some 30 minutes on her own whilst JL is in the kitchen. The mother&#8217;s account is that she had put B back upstairs in her cot or she continued to get P his breakfast and that she then heard a weird cry from upstairs which caused her to go back up to B&#8217;s room where she found JL  again in B&#8217;s bedroom. Thus both the mother and JL  agree that there were two occasions on which B appeared unwell. Although I did not hear expert evidence on this issue if B had already been injured prior to the first occasion she was noted to be unwell and it appears to be more the likely sequence then it is hard to understand how having sustained such serious injuries she was able to drink a half a bottle of milk. It is also harder to understand if B was downstairs with the mother in particular but also with Ms L  around that a period of half an hour or 45 minutes could pass with her to all intents and purposes being considered to be better until the point at which JL  reenters the living room and notices she is grey. I agree with Mr Hyde QC that it seems more probable that B was placed upstairs again in her Moses basket at some point after about 11 AM after her initial recovery because that would appear to be the mother is common practice and if it was thought B was looking better why would that have been departed from? If she was supposed to be napping why not put her down to nap. It also seems more probable because I find it hard to conceive of a situation where B was carrying the terrible injuries that she was and yet she was feeding normally in the presence of the mother with JL  in the kitchen and yet for a period of 30 or 45 minutes nothing was noted to be wrong with her. It seems to me more probable that she was upstairs in her cot.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the mother describes hearing a weird cry or in her oral evidence before His Honour Judge Marston a doglike cry this does not fit the sort of description that Dr Robinson the paediatrician said was likely to be Bes response to an impact which is the most likely cause of her injuries. It might perhaps be consistent with a severe squeeze which Dr Robinson says would have led to B being unable to breathe. I suppose if a child cannot breathe they are not likely to vigorously cry. JL  does not describe any cry at all although if she were downstairs in the kitchen with the television on as she describes being part of her usual routine it is entirely possible that she would not have heard anything. However, if it was the mother who assaulted B it would have been done in the presence of P. The evidence demonstrates that P was in the same room as the mother and B from around 7am. Given that the medical evidence points to B having sustained the injuries within a couple of hours prior to the ambulance being called and given that all of the evidence from the mother father and JL suggests that at around 10am B was well P would have been in the same room as B at the time she sustained the injuries if it was the mother who inflicted them. Of course he may have been asleep and if B did cry by the time he awoke he may have understood her crying to be no more than normal distress. On the other hand if he were awake he would have witnessed an extremely violent incident in which his mother shook and/or squeezed and/or thumped his baby sister causing her to be extremely distressed for a period of time. The absence of any evidence from the mother or JL  suggesting P was at any stage upset suggest that either he did not witness anything either because it did not happen in his presence or because if he was present he was asleep. </p>

As outlined above this seems less likely given Dr Robinson&#8217;s description of B&#8217;s likely reaction to the infliction of the injuries although it might be consistent with a squeeze.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is yet another of the curiosities of the evidence that LB in his statement gives an account of the lead up to the calling of the ambulance which is far more consistent in its account of events with the mother&#8217;s than it is with JL 's. It seems reasonably clear that after the ambulance left, he and JL remained in the property together until the police arrived to collect P and JL. For a couple of hours therefore they were in the property. One does not need to speculate very much to imagine the situation. It seems probable that they would have been concerned about the possibility of police attending. It appears likely that both would have wished to minimise the presence of drugs in the premises. It may be that the premises were in a state of disarray which they wanted to rectify. During that time it is likely that they talked about earlier events. How was it that LB came to say to the police that B had been unwell earlier in the morning and that later in the morning the mother and JL were arguing upstairs about her. It is either a figment of his imagination or it is derived from JL. It is of course perfectly possible that it is a misunderstanding of what JL told him but it also might be that it is what JL told him. If that is so it is of course consistent with what the mother said but not consistent with what JL said. His account of how they JL came down running downstairs with the mother following trying to take the baby from JL also fits more easily with the mother&#8217;s account of their being a dispute as they were going down the stairs than with JL &#8217;s who says that there was never any dispute upstairs with her running down the stairs (albeit she does say the mother started to go upstairs) and that both she and the mother were in the hallway with her going out of the front door by the time LB arrived home. I have concluded that the totality of the evidence leads me to conclude that JL was in some ways acting irrationally on the morning of the eighth. Therefore, the possibility that she may have given LB an account in that two-hour window and later that night given a different account as appears in her statement to the police is something which would be possible. </p>

Is it in &#8216;Lucas&#8217; territory where she might have tailored her account because she had picked B up and B had cried in pain because she was already injured but she felt guilty that she might have done something? Or is it because she had in fact caused the injuries to B and was seeking to cover that up? No clear answer emerges and no one has been able to explore the issue with JL .  </p>

Although the bruising is not dated it seems reasonable to conclude that the bruising to her tongue cannot have been a result of something that happened after 10am that morning. Why did the mother not notice during the 10am feed that B had a bruise in her mouth. This was not explored by anyone during cross examination. Whilst I can understand that it 3am in the morning or possibly even 7am a feed might take place either in the dark or with very limited light this is less likely at 10am, although I suppose if P was still asleep the mother might have fed B with the curtain still closed. The mother&#8217;s account of the normal routines involved B being bathed every day. Although both R and EC expressed concerns that P occasionally hit B on the head no one had seen him do anything to her in the days immediately preceding 8 August. The mother&#8217;s explanation of bruising arising from how B lay on covers or from hot food dropping on her chest I agree are improbable. Given Mrs Justice Roberts&#8217;s later findings I conclude that some of the marks seen on B can only be explained by rough handling most probably by the mother both in respect of feeding with a bottle (which is a common cause of bruising under the tongue) and in respect of two or three of the bruises which are not associated with the serious chest injuries B sustained. </p>

That supports the conclusion that JL &#8217;s account of the mother&#8217;s reluctance to call an ambulance and her desire to seek medical help is the more probable. But then why did the mother give an account in her first interview and has stuck to it subsequently that it was she who was concerned and that it was JL who did not want to seek medical attention? Again is this a deliberate lie and if so is it a lie within Lucas territory or a lie which corroborates other evidence pointing to the mother as the perpetrator? In her fear was the mother seeking to demonstrate to the police that she was always concerned? Was this fear of being uncovered as the perpetrator or fear of being unjustly identified? Was she reluctant to have B seen by doctors because she knew that she had some minor bruising which she had caused? The latter is certainly likely having regard to Mrs Justice Roberts findings but does it go further than that and support the conclusion that the mother had inflicted a serious assault on B and was hoping for the best but seeking to keep her from medical attention? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is in the context of the dispute between the mother and JL over what should happen to B that one of the most curious features of the case takes place. That is the assault by JL upon the mother. There is nothing from anything the mother or father or RL  or EC that identifies JL  as being somebody who behaves aggressively or violently and who one might predict would act violently under stress. However we know for a fact that she did punch the mother. I have also concluded that she did at least push the mother away with her foot - this has subsequently come to be described as a kick. For JL  to have punched the mother, whilst JL was holding B is in my view something nobody who knew her would have predicted and is an act of violence which was wholly out of place in the situation that the mother and JL  were in. Whilst I am able to accept that this was a distressing and escalating situation as described by Mr Norris I cannot accept that her response was in any sense reasonable or justified. It is more the act of an individual acting irrationally than of an individual acting rationally. It therefore supports the contention that JL &#8217;s state of mind that morning was for one reason or a constellation of reasons not her usual one. Whilst this act of violence towards the mother took place it does not of course follow that JL was also responsible for an assault upon B. Punching and &#8216;kicking&#8217; the mother in the course of a highly charged half-hour is plainly very different to shaking and/or squeezing or punching a tiny baby for no apparent reason. Mr Hyde QC floated the possibility that JL may have deliberately hurt B in some sort of misguided attempt to delay the departure of the mother and father and their children either because she had become obsessed with the children or needed the money or a combination of the two. The possibility that JL deliberately harmed B for any purpose I conclude can be discounted. There is absolutely nothing in her background which remotely supports the contention that she might behave violently towards a child. In fact quite the contrary. If anything the evidence suggests she is likely to be overly anxious albeit her evidence in relation to her concerns over B and P has I have concluded been magnified as a consequence of what I think is a tendency to overdramatise on her behalf and between August and October her &#8216;need&#8217; to fix responsibility for B&#8217;s injuries at the parents door. What the assault on the mother does give rise to though is the real possibility that JL was somehow behaving irrationally and unpredictably that day for reasons which it is not possible to reach a clear conclusion on. </p>

If the ultimate test were out of the two who is the more likely to have done this, by reference to aspects of the evidence and to the court&#8217;s experience of inflicted injuries on babies one might say it was more likely that the mother had inflicted the injuries than JL . However the compartmentalised approach, an approach which looks only at who is the more likely perpetrator is plainly the wrong approach. An approach which surveys a very broad canvas, which weaves all of the evidence together in all of its facets, which draws appropriate inferences from the evidence and from common sense and which incorporates the likelihood of one rather than the other being the perpetrator is the correct approach.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There is much in the evidence which points to the mother as being the probable perpetrator. She has already been found to have injured her daughter on several occasions; albeit injuries of a wholly different order of magnitude or manner of infliction to these. She has already been found to have lied in order to cover up her assaults upon her daughter. She has lied in relation to these injuries notably fabricating an account of JL &#8217;s large Akita dog treading on B&#8217; chest. This lie though does not seek to blame JL but seeks to offer an &#8216;innocent&#8217; explanation for B&#8217;s injuries which perhaps is more consistent with the mother&#8217;s explanation than with seeking to cover her tracks. If she knew what she had done would she not have offered an explanation consistent with B being shaken and thumped rather than trodden on. It does not of itself therefore corroborate other evidence that points to the mother as the perpetrator. She has been found to have lied by Mrs Justice Roberts and not to have been a credible witness in other respects by Mrs Justice Roberts. As Mr Norris points out all of this supports the conclusion that it was probably the mother. However I have myself concluded that the mother&#8217;s credibility is a mixed picture where she has told lies yes but has also told truths on important issues. She certainly had the opportunity being the principal carer for B that morning. But P was also in her care. Could these injuries had been inflicted in the presence of P and without his being aware of and distressed by the events? The mother is capable of getting angry so found Mrs Justice Roberts. The parents were living in a very difficult situation in a house in which they were unhappy because of the drug use and the presence of others including JL with whom they had issues. Any young mother caring for two small children in such circumstances would be likely to be tired and stressed at times. Taken together that situation would provide a fertile ground for the sort of momentary loss of control often seen in shaken baby cases where in frustration and a flash of anger at a baby not taking her feed or some other minor behaviour a parent causes grievous injuries to their baby by shaking or throwing them. But these injuries were not just a shake. B was either subjected to a very serious impact to her chest and abdomen in the form of a punch or similar or she was squeezed so brutally that it broke her ribs and damaged her internal organs. What appeared on paper to be a real issue over the mother seeking to obstruct B being taken to hospital dissipated to a considerable degree when the paramedics gave evidence and when the safeguarding referral form emerged. What had appeared to corroborate JL &#8217;s account of the mother being obstructive was not borne out by the totality of the paramedic evidence which rather supported a conclusion that the mother was genuinely concerned but did not understand the severity of the paramedics&#8217; concerns. Taking all of the evidence and arguments, </p>

Thus I do not find that the mother was the perpetrator of these terrible injuries on the balance of probabilities; I do not find it is more likely than not that she inflicted them. However the totality of the evidence clearly places her in the category of there being a real possibility that she might have inflicted the injuries in a short flash of anger and loss of control. She is therefore in the pool of perpetrators. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What of JL? There is much also that points to her as a possible perpetrator. Does it reach the threshold of the probable perpetrator? There is powerful evidence that she was in an unusual state of mind that morning which finds its most obvious illustration in her assaulting the mother. Does this mean that she might have behaved irrationally and violently towards B? A serious assault on a vulnerable baby is manifestly different to the circumstances in which she assaulted the mother. The mother was downstairs with P and yet she had nothing at this point which would indicate an assault upon B; this being the most likely point at or by which B had sustained her injuries. The mother denies being in the toilet which might have masked any noise from upstairs. On JL &#8217;s own account she was alone with B for a period of time when B was first noted to be unwell. Why if B was so unwell when she first entered the room did she not immediately call the mother but wait for five minutes? On the other hand, she appears to have had little regard for the mother&#8217;s maternal qualities and on first seeing B no doubt it might be reasonable to have thought that nothing was seriously amiss.  Is JL &#8217;s account of how B remain downstairs in the care of the mother after that point and which I have found to be either untrue or an erroneous recollection an attempt to divert attention away from the extent to which JL was alone with B on that day? On the mother&#8217;s account though when she saw JL upstairs with B it was shortly after she heard a cry, a cry which was not consistent with the infliction of the serious injuries in the moments beforehand. If the injuries were not inflicted then what would be the purpose in JL making up an account of her not having been upstairs again? Does LB&#8217;s statement which puts JL upstairs with the mother and which tends to corroborate the mother&#8217;s account indicates that JL told him something different to that which she included in her initial account? If so again what inference in Lucas terms can properly be drawn from this? What of the exaggerated account contained within 28 October 2016 statement and the very considerable criticism of the mother and the father contained within that? Is it as His Honour Judge Marston found a deliberate attempt to seek to incriminate the parents and to divert suspicion away from her? In the context of JL being aware that she was the other person in the frame alongside the parents that she would have ramped up the level of concerns is perhaps not surprising and does not in my view indicate a fabrication which corroborates her having committed the assault. Given that there is evidence from RL and from contemporaneous sources that JL did have some concerns about the quality of parenting being given to B it seems to me that the criticism of the parents may be explicable simply through anxiety to ensure that she wasn&#8217;t wrongly accused as much as being an attempt to prevent her being properly accused. Taking all of the evidence, drawing what inferences are legitimate allowing for the lies or exaggerations she has told (or the suppression of the truth) taking account of who of the two is more likely to be the perpetrator I conclude that the Local Authority has not established on the balance of probabilities that JL did inflict the injuries on B. However the totality of </p>

I am troubled that I am unable to reach a clear conclusion but this is a classic case where I would be straining to identify the perpetrator having regard to my analysis above. The combination of the evidence which exists, together with the evidence which has not been available and the inability to test in particular the evidence of JL and LB has of course had an impact on the process of the evaluation of the evidence and undoubtedly has contributed to my inability to identify a perpetrator on the balance of probabilities. </p>

I rejected that on the basis that the court owed it to the children in particular but also to the parties and more broadly to the process of justice to at least embark on the process to see whether a perpetrator could fairly be identified. I said then that it may be an easy route out simply to identify that there was a real possibility that the mother and JL might have caused the injuries but I did not consider that that would do justice to the very serious issues concerned. Having undertaken that very full investigation into how B&#8217;s injuries were caused I am satisfied that no reasonably sized stone has been left unturned during the two weeks that I have been enquiring into this. I decline to speculate on whether a different outcome might have been possible either at an earlier stage or with different evidence. Thus all that can sensibly be done to get to the bottom of this has now been done.  </p>

He said they thought she was stealing their food and that she had found out they were planning on trying to get a council house and thus would be leaving her and removing a source of finance for her. The father says that Sunday was an ordinary day. He said that B had been colicky over the previous few days but did not give the impression that that was much of an issue. He said he had helped with a bike or motorbike in the course of the afternoon and had then been up and down stairs as he cooked dinner. He said that JL had several teenagers over and they were smoking dope in the living room. He said he had not remonstrated with JL because he had previously raised the issue and she had said that it was her house and if he didn&#8217;t like it he could move somewhere else. He said that at some point when he checked his wallet he realised that &#163;20 had gone from it and that he spoke to JL gesturing at his wallet. He said that she was tearful and said sorry. He said that the paperwork to do with getting a council house had been with his wallet and that JL appeared from her demeanour and facial expressions to be cross; he thought she was cross that they would be moving out and she would be losing the income.

In his interview on 9 August the father said that he was paying &#163;75 a week rent which he thought went on drugs. He said he didn&#8217;t want to cause jet any problems.

Her colour was normal, she was breathing normally.  Then I have another child P so I went downstairs to feed P.  So, I heard JL, the person who lives in the house to whom I pay for the house, she went upstairs and she took a long time there.  So, I ended up by going upstairs, I have a little basket where I put the baby and I put the cushion underneath the basket and put the basket on top of it. So, when I went and I reached upstairs she was kneeling down and she was touching the baby.  And as I noticed that the baby was pale, I sort of took her in my arms, I put the rug around her and I went downstairs to the living room.  I folded my shirt and I sort of encouraged her to burp because she might be pale because </p>

She was, she seemed well her colour came back and she was breathing normally and she ended up by sleeping in my arms but as I have P and I have to feed P.  I went upstairs to leave her there so I put her in the basket but I didn&#8217;t leave the basket as it was on the floor, I took it, I put it on the bed against the wall.  Then I went downstairs to feed my son but then I heard footsteps upstairs, I went up again, I saw her, she had taken the baby from the basket, put the baby on the bed and she was sitting by her.  Then she took the baby.  I asked her to give the baby to me, she did not give the baby to me, she did not want to.  As I was going down the stairs she tripped over, I grabbed her by the back of her shirt so she didn&#8217;t fall down as she had my baby in her arms.  She went down to the living room.  I wanted to take my baby to the hospital and when we were upstairs, she had told me there was no need for hospital and the baby had low blood pressure.  All I had to do was put some sugar in her mouth.  She went down, she sat on the settee, I went and tried to get my daughter, she kicked me on here on just here, she kicked me.  And then there was a rug she was covering the baby so I removed the blanket so I could again try to get the baby.  So, as I got closer, she punched me on the mouth.  Then she got up, she started crying out of nothing.  I don&#8217;t know whether she was being forced or not.  Then this young man who lives there arrived, he&#8217;s called L.  And she was crying and saying that the baby had fainted or had nothing hadn&#8217;t got anything to call the ambulance.  After she said that to Lee he was telephoning.  From what I understood they were speaking in English she was telling the man it was me who didn&#8217;t want to take my daughter to the hospital.  And then her husband was here and she went round the bend and she was ringing the doorbell of the neighbours to see if anybody had a car to take the baby to hospital.  The neighbour wasn&#8217;t there so she came back into the house, sat down on the settee and smoked weed so she started smoking with my daughter in her arms.  And again, I tried to get my daughter but she wouldn&#8217;t let me and I didn&#8217;t try anymore because I didn&#8217;t want to hurt the baby.  But when she went outside my daughter was wearing a top long sleeves and leggings and it was cold.  So, I went inside to get the blanket to cover the baby as she was not giving me the baby and when the paramedics arrived, she started crying just saying lots of things which I didn&#8217;t understand.  When I was about to go into the ambulance, she started crying saying all she wanted to do was to help me, she didn&#8217;t want to hurt anyone.  And she said she was going to take my son P to be by my side.  She did but she told the police as well she was angry at me because all this happened to the baby.  I have told her that the council was going to give us a house on Tuesday which is today and on </p>

And from what I understand that she was talking in English with her friends and she said to them &#8220;they&#8217;re going to go and the money for the drugs will no longer exist&#8221; and before that AC had &#163;20 to buy the bus pass to go to work so we had this money in the wallet, the wallet was inside AC&#8217;s rucksack he uses for work upstairs in the bedroom.  And we went downstairs and when we looked for the money &#163;19 had disappeared with &#163;1 left in the wallet.  I confronted her about the money, </p>

		  <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0in;margin-right:0.06in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;It was a normal one.  B and P woke up, B is start crying, as is normal when she is hungry.  I went downstairs to make the bottle for her to drink.  She had drunk all the bottle and she burped normal.  I changed her nappies and she fell asleep again.  I left her upstairs in my bedroom and went downstairs to feed the boy, he ate.  But JL was taking quite a while upstairs and that&#8217;s not normal, that&#8217;s not habit.  I don&#8217;t know, something could have taken place to her I don&#8217;t know.  So, I went upstairs and I noticed that she was not in her bedroom, then I went to my bedroom.  When I went upstairs, she was kneeled on the floor next to the basket, she was touching my daughter.  And when I looked at the girl, she was white.  I asked her to move out of the way.  I took the girl out of the basket, I went downstairs again to the sofa, I put her against my chest and I kind of, tap her in the back because I thought maybe she wants to burp and she is a little bit, you know, with the air there.  To be honest with you, she was a bit distressed because she didn&#8217;t burp the way she should burp.  I managed to I tried to make her burp but she didn&#8217;t, so she ended up vomiting and made herself all dirty.  I changed her, then she stayed in my lap, in my arms for a little bit more, and then I realised she was not well.  I hadn&#8217;t finished feeding P at the time.  Because I realised, she was well I went upstairs and put B inside the basket.  And she slept (inaudible) like she was in the morning.  I usually leave the (inaudible) basket on my floor next to the cushion but that time I lifted up and put on top of my bed closer to the wall.  I went downstairs to carry on feeding P.  P ate and then I heard she was crying and I went upstairs again.  And once more, the girl was outside of the basket on top of my bed and JL was touching the girl, and again, the girl was white.  And when I went upstairs and I ask what she was doing there she held the baby in her arms and I ask her why the girl was white again.  She said that was normal, that was probably her pressure dropped, that I should put some sugar underneath her tongue.  And I said &#8220;no I&#8217;m not doctor&#8221;.  I tried to remove the girl from her arms but she went downstairs in the living room and was kind of in a position that she will not allow me to touch my daughter.  And she went to the streets with my daughter with her body (inaudible) without long sleeves and with short legs.  I almost beg her to get inside the house because it was very cold and the girl was outside.  She come in and sat in on the sofa.  I ask her to pass on the, my daughter, to me in a tranquil way, calm way she refused.  She kicked me on the top of my scar (?) and she punched me around my mouth area.  I did not want to remove the child from her because I could see the girl was not well.  And I was scared that she would use some sort of force towards the girl and end up causing her injury.  At this time, L came from work and out of nothing she starts to screaming and saying that I didn&#8217;t want her to take the girl to the hospital.  That is when L called the ambulance&#8221;. </p>
