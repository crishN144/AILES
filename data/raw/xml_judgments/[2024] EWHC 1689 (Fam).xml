O, who is not a subject of these proceedings, has a close relationship with F and is presently at a boarding school in England, where the fees are paid by F. Despite the highly litigious nature of these proceedings, M and F continue to have a sexual relationship. This is an agreed fact. </span></p>

F has access to a private jet. They have travelled and continue to travel extensively. They are Ukrainian. Neither girl was born there, both parents were born and grew up there, grandmothers, on both sides, continue to live in Kyiv. In a case where there are very few areas of agreement, the parties appear to accept that they, but more particularly S, lived and was habitually resident in Ukraine until February 2022. The significance of this date is now obvious to the world. In that period there was a considerable escalation of tension in Ukraine surrounding a potential Russian invasion. F stated that, and I am prepared to accept, he had extensive access to intelligence, not in the public domain, which left him in no doubt, at that time, that invasion loomed. He told me, in evidence, that in that period, he was sure of Russia&#8217;s intentions and that he believed that the war (or &#8216;special military operation&#8217;, to use the Russian nomenclature) was imminent. He also considered, from the information that he had, that the capture of Kyiv would take little more than a matter of weeks. It is an understatement to say that F would not have flourished under a Russian regime. Inevitably, it was necessary for him to leave his country. </span></p>

F has a villa in Italy, where they have all enjoyed holidays in the past. I hesitate to use the phrase &#8216;family holidays&#8217; as, at this time, F was still married to another woman, with whom he has children. The reality appears to have been an arrangement of parallel families. For a while, they lived in the villa. This was never intended to be a permanent home. F obtained (along with his wife) leave to remain in the UK, in April 2022, pursuant to the Homes for Ukraine Scheme (UK). It is clear that F made this application without informing M.  When M discovered, she was plainly very angry and, despite their continuing relationship, little of that anger appears to have dissipated. </span></p>

The evidence before me indicates that M, F and S were all distressed to be exiled to the villa in Italy. However idyllic it might have been for a holiday; the loss of their home manifestly caused the adults great pain. Instinct suggests that S too might have sensed this and felt something of it herself, but there is little information about this in the papers. M felt the distress most acutely. She had left her home, her business, and her mother behind. Unlike F, she did not have property or roots, however shallow, in any other country. She told me that she was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;extremely sad&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">in this period.

The war became one of attrition. After a while, M started returning regularly to Kyiv. S sometimes travelled with her. It is, at least as I understand it, acknowledged by F, that S lived in Kyiv for some 6 weeks between January and February 2023. For entirely obvious reasons, the family continued to be unsettled. However, between mid-October and mid-December 2023, they all returned to Kyiv and were joined by O, who plainly regards F as a father figure. </span></p>

In August 2023, I had understood that F purchased what appears to be a rather grand house in a highly regarded suburb of Kyiv. In fact, Ms Renton tells me that it was transferred to him as part of his divorce settlement and that it was matrimonial property acquired in 2017. To my mind, how it was acquired is of little significance. The retention of it indicates some level of commitment to Kyiv. In mid-December, the family travelled to London and from there departed, a few days later, on a quite extensive Caribbean holiday. The transcript of the messages between the parents indicate that M had some hesitation about the holiday plans. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">F has constructed an elaborate argument that the &#8216;plan&#8217; to live in London, which he appears to contend began in those few days before the Caribbean holiday, was concluded but subsequently reneged upon by M. Ms Guha KC, Counsel on behalf of M, points to the evidence that all of S&#8217;s belongings (including her much loved dog) remained in Kyiv, which is of course, entirely inconsistent with having moved to live permanently in London. She also emphasises the controlling mindset, revealed in unambiguous terms in the extracts set out above. This, Ms Guha submits, illustrates behaviour which is corrosive of M&#8217;s autonomy and inimical to her independent decision making. F simply does not regard M&#8217;s consent to the family&#8217;s arrangements as necessary. He considers that the decisions are his </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;as head&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of the family. He regards M&#8217;s submission under the weight of his persistence as equivalent to consent. It is not. In any event, I do not consider M ever agreed to the plan, though she was undoubtedly prepared to negotiate around it. </span></p>

There are also transcripts of conversations which reveal the mother as trying to conflate financial arrangements with some rather loosely defined concept of joint residence between London and Kyiv. Into this maelstrom must also be added an intense and highly emotional conflict between M and F, predicated on F&#8217;s belief that M is or has been having an affair with another man. </span></p>

It is also clear that the children&#8217;s welfare will inevitably have been damaged by it. Both adults have been entangled in a powerplay in which their own emotions, the needs of the children and money have all been conflated by both. Though there is no equality in this powerplay, M was prepared to play such cards as she perceived to be at her disposal. On the morning of the hearing, I received further covertly recorded transcripts of the parties&#8217; telephone conversations.

For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb (&#8220;avait consenti/had consented&#8221;): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.'</span></p>

Both the defences contemplated above are, to my mind, characterised by the need for clarity i.e., lack of ambiguity. The evidence here is the antithesis of both. Whilst it is not always coherent, the preponderant evidence reveals a couple in almost permanent conflict. Agreement on virtually anything seems to elude them. Their language is that of hostile negotiation and bargaining, in which neither seems prepared to say what they really feel. This does not even come close to establishing the clarity of evidence required by the defences. Insofar as they were arguable at all, they were predicated upon a confection of highly selective evidence which was incapable of establishing any clear forensic conclusion. </span></p>

It is that issue which I believe to be central to this case. The other matters raised here strike me, essentially, as makeweights, though they have been pursued with vigour and tenacity. What is important to address is the emphasised sentence in the above passage. I say, at once, that I find it to be a proposition which runs entirely contrary to the preponderant evidence of where S herself regards her home to be. As the case law establishes, the habitual residence of a child will inevitably correspond to the place which reflects some degree of integration by that child in a social and family environment. A child will usually, though not inevitably, have the same habitual residence as the parent who cares for her. The younger the child, the more likely the proposition. Stability for the child is what characterises habitual residence and not days or time spent in a particular location. It is, as the case law has emphasised, the child who should be at the centre of the exercise when evaluating habitual residence. Yet again, the evidence in this case, which is voluminous, especially for a summary application, focuses on the parents. The statements reveal nothing of S&#8217;s character or personality nor do they engage properly with the kind of material that the case law indicates is required (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re B (A Child) (Custody Rights: Habitual Residence) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2174" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2174 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2174 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 4 WLR 156" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 4 WLR 156</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">M (Children) (Habitual Residence: 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/1105" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 1105" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 1105</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2020] 4 WLR 137" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] 4 WLR 137</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">). </span></p>

Almost immediately, it became clear that this is S&#8217;s home. Near to her mother&#8217;s house is her maternal grandmother, whom she sees regularly when in Kyiv. F&#8217;s mother also live close by but, perhaps understandably in the light of the complex parallel family arrangements that I have referred to, F&#8217;s mother has played a small part in S&#8217;s life. M spoke of S&#8217;s enthusiasm for ballet and piano, which are very much part of her life in Kyiv. These interests, to some extent, reflect those of her older sister, O. They are interests that M has encouraged and takes obvious pleasure in. She told me that S enjoyed dancing to the ballets of Prokofiev (Cinderella) and Tchaikovsky (The Nutcracker). It is poignant that those two great composers are of Ukrainian and Russian heritage, respectively. None of this matters to S however, whose real enjoyment of music and dance was reflected in the mother&#8217;s own joy in relating this to me. In addition to her daily routine, there are also both piano and extra ballet lessons. M said that S had not been practising the piano whilst in London. </span></p>

I have no real sense of S&#8217;s life, from the available evidence, in any other environment. It is only in the description of her life in Kyiv, with her mother, that she becomes three dimensional. Of note is her relationship with her nanny in Kyiv, with whom she clearly has a strong bond and whom she continues to speak with on the telephone regularly. In addition to all this, I have already noted the frequency and the duration of S&#8217;s time in Kyiv, including time spent with both her mother and father together. The pull of Kyiv to all this family is magnetic (including O). F told me that when he left Ukraine in February 2022, he had assumed that he would never be able to return. He too was plainly delighted at having had the unexpected opportunity to do so and, I note, as recently as 6 months ago. </span></p>

Her main home was with M in Kyiv, her nursery and school were in Kyiv, her wider family (including her maternal grandmother), extended social life and world was in Kyiv. Italy, where she spent most of her time since February 2022, was always a holiday home, and neither party has sought to suggest otherwise. Whilst in Italy, the place she was most familiar, and where she slipped back into her familiar routines, was Ukraine, where, in 2023, she spent just short of four months. Her mother has travelled back frequently there. Her sister was at boarding school (now day school) in England but returned to Kyiv in October for two months to see her own father. F had sufficient business interests there to warrant his still having to return there on occasion. Indeed, he maintains a substantial home there, as M&#8217;s photos exhibited to her second witness statement attest. As M points out, that home was procured in October 2023, barely a month after he paid the fees to Ukraine&#8217;s top school for [S] to attend in 2024. The purchase of this sizeable property does not at all sit well with F&#8217;s assertion that he himself had &#8216;moved&#8217; to London by the end of 2023&#8221;.</span></p>

I remind myself, of course, that S speaks Ukrainian at home. Even in the UK, there is a strong sense of her Ukrainian culture. I noticed a photograph of her with her father, with him wearing the Ukrainian flag, the national Trident symbol and a traditional Ukrainian folk shirt, which I understand is called a vyshyvanka. S&#8217;s school reports in Ukraine, predictably, also reveal her to be steeped in Ukrainian culture. Given that I have found that there was never a collective intention or agreement to move permanently to London, and having looked at the circumstances of S&#8217;s life, I am entirely satisfied that it is Kyiv and her family home there where S remains most integrated and which continues to provide her with stability. Whilst I do not wish to diminish F&#8217;s love and concern for his daughter, I am also satisfied that it is M who is S&#8217;s primary carer. It is Ukraine where S is habitually resident. </span></p>

For it to be effective, cases must be listed quickly. For this to happen, case management must exert tight control over the documentation. Judicial reading time, built into the estimated length of hearing, is rarely allocated to these cases and judgment writing time is a chimera. Solicitors who file material of this quantity must realise that they simply do not assist their clients, it is more likely that important points become lost in the volume of information.

One of the consequences of filing this lengthy material was that the lawyers acting for M sought to counter it by seeking to instruct an expert who could advise on the realities of day-to-day life there. The agreed instructions, which I will return to below, went wider than that. To achieve parity between the parties and because I perceived there to be some potential utility in this line of enquiry, I granted leave for Dr Yedeliev to be instructed. I have explained how the expert came to be instructed in this case because I wish to signal, in the clearest possible terms, that such instructions should, in my judgement, be regarded as exceptional and rarely necessary. The key elements of the evidence and those upon which I have relied, were largely available directly from the parties and could, to my mind, have been presented, succinctly, in their own statements. This is not intended, in any way, to be critical of Dr Yedeliev, whose evidence was thoughtful and carefully presented, though I agree with Ms Renton that there was, at times, a detectable nationalism in his approach. All this, however, simply indicates that the issue we are concerned with is, of itself, likely to be unreceptive to expert assessment. </span></p>

It is, for example, relevant to note that F&#8217;s own access to intelligence in the early months of 2022, which influenced the decision to go to Italy, proved to be inaccurate. Kyiv did not topple in weeks and the war has proved to be far more protracted than the intelligence he had access to had led him to anticipate. It is also relevant that F, despite his own heightened risk, felt sufficiently confident, both to return to Kyiv and to retain property there at the end of last year. Further, it is a universal feature of war that truth is its first casualty. The pervasiveness of this point is illustrated by the fact that it was first made by Aeschylus (Agamemnon: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;The first casualty of war is the truth&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, 458 BC).

As I have stated, she runs her business in Kyiv. It is necessary, when coming to London, for her to travel to Poland and to fly from Polish airports. This is one of many restrictions caused by the war to day-to-day life in Kyiv. By way of further example, sometimes children&#8217;s education has to be conducted in bunkers or air raid shelters. M told me that people make the best of things. It is almost trite to say that a nation at war generates resilience. I sensed something of this in the mother&#8217;s own written and oral evidence. Though there have been missile attacks on Kyiv (e.g., power station) they have been infrequent. The primary risk would appear to be shrapnel injuries from missiles shot down by Ukraine anti-aircraft fire. F&#8217;s case, properly analysed, is that Russian forces are resurgent and that Ukraine&#8217;s ability to resist is diminished. F contends that the summer months are likely to see an escalation in the war generally and with Kyiv potentially exposed to greater onslaught. This future risk is articulated in Ms Renton and Mr Langford&#8217;s skeleton argument in these terms. They highlight the following paragraph in bold print and so therefore do I: </span></p>

I do not consider that the FCDO advice comes close to supporting the weight Ms Renton places upon it. It is inevitably the case that foreign travellers face a different and heightened risk from that of Ukrainian nationals who have lived, daily, with the challenges and privations of war for some time and have adapted their lives in response to it. Both Dr Yedeliev and M told me, for example, that some people in Kyiv (which M confirmed included her family) had installed generators as a backup during electricity cuts. This makes life much easier and safer. The UK traveller may not have access to such resources. </span></p>

Though sirens are still sounded, in fact, the citizens of Kyiv rely on and are familiar with mobile phone alerts, generated by government apps. Dr Yedeliev suggested that these might not always be speedily accessible to foreign travellers or that they might even be unaware of them. There are other obvious challenges, for example, in relation to language. The risk matrix is, therefore, wholly different for UK nationals. The guidance is prepared for an entirely different purpose from the exercise that I am engaged in here. Whilst it may have some place in the broader evidential canvas, it most certainly does not assume the elevated role Ms Renton contends for it. Neither would the FCDO expect their guidance to be used in the way that Ms Renton asserts it should be. It not written with this in mind. Indeed, the FCDO would, I am confident, be alarmed at their advice being construed as, in any way, restrictive of the movements of a Ukrainian national. Those evaluating risk to themselves and their families when their country is at war, will inevitably weigh into the balance the importance to them of remaining in their homeland with family, friends and neighbours. Remaining may, itself, be an act of national solidarity. There are also practical considerations. Here, M&#8217;s home, business and livelihood remains in Kyiv. </span></p>

I do not need to. I find the parents&#8217; evidence and lived experiences, both as they recount in the witness box and in their statements, provides a secure evidential base for determining the key issue. The chronology of the parents&#8217; respective visits to Kyiv (and their duration) also illuminates their attitude to risk, as, to some degree, does M&#8217;s determination to remain in Kyiv herself. I should add that when put to the assay, that core evidence, on all this, reveals a rather surprising degree of common ground between the parents. This is because, as I have foreshadowed above, F&#8217;s essential objection to his daughter&#8217;s return, when properly analysed, is his anxiety, surrounding escalating future conflict most particularly, over the coming summer months. As illustrated in para. 41 above, this is the primary focus of Ms Renton&#8217;s argument. </span></p>
