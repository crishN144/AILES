	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">BC is a 15 year old girl, soon to be 16, who is a child subject to a care order,  placed by the First Respondent Local Authority in long term foster care after police officers arrested her father, the Third Respondent, in 2021, and charged him with sexual assault including rape of BC. In the family public law proceedings that followed, HHJ Shelton made findings that BC&#8217;s allegations against her father were true. A final care order was made on 24 June 2022. BC has been living with her current foster carers for over two and a half years. She is settled in her foster care placement and is excelling at school. She has no contact with her father but has face to face supervised contact with her mother, the Second Respondent, once ever half term and weekly indirect contact. She has three brothers. Two are now adults and one is younger than her. She usually sees her younger brother, D, and sometimes one of her older brothers at the face to face contact with her mother. BC wishes to become included in future family gatherings, but not to include her father.</p>

The names she has chosen have no wider significance: they do not relate to her mother&#8217;s maiden name or any other family names, for example. She has chosen the names because they are attractive to her and the actual initials of her new name would be of significance to her in relation to her recovery from the trauma inflicted by her father. I have anonymised her current and planned names.</p>

She shares one name in common with her father, and her other name is a female version of his name. She has wanted to change her names since first expressing the wish to do so in November 2021. She has been constant in her expressed wish to change her names and as to the names she wishes to have. There is no dispute that she is competent to make the decision about changing her names.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2021, BC was living with her parents and three brothers when, at the age of 12 she contacted Childline to report that her father had sexually assaulted her. It was her third call to Childline in a period of about six weeks. Childline contacted the police who attended the family home and arrested the father. He was charged with rape of his daughter and granted bail. BC was taken to a place of safety and the Local Authority issued care proceedings. An Interim Care Order was made. In April 2022 HHJ Shelton conducted the final hearing and made findings of fact. The evidence before him was that her father had slept in the same bed with BC since she was about 6 to 7 years old. The Judge made findings which I need not repeat in detail but they included that:</p>

I expressed at the time to the professionals who were working with me, a desire to change my name.  The advice I was given was to wait until I became settled in foster care and the care proceedings had concluded.  I accepted that the abuse I suffered has had a significant impact on me emotionally.  I also accepted the view of professionals at the time such as my social worker who said that it wouldn't have been right to change my name.  However, I have stuck to this name for over three years, and I believe it to be part of me.  It is now part of my identity and a part of who I am.  My desire to change my name arose from being hurt by the people I trusted most.  I really don't want to be associated with or have my identity linked to my father, who betrayed me in such a cruel way.</p>

I wrote an entire double page, to the Social Worker as to why I feel my name should be changed and how I would feel if my name is not changed.  I'm happy for her to show this to the Court.  I am disappointed that even after the abuse I have suffered, people cannot understand why I ask that my name is changed. I am particularly upset about the view taken by [the Local Authority]. They applied to Court for a care order so they could keep me safe and make decisions in my welfare.  I feel on this issue they have let me down and do not have my best interests at heart. </p>

I have thought about what would happen if I change my name when people that don't already know find out, yes they will be curious but they will just have to accept it.  They are only people that don't know me, and they are temporary in my life.  All my friends and the trusted adults in my life already know the things that have happened to me.  It's only students that aren&#8217;t my friends that don't really know at my school.  I only have one year left in school after this in any event and if they asked why I changed my name then I will tell them. </p>

My name should not be something that a bunch of people, who barely know me have decided, it should be something I've decided.  The legal age for someone not in foster care to change their name is 16.  I turn 16 this year. I am not too young to decide this. I have decided this, and I have been dead set on this since I was 13. If I had any doubt that my name shouldn't be J and should be B, then I would have already felt it.  I also know that I can change my name back.  If the Court doesn't grant permission to me, then I will change my name when I am 18 anyway. I feel it is better for my name to be changed now, so that when I move onto college and university my name is legally formalised and the people I encounter in my life going forward will only know me as that. It will be a fresh start for me.</p>

I can't even imagine a future of not being called J, because for me the name BC, has me connected by one of the most important ways to a man that I've come to fear so much.  This name is making me be associated to a man I am scared of.  I&#8217;m mature enough to make this decision.  You can see this through my school work and home life.  I understand the consequences of changing my name, I know it will change my identity.  The reality is that my identity changed when my father decided to abuse me.   </p>

I can finally say that I'm not his daughter and that I don't belong to him in any way.  I have already waited three years and waiting two more years will just be unbearable.  I am disappointed that so many people don't understand the importance and significance of the reasons why I am changing my name. You can't even comprehend what it's like being owned by the man that you fear the most. If I can&#8217;t change my name the impact on my mental health will be significant.&#8221;</p>

She struggled to go into lessons without considerable support. She would access pastoral support around four times a day. Now BC has made amazing progress. She is confident, conscientious and a caring young lady. There has been such a huge change. BC is an articulate and studious young person. She is an absolute delight to teach within school and is thought of very highly by the teaching staff. She is on course to receive very good GCSE&#8217;s across all subjects. [She] undertakes several roles within school, such as helping year seven pupils read &#8230; She is very responsible&#8230; BC is extremely focused and mature for her age. She has a clear understanding of the issues which are taking place in her life. She will often remind me of meetings. BC likes to fully participate in meetings about her care and make her views known.</p>

BC has a small friendship group in school, but they are very close. I'm aware that her friendship group has been calling her J for around the last six months. BC has also asked me to call her J. I have absolutely no worries about BC's capacity to make a decision to change her name. She has clearly thought it through, and I believe she has good reasons for wishing to change her name. I am aware that her name is associated to her father&#8217;s.</p>

We are happy for BC to trial changing her first name in school, if she so wishes. We were going to implement the name change after the Easter break. However, BC preferred to wait for the Court, to seek permission from the Judge, before making the change as she knew it was not agreed by the Social Worker and family. BC is now thinking about whether she wishes to trial her name change within school after the next half term. BC and I have discussed how her name change would be approached in school. We will say [agreed plan set out].</p>

The most obvious example of this, is transgender students. School has experience of supporting pupils on this issue for around the last 12-13 years. In my experience when a young person changes their name in school, it is generally accepted by the other students without too much questioning. I do not think it would have any impact on BC from a school position.</p>

This will be a vulnerable time for BC. She is concerned that the name changes will draw unwanted attention to BC and generate some difficult questions from her peers. The social worker seems to be concerned that BC has overstated the effects on her of having her name. She states that the name change should be something to discuss in a therapeutic setting but that BC has not even begun to talk about her father&#8217;s actions in therapy. There is concern that the name change will hinder the improving relations between BC and her mother and brothers. These are relationships that BC has said she wants to develop.

A deed poll is just as effective or ineffective whether it is enrolled or not; the only point of enrolment is that it will provide unquestionable proof, if proof is required.  No more.  So that the deed poll in this case is not vitiated in any way by failure to comply with those enrolment regulations.  It simply means that the deed cannot be enrolled.&#8221;</p>

The Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994, as amended, prevent any deed poll executed by a child under the age of 18 being enrolled except by someone with parental responsibility for the child (unless the child is a female aged at least 16 who is married). A child who is 16 or 17 has themselves to consent to the enrolment. But enrolment is not a pre-requisite for a formal change of name.</p>

The same might apply to those given parental responsibility under a child arrangements lives with order or a Special Guardianship order. The statutory requirement to seek the leave of the court to change a surname in the absence of the agreement of every person with parental responsibility can be seen as a protection of the Art 8 rights of those with parental responsibility for the child. Likewise, the requirement identified by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> [2016] to apply for leave under the inherent jurisdiction to change the forename of a child subject to a care order was grounded on the importance of the decision and the protection of the Article 8 rights of others with parental responsibility. In contrast, it is accepted procedure for a 16 or 17 year old who is not subject to a relevant CA 1989 order to change their forename and/or surname by deed poll without the consent of any person with parental responsibility. That acceptance seems to recognise that in this context the Article 8 rights of the young person always outweigh the Article 8 rights of anyone with parental responsibility. 16 and 17 year olds are presumed to have capacity to decide to change their names. The execution of a deed poll by a 16 or 17 year old requires the use of a certain form of words and the signatures of two witnesses who must be over 18.  It does not require any notice to be given to those with parental responsibility. There would be no opportunity to them to object before the deed poll were executed.</p>

Similarly, although the authorities to which I have referred stress the significance of name changes for a child, a child of 16 or 17 years who is not subject to a relevant order can change their forenames and surnames by unenrolled deed poll by doing no more than making a witnessed declaration.</p>

The applicant wished to change her surname from her father&#8217;s surname to her mother&#8217;s surname.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; In determining an application by a Gillick competent child in the care of a local authority, the welfare principle must of course be paramount.  However, in addition, the judge should give very careful consideration to the wishes, feelings, needs and objectives of the applicant.  If he has the advantage of advice from a guardian ad litem who has had the opportunity to make a thorough investigation of the family dynamics, he should pay particular heed.  Next, he must give searching scrutiny to the motives and stated objectives of the respondent.  Here, the father&#8217;s stated objective was to maintain and restore his relationship with his daughter.  It is hard to see how that objective would be advanced by requiring her to be cross-examined in the family proceedings, by requiring her attendance at the crown court trial and by opposing this appeal.  The inconsistency must cast doubt upon the stated motive.  Finally, the fresh evidence only reinforces my opinion that the application should have been granted on 29th July.  The acquittal probably retards rather than advances the prospects of any contact between K and her father.  K is now 15.  The letter of 1st September is sad but determined in her rejection of her father.  Her right to determine her surname without the leave of the court is likely to arrive before there has been a change sufficient to weigh in the scale which we balance.&#8221;</p>

An application by a child in care for leave to change their surname requires the court to consider exercising its power to give leave under CA 1989 s33(7). That application can be made under the FPR Part 18 procedure.

She refused to speak to the social worker after being informed of the Local Authority&#8217;s decision to oppose her application.

It would be preferable for the proposed changes of her names to be worked through with BC in therapy. BC would benefit from flexibility rather than making formal commitment to changing her names. She could trial her name first before making the changes.</p>

I reject the submission that the court may only permit the change of a name if the continued use of the current name would be likely to cause the child &#8220;significant harm&#8221;. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> [2023] Cobb J said that, &#8220;The issue of whether there is a power within the inherent jurisdiction to prevent a parent with parental responsibility from naming their child with a particular name is dependent on whether the court is satisfied that to allow such a name to be used would likely cause that child significant harm.&#8221; He was dealing with an infant whose name was said to be unsuitable, similarly to the name &#8216;Cyanide&#8217; considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C [</span>2016].

I accept that the double name change requires particular consideration. BC is not asking to adopt her mother&#8217;s surname in place of her father&#8217;s surname. A request to change to a name that has no association with the family is a matter to be weighed in the court&#8217;s determination. On the other hand, it might be said that even more weight should be given to BC&#8217;s wishes and feelings than in the case of the young applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> because (i) BC was the actual victim of the sexual abuse by her father and so her motivation to make the change might be given even more weight, and (ii) the father has been found by the Family Court to have sexually abused her whereas no findings had been made in the <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> case.

It is not disputed that BC is competent to make a decision for herself about her change of name. The evidence from her school is very persuasive that she is mature for her age. She will be 16 in a few weeks from now. She will have capacity to make the decision to change her names. Change of name deeds poll are effective for 16 year olds who are not in care, and not subject to child arrangements orders or special guardianship orders.</p>

The court should not give leave simply because a Gillick competent child applies for leave. The court must consider the benefits and harm to the applicant from either granting or refusing the application but taking into account also that rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights are engaged and that when the child is 18 they will be able to change their name without consent or leave. The views of those with parental responsibility including the Local Authority, and other relevant individuals and agencies should be taken into account.</p>

I reject the Local Authority&#8217;s case that she has been hesitant or indecisive on the issue. BC&#8217;s dissatisfaction with the Local Authority&#8217;s opposition should not be taken as indecision. Her choice to await the court&#8217;s determination before committing more publicly to the name changes seems to me to be a mature approach not a hesitant one. The fact that BC has asked close friends and some teachers to use her chosen first forename is further confirmation of BC&#8217;s settled and firm wish to make the change not evidence of any doubts in her own mind. I am also struck by BC&#8217;s choice to allow family members to continue to call her by her first name. She does not want to require them to use a name they do not wish to use. Again, that seems to me to be a mature and pragmatic decision.</p>

They do not fall into the category of names that are in themselves liable to risk harm to the child or young person. However, the names have no connection with BC&#8217;s family and would symbolise a break from the family and, to an extent, from BC&#8217;s heritage and culture. After all, BC wants to change her name so as to break the link with her father whose name is so obviously close to both her names, and with a deeply traumatic period of her life. I have to weigh the symbolic severance from her father, and to an extent other members of her family, that the name changes would represent. Her mother does not share her father&#8217;s surname, but her brothers do.  In that context, BC has no contact with her father and is unlikely to do so for the foreseeable future. She does have contact with her mother and brothers albeit on a supervised basis. It is hoped by her and the family that that contact and those relationships will develop further and be rewarding to BC.</p>

The Family Court has found that he perpetrated appalling sexual abuse on her over a prolonged period. The Deputy Safeguarding Lead&#8217;s statement gives a small glimpse of the trauma BC has suffered as a consequence. Professor Craig&#8217;s report confirms the severe impact of the father&#8217;s actions on BC. The evidence suggests that she has made very good progress since being in foster care and starting a new school but she continues to be emotionally and psychologically very vulnerable. I accept that she has not been through a formal therapeutic process to explore her motivations for changing her name, but she has articulated her motivations very clearly to the court and they are understandable.</p>

The father has not engaged in the proceedings but I would be unlikely to give his views much weight in the circumstances. The mother opposes the application although her submissions to me at court suggested that she would be content for BC to change her surname so long as it was to the mother&#8217;s surname. She told me that her sons also oppose the application. Following <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, I should scrutinise the motivations for the mother&#8217;s opposition. I note the findings made against her by HHJ Shelton as set out above. I note that the father&#8217;s criminal trial is pending and I note the allegation that she has privately asked BC not to give evidence against the father. I have no doubt that the mother loves BC but, even allowing for the fact that the mother is unrepresented, her statement does not demonstrate a full understanding of the trauma caused to her daughter and why that lies behind the application. She says, &#8220;I have not let my husband back into the home as I know this would be upsetting to her and I am waiting for the outcome of the other court case [the criminal trial]&#8221;. She does go on to say that if he is acquitted he will not return to the family home but her sons would go to visit him in his flat. However, she does not indicate that she has fully accepted her daughter&#8217;s allegations to be true nor that it is his actions that might cause her to exclude him from the family home rather than the wish not to upset BC. The elder brother&#8217;s attitude, as recorded by the social worker, likewise reveals a lack of appreciation of the trauma inflicted on BC by the father.</p>

However, I do not find the Local Authority&#8217;s grounds of opposition to be substantial. I cannot see any evidence to justify the Local Authority&#8217;s concern that permitting BC to change her names will set back the ongoing re-building of family relationships. The family do not say that it will, and in any event BC will not insist that they use her new names. BC now has a life that is largely separate from her birth family. In all the circumstances the change of names would not impinge greatly upon them. The most important issue affecting family relationships is the father&#8217;s conduct and the pending criminal trial. I do take into account that the trial is likely to be a time of stress for BC and all the family. If he is found guilty he is liable to be sentenced to a long period of imprisonment. Relationships within the family might well come under considerable strain. In my judgement, having considered the written evidence and submissions, the change of name will not be a significant contributor to any strain on relationships at the time or after the trial. The father&#8217;s conduct, the verdict, and the sentence will be much more significant.</p>

However, the views of the parents and the wider family are not determinative of the application and are but one factor that the court must consider. Their attitude and views are relevant insofar as they may affect their conduct and attitude but I do not believe that the name changes will actually adversely affect the attitude and conduct of the mother or brothers to the detriment of BC.  </p>

I rely on the professional opinion of the Deputy Safeguarding Lead in that respect. The foster carers, in whose care BC has thrived, will also provide her with support through the process. I accept that the name changes might prompt questioning of BC but she has thought about that, as has the school, and she is prepared for it. I accept that there is a possibility that BC might regret making the changes. If she does so, and she believes that it would be better to revert to the name BC, she can apply to do so, or in just over two years, she can change her name without the need for consent or leave.</p>

In particular, if her father were acquitted, BC will doubtless feel very vulnerable and the refusal of permission to her to change her name could cause her considerable distress in such circumstances. To be clear, BC does not seek to change her name to avoid other people recognising a connection between her and her father. The changes would be for her own psychological and emotional benefit. When her name is used it is a constant reminder of her trauma. Her name is part of her identity and affects her self-perception. She wants to extinguish the association of her name with her abuser to help her develop a more positive experience of being herself. </p>

To an extent it appears BC&#8217;s therapist may share that view, albeit their reported view is hedged. In fact, CA 1989 s33(7) requires the court&#8217;s leave to &#8220;cause&#8221; a child &#8220;to be known by a new surname&#8221;. Arguably, changing her name by usage, without the court&#8217;s leave, as the Local Authority suggest, would offend that provision. Put another way, if I were to give permission for BC to use a different surname even informally without making a change by deed poll, I would in fact be giving permission under CA 1989 s33(7) as has been sought. In any event, BC seeks to change her name in an official manner, to make a formal break with her current names and I recognise that wish. If there were no court order permitting a change of names, BC&#8217;s objective would not be met: the Local Authority&#8217;s suggestion would not serve the purpose sought by BC. She wants a formal court order permitting her to change her names in order to reflect the seriousness and significance of the change.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A change of forename and/or surname for a child is a serious decision whatever the age of the child. The court&#8217;s paramount consideration is the best interests of the child. The views of others, in particular of those with parental responsibility, are to be taken into account. The family&#8217;s views are relevant insofar as they may affect their conduct and attitude and therefore affect the welfare of the child. The views of the Local Authority, having parental responsibility in respect of a child in care, are of importance. The court must take into account the child&#8217;s competence to make the decision, their age and maturity, the steadfastness of their wish to change their names, and the reasons behind the wish to make the changes. The court should consider the choice of name(s) &#8211; are they frivolous or would they be liable to be detrimental to the welfare of the child because of their nature or associations? The court should have close regard to the impact on the child of allowing them to change their name(s) as well as the impact of refusing them leave to do so. In the case of an older child, the court can have regard to the fact that a 16 or 17 year old not in care and not subject to a relevant child arrangements order or special guardianship order, could change their name without consent or leave, as could any 18 year old.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the legal framework and all the evidence and circumstances in this case, I have little hesitation in allowing the application and in giving leave to BC to change her forename and surname so that she shall be known as JKL. I suggest that if she wishes to do so, once she is 16 years old, she should be assisted to change her name by unenrolled deed poll. My order gives her leave to do so. I give considerable weight to the settled wishes of a mature, competent 15 year old who has good reason to wish to change both her forename and surname, who has chosen sensible new names that are not frivolous or provocative or liable to be detrimental to her welfare in any way. I am content that she has thought through the decision and is aware of the significance of the changes proposed. I am confident that she will be well supported at school and in her foster placement in the change process, that she will enjoy psychological and emotional benefit from the changes, and that she would be liable to suffer psychological and emotional harm were her application to be refused. The Local Authority might consider funding further therapy to support her though the process of the name changes (and the pending trial of her father). I do not believe that her family relationships will be harmed by the proposed name changes. In my judgement it is clearly in BC&#8217;s best interests to allow this application.</p>
