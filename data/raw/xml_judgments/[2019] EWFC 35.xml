A fourth child A, a boy now aged 9, lives with his maternal grandfather (MGF) in Slovakia.   The mother, the father of A, B and C (F), the father of D (G) and all the children are Slovakian nationals.  </p>

The children returned to Slovakia on 17 August 2016 and were subsequently returned to the care of their mother.   She then moved again to England with the children in March 2018 with a then settled intention to remain here.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.5in">All parties agree for the purpose of these proceedings that the children are habitually resident here.  However, the Slovakian Central Authority (SCA) as Intervener, supported by the mother (represented by Mr Hand), requests transfer of the proceedings to the Slovakian courts pursuant to Article 15 of B11R.  The request is opposed by the local authority, Dorset Council, represented by Ms Frith, and by the guardian on behalf of the children who are represented by Mr Skinner. </p>

It seems he has spent time in England.   G was not identified as D&#8217;s father by the mother until her response to threshold filed on 13 May 2019.

Her first language is Slovak.    The foster carers report that all three children speak English very well, probably 90% of the time, and D tells B and C to speak English if he hears them speaking Slovakian.  Sometimes B speaks Slovakian to C if he is struggling to understand something.  The foster carers think English is D&#8217;s first language. </p>

MGF was imprisoned in October 2011.   In May 2012 the care of A was entrusted to the Crisis Centre, with B and C joining him in August 2012 following orders made by the Slovakian court.  The main reason was that the mother had escaped the household due to an alleged physical attack, robbery and threats by F.    In September 2012 A and, in December 2012, B and C returned to the care of the mother, since when the family had been supported by social services in Slovakia and MGF. </p>

It became clear that the local authority could not prove habitual residence and the issue became one of continuation of the emergency orders which had been made under Article 20 of B11R pending the return of the children to Slovakia and institution of proceedings there.  Theis J made findings in that context.  I note, however, that the findings came at the end of a three day hearing during which Theis J heard oral evidence from the mother, F and his brother. </p>

And if they do, and the court decides they are not safe with their mother, the prospect will be for placement outside the family (and the distinct possibility of sibling separation given the likely outcomes for children of their different ages).   Those outcomes for the children would of course only result if nothing else would do.   At the moment there are family members in Slovakia who are being assessed.  And I bear in mind that A is living with MGF who is willing to take on the other children.  So, a move at some point is a distinct possibility. </p>

I repeat, this is not to undermine comity of either judicial or social work authorities, but is part of all the circumstances the court must consider.  Given the unsettled lives of these children so far, the court would need to have an understanding of plans following transfer to be able to determine best interests. </p>
