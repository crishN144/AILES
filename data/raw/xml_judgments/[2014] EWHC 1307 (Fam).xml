	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This is an application made by the applicants in relation to a little boy (Q) who is now one year old.  This application has resulted in the lawyers and the court having to consider the legal complexities that arise from this application. If nothing else Q will leave his mark long term in the legal textbooks that consider this area of the law.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The court has had the considerable benefit of written and oral submissions from advocates with expertise in this field.  Ms Cabeza and her instructing solicitor Ms Gamble have been involved in a number of these cases and the written skeleton argument submitted on their behalf has been of great assistance in navigating some of the unchartered waters this case has had to consider. Their analysis of the law has been considered by the Advocate to the Court, Ms Carew. The skeleton argument submitted by her was of the highest standard and the court is extremely grateful for the role she has willingly undertaken. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This case highlights once more the legal complexities in this area of the law and the need for those who embark on international surrogacy arrangements to ensure they have expert advice both here and in the jurisdiction where the arrangement is taking place. This international flavour of this case is not unusual: the applicants are of British and French origin, the child was born in the US to a US surrogate mother in an arrangement that involved legal procedures between two US States, the family currently live in France and the proceedings for a parental order are here.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The applicants, Ms C and Mr C, are a British-French married couple who are currently living in France. Ms C was born overseas to British parents who were working on a temporary posting abroad and who subsequently returned to live permanently in England, where they still reside. Ms C was raised in this jurisdiction and lived here until 2006 when she met Mr C, who lived in France. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">All legal steps were taken in Minnesota to secure the applicants&#8217; status as Q&#8217;s legal parents. Their US attorney Mr Synder has provided a detailed report setting out the relevant legal framework. This confirms that, in line with normal post-birth procedure in Minnesota, an order was made shortly after Q&#8217;s birth confirming Mr C as Q&#8217;s legal father and, with her consent, extinguishing Ms D&#8217;s legal motherhood. Immediately afterwards (at the same court hearing) a step parent adoption order was made under Minnesota law securing Ms C&#8217;s position as Q&#8217;s legal mother. This enabled the applicants to be recorded as Q&#8217;s legal parents on his birth certificate which was issued in Iowa. The orders made by the Minnesota court are recognised in other US states (including Iowa) by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the US Constitution. I shall return to this aspect of the case later.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In considering this application, the court has to be satisfied about two matters:  firstly, whether the requirements of s 54 of the Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Act 2008 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>) are satisfied and, secondly, whether Q&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs will be secured by this court making a parental order (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>)).</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It is quite clear from the detailed material that I have considered, in particular the statement filed by Ms C and Mr C, this has been a very long and difficult journey for them to fulfil their wish to be able to have a child of their own.  That journey has, however, been rewarded with the arrival of Q who it is quite clear has brought them enormous fulfilment and joy. </p>

	    <num>11</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">One of the matters that the court will need to consider is the relevance, or not, of the adoption order that was made in Minnesota.  In summary, I am quite satisfied on the evidence of this case that not only has there been no contravention of s 83 of the Adoption &amp; Children Act 2002 as it is quite clear that neither the applicant nor the child were habitually resident in this jurisdiction at the time the order was applied for, but also that it is necessary for the court to consider a parental order application to ensure Mr C&#8217;s position is clear in relation to his status regarding Q in this jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">So, for those very brief reasons, whilst the adoption made in Minnesota is an important part of the background to this matter it does not, and should not, prevent this court considering the application for the parental order.</p>

The evidence clearly establishes that there is a biological connection between Ms C and Q, and Q was carried by Ms D who carried Q pursuant to a surrogacy arrangement that was entered into in the US.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The second matter the court has to consider is the status of the applicants&#8217; relationship.  They are married and so clearly meet that requirement.

The application was issued within the period of six months. (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54 (3)</ref>)</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Fourthly, the court has to consider whether the Q&#8217;s home was with the applicants at the time they made their application in June 2013 and when the court is considering making an order. The evidence clearly demonstrates that Q has effectively been in the applicants&#8217; care within a matter of hours, if not minutes, after his arrival into this world.  His home was clearly with the applicants at the time the application was issued, and is very clearly in their care at the time the court is considering making the order as he is not only present in court as the court is actually considering whether it should make the order but the report from the parental order reporter makes it clear his home remains with the applicants. (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54 (4)</ref>(a))</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The other aspect of that sub-section is the court has to be satisfied that at least one of the applicants is domiciled in this jurisdiction to enable them to make the application.  This application can be determined irrespective of whether there is habitual residence or physical presence in this jurisdiction.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The importance of domicile has been highlighted in previous cases, in particular by what McFarlane J (as he then was) said in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re G(Surrogacy: Foreign Domicile) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/2814" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 2814 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 2814 (Fam)</ref></span> at paragraph 3 (when he considered the comparable provisions in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>)</p>

What renders the case of young M remarkable, and justifies this detailed judgment, is that Mr and Mrs G, the commissioning parents, are Turkish nationals who are domiciled in Turkey.

If that is indeed the case, then such orders must have been made outside the jurisdiction of the court, which, as I have indicated, is confined to applicant parents where one or both is domiciled in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man.

The court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make a parental order rests solely on the requirement in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.54 (4)</ref> (b) that at least one of the Applicants has a domicile in a part of the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Although a parental order has the effect of conferring parental responsibility on the child&#8217;s new legal parents, the primary function of the provision is to transfer legal parenthood from the surrogate and her husband to the applicants.  Accordingly this provision is primarily concerned with parentage and status and not parental responsibility, consequently it is more like an adoption order than an order made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or a special guardianship order.  Therefore, while orders which transfer legal parentage following a surrogacy arrangement are not referred to explicitly in any part of Brussels II revised (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) such orders must fall within the Article 1(3) of Brussels II revised which explicitly excludes matters related to the establishment of parentage and adoption.</p>

Whether the sums paid are so disproportionate to reasonable expenses to either overbear the will of the surrogate mother or to exploit her.  I am satisfied, bearing in mind the court&#8217;s knowledge of other payments that have been made in similar cases and also the fact that they were negotiated at arms length through a third party agency, that the sum paid was not so disproportionate to expenses that were incurred.  I also have to consider whether the applicants have acted in good faith and whether there has been any suggestion that they have sought to defraud the authorities.  I am entirely satisfied in this case on the information that I have seen, that all the evidence points the other way.  Both of these applicants have acted entirely with good faith.  They have sought advice at all relevant stages and have provided full cooperation with all the relevant authorities, any directions made by the court and in any requests made by the parental order reporter.  In the circumstances of this case it is appropriate for the court to exercise its discretion to authorise the payments that have been made.

Minnesota and Iowa both fall into the third category mentioned above... Therefore surrogacy arrangements are fashioned under and carried out through other laws regarding parentage that were not necessarily intended to apply to surrogacy.

In that scenario the court will need to consider, in the light of the facts of that case, whether the applicants have acted in good faith or whether it would amount to a clear abuse of public policy which may prevent the court making a parental order. In circumstances such as this case, where the applicants acted in good faith relying on reputable legal advice it may be difficult to say they were not acting in good faith. However, each case is fact sensitive and needs to be carefully considered.</p>

It is merely a geographical accident that the applicants&#8217; legal parentage in the US was secured by way of adoption rather than a parentage order. The applicants wish for the same legal certainty as other parents through surrogacy in similar situations.</p>

The court is greatly assisted in undertaking that task by the report from Mrs. Sivills who has met the applicants and Q on a visit whilst they were visiting family here.  The report is dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014 and it sets out within the body of that report between para.23 and 28 an assessment of the welfare checklist, which I fully agree with.  She concludes her assessment at para.29 of the report as follows:  </p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.83in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The applicants&#8217; approach to this application reflects the care and attention to detail that they have given to the whole process of attempting to have a child.  Their love and pride in Q is evident, and he is now a member of a supportive extended family on both sides.  The relationship of the applicants is loving, good-humoured and mutually supportive.  They communicate effectively and would score highly on any parenting-capacity assessment.  There is every welfare reason why Q should remain happily and grow up confidently in the care of the applicants.  Their close friendship with the respondents will enrich the details to be given to him of special arrangements that were made to bring him into the world.  I have no doubt that Q&#8217;s understanding of his history will be a positive and open process handled sensitively by the applicants.&#8221;  </span></p>

It is quite clear that Q&#8217;s lifelong welfare can only be met by securing his relationship with both of the applicants in a lifelong way that will give them equal status that will endure for the rest of their lives. The only order that is capable of doing that is a parental order.</p>
