A report on her by Lisa Wolfe, a clinical psychologist, dated 28th November 2013 found that she had an insecure avoidant attachment style caused by a physically abusive childhood.  She lacks a blueprint to have a functional male relationship.  She has been poor at self-monitoring her feelings.  Although she does not accept this, it appears that she has not had a relationship with a male that has not been abusive in one way or another.</p>

She is attending a college and is a talented artist.  She has been described as being a troubled young lady.  Lisa Wolfe diagnosed a social anxiety disorder and an avoidant attachment style.  The Mother says she is about to be diagnosed on the autistic spectrum, but that seems to have been a long process that has not reached a conclusion.  CB lives with her Mother although the Local Authority has a supervision order which expired yesterday, 4th February.  Given her age, it cannot be renewed. </p>

On one occasion, BB had to go out onto the street to shout for help at 11 pm because he was so distressed and concerned for the Mother.  He was aged seven at the time.</p>

In August 2005, a car was set alight in the family&#8217;s front garden and petrol was thrown at the house.  Z&#8217;s sons were implicated along with another attack on the family home.  The Mother then separated from Z briefly.  In March 2006, Z himself damaged the front door.   </p>

Almost immediately, there was an anonymous referral alleging that the Mother was drunk in charge of the children.  Z followed the family.  Domestic abuse and alcoholism continued to the undoubted detriment of all the children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Indeed, it is clear that the Mother has had serious alcohol problems on and off over approximately a sixteen year period.  She has regularly sought professional help.  She has remained free of alcohol for significant periods but the evidence until 2013 was that, very regrettably, she always eventually lapsed back into drinking again notwithstanding the professional help she had been getting.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In July 2008, the Police removed DB and CB to a place of safety.  They remained in foster care for nearly six months.  The Mother told me she began to seek help from a drug an alcohol support agency in 2007.  This has continued in one form or another ever since.  I consider this important in the context of the evidence I have heard in relation to this application.   </p>

In December 2008, DB and CB were rehabilitated to her but she soon relapsed into alcohol misuse.  That is not to her credit and is again something I will need to consider carefully.  I am told that she had two separate relapses but the file was closed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 2010, the Mother commenced a relationship with the Father.   The Mother was undoubtedly still getting help from a drug an alcohol support agency around this time.  On 5th August 2011, the Father made threats against both the Mother and a drug an alcohol support agency worker.  In November 2011, AB rang the Police to tell them that CB was very distressed as her Mother and the Father were arguing.  The Father was threatening to blow up the Mother&#8217;s house.  Later in November 2011, he told his GP that he had assaulted the Mother.  In January 2012, the case was reopened as CB was suicidal.  The Mother&#8217;s alcohol misuse was an issue again.  The Father was told to leave the home and an agreement was reached that he would not return.  It was signed in March 2012 and stipulated that the Mother was to have no contact with the Father.</p>

In late April 2012, the Police removed the Father from the home after yet another incident of domestic violence.  In mid May 2012, the Father was telling third parties that the relationship was ongoing.  The Father was removed again by the Police later in May 2012.</p>

She noted in her judgment that both parents accepted that the threshold criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> was satisfied.  The Father supported a care order and a placement order.   The Mother opposed the orders.   She sought one last chance.  She asked for adjournment to attempt rehabilitation.  Her position was, however, that if the judge rejected rehabilitation, she supported adoption over long term fostering.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Judge had grave concerns about CB and DB&#8217;s welfare which, she said, increased as the evidence was heard.  It appears that, as a result of this, the Local Authority issued care proceedings in relation to CB and DB.   The judge said that, even if the Mother had an &#8220;epiphany&#8221; moment, it would be an impossible task for her to keep the Father away from her home.  She found that he was likely to seek her out on his release.   She further found that the Mother tells the Local Authority only what she wants to tell them, despite knowing full well that she needs to disclose but choosing not to do so.  She had chosen abusive partners because of her own abusive upbringing and the psychological harm it caused her.  She needed to be in a relationship, whatever the cost to her or the children.  She was at times evasive and at other times belligerent when cross-examined.  She was an unreliable witness.  The judge had no doubt that the true level of violence against her and the number of meetings between her and the Father was far higher than the Mother said.  She sensed their relationship was far from over.  The Mother had no insight into the impact of all of this on the children.  The parents would drink alcohol when they met up.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The history had shown that the Mother had numerous reconciliations with abusive partners.  The Father was bound to try to seek her out and would always try to parent E, his only child.  These were very high and unmanageable risks.  She took the clear view that no lesser order than a placement order would do.  Adoption was the only way.  She found that E would settle into a new family with ease and would form strong bonds and attachments.  The Mother had had umpteen chances but had failed to change.  Whilst I must consider the position since Judge Edwards&#8217; judgment, the findings of fact she made are what the lawyers call &#8220;res judicata&#8221;.  In other words, they are binding on me.  For what it is worth, I am quite sure I would have come to exactly the same conclusion given everything that I have read about the case.</p>

I do, however, note that this is what she had done before when the girls were removed in 2008.  As a result of her efforts, for which she is entitled to considerable credit, Judge Edwards made a supervision order for one year in relation to both girls on 4th February 2014.  It appears that the Local Authority was content to seek no order but the Guardian wanted care orders with placement with the Mother.  In one sense, the supervision order was a compromise but I do not see that anything very much turns on that.   </p>

She added that she had undertaken therapeutic work leading to greater self-awareness.  She had (and has) achieved abstinence from alcohol.  She had satisfied the court she can provide primary care to the other children.  She had achieved a level of self reliance and confidence which makes her unrecognisable from the woman dominated by the Father.

A child&#8217;s circumstances may &#8220;require&#8221; statutory intervention, perhaps may even &#8220;require&#8221; the indefinite or long-term removal of the child from  the family and his or her placement with strangers but that is not to say that the same circumstances will necessarily &#8220;require&#8221; that the child be adopted.  They may or they may not. The question, at the end of the day, is whether what is &#8220;required&#8221; is adoption.&#8221;</span></p>

He said it was time to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">call a halt</span>&#8221;.  The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

The court has the jurisdiction to set aside the order (so to that extent it might be said to be voidable) but until it is set aside it remains in full force and effect.  For it to be otherwise would cause chaos.  I am quite clear that the order of Judge Edwards is not void.  It has not been appealed or set aside.  It is a valid placement order that authorised placement with the applicants.  </p>

In fact, she only went twice, once before the final hearing and once after as a farewell contact.  When asked why she didn&#8217;t go in the summer holidays, she told TT that she did not wake up in time.  I was slightly surprised by this.  It may be an explanation for a fifteen year old not going but not for a nine year old.  On one occasion, in answer to a question as to what she would want if she could have anything in the world, she said to move away (presumably from the Father) and to have E back.

It is also right to note that the report of the Guardian, MM, does not specifically deal with the position of CB and DB.  This was wrong, particularly given <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>(f) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> which requires the court to consider the relationship which the child has with relatives and in particular &#8220;the wishes and feelings of any of the child&#8217;s relatives&#8230;regarding the child&#8221;.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">What effect does this have on the order of Judge Edwards?  It is clear that Judge Edwards was very concerned about the position of CB and DB.  Her primary concern, however, was not that their existence was a reason for returning E to his birth family but the opposite, namely her apparent view at the time that CB and DB should follow him out of the Mother&#8217;s care.  I do not criticise the Local Authority for not having issued care proceedings before September 2013 in relation to both girls. Given their ages, very different considerations applied to them than applied to E.  It was unfortunate though in that, if care proceedings had been issued at the same time in relation to all three, the views of all three would undoubtedly have been to the forefront of the Judge&#8217;s thinking.</p>

The fact that there was not does not, however, invalidate her order.  A very similar issue arose before me in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The Prospective Adopters v IA and Another</span> [2014] EWHC 331 where it was alleged that the placement order was fundamentally flawed.  I was able to cure the alleged defect by granting permission to oppose the adoption.  This allowed the matter to be fully considered at the adoption hearing.  This is exactly what has happened here.  Moreover, I also granted CB party status.  I am quite clear that the views and position of both CB and DB have been fully canvassed before me.   I am quite satisfied that the defect has therefore been cured prior to an adoption order being made.</p>

In answer to questions from Ms Waldron for the Local Authority, she said that she &#8220;imagined removing him would be painful and traumatic&#8221; but I did not gain the impression that she had any real insight into this.  She said she would like a smooth transition but it was clear that she thought this could be achieved easily and within a short period.  I do not necessarily criticise her for this.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do accept that the Mother has made changes from the position she was in at the time of the hearing before Judge Edwards.   It may well be that, confronted with E&#8217;s removal and the real threat of the removal of CB and DB, forced her to confront her demons.  In October 2013, she was still binge drinking.  I recognise that she has been entirely clear of alcohol and other illegal substances since then.  That is to her credit.  I also accept that she has ended her relationship with the Father.  That is also to her credit.  I do not accept, however, that this is a damascene conversion. This just puts her back in the position that she has been on many occasions in the past.  In 2008, she took exactly the same steps to secure the return of the girls to her care but relatively shortly thereafter lapsed back to her old ways.  She has had significant help from professionals going back over sixteen years. She has had assistance from a drug and alcohol support agency since 2007.  Yet, she relapsed and formed an entirely inappropriate relationship with the Father.  She let down her children again.  E was even conceived in breach of an agreement with the Local Authority to have no contact with the Father.  I realise this is hard but she simply did not learn the lesson from the girls being taken into care in 2008 and, in the light of the history, it is impossible to say she has learned it now.  There is clearly still a very substantial risk of relapse.  The judgment of Judge Edwards remains pertinent.  The Local Authority and Guardian are entirely right to be very cautious.</p>

I am bound by the findings of Judge Edwards.   The Mother is an intelligent woman.  She understands fully the findings Judge Edwards made yet her evidence to me was exactly the same evidence that she gave Judge Edwards in a significant number of respects and on which she had been disbelieved.  These included the number of times she had met the Father; the number of times they had sexual intercourse; the amount of drinking and the level of violence.  She did say she accepted there were things that she omitted to tell the Local Authority but I did not gain the impression that she was really accepting responsibility.  In the earlier proceedings, she had accepted that if she had E with her the Father would not stop trying to seek her out.  She denied that this would be a problem when she gave evidence to me.  She was found by Judge Edwards to be someone who needs to be in a relationship.  She denied this to me saying she was quite happy being single and would not make the same mistakes again.  Regrettably, I do not have sufficient confidence that this is the case.  </p>

In final submissions, Ms Waldron said that &#8220;the Mother still does not appear to make any real acknowledgment of her part in what happened&#8221;.

For this, he is entitled to credit.  But it has been far easier given that E is not there.  He tells me he has turned over a new leaf as well, since his release from prison.  I hope this is the case but I am sceptical.  He appears still to be drinking, even if it is only occasionally.

I do not think he could prevent himself from doing so as this would involve him accepting very limited supervised contact.  The Mother&#8217;s response was to say that the restraining order would protect her but this is a very na&#239;ve position, particularly given all the difficulties that occurred before.  I would have very serious concerns for the welfare of E and the older girls.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Finally, there is the point that all changes made by the Mother are too late.  She was warned by HHJ Judge John that she was in the last chance saloon. She failed to take the warning.  She lost E.  Even before Judge Edwards, it was clear that any changes she made would not be within E&#8217;s timescales.  Nearly eighteen months have passed.  There would still be considerable work to do even if E could be returned to her care.  I am not sure the Social Worker and Guardian were right when they referred to years but they are right that it could not be done tomorrow.  This is all far too late for this little boy.  It is hard to say but the Mother had her chance and she did not take it.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">My paramount concern is E&#8217;s welfare throughout his life.  I have come to two very clear conclusions.  The first is important but the second is far more important.  The first is that the Local Authority and the Guardian have made out their case as to the risks inherent in any return to Mother being very considerable.  The second, however, relates to the absolutely devastating impact on E were he to be removed from the applicants at this stage.  He has become part of their family.  He now does not know his birth family.  He cannot simply be uprooted.  He is not a baby.  Equally, he is not the same age as DB.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Mr Blake submitted to me that there would be no difficulty as the applicants, as good loving people, would be able to facilitate his gradual return to his Mother.  I accept, of course, that they are good loving people but I consider that the analogy that I made in submissions, when he raised this argument, is a fair one.  It would be like asking birth parents whose child had been placed for adoption to facilitate the move to the adopters.  It is impossible to imagine how distraught they would be.  I consider that this would make E distraught as well.  Such an arrangement would not be possible.  He would therefore have to move to another foster placement with no guarantee that he would be able to move back to his Mother permanently.  I cannot imagine anything more detrimental to his welfare.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">When this is placed alongside my findings as to the continuing concerns about the Mother, the position becomes overwhelming.   The simple fact is that the Mother&#8217;s changes have come too late.  The Mother was warned as to her conduct.  I accept that an adoption order means a permanent separation from E&#8217;s birth family and he may well experience conflicting emotions of loss over the years ahead.  Every other point, however, goes strongly in favour of adoption.  I have set them all out above.  I have no doubt that E would suffer significant harm if he was now moved from the applicants.  When all matters are considered, I find that no other order other than adoption will do. Even though it is a draconian order, it is the only order that can be made in this case to secure E&#8217;s welfare.  It follows that I am quite clear that E&#8217;s welfare requires me to dispense with the Mother&#8217;s consent.  I do not believe I need to do so in relation to the Father as he does not have parental responsibility but, if I am wrong about that, I would dispense with his consent as well.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I reject the submission that the position of CB and DB requires me to come to a different conclusion.  I consider that if more emphasis had been placed on their views before Judge Edwards, she would still have come to exactly the same conclusions given E&#8217;s welfare.  The Judge would, after all, have been considering the elder girls&#8217; wishes in circumstances where she, at least, thought that they too might well have to be removed from the Mother&#8217;s care.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I do not consider that the Judge would have insisted on attempts being made to find an open adoptive placement for E given the difficulties inherent in doing so and the fact that the Mother in particular has never accepted adoption.  But, in any event, as Mr Prosser submitted to me, we are where we are.  It is a very regrettable consequence of the history of this case that E&#8217;s welfare decisively trumps the Article 8 rights to family life.  Whilst unfortunate, it is now inevitable. There will, of course, have to be careful life story work.  I could, if I thought it right, make a contact order to E&#8217;s siblings.  Exceptionally, I can even do this if the applicants do not agree.  I must therefore now turn to the issue of contact following adoption.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In commencing this part of my judgment, I must refer briefly to the submissions on behalf of the Mother that, even if I accede to the adoption application, I should order some sort of shared parenting arrangement between her and the applicants.  I reject such a solution absolutely.  It is entirely inconsistent with the adoption order I would be making.  If it were right, I would not be making an adoption order at all and I am quite clear that I must do so in E&#8217;s interests for all the reasons I have given.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">There are certain circumstances in which it is appropriate for there to be an open adoption but I am clear that this is not one.  Again, it is for all the reasons I have given but by far and away the most important is that the Mother does not accept the adoptive placement.  This of itself would be fatal to anything other than identity contact as it would run the real risk of jeopardising the stability of the adoptive placement.  It therefore follows that, if there was to be contact, it would be for identity purposes only.  Indeed, it is clear that this is the position in the vast majority of cases where there is post-adoption contact.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I was referred to research by the University of East Anglia as to outcomes for children following adoption.  Of the cases studied, there was no contact in 11%.  There was letterbox contact in 80%.  There was face to face contact with adult birth relatives in 17% but only 9% was with a birth parent and then it was usually once or twice per annum, often for brief periods.  A high level of contact is extremely unusual.   There are significant challenges to introducing contact when the child has no memory of a birth parent.  It requires a high level of management.  It can be very distressing and confusing for the child.  The applicants would, in general, be expected to make the arrangements.  This can cause difficulties in managing the emotions of the birth family so as to protect the boundaries of the adoptive family.  In a serial number adoption, such as here, this would almost certainly lead to a lifting of the veil of anonymity.  I have concluded that this would all be impossible in this case where there has been such a high degree of conflict. Mr Jones for the applicants submitted to me that it was asking far too much of the adopters.  I agree.</p>

Anything else would run the real risk of undermining the placement to the huge detriment of E. Even if the contact was only to DB and CB, it would be extremely difficult to ensure confidentiality to the Applicants, particularly as E got older.</p>

Inevitably, I have come to this conclusion reluctantly but I am clear that it is the only order that will provide the stability in his adoptive placement that E needs.  Direct contact is not something I should impose upon these Applicants.</p>

It is the only outcome to which I could come that is consistent with the welfare of E throughout his life.   </p>
