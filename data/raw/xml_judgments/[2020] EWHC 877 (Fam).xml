	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The United Kingdom is a subscriber to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It was incorporated into our domestic law by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> which came into force on 1 August 1986. Section 28(1)(c) allows Her Majesty by Order in Council to direct that the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref> may be extended to any colony. In fact, no such Order has ever been made in relation to Bermuda, in contrast, for example, to the Cayman Islands. This is because in 1998 the Bermuda legislature enacted the International Child Abduction Act 1998, which is in virtually identical terms to the United Kingdom 1985 Act. Accordingly, the United Kingdom notified the Hague Convention depository, in accordance with article 39 the Convention, that the Convention had been extended to Bermuda on 21 December 1998 and that it took effect there on 1 August 1999. </p>

The current list is contained within the Child Abduction and Custody (Parties to Conventions) (Amendment) Order 2020 (SI 2020 No. 277).

For the purposes of the Convention British Overseas Territories are treated as being part of the United Kingdom. Just as the Convention does not operate between, England and Wales, on the one hand, and Scotland on the other so it does not operate between the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and British Overseas Territories on the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">If a child is removed from Scotland to England it is very unlikely that there would be a welfare-based enquiry in England as to whether that child should be returned to Scotland. This is because, inevitably, an order would be made in Scotland requiring the return of the child (or some other suitable child arrangements made), and such order would be automatically recognised in England pursuant to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. But the mutual recognition of orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> only applies to orders made in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is no automatic statutory recognition of orders between the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories. Nor does the mutual recognition of orders regime under the 1996 Hague Convention apply to orders made in British Overseas Territories. It would seem that the only way in which a return order made in a British Overseas Territory could be recognised would be pursuant to the common law. The common law on the recognition of foreign orders about children was recently analysed by the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">C v C (Jersey)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2019/40" uk:canonical="[2019] UKPC 40" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] UKPC 40</ref>. As I understand it such a foreign order can and should be recognised unless it would be contrary to public policy to do so. The Privy Council&#8217;s analysis demonstrates that in determining the question of public policy the court does not embark on a full welfare-based enquiry. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In this case there exist in Bermuda orders granting the parents joint custody of RR; the mother care and control; and the father access on alternate weekends. It is obviously implicit in such orders that the child should reside in Bermuda. Recognition in this country of that order would inevitably lead to a consequential order in this country for the return of the child to Bermuda. However, that is not a path that the father has adopted in this case. He has applied in Form C66 to the High Court for an order pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction for the summary return of RR to Bermuda. The decisions of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Child) (Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)</span> [2005<span style="font-size:13pt">] UKHL 40, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 80</ref> </span>and of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re NY (a child) </span>2019] UKSC 49, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2019] 3 WLR 962" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] 3 WLR 962</ref> confirm that this is a permissible path.

That was another case involving a removal of a child from Bermuda. In summarising the law Theis J stated at para 21(2) &#8220;there is no basis for the principles of the Hague Convention being extended to countries which are not parties to that convention&#8221; and proceeded to go on to decide the case on the false basis that Bermuda was not a country which was a party to the Convention, when in fact it was. </p>

On 21 June 2018, by consent, the court made an order for joint custody; care and control to the mother; and access in favour of the father each weekend. The court later directed the parties to attend mediation. That resulted in an agreement made on 9 July 2019 which was embodied in an order made by the court the following day on 10 July 2019. That agreement granted the father access for two nights every alternate weekend. As stated above, although the agreement and order does not explicitly state that RR must live in Bermuda, that is obviously an implied term of the order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother has suffered from Crohn&#8217;s disease since the age of 18. She says, and it is not disputed by the father, that following the birth of RR the disease has extended to the vulva. This is a rare condition, with debilitating effects. The father acknowledges this. She claims that Bermuda does not have the medical experience or facilities to deal with her condition; and that in any event she could not afford any such treatment that was on offer. Indeed, she says that the hospital that she attended in May 2019 in Boston, Massachusetts was similarly ill-equipped to deal with her condition. In contrast, she claims that the National Health Service in Birmingham is equipped to deal with her condition, and it is for this primary reason that it would not be in RR&#8217;s interests for an order to be made requiring his return to Bermuda. Essentially, she claims that the only place where she can properly be treated for her condition is Birmingham, and as primary carer of RR he will, perforce, have to stay here with her. Thus, her primary argument is that it would be contrary to RR&#8217;s best interests for him </p>

Upon my return to Bermuda in May 2019, I began to seriously consider moving to the UK on a permanent basis with RR. There has never been any suggestion that I would have left RR in Bermuda or that I would have relocated without him. The whole purpose of the move was to access health care on a longstanding basis so any consideration of plans were for a permanent move; there was never a suggestion of a short term move simply for surgery or a one off medical appointment. This proposal was not discussed during mediation because it concluded on 10 July 2019 before I had properly formulated any plan.&#8221; </p>

The decision I made to move to the UK was one with RR&#8217;s interests firmly at its centre. I need to be able to access medical treatment to enable me to be the best parent that I can be for RR and which also includes being able to work and provide for him financially. I cannot do this if I am in poor health. If the Court makes an Order that RR must be returned to Bermuda, then I do not know what we would do because we would be returning back to an intolerable situation. It is my understanding that without regular and updated medical treatment, my illness will only get worse. I have already spent in the region of $30,000 on medical treatment and I am in debt. It is impossible for me to be able to secure a level of health insurance with a pre-existing condition that would enable me to cover the costs of further and extensive invasive surgery and medication which will need to take place abroad. It is extremely distressing for me to be in this position at such a young age to know that I have a future of financial difficulties as a result of an illness which I have no control over and has no cure. I will need constant medical attention throughout the rest of my life for my current health to be maintained.&#8221; </p>

This includes the purchase of flight tickets for the return of both mother and child. The mother has additionally asked that the father undertake to support her and the child at the rate of $2000 a month. That would be completely inappropriate. The question of general maintenance for the mother and the child must be for the Bermuda court alone. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There has been a suggestion within the context of the current coronavirus medical emergency that a rescue flight from this country to Bermuda will depart early this week. In order to be registered to go on that flight a commitment had to be made by 3 April 2020. That date has come and gone. The mother is plainly in a vulnerable medical condition. I do not think that it is reasonable to expect her to travel back with the child until the UK government has stated that it is safe for people in vulnerable conditions to travel. However, I will receive further submissions in writing as to when RR should be returned to Bermuda. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally I would make the obvious point that even at this late stage it is open to the mother to apply now, and necessarily remotely, to the court in Bermuda for an interim order permitting her to remain in this country pending the hearing of a substantive application by her for relocation. Were such an order to be made, then, of course, my order for return will be set aside. The order giving effect to my decision will provide for this.  </p>
