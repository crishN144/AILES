There are in fact two properties, number 149 which was the matrimonial home and number 151, next door, which was being renovated. The registered proprietor of both properties &#8211; for both properties are registered at Her Majesty&#8217;s Land Registry &#8211; has at all material times been a Liechtenstein anstalt which, according to the wife, is merely the husband&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">alter ego</span>.</p>

On the following day, 22 November 2005, she applied to me <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte </span>(without notice) seeking a worldwide freezing injunction. She claimed that the husband was about to make an improper disposition of the properties. She understood that the husband was on the point of completing a sale in relation to which contracts had already been exchanged. In the circumstances the wife&#8217;s advisers took the view that there was no need to join the anstalt as a party. They took the view that it would be sufficient if the injunction, although directed only against the husband, was served on the anstalt and on the purchasers. It was known that the property was subject to a charge or mortgage in favour of Citibank. Accordingly, the freezing injunction I granted contained a provision giving the wife permission to notify certain persons, including the anstalt, Citibank and the purchaser&#8217;s solicitors, of the terms of the order by serving a copy of the order on them. </p>

The anstalt&#8217;s case was that it had taken steps to market the properties in order to avoid a forced sale by Citibank (or a receiver appointed by Citibank) which would probably have achieved a much lower price. It asserted that the sale was an arm&#8217;s length transaction, where there had been a rival bidder to Z and his wife, and that it had in the event obtained a price very substantially in excess of the &#163;16,725,000 at which the properties had been valued in March 2004.</p>

That application came on for hearing before me on 18 January 2006 when, having made an order that the anstalt be joined as a respondent to the proceedings, I made a further order that a representative of Messrs X attend an inspection appointment before me on 21 February 2006. I declined to make any such order in relation to Messrs Y. My order made explicitly clear that it was without prejudice to any arguments that Messrs X and/or the anstalt might wish to raise in respect of legal professional privilege, issues of Liechtenstein law or otherwise. </p>

Mr Rutter and Mr Cook took no real part in the argument, Messrs X perfectly properly taking the view that since their client, the anstalt, was separately represented their only role was to submit to act as the court might direct.

She asserted that the claim should be rejected on that ground alone, alternatively that the anstalt should be required to identify or particularise in greater detail the documents in relation to which privilege was being claimed. I reject both these submissions. The content and meaning of the claim for privilege was clear enough given the context, namely that what had to be produced was a conveyancing file. And in any event Mr Rajah told me on instructions that, if required, any defect in this respect could and would be cured by a claim of privilege formulated in indubitably sufficient terms. So far as concerned the claim for particularisation, Mr Rajah relied, and in my judgment correctly and appropriately relied, upon Vinelott J&#8217;s rejection of a similar application in <span style="font-style:italic">Derby &amp; Co Ltd and others v Weldon and others (No 7) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 1 WLR 1156" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 1 WLR 1156</ref> at pages 1176-1179.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;the test is whether the communication or other document was made confidentially for the purposes of legal advice. Those purposes have to be construed broadly. Privilege obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice. But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege. In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages. There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and client. The negotiations for a lease such as occurred in the present case are only one example. Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach. A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as &#8216;please advise me what I should do&#8217;. But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice. Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This remark is, in my respectful opinion, plainly correct. If a solicitor becomes the client&#8217;s &#8220;man of business&#8221;, and some solicitors do, responsible for advising the client on all matters of business, including investment policy, finance policy and other business matters, the advice may lack a relevant legal context. There is, in my opinion, no way of avoiding difficulty in deciding in marginal cases whether the seeking of advice from or the giving of advice by lawyers does or does not take place in a relevant legal context so as to attract legal advice privilege. In cases of doubt the judge called upon to make the decision should ask whether the advice relates to the rights, liabilities, obligations or remedies of the client either under private law or under public law. If it does not, then, in my opinion, legal advice privilege would not apply. If it does so relate then, in my opinion, the judge should ask himself whether the communication falls within the policy underlying the justification for legal advice privilege in our law. Is the occasion on which the communication takes place and is the purpose for which it takes place such as to make it reasonable to expect the privilege to apply? The criterion must, in my opinion, be an objective one.&#8221;</p>

The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer in confidence will never be revealed without his consent. Legal professional privilege is thus much more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of a particular case. It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests ... it is not for the sake of the applicant alone that the privilege must be upheld. It is in the wider interests of all those hereafter who might otherwise be deterred from telling the whole truth to their solicitors.&#8221;</p>

A contract remains a characteristic part of the process of registered conveyancing: see Ruoff &amp; Roper <span style="font-style:italic">Registered Conveyancing </span>(ed 2003) at para 20.002 and Barnsley&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Conveyancing Law and Practice </span>(ed 4) at page 140.

Moreover, and as I pointed out to Mrs Carew Pole during the course of argument, although it is the responsibility of the <span style="font-style:italic">purchaser&#8217;s </span>solicitor to draft the conveyance or transfer, it is the responsibility of the <span style="font-style:italic">vendor&#8217;s </span>solicitor to draft the contract: see Barnsley&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Conveyancing Law and Practice </span>(ed 4) at pages 140 and 506.

So there is legal work to be done, and legal documents to be drafted, even by the vendor&#8217;s solicitor and even if the land is registered.</p>

I entirely agree. And I might add that it makes no difference that the solicitor has neither been asked to proffer nor has in fact tendered any explicit legal advice on anything. The solicitor retained to act in a conveyancing transaction who places a contract before his client and invites him to sign it is by implication advising that the contract is in the proper legal form to give effect to the client&#8217;s instructions, just as he is by implication advising his client to sign it. </p>

The charge had been created when the cesser of business by the company was inevitable and in order to remove the assets from the scope of a pre-existing floating charge before it crystallised, in other words to defeat or delay the rights of the company&#8217;s debenture holders under the floating charge. The claim, which for technical reasons could not be brought as a statutory claim under the fraudulent preference provisions then contained in section 164 of the Companies Act 1862 (compare now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/239" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 239</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref>), was, however, analogous to a claim to set aside a transaction for fraudulent preference.

There are many contexts in which the court similarly has to strike a balance between the need to do justice to the plaintiff, on the one hand, and, on the other, the extent to which interlocutory relief may result in an unjustified interference with the defendant&#8217;s property and his right to privacy. The point at which the balance is struck must depend on the extent to which the relief sought may unjustifiably invade the defendant&#8217;s rights. So if a plaintiff can show that he has a fairly arguable case and if the defendant can be fully protected by a cross-undertaking in damages, the court in granting or refusing a purely negative injunction will be primarily concerned with a balance of convenience. More is required (in ascending order of importance) if the plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction or &#8230; or if the plaintiff seeks <span style="font-style:italic">Mareva</span> relief or an <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order or the disclosure of confidential banking documents.</p>

An order to disclose documents for which legal professional privilege is claimed lies at the extreme end of the spectrum. Such an order will only be made in very exceptional circumstances but it is, I think, too restrictive to say that the plaintiff&#8217;s case must always be founded on an admission or supported by affidavit evidence or that the court must carry out the preliminary exercise of deciding on the material before it whether the plaintiff&#8217;s case will probably succeed, a task which may well present insurmountable difficulties in a case where fraud is alleged and the court has no more than affidavit evidence. </p>

It has got to be justified by some proper forensic advantage and some proper issue in the case. It seems to me that, against the background of the events of that week in 2005 when I dealt with a succession of applications, this is a case where, on the face of it, it would seem that there were attempts by the husband and/or the anstalt to sell the former matrimonial home (which appears to be, if not the only matrimonial asset of any substance, certainly the most valuable matrimonial asset) behind the wife&#8217;s back and in circumstances where she can legitimately assert, at least on the face of it, that that was part of an attempt not merely to sell the property behind her back but also to dispose of the proceeds of sale in a way which would defeat her matrimonial claims &#8230;  </p>

The wife, it seems to me, has a legitimate interest in exploring that because, after all, it goes to the question of the amount of the matrimonial assets available for the court&#8217;s investigation.</p>

It is an exploration of matters which fairly and properly require to be investigated for the purpose of the litigation. The argument that the application is premature or that the matter should be dealt with by questionnaire does not appeal to me at all. It seems to me that the sooner everybody knows whether there is substance to the wife&#8217;s concerns, the sooner everybody knows whether there is or is not something of importance in this conveyancing file, the better. If there is no substance, the sooner that particular part of the case is put to bed, the better.&#8221;</p>

Essentially it is a wish to find out what has been going on, in a situation where everything is speculation, assumption, rumour, suspicion and uncertainty. Production of Messrs X&#8217;s files was sought, as the wife&#8217;s solicitor put it, so that the wife could &#8220;understand on a more informed basis&#8221; what had been going on. Production was required, as Mrs Carew Pole put it, &#8220;in order to allay any fears or suspicions that may be lurking&#8221;. And although the wife and her advisers were suspicious, there was no express allegation that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> was implicated; indeed, so far as I can see, no express allegation of any conduct of the kind that would be required to destroy legal professional privilege.</p>

But no further evidence was served. So the only evidence put before the court by the wife consists of the two affidavits to which I have already referred. As articulated by Mrs Carew Pole in her written submissions, the wife&#8217;s case is that, at the relevant time, the husband (via the anstalt) was &#8220;acting secretly to sell her home with the intention of defeating her claims for ancillary relief.&#8221;</p>

And he submitted that in any event no evidence, or at least no adequate evidence, had been adduced in support of any allegation of relevantly wrongful conduct. He says it is quite plain that the sale of the properties was not made in furtherance of any fraudulent design. The sale was entered into under pressure from Citibank, and in order to avoid a forced sale by a receiver, following events which had been set in train long before the present proceedings were commenced. And he points out that, in the event, the wife withdrew her opposition to the sale and permitted it to proceed. (I do not think there is much substance in this last point because the wife was, after all, enabled to secure the net proceeds of sale.)</p>

The sale had been so structured (with a sale and leaseback of number 149 and a delayed sale of number 151) as to enable the transaction to be completed and the vast bulk of the money handed over to the anstalt &#8211; the husband&#8217;s creature, as she would have it &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">without the need to give vacant possession of the matrimonial home </span>and accordingly<span style="font-style:italic"/>without the wife knowing anything about what was going on. In other words, she said, the transaction had been so structured as to enable the money to be squirreled away and hidden, no doubt somewhere offshore, before the wife even knew that the matrimonial home had been sold. Mrs Carew Pole asked rhetorically why the letter sent by the wife&#8217;s solicitors to Messrs Y on 21 November 2005 had seemingly stopped the transaction in its tracks if everything was so innocent. (I am not much impressed with this last point: after all, what solicitor acting, as Messrs Y were, for a purchaser would advise their client to buy a lawsuit?)</p>

The question whether the court should inspect the documents is one which is a matter for the discretion of the court, and primarily for the judge of first instance. Each case must depend on its own circumstances; but if, looking at the affidavit, the court finds that the claim to privilege is formally correct, and that the documents in respect of which it is made are sufficiently identified and are such that, prima facie, the claim to privilege would appear to be properly made in respect of them, then, in my judgment, the court should, generally speaking, accept the affidavit as sufficiently justifying the claim without going further and inspecting the documents.&#8221;</p>

I am prepared to assume that people may feel it less worrying if their solicitor&#8217;s file is being examined by a judge rather than by a policeman, but if the papers are indeed privileged then the privilege will have been invaded just the same. Privilege is, in principle, absolute. Too ready a judicial willingness to exercise the power to inspect might well have a seriously chilling effect on people&#8217;s confidence that what they say to their lawyers will not be disclosed and a seriously chilling effect, therefore, on their willingness to speak frankly and without reserve to their lawyers. In short, too ready a judicial willingness to exercise the power to inspect would put at risk the vitally important public policy on which the very principle of the privilege is founded. Moreover, too ready a judicial willingness to exercise the power to inspect would tend to water down the salutary protections against the too ready ousting of privilege which are afforded by the stringent requirements set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Bullivant v A&#8211;G for Victoria </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1901] AC 196" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1901">[1901] AC 196</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">O&#8217;Rourke v Darbishire </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1920] AC 581" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1920">[1920] AC 581</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Derby &amp; Co Ltd and others v Weldon and others (No 7) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 1 WLR 1156" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 1 WLR 1156</ref>.
