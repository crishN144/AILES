	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">EE is a 31 year old woman who wants to become pregnant and have a baby. These are amongst the most fundamental decisions a woman can make but EE&#8217;s capacity to engage in sexual relations, to decide about contact with others, and to make decisions about contraception, are all in issue and require the court&#8217;s determination.  EE was born with a genetic condition called Tuberous Sclerosis which causes benign tumours to develop in different parts of her body, including her brain. She has been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder with mild learning disability, an emotionally unstable personality disorder, and recurrent psychotic disorder. She is on anti-psychotic and other medication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">This judgment follows a one and a half day hearing to determine EE&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations, contact with others, and contraception. Prior to the hearing I met EE in the company of her solicitor and Junior Counsel who made a note which I have approved and which has been shared with the Applicant. I explained to EE my role, the issues the court had to determine, and how she could attend the hearing, which she did throughout the first day, the second morning being devoted only to oral submissions. I am very grateful to Counsel for engaging so helpfully with the difficult issues of capacity which I have to determine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The parties agree that EE has capacity to make decisions to engage in sexual relations and lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others. The Applicant Local Authority submits that EE lacks capacity to &#8220;make decisions about whether to use contraception&#8221;. The Official Solicitor (OS) submits that EE has capacity to make &#8220;decisions about contraception&#8221;. The fact that the parties used different formulations for the matter in respect of which the court must evaluate P&#8217;s capacity to make a decision for herself concerning contraception, points to an important issue for the court to address, namely what <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> the matter in relation to contraception which EE has to decide.</p>

If she is found to lack capacity to make decisions about contraception or other matters then the court will have to consider what decisions might be made on her behalf, in her best interests.</p>

Although in theory the &#8216;reasonably foreseeable consequences&#8217; of not taking contraception involve possible conception, a birth and the parenting of a child, there should be some limit in practice on what needs to be envisaged, if only for public policy reasons.  I accept the submission that it is unrealistic to require consideration of a woman&#8217;s ability to foresee the realities of parenthood, or to expect her to be able to envisage the fact-specific demands of caring for a particular child not yet conceived (let alone born) with unpredictable levels of third-party support. I do not think such matters are reasonably foreseeable: or, to borrow an expression from elsewhere, I think they are too remote from the medical issue of contraception.  To apply the wider test would be to &#8216;set the bar too high&#8217; and would risk a move away from personal autonomy in the direction of social engineering. Further, if one were to admit of a requirement to be able to foresee things beyond a child&#8217;s birth, then drawing a line on into the child&#8217;s life would be nigh impossible. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Dr Todd has advised, and the parties agree, that EE has capacity to make decisions to engage in sexual relations. I am not bound so to find. I have regard to the legal framework set out earlier in this judgment and, crucially, the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>. Baker LJ&#8217;s formulation of the information relevant to a decision to engage in sexual relations included &#8220;that a reasonably foreseeable consequence of sexual intercourse between a man and woman is that the woman will become pregnant.&#8221; He did not include information about the possible consequences to P, or, if P is male, to P&#8217;s female sexual partner, of becoming pregnant to P or the possible risks to the baby if conceived. However, the &#8220;specific factual context&#8221;, including the existence of &#8220;serious or grave consequences&#8221; of a decision, or not making the decision, needs to be considered and Baker LJ did not purport to give an exhaustive or exclusive list of relevant information that would apply in every case. If a woman of child-bearing age were to have a high risk of suffering serious or grave complications of pregnancy of the kind to which P in <span style="font-style:italic">DD</span> was vulnerable, then it is arguable that the information relevant to her decisions to engage in sexual relations would include not only the prospect of her becoming pregnant but also that consequently she and her baby would be at a high risk of grave harm. These kinds of reasonably foreseeable consequences were not addressed by Lord Stephens in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>, but he was concerned with a man not a woman, and in any event it would not have been possible for him to have addressed every kind of information that would be relevant to every potentially incapacitous person&#8217;s decisions to engage in sexual relations. Instead, he set down the general requirement for the court to consider the specific factual context of each case.</p>

A line must be drawn so as to avoid imposing too high a requirement on persons who may potentially lack capacity to make a particular decision. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In the present case, I consider that in the context of decision-making about engaging in sexual relations it would exceed the practical limits to require EE to envisage the risks to her or her baby should she become pregnant following intercourse. Firstly, the evidence does not establish that she or her baby would be at serious or grave risk of harm were she to become pregnant. The evidence suggests that there would be some risks to her, but they are not of a direct and severe kind. I address this more fully below. Secondly, many women will put their physical or mental health at risk by becoming pregnant. Some may consider those risks before engaging in sexual relations, some might not. To require EE to understand and weigh or use information about risks to her health during pregnancy or labour, in particular risks which were not grave, would stray beyond the practical limits to which Lord Stephens referred and would set the bar too high. Thirdly, and similarly, many women will engage in sexual relations with a view to conceiving when there is a risk that their baby will suffer harm in utero or be born with a congenital disability. Again, some women will consider those risks in advance of engaging in sexual relations, some will not: the bar should not be set too high for EE. Finally, these matters &#8211; risks consequent to pregnancy &#8211; have not featured significantly or at all in the case law regarding the information relevant to decisions about sexual relations including older authorities about capacity to consent to sexual relations. I proceed on the basis that it would only be in cases where there was a clearly identified, high risk of grave harm consequent on pregnancy or childbirth, that information about that might have to be envisaged by P and be included in the list of relevant information.</p>

Dr Todd&#8217;s written reports correctly address EE&#8217;s ability to understand, retain, and weigh or use the relevant information. EE&#8217;s responses in interviews with Dr Todd are conspicuous for the detailed understanding and ability to weigh and use information that she demonstrates. As Dr Todd said to the court, EE offered the information she knew and her opinions about decision making, largely unprompted.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">There is no dispute that EE lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others. The primary reason EE lacks capacity regarding contact is her inability to use or weigh the risks that others pose to her. She has exposed herself to exploitation and harm from those with whom she has had contact but who has not previously known. For example, recently she handed her smart phone to a stranger who had offered her money for it on the internet. She met him and he made off with her device without paying her for it. She had been unable to weigh the risks and benefits of this contact. Applying <span style="font-style:italic">LBX</span>, EE is unable to weigh and use information about the positives and negatives of having contact with people with whom she is not already familiar. Dr Todd has advised that this is &#8220;owing to a combination of developmental, organic, and mental health problems.&#8221; These are the diagnosed conditions set out above and they prevent her from being able to weigh and use the relevant information to which I have referred.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in <span style="font-style:italic">PN</span> (above) I was concerned with determining capacity to engage in sexual relations generally, not with a specific person and I found that <span style="font-style:italic">PN</span> lacked capacity to make decisions about contact with others but had capacity to engage in sexual relations with others. For the reasons set out in that judgment, in particular at [28], I did not consider those determinations to be inconsistent. Likewise, in the present case, I am content to find that EE lacks capacity to decide on contact with others, specifically those with whom she is not already familiar, but has capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with others. EE&#8217;s carers have devised and adopted a care plan which has been based on those positions in relation to capacity. It follows an approach of the kind set out by Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v TZ</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/973" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 973" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 973 (COP)</ref> and discussed in his oral evidence by Dr Todd when he referred to &#8220;positive risk taking&#8221;. The approach involves encouraging EE to consider the risks and benefits of meeting any particular person and the form of contact with them but ultimately to make best interest decisions to protect her from harm, or the risk of harm from contact with a person with whom she is unfamiliar, and to allow for interventions by a carer. However, once she has familiarity with a person and wishes to have sexual relations with them, her capacity to make that decision would have to be respected. The fact that JB had been found to lack capacity to make decisions relating to contact with others did not preclude the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court from considering whether he lacked capacity to engage in sexual relations. The courts were clearly prepared, in principle, to find that he had capacity to engage in sexual relations notwithstanding that he lacked capacity to decide to have contact with others.</p>

Although the word &#8220;contraception&#8221; means the intentional prevention of conception, the questions were put to him as though they related to two separate decisions, not as different ways of describing the same decision, and he must have viewed them as such because he came to different conclusions about EE&#8217;s capacity to make each decision.

Such information was not included within the &#8220;practical limits&#8221; of what needs to be envisaged. In the present case I have found that those matters were not part of the information relevant to EE&#8217;s decision to engage in sexual relations. The freedom to make decisions about conceiving and having children, subject to the unavoidable restrictions imposed by biology, is a fundamental part of anyone&#8217;s Article 8 right to respect for their private and family life and,  in my judgment, it would be irrational, unnecessary, and an unjustified interference with EE&#8217;s Article 8 rights, to find that she has no capacity to make decisions about conception on the grounds that she cannot understand, retain, or weigh or use that same information. Dr Todd and the Applicant have, I believe, fallen into that error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Clearly there is some overlap between decisions about contraception and decisions about conception, but they are different. Without needing to decide the matter, there may be cases, for example where P wishes to undergo IVF, in which P&#8217;s capacity to make a decision about conception has to be determined. But in most cases, including EE&#8217;s case, those specific considerations will not apply. EE has capacity to engage in sexual relations and that means she has capacity to engage in sexual relations with a view to becoming pregnant. I shall also consider her capacity to make decisions about the use of contraception. In the circumstances, no separate consideration of capacity to decide about conceiving or conception is required or justified.</p>

In relation to the issue of contraception, in my judgment the appropriate formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; in respect of which the court must evaluate whether EE is unable to make a decision for herself, is &#8220;the use of contraception&#8221;. Both Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v Mrs A and Mr A</span> and Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">DD</span>, approached the matter on which P had to make a decision as being not only about modes of contraception but also whether to use contraception. At [65] Bodey J described the issue for him to determine as being, &#8220;does Mrs A have capacity to decide whether or not to have contraceptive treatment?&#8221; and the first of his list of relevant information relates to the consequences of not using any, or any adequate, contraception. Cobb J referred to decisions &#8220;about contraception&#8221; but clearly took into account the foreseeable consequences of choosing not to use any or any effective contraception because he added to the relevant information the consequences of P becoming pregnant. Neither framed the question as being whether P had capacity to decide to try to conceive and I have already dismissed any suggestion that I should consider EE&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about conception. In my judgment it is necessary for me to determine whether EE has capacity to make decisions about the use of contraception which includes not only consideration of what form of contraception to use, but whether to use contraception at all.</p>

Dr Alex has identified that EE is currently prescribed anti-anxiety medication, sleeping tablets, and an anti-psychotic. He advises that the probable advice to EE would be to continue with each of these during pregnancy. EE has said that that is what she would do. She has been compliant with her medication for some time and has not suffered a psychotic episode for a while. Dr Alex does warn that if EE were to continue her medication throughout pregnancy, then at birth the baby might initially have to be cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit to monitor for signs of withdrawal from the anti-psychotic medication. There is no evidence that EE does not understand this information or is unable to weigh or use it. </p>

I do not accept that reasoning. Dr Todd&#8217;s interview with EE about care and support focused on her independence and ability to live without day to day support and care, not on medical treatment or support in the particular circumstances of a crisis or deterioration in her mental health or psychological condition caused by pregnancy.</p>

Daily, in GP surgeries and clinics, women make decisions about contraception without considering the risks to them or to the health of their baby if they were to get pregnant.

I am not persuaded that serious or grave consequences to EE are brought into consideration. Moreover, I believe that these risks and benefits are not sufficiently proximate to the decision about contraception. The risk of thromboembolic disease which was pertinent to decision making in <span style="font-style:italic">DD</span> would arise directly from a pregnancy. Here, the risks of continuing or discontinuing medication are a secondary consequence of the pregnancy &#8211; they arise from a decision that has to be made in the event of the pregnancy. They are therefore further removed from the decision about contraception. If I am wrong and should have included this information, then I am quite satisfied that EE can understand, retain, and weigh or use the information. Dr Todd focused his discussions with EE much more on the potential impact of continuing the medication on any baby she might carry in the future, rather than on the impact to EE herself of ceasing medication, but he went through Dr Alex&#8217;s report with her and EE appears to have aligned herself with Dr Alex&#8217;s evidence and his opinion that EE ought to continue taking her current medication during any future pregnancy. I am satisfied that she did so having weighed and used the information provided. To underline my conclusion, EE&#8217;s ability to weigh and use information in relation to the medical issues regarding the use of different forms of contraception shows her functional abilities in these areas. </p>

There is no, or no sufficient, evidence before me that this is a serious or grave consequence in the case of EE.  I would accept that in principle serious or grave risks might be included as reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding not to use contraception, but in the specific context of this case, the evidence does not justify treating these risks as serious or grave or as matters which any woman in EE&#8217;s position would have to consider when making decisions about contraception. Aside from Dr Todd&#8217;s comments during his oral evidence about the risk of &#8220;autistic meltdown&#8221;, which were not backed up by any references or reliable experience, only by an anecdotal reference to a single case that did not relate to a pregnancy, no other evidence was provided that was relevant to EE&#8217;s case. If, contrary to my determination, this should be regarded as relevant information then I would need to consider allowing for a further interview with EE in order to afford her an opportunity to address it and thereby to give the court evidence as to her ability to understand, retain, and weigh or use that information. This information has not been discussed with her. I do not need to decide whether I would indeed allow for further evidence to be adduced but I note that the onus is on the Applicant to establish that EE lacks capacity. Whilst the Court of Protection adopts an inquisitorial approach, it does not follow that if, after sufficient time has been given to gather relevant evidence, a party is unable to establish a case, then proceedings must be adjourned to enable more evidence to be obtained. </p>
