J was assigned to the female sex at birth [&#8216;natal female&#8217;] but has for some time regarded himself as male [&#8216;affirmed male&#8217;]. I shall refer to J as &#8216;he/him&#8217;. In January 2023 J commenced a course of cross-hormone treatment and thereafter he received further injections of testosterone every 3 months. The last injection was in August 2023 and the next would ordinarily have been in November 2023 but, with the agreement of the parties including J, any further injection has been deferred in the hope that issues around future treatment will be resolved at the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>

In the event, as I shall explain, there is currently a measure of agreement, or more accurately acceptance, as to the way forward for the coming few months and, as a result, it will not be necessary to determine the principal issues between the parties in this judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has been complicated by the fact that the treatment regime in place at the start of the proceedings had been established by an internet provider, &#8216;Gender GP&#8217;, rather than under the NHS. Both parents, J, his guardian and the court now have significant concerns over the involvement of Gender GP to date. Despite extensive efforts to engage with the NHS or an alternative source, Gender GP has, until recently, remained the only potential prescriber of testosterone for J. There is, now, however, the prospect that a new, London based, clinic, &#8216;Gender Plus&#8217;, may be available to become involved once an assessment of J and his needs has been undertaken. J&#8217;s father [&#8216;the father&#8217;], whilst remaining firmly opposed to the idea of any young person under the age of 18 years being prescribed cross-hormone treatment, accepts that J will, with his mother&#8217;s support [&#8216;the mother&#8217;], now undergo assessment by Gender Plus &#8211; a process which may take up to six months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The primary purpose of this judgment is, therefore, more one of taking stock of the issues and the evidence to date, rather than making any final determination at this stage. The final report of the review by Dr Hilary Cass, Chair of the &#8216;Independent Review of gender identity services for children and young people&#8217; was published in April 2024 when the final draft of this judgment had been largely completed. Dr Cass&#8217; final report was not available during the most recent hearing, in February 2024, but may well be referred to at subsequent hearings. I have, therefore, deliberately not consulted the report before completing this judgment, other than to note headline points from media reporting. The content of this judgment is based on the evidence and submissions that were before the court as at the conclusion of the February hearing.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is agreed that the issue of capacity is decision and time specific. Currently, there is no &#8216;decision&#8217; for J to make other than to take part in an assessment process with Gender Plus, which all parties accept he has capacity to agree to. Depending on that assessment and/or if J&#8217;s testosterone level drops so that a further interim dose may be needed before the assessment is complete, there remains the possibility that, if no alternative source of testosterone is then available, the option of obtaining a further, interim, prescription from Gender GP, will once again become live. In those circumstances, it is agreed that the issue with respect to capacity would be cast in precise and narrow terms:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8216;Does J have capacity to consent to medical treatment in the form of cross-sex hormones via an interim, holding, dose prescribed by an unregulated online clinic, Gender GP&#8217;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further complicating factor is that Gender GP has played no part in these proceedings and, although the issue on capacity is drafted on the basis that that clinic would prescribe an interim, holding, dose of testosterone there is no evidence that they would do so, or, importantly, what dosage they would prescribe. Thus, if the issue of consent to further treatment by Gender GP were to become live again, there is no certainty about the details of that treatment or what particular dosage would be medically appropriate for J at that time.</p>

Given the absence of dispute over the present referral to Gender Plus, it is not currently necessary to engage with the father&#8217;s wider legal case in order to determine any live issue.

At age 13, a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder [&#8216;ASD&#8217;] was made and he was also diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. At that stage he was not in education, he was not engaging in treatment for his eating disorder and he was said to be socially isolated. Matters came to a head and in 2020, J was compulsorily admitted to hospital for 9 months for treatment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3</ref> due to severe malnutrition.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Hewitt&#8217;s principal criticism of Gender GP&#8217;s intervention, however, relates to the dose of testosterone that was prescribed. She explained that the dosage of intra-muscular injection of testosterone [Nebido] at 1000mg/4ml every 6 weeks was at the level that one would administer to an adult only after a course of treatment that would have started at a much lower dose but built up to 1000mg/4ml over the course of two or three years. Not only did Gender GP prescribe this top-end dosage to a testosterone-na&#239;ve child, but they did so by directing a &#8216;loading&#8217; (double) dose at the commencement of the treatment. Dr Hewitt advised &#8216;with confidence&#8217; that &#8216;there is no professional society of paediatric endocrinologists internationally who would consider this anything other than a highly abnormal and frankly negligent approach&#8217;. She stated that &#8216;in Australia, the treatment provided by Gender GP would be unlawful&#8217;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the time following her initial instruction and her main report in September 2023, Dr Hewitt has been concerned about the very high level of testosterone that continued to be registered during regular testing of J&#8217;s blood. In October 2023, Dr Hewitt advised that the level of testosterone in the blood was &#8216;dangerously high&#8217; and that, apart from the potential for adverse long-term consequences of such a level, J was &#8216;presently at risk of sudden death due to thromboembolic disease&#8217;, meaning the potential for the hormone to cause thickening of the blood. Subsequently, J&#8217;s blood was assessed by Dr Russell Keenan, a consultant paediatric haematologist at Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital, Liverpool, who advised that the results were effectively normal when compared to reference points relevant to an adult male (which Dr Keenan considered was the appropriate comparison in this case).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the risk of immediate harm as a result of changes to his blood was no longer seen as a pressing factor, Dr Hewitt continued to express surprise that, as the months have gone by, the level of testosterone recorded in J&#8217;s system has remained very high. In her evidence to the court in February 2024 she explained that after a dose of testosterone, the level would be elevated for a time but then fall to a &#8216;trough level&#8217; of 10-15 nanomoles/litre after 10 to 14 weeks. For J the readings had been in the mid 20&#8217;s nm/L throughout the autumn and up to mid-January 2024. For Dr Hewitt this was an &#8216;unusual&#8217; and &#8216;unexpected&#8217; picture which initially caused her to question whether there had been any further (surreptitious) top-up dose administered. A test in early February 2024 recorded a fall to 15.7 nm/L. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having reviewed the literature, during a break in her evidence, Dr Hewitt observed that as she had never before (in her 20 years in the field) seen such a &#8216;massive dose&#8217; of testosterone administered to a young person, her settled view was that the prolonged record of high levels of testosterone seen here could have been caused by the series of high overdosing that had taken place so that there had been an accumulation of the hormone in the body, with the baseline trough level never being reached before the next dose was given.  </p>

Put in lay terms, by overdosing on hormones, skeletal development is accelerated from its normal pace of growth during puberty with the result that the point is brought forward at which the growing plates at the end of the bones &#8216;fuse&#8217; and stop growing. When that happens, the individual stops growing with the potential for them to end up as an adult with a shorter, smaller, frame than would otherwise have been the case with a normal span of bone growth.</span></p>

Dr Eyre considers that the combined effect of all four of the identified conditions from which J has suffered/is suffering from does not render him unable to make a decision about treatment for gender dysphoria within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The options for J&#8217;s future treatment and care in the context of gender dysphoria are severely limited. As is well known, the previous NHS provision via the Tavistock Clinic is no longer available and planned replacement services have yet to commence taking patients. During the course of these proceedings, particularly after receipt of Dr Hewitt&#8217;s worrying advice that J may be at risk of imminent death, concerted attempts were made to engage the NHS in offering assessment and, if advised, treatment for J. These efforts were unsuccessful in achieving more than basic blood testing. The reality, reluctantly accepted by the parties and the court, is that, currently, there is no relevant NHS service available for J. Apart from turning once again to Gender GP, which no party currently favours, the only other option that has been identified is for J to engage with the newly opened Gender Plus clinic in London, where an assessment, over some six months, will aim to identify what, if any, treatment that clinic can offer to him. J&#8217;s testosterone level, whilst beginning to fall, currently remains high and the expectation is that it may well remain above the &#8216;trough&#8217; level, at which a further dose might be indicated, throughout the Gender Plus assessment period. </p>
