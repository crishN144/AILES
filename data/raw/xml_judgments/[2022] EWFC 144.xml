I will identify them as A who is now [X], B who is [X] years old and C who is [X] years old. The applications were made in the premise of A&#8217;s challenging and unmanageable behaviour that has put herself and her family members at risk of harm. The local authority was also concerned about the parents&#8217; ability to manage her. It was alleged that she was assaulted by her father and that A had assaulted the mother. Most regrettably A&#8217;s circumstances have not improved and she was made the subject of a final care order in June 2021 and subsequently a Deprivation of Liberty order in August of the same year.</span></p>

These are detailed in a schedule of allegations that I have appended to this judgment. These allegations are the subject of dispute.

This document has been agreed by all parties. I lend my support to it and apply it when making my decisions. However, there are some broad important principles that must be noted. The applicant local authority makes its allegations and must prove these on a balance of probabilities. Its detailed allegations as set out in the attached schedule inform the &#8216;threshold criteria&#8217; as set out in s 31(2) of the Children Act (1989) (the &#8216;Act&#8217;).

For the sake of brevity I will not repeat the detail in this judgment. Furthermore, I have read and considered the helpful guidance by the Royal College of paediatrics and Child Health on &#8216;Perplexing Presentation (PP)/Fabricated or Induced Illness (FII) in children 2 March 2021&#8217;. Finally, I note the enormous challenges that the mother and her legal team have faced in marshalling and managing the evidence. I am grateful to Mr Bickler KC and Mr Froud for their gargantuan efforts that have ensured the mother has been able to participate in these proceedings fully and fairly. However, it is important to note the significant stress that this family has been under and the evidence spans many stressful years, all of which will have impacted upon the parents&#8217; recollection and the quality of evidence that they have been able to give to the court.</span></p>

The local authority&#8217;s concern included A&#8217;s violence towards her mother, the other children&#8217;s safety, the father&#8217;s alleged emotionally abusive parenting, the mother&#8217;s low mood and general isolation of the family. By this time A was referred for an ASD assessment. B was referred to audiology and the mother was raising general concerns about her daughter suffering with pain in the limbs and possible hypermobility or Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. In December of the same year A was diagnosed with DAMP and assessed as &#8216;high functioning ASD&#8217; with a referral to an ASD nurse.</span></p>

By now the level of medical and professional involvement with the children was at its highest which included referral to a dietician and B being referred to a rheumatology clinic. Happily C continued to make good progress and was able to walk independently wearing his recommended supportive boots. The occupational health assessments of A and B had advised the use of adjuncts within the home and at school. B was provided with a wrist splint to aid her writing. B was diagnosed as meeting the criteria for ASD and the mother questioned if B may also meet the criteria in light of the family history of ASD.</span></p>

The school did not observe any need to prompt A to eat and neither child appeared to use or need the various aids that they travelled to and from school with and were provided for their use during the school day. Such were the school&#8217;s concerns that it raised questions about the mother&#8217;s mental health and possibility of fabrication of the children&#8217;s medical and health issues. By July of the same year B was diagnosed as having ASD. </span></p>

In the main hypermobility, pain and discomfort, audiology, issues around their diet and ASD were the issues that at any given time one or more of the children were assessed for. The school raised concerns about B&#8217;s ASD assessment as it was not involved in the assessment by Dr O and B&#8217;s description in the report appeared to be very different to the school&#8217;s experience of her. Later C was diagnosed as suffering with reflux and was prescribed medication. </span></p>

She was assaulting her mother, shouting and breaking items around the house causing significant concern and worry for all of the family including B and C. In [XX] 2020, A was detained under s2 of the Mental Health Act (1983). She was subsequently discharged and with the agreement of the mother, she was placed in a semi-independent home. By now children&#8217;s services were sufficiently concerned to issue these proceedings. The court permitted the parties to jointly instruct Dr Rose (Consultant Paediatrician). In his first report dated December 2020 he raised a number of concerns about the children&#8217;s medical presentation and possibility of misdiagnosis. He recommended the instruction of a psychiatrist that was sanctioned by the court. The parties instructed Dr Surgener who raised a number of significant concerns about the children and the potentially emotionally harmful environment that they were living in. Subsequently the court approved the instructions of an adult psychiatrist Dr Lyall to assess the parents and Mr Crompton Consultant in Trauma and Orthopaedics. I will refer to the detail of their assessments later in this judgment. </span></p>

After confirming the contents of her two statements to be true an accurate, Professor K was clear that she has no independent memory of the consultation and relied on her notes and other relevant documents. She explained that prior to the publication of the 2017 Guidance ([XX]_2017 Malfait et al), the terms Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (&#8216;EDS&#8217;) type III and benign joint hypermobility were used interchangeably. The relevant guidance in 2014 indeed used the two terms interchangeably. Under the 2017 guidance these are distinguished. She undertook her examinations by using the 2014 &#8216;Oxford Desk Reference&#8217;. The Beighton test score is also subjective and dependant on the age of the patient as ordinarily with age laxity decreases. As such, she would not expect B&#8217;s Beighton score in 2014 to be lower than her score in 2021. Professor K would always use the Beighton Score as a diagnostic tool. She could not explain why, contrary to her normal practice, this was not noted in her clinical notes but could not imagine circumstances in which she would not have used them. </span></p>

In this instance, she took a family history that covered three generations. She also examined the mother and assessed her to be suffering with hypermobility. She agreed that such a condition can legitimately attract attention from different disciplines in medicine who may take very different approaches to it. She explained that patients with hypermobility can suffer with pain but there are those in the population who do not and consequently do not seek medical attention. Often, as it was the case here, she recommends a referral to Occupational Health services to help build and strengthen muscles to compensate for the laxity in the ligaments. She did not anticipate that A or B would present differently to other children at school although they may present with greater flexibility in gym. However in ordinary day to day school life they would not present differently to other children. </span></p>

Dr Z was clear that in all her correspondence with the parents, she would set out a summary of all of the diagnosis and whilst expressing some concern that NHS letters do not always reach the parents, she was clear that C has never been diagnosed as suffering with cerebral palsy.</span></p>

She explained that she would not have made referrals to Occupational Health or physiotherapy if she did not feel that C required it. The NHS resources are limited and referrals are only made when she is satisfied that they are needed and justified.

In her opinion he was likely to require such support into adulthood.

The hip is one of the strongest joints and any dislocation would usually be caused by trauma with associated soft tissue injury. However the sensation and sound of the movement of the ligament across the joint may be misinterpreted by a child or parent as dislocation. On examination, he did not find instability of joints or subluxation in the children. However, &#8216;hypermobile children&#8217; can find particular position in some joints such as the shoulders, that would allow for subluxation and at times may even become a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">&#8220;party trick&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">for them.

He estimated that in his clinic he has similar complaints of pain from children who have joint hypermobility and those who do not. Nocturnal cramps and pain (growing pains) is common in all children and such a complaint would not lead to an examination for hypermobility. The child may wake up in pain and a gentle massage would relieve the pain. However, he agreed that an active child with hypermobility may present as entirely normal but suffer with more pains and aches at the end of the day where the muscles surrounding some of the joints, such as the shoulders, may have worked harder to stabilise the joint during those activities.</span></p>

She would have liked to have seen B at home but this is no longer an option due to demands at work. She observed that it was usual for children to behave differently in different settings. For example some children may behave differently in the more structured setting of the school and this may explain the difference between the mother&#8217;s observation at home and those by the school. Children also learn to mimic other children leading to the school stating that they have not observed the behaviours that are reported by the parents. However, children with ASD do not mimic their sibling&#8217;s behaviour who may also have a diagnosis of ASD. Each are individuals and different.

Whilst he accepted that nocturnal pain or &#8216;growing pains&#8217; are common, there is no reason to connect this with hypermobility especially as such pains are usually associated with the &#8216;middle of the bone&#8217; and not the joints.</span></p>

Dr Rose agreed that the number of medical appointments were not excessive, accepted that the adjuncts had been provided on professional advice but questioned why the school did not see any use for them. He sympathised with the mother in the difficult circumstances that she found herself and thought it reasonable that she should question the possibility of C having ASD when her two older children had a diagnosis for the same. He was clear that he was not challenging the diagnosis of ASD for B but questioned it in light of Dr Surgenor&#8217;s report. Similarly, having been made aware of the professional advice for C to wear supportive footwear he did not seek to criticise the mother for this. Furthermore, he agreed that Dr Z having had a prolonged interaction with C and given her concerns, a multidisciplinary approach was appropriate. Moreover, he stated that it didn&#8217;t appear that the mother was exaggerating any concerns about B&#8217;s audiology and in fact she was reporting no concerns. There did not appear to be evidence of the mother seeking a diagnosis and her actions in respect of the cardiology concerns for B were appropriate. Broadly, he did not see that either B or C has been inappropriately or unnecessarily been exposed to medical professionals. </span></p>

This makes the parental interpretation all the more significant. That in turn will have to be considered in the context of all of the evidence. In this case the children had been provided with a number of adjuncts that were not used in school and appeared to be unnecessary. He further observed that the use of the wheel chair and the bath hoist was equally unnecessary. The latter would be harmful in a hypermobile child who needs to use and strengthen the muscles to create greater joint stability. Whilst expressing sympathy for the family&#8217;s circumstances and the challenges of dealing with A&#8217;s behaviour, Dr Rose was concerned that the use of the wheel chair may have made B feel less capable than she is. </span></p>

Later in June 2017, when she had a new splint made, B commented that she was embarrassed to wear a splint. She also recommended ear guards to be used when required. She was clear that these are not always a short-term measure and some children continue to use such support as they age. Ms F observed generally that educational establishments are not consistent in their approach to such support. She also accepted that a child may be too embarrassed to ask or use such items in the class-room. It may be embarrassing to ask the teacher for access to such support. </span></p>

She was clear that she had not had any conversations with Dr Rose or Dr Surgenor before they completed their reports.</span></p>

The mother accepted that the father had told A to hit the mother to calm down. She also confirmed the details of the incident in October 2019 when the father hit A. She first noticed some of A&#8217;s difficulties coming to the surface when A was about seven or eight years old. As time went on, her difficulties were more pronounced but the school did not agree with the mother&#8217;s views which lead to the Tribunal proceedings which found against the school. Sadly, the school did not provide any further support and A only stayed in that school for six months before she moved to her next school. A&#8217;s behaviour was very difficult and had a serious impact on the whole family. Her behaviour included assaults upon the mother, breaking and throwing items.

She sees A regularly and her behaviour remains a huge cause for concern. The mother and the two youngest children remain living at the same address and the home is much calmer now. B and C are presenting as more confident and socialising more with their peers by having friends visit. The mother accepted that the condition of the home remained unsatisfactory including the egg boxes remaining fixed to the walls in A&#8217;s old room.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">In 2012, the mother began to notice the first signs of difficulties in A&#8217;s presentation. At this time  B was very young having been born in [XXX]. In 2013, the local authority first became involved as a consequence of the deterioration in A&#8217;s behaviour. By now C was born with significant medical issues that presented the family with additional significant challenges. In the ensuing years the mother became an advocate for her children and sought to find such help and assistance as she could. It is important to note that in the first four years and against the odds, C made significant progress. As it has been attested to by the relevant witnesses, this progress was in no small part due to the care that C received from his mother.</span></p>

Undoubtedly, this has placed her in conflict with some professionals and has marred their views of the mother. This was clear in the evidence from the witnesses from the school who did not share the mother&#8217;s concerns about the children&#8217;s needs and ability. What they observed in school, in so far as any of the witnesses had directly observed the children, was very different to that which the mother described at home.</span></p>

However, the school&#8217;s perception of the children&#8217;s needs has not always been accurate. This is perhaps best illustrated by the final decision in the tribunal proceedings that found in favour of the mother. In my judgment, this was a significant milestone and it was all the more surprising that none of the school witnesses including the head teacher who was involved in those proceedings, had any meaningful recollection of those proceedings or the decision of the Tribunal.</span></p>

A&#8217;s needs and behaviour are multifaceted and complex. She left the school within six months of the tribunal decision and the complexities of her needs and the demands of the same were immediately obvious to her new school.  Cross examination of the witnesses from the school, clearly illustrated that in the main, the school&#8217;s assessments of the children were based on the school observations without any relevant knowledge of the medical investigations and advice from the treating teams. Inevitably, this has led to a greater sense of isolation and frustration by the mother. This was palpably clear as I listened to the mother&#8217;s evidence who was measured in her criticisms of the school. </span></p>

Her description of the children&#8217;s needs and their role within the family when applying for the &#8216;[XXX] Card&#8217; or a blue badge were clearly inaccurate. There is no evidence that at any point B had assumed the role of a carer for any of her siblings. I was also concerned to hear her evidence about C suffering with Cerebral Palsy. Whilst it is clear to me that this may have been raised as a possibility, it was concerning to note that the mother who is otherwise in charge of a great deal of detail, chose not to make any enquiries about this and proceeded on what was clearly an incorrect premise. Furthermore, whilst I accept that the mother did not tell C that he has ASD, the evidence of C mentioning this in school speaks to a home atmosphere where the children are exposed to and involved in medical concerns. I found the mother to be reliable in this regard and there are many reasonable scenarios in which a child such as C my say such a thing. Although, perhaps understandable, mistaken use of medical terms such as dislocation would have added to this concern and the children&#8217;s views of themselves.</span></p>

If so, whether this can be attributed to the mother&#8217;s parenting which was not reasonable to expect a parent to provide the children with. The height of the local authority&#8217;s evidence is the &#8216;possibility&#8217; of the mother presenting with PP/FII as raised and attested to by Dr Rose whose views are informed by a detailed analysis of the children&#8217;s medical records and other experts including Dr Surgenor.</span></p>

One of the relevant issues that she raises in her report concerns the integrity of the ASD assessment that was undertaken by Dr O. Having had the benefit of hearing directly with Dr O, I do not share these concerns. I am entirely satisfied that Dr O had undertaken a robust assessment of B and her diagnosis at that time was reliable. It may well be that a reassessment is justified for the purposes of any welfare determination, if indeed such a determination is required, however I do not find that the mother&#8217;s contributions to this assessment had such an influence on Dr O&#8217;s independent assessment to bring its validity into question. Whilst the majority of the issues that Dr Surgenor raises fall outside the remit of this hearing, I am confident that her report and views have made a significant contribution to the trajectory of this case.</span></p>

I found Mr Crompton&#8217;s evidence to be fair and balanced. In his evidence, I did not find any criticism of the mother. Similarly, the treating medics have made positive observations about the mother. I found Professor K a most helpful and learned witness who was very careful to give an accurate testimony and limited her evidence to that which was within her considerable expertise. Dr Z was in my judgment uniquely placed to attest to C&#8217;s circumstances and displaying a detailed knowledge of C, the medical investigations, referrals and the use of recommended adjuncts. The evidence from the Occupational Health Therapists was equally clear that the use of adjuncts was a recommendation made by them which founded in the assessments that they had undertaken.</span></p>

In my assessment these may be categorised as falsification and exaggeration of the children&#8217;s medical and quasi medical conditions that have caused an over medicalisation and unnecessary medical or quasi medical investigations of them, the professional disagreement with the Mother&#8217;s presentation of the children which is mainly associated with the school&#8217;s observations and finally conduct within the home such as the use of adjuncts or medical terminology. Although this may be a helpful summary of the local authority&#8217;s case, it is important that closer attention is given to the elements that make up the local authority&#8217;s schedule that contains several important and relevant examples of the mother&#8217;s alleged behaviour.</span></p>

The examples start in March 2014 and conclude in December 2014 during which time B was examined on three occasions. The mother appears to have accepted the conclusion of the investigations during this period without seeking any further referral. C was referred for investigation on one occasion in 2020.

There are inaccuracies in the first pleaded examples that start in January 2013 and conclude in August 2013. In this period there was one referral from the health visitor resulting in two examinations in April and August of the same year with the latter being a review by the audiologist. Arguably the first referral was instigated by the mother&#8217;s reports. There is no evidence before me to support a finding that the mother&#8217;s reports were inaccurate or exaggerated save that the investigations did not identify any issues. On any view, although distressing for B, the local authority&#8217;s case does not reach the required evidential threshold for such a finding to be made. </span></p>

However, this is broken down into separate elements the first of which refers to B and referral in 2013 for investigations into Dyspraxia. This example is clearly inaccurately recorded and on the correct reading of the documents cannot be sustained. The next examples under this heading are between January 2018 to June 2018 with a missed appointment in September. Having carefully considered these referrals, it is hard to see how the local authority can show that the mother has falsified or exaggerated her accounts and even if she did, how the court can find that this has caused her significant harm where there were nonintrusive recommendations that the mother appears to have followed and indeed the mother did not pursue any further investigations thereafter. However, as accepted by the mother and detailed earlier in this judgment, the purchase of the wheelchair for B, its use and storage in sight of the children was an extremely poor decision which has in my judgment caused B and C significant emotional harm. However, I do not find that there is evidence that meets the requisite evidential threshold for a finding that this was significantly or otherwise physically harmful to B and certainly not to a degree that would come close to justifying a threshold finding. The issues concerning the bath hoist were concerning but the evidence of the mother which I accept was that this was a chair and not a hoist and was not used. Although its presence may have contributed to the overall presence and use of adjuncts, I do not find that there is evidence that would justify a finding as sought that meet the evidential requirements. </span></p>

Where there was a conflict in the evidence of the latter witness and Dr Rose, Professor K&#8217;s evidence was far more consistent with that of Mr Crompton&#8217;s. Furthermore, the totality of the relevant evidence when considered together with these experts causes an insurmountable evidential hurdle for the local authority&#8217;s allegations under these two main subheadings.

Much of the local authority&#8217;s case in this regard relies on the questions that were raised by Dr Surgenor and the differences in the observations of the school and others to that which the mother has described. There is no doubt that among several diagnosis, A has been diagnosed as having ASD. It seems to me entirely reasonable for parents to have considered this as a potential diagnosis for B and C. The latter has suffered with developmental delay which may share some attributes with ASD although these are different conditions and B now has a formal diagnosis of ASD that has been found on the strength of the evidence to be reliable.

Each of the above considerations have informed my decision about whether the threshold criteria as set out in s31(2) of the Act is met. For reasons that I have set out above, I have no doubt that the mother has done all that is in her power to provide the best for her children. In many respects she has been very successful at this task and has a great deal to be proud of. In other respects, the challenges that she has faced, have been beyond her capacity and ability to meet. The difficulties that she had to address over many years have undoubtedly impacted on her health, perception and abilities as a parent. I have no doubt that she has found support and comfort in the services that the medical profession has been able to provide her family with. It is also clear to me that she has on occasions exaggerated or fabricated the children&#8217;s presentation and behaviours. A clear example of this is found in her description of the children and their role within the family when she applied for an [XXX] card and the blue badge. However, such examples do not begin to satisfy the &#8216;threshold test&#8217; whether by themselves or as part of consideration of the wider canvas.

The father clearly contributed to this by acting on the mother&#8217;s instructions and not challenging her. Furthermore, this clearly satisfies the &#8216;threshold test&#8217;. However in all other regards the evidence of substandard parenting that would satisfy the threshold criteria is less than clear. The children clearly have a number of properly diagnosed medical and behavioural difficulties. I am confident that their daily lives were occupied with consideration or management of those issues. Sadly, there were significant periods when the demands of looking after A has over-shadowed all else within the children&#8217;s home. However in my judgment, there are considerable evidential difficulties in the local authority&#8217;s allegations. In the main, there is no direct evidence that the children suffered any significant harm that can be attributed to the mother or her parenting. Secondly, where there may be arguments that there is evidence of significant harm being suffered or likely to be suffered by the children, there is little evidence to suggest that the mother&#8217;s conduct or parenting was not reasonable for a parent to provide. Therefore, I do not find that the threshold criteria pursuant to s(31)(2) of the Act is crossed save in the following respects which includes what has already been accepted by the father;</span></p>
