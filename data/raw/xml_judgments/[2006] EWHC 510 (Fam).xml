	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In January and February 2006 I conducted a three week hearing of a case in which a local authority sought a care order with respect to a 9 year old girl (who I will refer to as X). The local authority had been aware of the girl, who was displaying some modest behavioural difficulties, for some months. The girl&#8217;s mother had expressly sought the help of the social services and child health services. Professional concern about X was such that two Child Protection Case Conferences had been held, and a low level of intervention by way of a referral to the local Child Guidance Unit and some further assessment work had been recommended. The child&#8217;s name had been entered onto the local Child Protection Register in the category of &#8216;emotional harm&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2004 there was a further case conference to review the progress of the work. Those at the meeting remained concerned about the child&#8217;s emotional well being. The local authority was to hold a legal planning meeting within the following five days to consider whether care proceedings should be issued. A psychiatric assessment of the mother, which was in the process of being set up, was to proceed; as was a further psychological assessment of the child. At the time that the meeting concluded there was no suggestion from the social workers, or any other professional attending the case conference, that the child should be removed from her parents&#8217; care &#8211; either immediately or at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within two hours of the case conference concluding, however, the social work team leader was giving evidence before a bench of lay justices in support of an application for an Emergency Protection Order (&#8216;EPO&#8217;). That application was made without any notice to the parents. The justices granted an EPO. At that time the mother and child were at a local hospital, to which the mother had taken the child for a check up because the child was complaining of abdominal pain. The social workers, accompanied by four uniformed police officers, attended the hospital and removed the child from her mother&#8217;s care. She was placed in foster care, in which state she remained (with a number of changes of carers) for the following 14 months under a series of interim care orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of the hearing I investigated how such a Draconian order came to be granted in a case which, up until that time, had been one where low level intervention by way of assessment and counselling had been the agreed plan. As a result of that investigation I have found significant flaws in the manner in which the system operated by the social services and the family justice system itself impacted upon this family. There is in my view a public interest in wide publicity being given to what took place in this case in the hope that lessons may be learned to ensure that what befell this family is not repeated elsewhere.</p>

I therefore propose to do no more than summarise the factual background in very short terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts of this case have led me to produce a judgment which is highly critical of the social workers and the social services department who became involved with this family. I wish to record at the outset of this reported version of the judgment that, in my experience, failures of this degree are rare indeed. The ordinary experience of the family courts is of social workers and social services departments whose professional work is both valuable and appropriately targeted to meeting the particular needs of children and their families. Often that work is undertaken within the context of limited resources and consequential stress upon the social services organisation and the individuals who work within it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the commencement of the proceedings X, an only child, had always lived at home with her parents. Concern about her behaviour at home and at school had led her mother to seek professional assistance. This led to a recommendation from a child and adolescent psychotherapist that the girl would benefit from some ongoing psychological support. The psychologist also referred the case to the social services because she was concerned about X who seemed very scared, insecure, withdrawn and frightened. She was also concerned about how well the father&#8217;s mental illness was controlled and about issues regarding sexual abuse arising from the mother&#8217;s own childhood and a sexual incident that had occurred with the girl and a young cousin some years earlier.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An initial case conference took place in March 2004. A range of assessments were recommended. It was also recommended that psychotherapy counselling services should be provided to the child and her mother by the Child Guidance Unit as soon as possible. The child&#8217;s name was entered on the local Child Protection Register in the category &#8216;emotional abuse&#8217;. It is to be noted that the government guidance &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#8221; defines &#8220;emotional abuse&#8221; as being &#8220;the persistent emotional ill treatment of a child such as to cause severe and persistent effects on the child&#8217;s emotional development&#8221;.</p>

The notes also record: &#8216;SS view mother ill / factitious illness. Suspicion &#8594; multiple personality disorder&#8217;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the case conference, despite the legal planning meeting having been told of the social worker&#8217;s view being that this was a case of factitious or fabricated illness, no reference was made to any such condition. There was however a contribution by the father&#8217;s community psychiatric nurse [&#8216;CPN&#8217;]. The father had for a number of years suffered from a schizo-affective disorder. His condition had been moderated in recent years by regular medication. At the conclusion of the hearing I found as a fact that the CPN told the case conference that, if X was taken into care, the father might possibly commit suicide as he was so close to his daughter and that was what kept him going mentally. The CPN&#8217;s contribution is neither recorded nor referred to in the official minutes of the meeting. The social workers assert that the CPN asked for his advice to be treated as confidential (he denies making this request). The result was that there is no official record (either minutes or on the social work file) of this important information. From the parents point of view, there is not even a record that confidential information was given to the meeting.</p>

This decision was communicated to the conference chair, who was apparently still in the building, and to the relevant social services service manager. Both of these individuals apparently approved the proposed course of action, although neither was tasked with making a formal decision upon it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A central plank of the social services case was that this was a case of fabricated or induced illness (previously referred to a Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy). This was clearly the factor that was uppermost in the minds of the social workers when, having heard that the mother was at the hospital, they determined that the child needed to be immediately removed from her parents&#8217; care. X had indeed received medical attention in the previous months and years. However no doctor had ever raised any question relating to induced or fabricated illness. Despite the fact that the social workers had entertained the view for some weeks that this was such a case, at no time did they seek any medical advice. Moreover, once the care proceedings began and the local authority lawyers set out that the case was based on an allegation of induced or fabricated illness, even at that stage the local authority made no attempt to obtain a medical opinion on the point. In the course of the guidance that follows, I will give specific attention to cases of alleged induced or fabricated illness.</p>

The case thus proceeded on the basis solely of allegations of emotional abuse to X. At the conclusion of the hearing I found that the threshold criteria of &#8216;significant harm&#8217; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> were not established. With the agreement of all parties, I made X a ward of the High Court for a short period in order facilitate the child&#8217;s return home and the provision for support to the family as they began to rebuild their life together.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child protection system depends upon the skill, insight and sheer hard work of front line social workers. Underlying those key features, there is a need for social workers to feel supported and valued by the courts, the state and the general populace to a far greater degree than is normally the case. Working in overstretched teams with limited resources, social workers frequently have to make crucial decisions, with important implications, on issues of child protection; often of necessity these decisions must be based upon the available information which may be inchoate or partial. There are often risks to a child flowing from every available option (risk of harm if the child stays at home, risk of emotional harm at least if the child is removed). It is said that in these situations, social workers are &#8216;damned if they do, and damned if they don&#8217;t&#8217; take action. Despite these difficulties, it is my experience that very frequently social workers &#8216;get it right&#8217; and take the right action, for the right reasons, based upon a professional and wise evaluation of the available information. Such cases sadly do not hit the headlines, or warrant lengthy scrutiny in a High Court judgment. I say &#8216;sadly&#8217; because there is a need for successful social work, of which there are many daily examples, to be applauded and made known to the public at large.</p>

They had, I am sure, only a desire to meet X&#8217;s needs (as they perceived them to be) as their motive. The only exception to this generalised observation might have been with respect to team manager&#8217;s actions in giving the evidence that she gave at the EPO hearing, but, as she was not in a position to be asked directly about this (because the material to challenge her was only available after she had given evidence) I am not able to express a concluded view on her motives.</p>

Parents against whom an EPO is made ex parte are entitled to be given, if they ask, proper information as to what happened at the hearing and to be told, if they ask: (i) exactly what documents, bundles or other evidential materials were lodged with the FPC either before or during the course of the hearing; and (ii) what legal authorities were cited to the FPC.

The mere fact that the local authority has obtained an EPO is not of itself enough. The FPC decides whether to make an EPO. But the local authority decides whether to remove. The local authority, even after it has obtained an EPO, is under an obligation to consider less drastic alternatives to emergency removal. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/44/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 44(5)</ref> requires a process within the local authority whereby there is a further consideration of the action to be taken after the EPO has been obtained.

Extensive guidance has been issued by central government (<span style="font-style:italic">Safeguarding children in whom illness is fabricated or induced</span> &#8211; Department of Health 2002) explaining the particular approach that is required in such cases. A key message to social workers from this guidance is that any concerns about a child&#8217;s health must be discussed with the GP or a paediatrician. Whether or not a child may be at risk of induced or fabricated illness must of necessity involve a medical assessment of his past health and parental care. It is not a diagnosis that can be made by social workers acting alone, it is a matter that requires skilled medical appraisal.</p>

The facts of that case were different and involved a baby being removed at birth, but the court clearly held that where the possibility of harm arose from the mother introducing something into the child&#8217;s system (such as a laxative) that did not justify separating mother and child. In the present case, even on what the social workers apparently believed, there is no suggestion of positive action by the mother to induce symptoms, and the implication must be that under the ECHR there is even less justification for emergency removal of the child in those circumstances.</p>

It has taken a three week hearing to clarify the basis, or lack of it, of these allegations.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The paucity of the justices&#8217; stated reasons is, regrettably, another indication that this hearing was rushed through. An application for an EPO may only be heard in a Family Proceedings Court (unless there are already proceedings pending in another court). In a complex case such as the present, where the evidence relied upon at the EPO hearing involves induced or fabricated illness, emotional harm and possible sexual abuse, the wisdom of the system preventing such an important issue being transferred up to a higher tier of court must be seriously in doubt. Allegations of induced or fabricated illness and/or emotional harm are unlikely to give rise to a genuine emergency sufficient to justify immediate removal of the child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already questioned the wisdom of confining applications of this sort to the FPC level. One course open to the justices in the present case, if they had seen the benefit in a higher tier of the system dealing with the issue, would have been to encourage the local authority to issue an application for an interim care order and then providing for the immediate transfer of that application to a higher court.</p>
