	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am concerned with a child, a boy born in May 2007 who is therefore now a little over six years old.  For some four and a half years there has been incessant litigation between his mother and his father.  Towards the end of that process Mr. Justice Hedley became the judge who was concerned to make welfare decisions in the interests of the child in circumstances where it was, unhappily, all too apparent that there was very little the parents could agree upon.  </span></p>

It is, if I may say so, characteristic of the wisdom, commonsense, deep understanding for the human condition, and empathy of an immensely experienced family judge.  It makes very depressing reading.   Mr. Justice Hedley was concerned to decide whether there should, or should not, be significant variation in the arrangements which had been made by him in previous orders of the court.  In particular, as he records in para. 12, the father's stance was that there should be, in effect, as he put it, "a reversal of the primacy of care" so that the bulk of the child's time should be spent with the father and the role of the mother, in terms of time, should broadly mirror the father's role under the previous orders.  Mr. Justice Hedley set out the reasons why, as he concluded, </span></p>

I am simply not prepared to be part of any such developments and I do not believe that the interests of [the boy] are remotely served by any such approach".</span></p>

He ordered that the wardship was to continue.  He provided that the court would delegate its powers of care and control and the exercise of parental responsibility in accordance with the terms of the Order.  In para. 3 he spelt out in terms of time the periods when father was to have care and control of the child.  In para. 4 he provided that care and control was at all other times to be with the mother.  In para. 5 he provided there was to be no contact to either parent during the time of the other's exercise of care and control, save such as might be agreed between the parties.  I omit reference to a further, for present purposes immaterial, qualification.  Mr. Justice Hedley went on in para. 6 to determine a question as to the boy's education.  In para. 7 he provided as follows:</span></p>

(as he then was) in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">A v. A</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, divided the exercise of parental responsibility into three different categories.  For present purposes I need refer only to the third category &#8211; namely, "Decisions that you would need to inform and consult the other parent prior to making the decision".  One of the decisions under that heading was "planned medical and dental treatment".  In other words, the court was devolving to the parents the ability to take decisions in relation to the medical and dental treatment of the child, thus in anticipation making provision avoiding the need to come back to court as would normally be required under the principle that no medical treatment can take place without the court's consent.  Importantly, as will be appreciated, the mechanism which Mr. Justice Hedley put in place was that in relation to planned dental treatment, with which I am in part concerned today, the obligation on the parent proposing to embark upon such treatment was to inform and consult with the other parent prior to coming to a decision.  There is no obligation to obtain the consent of the other parent, let alone the consent of the court, the consent of the court having been given in anticipation by the provisions to which I have drawn attention.</span></p>

On that occasion I gave certain directions, including, significantly as it has turned out, a direction that the father was to obtain and produce to the court a transcript of the judgment of Mr. Justice Hedley to which I have already drawn attention.  My Order provided that the application was adjourned to be heard on the first open date thereafter before me.  It has come on before me today.

The reality, whether he is prepared to accept this or not, is that the father seeks in substance to re-open the case and to persuade me, or some other judge, to do that which Mr. Justice Hedley was not prepared to do as recently as 11 December 2012.  He supports his application with a litany of complaints about the mother's alleged conduct, many of which are reminiscent in their substance, if in their detail they differ, from complaints which have been ventilated in the past.  Fundamentally he attacks the division of time as between the parents and asserts that the proper division of time should be equal as between the mother and the father, referring in this context to proposals which are currently before Parliament.

There seems to be a complete inability to do anything by agreement.   There has been a distressing volume of correspondence between the parties and their solicitors.  It is a feature which I am readily able to accept that virtually nothing is achieved by agreement.  It does not follow from this that the solution is for the court to embark upon the kind of further investigation that the father is suggesting.  Unless the parents both recognise their responsibilities as parents, take account of the wise words of Mr. Justice Hedley, and adapt their behaviour accordingly, the consequences for the child caught in the middle of what a CAFCASS officer described as a "toxic relationship" hardly bear thinking about.</span></p>

A deeply saddening but, I fear, all too characteristic example of the problem is at para. 23 of his judgment, which suggests an inability by the parents even to agree the detail of the whereabouts on Clapham Junction railway station the handover should take place.  In relation to that, Mr. Justice Hedley used these words, </span></p>

Despite the force and intensity of the father's complaints, he has said nothing in my judgment which, whether looked at individually or collectively, justifies the drastic step, so shortly after Mr. Justice Hedley refused, entirely appropriately as it seems to me, to vary the arrangements, to throw all that back into the melting pot and to embark upon the kind of investigation preparatory to the kind of fundamental change in the arrangements which it is the father's ambition to achieve.</span></p>

It is common ground, it seems, between the parents that their child needs dental treatment.  Each has propounded a form of treatment which they contend is appropriate.  The father's is set out in a letter dated 20 February 2013 from Dr. S. The other, propounded by the mother, is set out in a treatment plan from the M Clinic dated 7 December 2012.  That treatment plan has, as I understand it, been with the father for some time.  There may be a dispute as to whether the father had, before today, sent a copy of the letter of 20 February 2013 to the mother or her solicitors.  But, be that as it may, a copy of that letter was handed to the mother and her counsel in front of me this morning.   </span></p>

Each parent has consulted the other.  Although it may be that it was only this morning that the mother had seen the letter, the substance of what was in that letter had been set out in an e-mail sent many months ago.  So, as to the substance each parent has had the benefit of being consulted by the other as to what is proposed.   Unsurprisingly, neither parent can agree with the other as to what is the appropriate form of treatment.  The father says that the appropriate form of treatment is that for which he contends.  The mother likewise.  The father's complaint about the mother's proposal is that it involves more radical invasive dental treatment, removing a number of, albeit milk, molar teeth whereas what he is contending for is a less seriously invasive form of procedure.  Miss Mustafa points out that the form of treatment being proposed by the father has, in effect, been considered by the mother's dental advisers and they give reasons why, in their view, the form of treatment proposed by the father would not be appropriate.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">How am I to resolve this issue?  One way would be to direct a hearing at which further evidence might be taken, perhaps inviting each of the relevant dental practitioners to file an expert report commenting on the other so that a judge might, with the benefit of further evidence from the dental practitioners, in effect come to a judicial decision as to which form of treatment is the more appropriate.  That approach, however, as it seems to me, would undermine both the specific provisions and, indeed, the fundamental philosophy of Mr. Justice Hedley's Order.  The specific provisions of his Order to which I have already drawn attention have the consequence that either parent is at liberty to proceed with the treatment they propose without obtaining the consent of the court, without obtaining the consent of the other parent, so long as they have informed and consulted with the other parent before deciding to proceed.  That process of informing and consulting has now taken place.  Consequently, in accordance with the terms of the specific provision of Mr. Justice Hedley's Order, unless I make some different Order, each parent is at liberty to proceed with that form of dental treatment for which they contend and may lawfully do so, whether or not they have the consent of the other parent.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">But those specific provisions in Mr. Justice Hedley's Order seem to me to reflect a deeper and more profound philosophy which underlies his Order &#8211; that these parents must get on with the task of deciding what is to happen to their son.  The court cannot continue to be engaged in a process of micro-managing or, as in this case, ruling on specific issues which may arise throughout this child's life.  If I were to go down the path of directing a hearing or, indeed, of taking a judicial decision as between these two competing assertions, where would it end?  In the nature of things, there are bound to be future occasions when this boy will require dental treatment.  There are likely to be occasions when he may require medical treatment.  If I was to embark upon the task of adjudicating upon this particular dispute, I would, in effect, be indicating that despite the arrangements put in place by Mr. Justice Hedley each and every such dispute down the years is to be decided by a judge.  That is a process which is consistent neither with the philosophy &#8211; the very wise philosophy &#8211; embodied by Mr. Justice Hedley in his Order, nor indeed with the very detailed provisions he made.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">According I decline to make any order in relation to the question of dental treatment.  The position, as I have explained it, is that as matters stand today and assuming, as I do, that the proposals of the father and the mother are respectively set out in the two documents I have mentioned, there has been the necessary process of informing and consulting.  The consequence, to repeat, is that either parent is at liberty to proceed with the dental treatment they think appropriate without obtaining the consent of the other parent and without obtaining the consent of the court.  That may be thought unsatisfactory in the sense that absent any form of agreement it will be left to each parent no doubt to seek to steal a march on the other parent.  But that, it seems to me, is unavoidable.  It is the necessary consequence of the Order made by Mr. Justice Hedley which seems to me to be an Order which, unsatisfactory though it may be in some senses, is, I have not the slightest doubt, the best order which could possibly have been achieved given the circumstances.  </span></p>

It seems to me that for the future there is a pressing need to ensure judicial continuity.  I have not the slightest reason to believe that this will be the last application made by one or other parent to the court.  It seems to me that for the time being at least, the case, not least because it is a case involving a ward of the court, should remain in the High Court.  It should not be transferred to the County Court.  It will in due course be allocated to a specific named judge of the Division.  When the Order which I make today is actually sealed, the name of that judge will be in the Order.</span></p>

It seems to me that for the future there will be advantage to that judge in being able to read not merely the judgment I have given this morning but, if I may say so, even more importantly a transcript of the proceedings; because the way in which the case was presented on the one side and on the other side is itself something which it seems to me the judge who for the future will have conduct of this case needs to be aware of.  I shall accordingly, exceptionally &#8211; and this is not to be taken as a precedent for the future &#8211; direct that a transcript of the proceedings and a transcript of this judgment are to be prepared at public expense.</span></p>

This is a case in which the respondent chose, very helpfully as it has turned out, to attend, having permission to do so without being required to do so.  That is another reason why there should be no order as to costs.</span></p>
