	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">This judgment addresses a variety of case management issues prior to the rehearing of a fact finding hearing within private law proceedings concerning a little girl, M, now aged three years. The outcome of a previous fact finding hearing was the subject of a successful appeal by the mother. The judgment on the appeal is reported under neutral citation <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/3225" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 3225 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 3225 (Fam)</ref> (referred to herein as &#8220;the appeal judgment&#8221;).

I am very grateful to all the advocates for their written and oral submissions in what is highly emotive and difficult litigation.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">This judgment may be of interest in that, in part, it concerns the use of intimate images within private law proceedings and makes suggestions for how such images should be admitted into and managed within private law children proceedings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of intimate images is becoming increasingly common in private law proceedings where allegations of domestic abuse (including sexual abuse) have been made and where the court has decided to determine the truth or otherwise of those allegations by holding a fact finding hearing.  No previous reported judgment concerned with private law proceedings has, to my knowledge or those of the advocates, addressed this issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Unsurprisingly given the litigation history but unhelpfully, the case management documents prepared by the mother and the father were not in agreement as to the factual background giving rise to the proceedings. Rather than attempt to construct a narrative myself for the purpose of what is a case management judgment, I have decided to rely on the summary of the background set out by Judd J at paragraphs 2-12 of her appeal judgment which, by reference, I incorporate into this judgment. No party made submissions to me that her summary was inaccurate.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Following the fact finding judgment at first instance, the mother applied for permission to appeal which was granted in April 2021. The appeal hearing took place in November 2021 and the judgment of Judd J was handed down on 1 December 2021. The mother&#8217;s appeal was allowed on two grounds.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The first ground was that the mother did not have the benefit of participation directions. There was a duty on the court to ensure that a party&#8217;s vulnerability was addressed by the use of participation directions to enable that party to give their best evidence to the court. In coming to her conclusion, Judd J highlighted the sensitive nature of the case where there were allegations of the utmost seriousness, including two alleged vaginal rapes and one alleged anal rape when the mother was eight months&#8217; pregnant. She also noted that there was evidence that the mother had some long-term underlying frailties and suffered from anxiety. Those matters <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;cried out for participation directions and a ground rules hearing, not just for the sake of the mother but for the integrity of the court process itself&#8221; </span>(paragraph 66 of the appeal judgment).</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The second ground was that the judge had given insufficient consideration to the possibility that the mother may have been over-dependent on the relationship with the father or vulnerable in that relationship. The judge&#8217;s analysis of that issue was found to be limited and Judd J accepted that there was some force in the submission that the judge had looked at the evidence in a compartmentalised manner.</p>

Shortly before Christmas 2021, I permitted the instruction of Dr Hannah Jones, a clinical psychologist, to prepare a report upon the mother. Regrettably, given the dispute as to the precise nature of Dr Jones&#8217;s instructions, I was required both to descend into the minutiae of what documents should be disclosed to Dr Jones and, because the questions in the draft letter of instruction were unfocussed and repetitive, to draft the questions for Dr Jones myself. </p>

The proceedings originated in the High Court when the mother wrongfully removed M from this jurisdiction to Romania. On 22 January 2020, Mostyn J found that M had been wrongfully removed from this jurisdiction and ordered her return. The mother had returned here with M by the time of a hearing on 18 February 2020 before HHJ Watson (sitting as a judge of the High Court). By an application dated 28 October 2020, the mother sought permission to remove M from this jurisdiction to live in Romania.</p>

She stated that he had an obsessive sexual compulsion/disorder which he was unable or unwilling to control and had desires towards young looking girls, including school girls. Additionally, the father was said to have shown controlling, manipulative and intimidating behaviour towards the mother throughout their relationship. He was alleged to be financially controlling and physically violent on occasion. The mother alleged that the father had behaved inappropriately with M by encouraging her to suck his toes, by watching him urinate, and by using abusive language to M such as calling her a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;whore&#8221;</span> and a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;cunt&#8221;</span>.</p>

However, the mother now alleged a further specific occasion of sexual assault in 2016, alongside multiple rapes when she was sleeping. She also alleged violent conduct by the father during sex including non-fatal strangulation. The father pursued an additional allegation that the mother had subjected M to unnecessary surgery on her labia in Romania without the father&#8217;s consent and against the advice of M&#8217;s GP. He also asserted that the mother had fabricated increasingly serious allegations of abuse in order to obstruct the father&#8217;s relationship with M.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">First, Dr Jones was of the opinion that the mother was experiencing symptoms characteristic of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Complex-PTSD) and that she had a Depressive Disorder with comorbid anxiety. Dr Jones was confident that the mother did not have difficulties with her cognitive functioning.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Dr Jones reports that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder that may occur in people who have experienced a traumatic event. People with PTSD have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people. People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch. Symptoms of PTSD fall into four categories: Intrusion; Avoidance; Alterations in cognition and mood; Alterations in arousal and reactivity. The mother described each of these symptoms to Dr Jones. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Complex-PTSD has been described as typically associated with chronic and repeated traumas and includes not only the symptoms of PTSD but also disturbances in self-organisation reflected in emotion regulation, self-concept and relational difficulties. In Complex-PTSD, the expression of emotion regulation difficulties predominantly includes emotional sensitivity, reactive anger, and poor coping responses.  Again the mother described each of these symptoms to Dr Jones. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The mother&#8217;s reported symptoms of Complex-PTSD were likely to impact upon her ability to provide her best evidence. Traumatic stress can influence engagement with court processes in a diversity of ways, with the impact having a positive correlation with exposure to trauma related material and exposure to increased stress (each being typical within court hearings). Research indicates that for those individuals experiencing trauma related symptoms, attempting to relay their experiences can produce memories that are fragmented, lacking in specific details, and difficult to position within a linear narrative. Those who experience trauma are more likely to produce inconsistent or incomplete accounts, and accounts may shift as an individual comes to terms with their experiences. Trauma memories are more likely to be partial, and fragmented into key moments. The impact on memory that trauma survivors experience means they are at raised risk of being susceptible to suggestive influences and vulnerable to court proceedings, most significantly within a cross-examination where there is opportunity to use suggestive, misleading questions in an attempt to find inconsistences and inaccuracies in a witness&#8217;s testimony to imply unreliable evidence.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">High levels of negative affect may predispose the mother to intense maladaptive emotional responses and dysfunctional cognitive processes such as selective attention to negative or threatening cues and hypervigilance to threat. Such maladaptive cognitive processes can result in emotional dysregulation and impaired social functioning. Moreover, an increased perception of threat accompanied by elevated emotional states might exacerbate negative responses to ongoing stressors or serve itself as a source of chronic stress, with the resulting stress-related co-morbidities. As a result of this, trauma related distress is often obscured by seeming innocuous behaviour or response. Within a courtroom setting, it is often challenging to identify when traumatic stress has been induced (or &#8216;triggered&#8217;), and the resulting behaviour can appear confrontational, defensive, bizarre, or evasive, and thus can give the impression that an individual is not in distress. According to Dr Jones, the mother recognised this to a certain extent, highlighting the severe impact that cross examination regarding the intimate video material by the father&#8217;s barrister had had. She said that, in response to feeling extremely <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;intimidated&#8221;</span>, she became <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;defensive&#8221;</span> rather than expressing the fear and shame that she was experiencing. The mother said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I try to be strong, I try not to cry, I didn&#8217;t want him to see me crying&#8221;</span>. Complex-PTSD related shame and guilt may also cause vulnerability to negative insinuations during cross-examination, with factors such as the tone of voice used acting as potential cues for feelings of powerlessness and stigmatisation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The mother&#8217;s medical records detailed a depressive disorder, ongoing hypervigilance, adrenergic symptoms, panic attacks, and fluctuating mood. She is currently prescribed anti-depressant medication. Dr Jones suggested that the mother&#8217;s experiences of symptoms associated with a depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety were most appropriately interpreted within the context of her wider symptoms of Complex-Post Traumatic Stress.</p>

The mother should also have the services of a consistent interpreter because, although her comprehension of English was good, at times of stress her ability to source words and convey meaning was likely to be impaired.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">With respect to participation directions, Dr Jones recommended that the mother should not come into direct or indirect contact with the father during her evidence and he should not be able to see her when she was giving her oral evidence. She should be given frequent breaks with additional breaks should she show signs of trauma related distress. Further, the mother should be exposed to areas of questioning in advance and there should not be unnecessarily intrusive questioning regarding traumatic experiences. Finally, the mother should not be unnecessarily exposed to trauma related material.</p>

She described finding cross-examination regarding the intimate videos and images particularly difficult to manage. The mother said that she continued to experience trauma related distress as a result of this experience, including physiological symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and low mood.  It was evident that the inclusion of the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;large number of explicit videos&#8230;several large pornographic photographs of her and several more small &#8216;stills&#8217; exhibiting videos&#8221;</span> (as described in paragraph 64 of the appeal judgment) in addition to questioning which <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;may not have been necessary&#8221; </span>(para 67) including material from prior to the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father had acted as a significant trauma for the mother. The mother told Dr Jones  that she had been <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;forever damaged&#8221;</span> as a result of this, and discussed that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;didn&#8217;t know how to manage&#8221;</span>. She described extreme physiological symptoms associated with this experience, in addition to panic attacks, re-experiencing, and depressed mood. Dr Jones was of the opinion that subsequent inclusion of this material within a further court setting was likely to have a compounding traumatic impact on the mother. The exposure to the intimate images and videos or other trauma related material was likely to impact on the mother&#8217;s ability to give her best oral evidence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">With respect to such material, Dr Jones recommended limiting the number of people who viewed the same with, ideally, the judge alone seeing the intimate images which were considered relevant. Further, the judge alone should ask the mother questions about it. If there were to be cross-examination by any of the advocates, Dr Jones recommended that only one advocate ask the mother about this material.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The conclusions of Dr Jones&#8217; report were accepted by the mother and the children&#8217;s Guardian, the latter noting that Dr Jones&#8217; analysis was congruent with her own observations of the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities set out in her report dated 21 January 2021. The father drew my attention to the fact that Dr Jones&#8217; report was based on self-reporting by the mother but accepted that, in the light of PD3AA, the mother was deemed to be vulnerable because she had made allegations of domestic abuse against the father. Mr Tyler QC submitted that the father was sceptical as to the extent of the mother&#8217;s actual vulnerability and he suggested that the mother now had a significant tactical advantage within the proceedings. However, Mr Tyler QC accepted many of Dr Jones&#8217; recommendations as to how the mother&#8217;s evidence should be facilitated by the court.</p>

Usually, where a ground rules hearing is convened, experienced advocates will agree on the correct process for which they will seek judicial approval. Of particular importance to many vulnerable witnesses will be the need for frequent breaks and also the need for straightforward questions, rather than several questions wrapped up in one.  The judge will be careful to ensure that recommendations made in respect of a vulnerable witness are followed.  Intermediaries will sit with the vulnerable witness and will interrupt if a question is considered to be too complicated, and will ask for breaks if deemed necessary.  Judges will be careful to ensure that the ground rules established are adhered to.  Advocates and judges, for whom digesting large amounts of documents quickly, and sitting for two or more hours without a break are commonplace, must be alive to the fact that most witnesses have never previously experienced the court process and that vulnerable witnesses may become overwhelmed by it.&#8221;  </span></p>

The parties produced a composite schedule of allegations for the March hearing which contained responses by the father to the mother&#8217;s allegations but no responses by the mother to the father&#8217;s allegations. I raised that deficit with Miss Fottrell QC, but did not receive a satisfactory response. As will be apparent later in this judgment, I invited the parties &#8211; in fulfilment of their duty to the court to co-operate with it &#8211; to review and simplify these documents (alongside other matters). On 6 April 2022, I received a revised schedule of allegations made by the mother. As I had directed in December 2021, that document provided an overview of the mother&#8217;s case and signposted the court to the matters she sought to prove under each broad category of alleged abuse. I note that the father disputes each and every one of the allegations made. However, by 6 April 2022, the mother had still not complied with my December 2021 direction to respond to the father&#8217;s schedule of allegations. On 7 April 2022, I asked my clerk to enquire why the mother had not responded to the father&#8217;s schedule of allegations and she was told by Miss Fottrell QC later that day that the failure to do so had been an oversight and that a response was in hand. On 11 April 2022, Miss Fottrell QC emailed my clerk to apologise for the continuing delay and eventually, I received the mother&#8217;s response to the father&#8217;s schedule of allegations on 12 April 2022. </p>

A direction is a court order - it is not an optional extra. The purpose of this direction was to define clearly the issues which required determination at the fact finding hearing so that each party knew the case it had to respectively either meet and/or prove. Regrettably, that has not happened in the manner I envisaged either at the December 2021 hearing or as a result of March hearing.</p>

Such an image can include part of a person&#8217;s body, clothed or unclothed, such as breasts, genitalia or the anus, which are generally regarded as private. Intimate images include those of a person engaged in what is normally regarded as private behaviour such as washing, urinating, masturbating or engaged in other sexual acts either alone or with another being. The images with which I am concerned are both still and moving images. None of the parties sought to define what an intimate image was but it struck me that this might be helpful for courts and practitioners. In offering my suggested definition, I have deliberately not made reference to definitions contained in the criminal law as those did not seem to me to meet the needs of the family court.</p>

There was no mention of how he came to meet the mother or of their sexual relationship. On her return from Romania, the mother produced at court a number of documents which alleged <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;deviant behaviour&#8221;</span> by the father, including watching pornography involving very young girls, and compulsive masturbation several times a day. She alleged that the father had emotionally abused her and had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;humiliated the baby by asking her to suck his big toe&#8221;</span>.

That statement referred three times to how the mother and father met online but not in a great deal of detail. There was a fleeting reference to the mother working online and another to her working as a webcam model. He made no reference in this statement or the exhibits to the couple&#8217;s sexual history which, at that time, had not been put in issue by the mother. Thereafter, the mother&#8217;s second statement on 6 March 2020 repeated many of the allegations made in the earlier material. However, by 16 March 2020, the mother had made allegations of domestic abuse, including an allegation of rape, to the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The mother&#8217;s schedule of allegations dated 28 April 2020 contained ten allegations, including three of rape, and was supported by a statement which made very serious allegations about the father&#8217;s conduct towards her. A bundle of documents and a bundle of digital exhibits were appended which contained graphic and intimate video content including material relating to an alleged rape. The intimate material included 6 videos of the mother and father engaging in sexual activity on four separate occasions and two videos of the mother following sedation for dental treatment. The mother alleged that, following one of four occasions of dental treatment, she was raped. Additionally, there were two audio recordings taken covertly by the mother of a conversation between her and the father. In her statement, the mother acknowledged how embarrassed she felt at showing and discussing this material with her legal representatives though she recognised that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is important that I show true information&#8221;</span>. There was no warning to the father or to the court that material of this nature had been filed. Thus, the mother was the first in time to produce and rely on intimate videos and recorded content. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The mother&#8217;s case was, in essence, that she had been treated by the father as a possession and a toy to use for his sexual pleasure. The father had inflicted pain on her and this apparently increased his sexual arousal. His sexual behaviour and coercion (including during their sexual relations) meant that the mother felt unable to refuse his demands. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">In rebuttal, the father exhibited 32 videos to his statement. Seventeen of these videos were concerned with the four occasions about which the mother had produced video material. Mr Tyler QC contended that these seventeen videos demonstrated an entirely different perspective on the couple&#8217;s sexual relationship to those chosen by the mother. A further three videos were submitted to allegedly show that the mother was either discussing in positive terms or masturbating to the very videos which the mother claimed were abusive. Ten of the videos exhibited by the father were in fact filmed by the mother and were produced to rebut her assertion that she did not consent to being filmed and that she had only filmed sexual intimacy with the father on one occasion. The remaining video material was produced by the father to show that the sexual relationship between the parties was not characterised by coercion and control throughout as the mother alleged. Once more, the court was not told about the nature of this intimate material before it was filed on behalf of the father.</p>

This included intimate pictures allegedly relating to the time when she worked as a prostituted woman in Romania; and a further video of her and the father engaging in sexual activity. In a statement made in consequence of my December 2021 directions, the mother made further serious allegations about the father&#8217;s sexual conduct towards her, including that he forced her to perform oral sex, that he strangled her during sex, and that he regularly raped her whilst she slept. The father&#8217;s statement in reply appended one further video of the mother allegedly laughing about an incident of oral sex which he said was relevant to the mother&#8217;s new allegations.</p>

I felt sick to see the father had added videos of me, which I had no knowledge of. I am sure that [the father] added those videos to humiliate me. I feel that he abused me all over again with those videos. I am deeply ashamed. I want [the father] to give an undertaking to the court to destroy all the videos and images he has of me.

This matter was case managed in advance of the first fact finding hearing by HHJ Jakens on 20 July 2020 when the fact finding hearing was listed for August 2020 and again on 30 July 2020 when the fact finding hearing listed in August was adjourned to November 2020. Apart from a mention of time being set aside for the viewing of the video material, no other directions were given with respect to the profusion of intimate images in this case. At the first fact finding hearing, HHJ Henson QC viewed the videos containing intimate material and inspected the still intimate images. I was not told that any party raised objection to her doing so.</p>

The father produced a detailed schedule of the intimate images on which he relied, briefly describing each item, why it was necessary and its relevance to the issues for the fact finding hearing. He also responded to the intimate material produced by the mother in similar form. I observe that the father&#8217;s legal team alone had viewed and considered all this material. For her part, the mother produced a schedule which listed all the video material produced by the mother and the father, highlighting all the intimate material which she said should not be admitted. That document was of limited assistance to me for, though it identified briefly the nature of the intimate material, it did not engage with whether each item was necessary or relevant. However, it was common ground that intimate images and videos relating to an alleged rape in Spain were relevant and should be viewed by the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">After I heard counsel&#8217;s submissions about the intimate images, I indicated that the parties should reconsider the relevance and necessity of the court needing to view all of this material at the fact finding hearing. They should ask themselves whether there were alternatives to its use such as agreed transcripts of videos or admissions as to certain facts, for example, the timing of the alleged anal rape. If it was necessary to rely on some of this material, what was proportionate (there being a limit to the material deployed in rebuttal of any allegation)? Above all, the parties were asked to consider the relevance of this material to the schedules of allegations. Following those observations, the parties produced on 6 April 2022 a document entitled an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;amended compromise schedule to the applicant father&#8217;s photographs and video exhibits&#8221;</span>.

Material relating to the mother&#8217;s sexual activities and conduct prior to meeting the father was of no relevance. She alleged that the use of such images by the father was intended to humiliate and re-traumatise the mother. The only intimate images the Court should view were of the alleged rape in Spain. She suggested that the father appeared to be running a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sexual history&#8221;</span> defence that, because the mother was sexually experienced and adventurous and available to him and others for sex, she could not possibly have been raped or sexually abused as she contended. Finally, she suggested that the father had not sought the mother&#8217;s consent before taking intimate images of her and, in those circumstances, that behaviour amounted to a potential criminal offence. Its deployment in these proceedings by the father was intended to traumatise and humiliate the mother &#8211; a form of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;revenge porn&#8221;</span> &#8211; and therefore the court should not admit this material into the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Following the submission of additional case management documents on 6 April 2022, the mother&#8217;s position had undergone some revision. She now accepted, in complete and stark contrast to her earlier case, that there were on occasion mutually enjoyable sexual relations between her and the father. According to Miss Fottrell QC, that meant that intimate images depicting this mutually enjoyable and consensual behaviour were irrelevant. The court should balance relevance against (i) the impact on the mother of the intimate images being viewed/used at the fact finding hearing; (ii) the father&#8217;s motivation; and (iii) proportionality as to volume and consequences. Miss Fottrell QC submitted that any decision I made with respect to this material should be kept under review before and during the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in"><span style="font-weight:bold">On behalf of the father</span>, Mr Tyler QC submitted that the mother was seeking to rewrite the narrative of the proceedings by arguing that none of the disputed intimate images should be admitted into the proceedings as evidence. That material had been deployed first in time by the mother and included explicit images of both M&#8217;s parents together with photographs of a private nature of the father&#8217;s son and his girlfriend, all of which were used by the mother without the consent of those depicted. There was no suggestion of the need for prior application to the court in respect of such material. When the father rebutted the mother&#8217;s allegations, the mother now sought to withdraw her exhibits of intimate images and to prevent the father from relying on his, while standing by her original allegations, to which, on her own (original) case, the exhibits were relevant. Mr Tyler QC vigorously rebutted the suggestion that he was running a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sexual history&#8221;</span> defence case. It was the mother who first produced sexual material in order to suggest that the father&#8217;s sexual behaviour was inappropriate. The father filed evidence in response to the mother&#8217;s extremely serious allegations which the mother, by producing the explicit material she exhibited, sought to prove. In fact, the mother was running an equivalent sexual history case against the father by suggesting that he preyed on young vulnerable foreign women, another allegation which he strenuously disputed. The video material produced by the father was not intended as a form of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;revenge porn&#8221;</span> or to traumatise the mother. The father did so in order to defend himself against very serious allegations. Mr Tyler QC asserted that the material was relevant and that the balancing exercise in respect of other rights being asserted to militate against such evidence being admitted fell in favour of the father. Each piece of evidence served a specific and legitimate evidential purpose and the cumulative effect of the intimate image evidence, including that produced by the mother, was vital to the father&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;defence&#8221;</span>. The father was entitled to reduce such relevant evidence as he chose in rebuttal to that produced by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">On 6 April 2022, it was plain that, having reflected on the court&#8217;s observations and on the views of the children&#8217;s Guardian that some of the material may be managed by alternative means, the father had reduced the intimate material he invited the court to review from 32 videos to 16 and the overall explicit material by more than 50%. Nevertheless the father submitted that the mother should not be permitted to withdraw any of the exhibits previously relied upon by her. It was important that all this evidence was viewed as the mother now sought to withdraw material once the deficits in her case had become apparent. Mr Tyler QC submitted that the mother sought to remove evidence which either did not support her case or supported the father&#8217;s case that she had exaggerated, misled, or manipulated the evidence before the court. In summary, he asserted that the mother should not be permitted to sanitise her case at this stage of the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in"><span style="font-weight:bold">On behalf of the child</span>, Mr Woodward-Carlton QC adopted a more nuanced position. He submitted that the evidence needed to be relevant and probative. Even if it satisfied both these requirements, a proportionality evaluation should include, amongst other things, the vulnerability of the parties and the effect on them and on the fact-finding exercise as a whole. He suggested that there may be a range of alternatives to the viewing of sexually explicit material such as agreed transcripts of videos or data as to the timing of an individual image. Should the father be permitted to rely on intimate images to rebut the mother&#8217;s allegations, the court should consider the proportionality with respect to the amount of material or the type of material relied upon. Thus, how many examples/types of what father purported to be the mother&#8217;s sexual enthusiasm were required to make father&#8217;s point about the absence of coercion and control within the couple&#8217;s relationship? Mr Woodward-Carlton QC suggested that the court retained the option to review its initial decisions regarding admissibility depending on the way in which the hearing proceeded. What might seem to be unnecessary and undesirable at this stage may, in all the circumstances, turn out to be required after all albeit handled sensitively. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The deployment of intimate images, both moving and still, in these proceedings has been wholly un-boundaried and disproportionate. The mother instigated the use of such material and continued to do so until shortly before the first fact-finding hearing in November 2020. Faced with extremely serious allegations about his conduct as a parent and as a partner, the father responded in kind by deploying a vast swathe of such material, some of which was intended to provide context to the couple relationship and some of which was intended to correct what he described as the misleading impression created by the mother&#8217;s use of excerpts from longer videos or of videos taken out of context. At no stage until the hearing before Judd J did the advocates or the court consider the relevance and probative value of this material let alone the proportionality of using it within private law children proceedings. The first time on which the use of intimate images was raised with the court was in the skeleton argument filed by leading and junior counsel for the mother once permission to appeal had been granted by Judd J. At the mother&#8217;s request, neither counsel nor the appellate court viewed the still or video intimate images save that Judd J viewed the video of the alleged rape in Spain.</p>

The mother&#8217;s written submissions on the revised table of explicit images relied upon by the father only dealt with that material rather than also addressing her own use of intimate images. It was also equally unhelpful that the mother&#8217;s responses to many of the individual items in the revised schedule did not engage with the factual matters which the father sought to demonstrate and which were spelled out in the schedule. The repetition of the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the Guardian has raised this as an exhibit which should not be viewed and the mother is in agreement with this&#8221; </span>was a response which failed to engage with the issues which I had asked the parties to address. Mr Tyler QC&#8217;s written submissions suggested that the mother maintained the position that every explicit image on which she had previously sought to rely should be withdrawn and, by email on 12 April 2022, Miss Fottrell QC confirmed this to be the case. </p>

The relevance of the material to the allegations made by both parties and its probative value have been my starting point. I part company from Mr Tyler QC in that I do not accept that it will be rare for relevant evidence to be excluded. It will be excluded if it is deployed in great amounts without justification or addresses the same issue repeatedly and without bringing anything of forensic value to what has already been submitted. For example, to persuade a court that a couple&#8217;s sexual relationship was mutually satisfactory does not require the admission into the evidence of numerous still and moving intimate images of the couple having sex. However, I accept his submission that the relevance test must &#8211; of necessity &#8211; be generously applied at a pre-hearing stage but that is not an open door to permit everything including the proverbial kitchen sink being deployed to bolster a case. </p>

Put simply, the court must - in this case - undertake a balancing exercise between the father&#8217;s right to a fair hearing when faced with extremely serious allegations and the mother&#8217;s need to have a fair process which does not impact adversely on her ability, as a vulnerable witness, to give her best evidence to the court.  The introduction into the proceedings of intimate material which is likely to be distressing to the mother and also embarrassing for the father is one of the considerations relevant to that exercise. </p>

I also accept that there may be limited value in viewing a still intimate image in order to be able to determine any issues of fact. However, a small number of such images may still have relevance and probative value, for example, to demonstrate that evidence may have been manipulated or to contradict an account given in a witness statement.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The mother has filed intimate images but, after the hearing on 29-30 March 2022, it was unclear to me whether she maintained that this material should also be excluded. By an email from my clerk on 8 April 2022, I asked Miss Fottrell QC if she now contended that all the intimate images the mother had introduced into this litigation should be excluded. Irrespective of the mother&#8217;s position, Mr Tyler QC submitted that this material should remain in the bundle, not least to demonstrate that the mother had exaggerated and manipulated the evidence in this case. I received a response from Miss Fottrell QC on 12 April 2022, confirming that the mother no longer sought to rely on the intimate images produced by her and listed in the schedule prepared by Dr Proudman (appended to the skeleton argument produced for the hearing in late March 2022). She requested that this material should not form part of the evidence and should not be viewed by the parties or by the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The difficulty with Miss Fottrell QC&#8217;s position is that the mother&#8217;s schedule only lists moving images and not still images so it is unclear to me whether she continues to rely on still images of an intimate nature. However, her submissions in the skeleton argument are couched in respect of both still and moving intimate images (see paragraph 30 of her skeleton argument). This lack of clarity in her position makes it exceptionally difficult for the court to adjudicate on the mother&#8217;s application with respect to intimate images produced by her. I have &#8211; with regret &#8211; decided that it would be unfair to either parent to do so at this stage.</p>

I direct that the parties collaborate to produce a schedule identifying these images together with a brief description and explanation of each item&#8217;s relevance to the issues I am required to determine and whether there are alternatives to viewing the images.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">It will be apparent to readers of this judgment that I have grave concerns about the use of intimate images in private law children proceedings where allegations of abuse, specifically domestic abuse, are made.  I perceive it to be a problem which is already present in a growing number of private law children cases and one which is likely only to increase given the growing use of still and/or moving images to document intimate relationships. In this case, the volume of intimate images previously admitted without any scrutiny is itself a strong argument for guidelines to encourage the court to control this type of evidence in private law children proceedings. However, there is a further compelling reason for such guidelines, namely the emotional and psychological harm which may be caused to the parties, and particularly to an alleged victim of abuse, by the indiscriminate use of this material. </p>

Further, it was an artificial exercise if the mother was effectively to rehearse her oral evidence with the intermediary the night before. Doing so ran the risk that the mother would be doubly traumatised by this process, once by thinking about and discussing the question the night before and then by answering it the following day. Providing the mother with topics/areas of cross-examination in advance coupled with the avoidance of exposure to trauma related material or unnecessarily intrusive questioning about allegedly traumatic experiences gave her a sensible route map for what she was to be asked on behalf of the father.</p>

It is also agreed that the advocates asking questions of the mother will conduct themselves in a way which does not cause the mother unnecessary upset, for example, by asking unnecessarily intrusive questions about allegedly traumatic experiences. She will also know the topics/areas of questioning in advance. Those participation directions address the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities whilst permitting a fair exploration of the father&#8217;s case.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">Leaving aside the objections raised by the father and the children&#8217;s Guardian, the course recommended by Miss Fottrell QC would have the effect of significantly elongating the mother&#8217;s time in the witness box. It is trite to say that the questioning of witnesses is a dynamic process but every advocate and judge recognises that reality. In order to respond to the mother&#8217;s answers and then compose or adapt written questions, the father&#8217;s advocate would need to be given extra time to do so during the court day and at the conclusion of the mother&#8217;s evidence. Time would also need to be allowed for the intermediary to consider and then discuss questions with the mother at a sensible time so that the mother could rest after the court day. Realistically, the court would only hear evidence in the morning and then adjourn for the rest of the day. In that scenario, the mother would likely spend at least 6 days giving her evidence which I cannot envisage would benefit her emotionally or allow her to give her best evidence to the court. The effect on the court timetable would be significant and result in this case likely taking 13 or 14 days to complete rather than the 10 days presently allotted. It would result in an adjournment either for many months before I could accommodate it part-heard or force the adjournment of other cases which have been waiting a long time for their determination. That would not benefit M or her parents who need this fact finding hearing to take place as soon as possible and it would disadvantage other children and their families who require scarce High Court judge time. Whilst certain aspect of the process suggested by Miss Fottrell QC may well be needed in cases involving a witness with cognitive limitations or a young child, this case does not, in my view, require participation directions of that type. </p>

If questions are convoluted and not straightforward and depart from the suggestions made in the intermediary&#8217;s report, I will intervene to ensure they are reformulated in a manner understandable by the mother.

She submitted that, in those respects, the mother&#8217;s sexual history was irrelevant to the allegations in this case. Miss Fottrell QC submitted that PD12J did not adequately address the disclosure of a complainant&#8217;s sexual history or behaviour and did not support a modern approach to the consideration of a complainant&#8217;s sexual history. Miss Fottrell QC noted the provisions of section 41 of the Youth and Criminal Justice Act 1999 which prohibits the use of a complainant&#8217;s sexual history without the court&#8217;s permission and suggested that the unqualified use of a complainant&#8217;s sexual history in the family court could have the effect of discouraging victims from raising allegations which may be central to a child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

My concerns about the inclusion of the transcript of the mother&#8217;s evidence are reinforced by the expert report from Dr Jones. Not only does her report highlight the linguistic difficulties the mother may have had &#8211; in immensely stressful circumstances whilst in the witness box and when assisted by an interpreter &#8211; in spontaneously sourcing words and conveying meaning but it also highlights the manner in which her then unrecognised vulnerabilities may have impacted on her oral evidence. Dr Jones proposed a wide ranging suite of participation directions, the vast majority of which are agreed by all the advocates as necessary for the mother to give her best evidence. If those measures are necessary now, their absence at the first fact finding hearing emphasises the caution with which this court should approach any consideration of the transcript of the mother&#8217;s evidence.</p>

Indeed, the father will have ample opportunity to undertake precisely that exercise by reference to the mother&#8217;s written evidence (amounting to some 10 statements). Reference to the transcript of the mother&#8217;s evidence either to highlight inconsistencies in submissions or to put inconsistencies to her during cross examination is of marginal benefit given the difficulties with that evidence to which I have already referred. Further, there is a real danger that any second hearing would be derailed by submissions as to probative weight and fairness on each and every occasion that the father&#8217;s advocate sought to deploy material from the transcript of the mother&#8217;s evidence at the first hearing.

The appeal judgement made no criticism of the arrangements made in respect of the other witness evidence and so it may be thought that transcripts of that evidence should be available to this court at the future fact-finding hearing. However, that is to misunderstand the effect of the profound procedural unfairness relating to the mother&#8217;s evidence on the evidence of all the other witnesses. The evidence given by the mother, contaminated by procedural unfairness, will have impacted upon the questions put to other witnesses and the answers that other witnesses gave. The entire process has thus been contaminated by the unfairness occasioned by the failure to take account of the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities and to make the necessary participation directions. If it were otherwise, there would be no need to hear the witness evidence of most of the other witnesses, save in respect of any new allegations now advanced. Were the transcripts of the other witness evidence to be contained in the trial bundle, the same danger of derailing the hearing with submissions as to probative weight and fairness which I identified with respect to the mother&#8217;s evidence would also apply to the transcript evidence of the other witnesses.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in">The father submitted that he should be permitted to file a statement from his former wife as to their sexual relationship to counter the allegations made by the mother of coercion and control, sexual violence and the father&#8217;s arousal from non-consensual sexual activity. With the greatest respect to Mr Tyler QC, I cannot see how such a statement would assist the court to come to a view about the dynamics of the sexual relationship between the father and the mother. A person may behave very differently with one partner than he or she does with another and, furthermore, sexual experiences/behaviour after a relationship has ended may shape the sexual experience with a new partner in a manner quite different to that in a former relationship. In his statements, the father does not seek to lay the foundation for the admission of a statement from his former wife by, for example, explaining that his sexual conduct or experiences with his former wife was similar to those he allegedly had with the mother. The probative value of evidence from his former wife struck me as limited and I thus decline to direct the statement sought by Mr Tyler QC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.09in"> The timely delivery of this judgment has been hampered by the need for counsel to assist the court by scrutinising the schedules of intimate images; and by waiting for a response from the mother&#8217;s legal team. When that response was eventually forthcoming on 12 April 2022, I was on leave out of the jurisdiction.</p>
