The anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.

The children have received Local Authority support in the form of &#8216;early help&#8217;, child in need plans and child protection plans. The Local Authority&#8217;s concerns are that the parents&#8217; own needs negatively impact upon their capacity to parent their children. The mother experiences difficulties with her mental health in addition to her learning disability. The father experiences difficulties with his physical health in addition to his learning disability. Further, the relationship between the parents is reported to have been abusive, with swearing, shouting and violence in the home, witnessed by the children. The children were also reported to swear and to shout. The Local Authority is concerned that, notwithstanding a high level of professional assistance, the parents have not been able to meet the needs of the children, resulting in the children experiencing significant harm in the form of neglect, emotional harm and physical harm in their parents&#8217; care.</p>

The professionals&#8217; concerns included ongoing shouting and swearing, escalating violence from the youngest child and resistance from the parents to professional support.  Unfortunately, at the contested Interim Care Order hearing, the father became highly distressed and collapsed clutching his chest and indicating he was experiencing chest pains. The father is known to have underlying physical health difficulties. He had previously spent time in hospital following a similar incident. The father received immediate assistance from the advocates, the court clerk, court security staff and the court&#8217;s first aid officer, pending the arrival of an ambulance. I am immensely grateful for the extraordinary and instantaneous efforts made by everyone concerned to ensure that the father received urgent assistance prior to him being taken to hospital, where he made a full recovery. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is well established that in the Family Court, intermediaries perform an extremely important function in ensuring a fair hearing for highly vulnerable people. Intermediaries are impartial communication specialists, whose primary responsibility is to facilitate and enable complete, coherent and accurate communication between all parties and to ensure the vulnerable person&#8217;s understanding and participation in the proceedings. This includes making an assessment and reporting to the Court, orally, in writing or both, about the communication needs of the vulnerable person and the steps that should be taken to meet those needs. It is well established that intermediaries can be invaluable in giving vulnerable parties a voice in the Family Justice system and in turn, providing them with equality of access to justice. It is important to appreciate that the intermediary is there to assist and advise the Judge. Intermediaries are expected to prevent miscommunication from arising during the hearing and to intervene actively when miscommunication may or is likely to have occurred or to be occurring. During the hearing, it is almost always necessary to allow regular breaks with sufficient time for the intermediary to explain to the vulnerable person what has happened and is about to happen (&#8216;explanation time&#8217;), in addition to time for a proper break (&#8216;rest time&#8217;).  Intermediaries have a discreet and important role and specialism. </p>

Unlike the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings, the inquisitorial, problem-solving nature of these care proceedings in the Family Court demanded that no form of adaptation to the Court process lesser than a &#8216;whole trial&#8217; intermediary order would suffice in the context of these parents&#8217; vulnerabilities, to ensure that they were not disadvantaged as a result of their cognitive, communication and learning disabilities. Such steps were in furtherance of Family Procedure Rule 1.1 and the overriding objective of enabling the Court to deal with the case justly, having regard to the welfare issues involved, including ensuring that the case was dealt with expeditiously and fairly and ensuring that the parties were on an equal footing. Such order was necessary, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, to uphold the essential principles that <span style="color:#333333">Courts must take all steps possible to ensure that people with a learning disability are able to actively participate in decisions affecting their lives and that the Court must take steps to ensure that there are no barriers to justice within the process itself. </span>On the facts of this case, there could be no proper justification for any alternative order directing the intermediaries to assist for only <span style="font-style:italic">part</span> of the process.</p>

The father was assessed as having considerable communication difficulties exacerbated by his inability to read and write. The mother too was assessed as having considerable communication difficulties, exacerbated by her diagnoses of depression and her learning disability. The parents&#8217; combined difficulties in communication included difficulty maintaining attention and concentration, difficulty recalling specific dates and times, limited auditory working memory capacity, difficulty understanding low frequency vocabulary and court-specific terminology, difficulty processing and reliably responding to complex questions, difficulty processing and retaining verbal information, difficulty understanding non-literal language, difficulty providing detailed narratives, difficulty processing written information, consistently processing sentences exceeding three key words, difficulty understanding and responding appropriately to grammatically complex questions including questions containing multiple-parts and tag questions, understanding unfamiliar figurative language, retaining large volumes of verbally presented information, reliably understanding written information and expressing themselves clearly.</p>

At the outset of the Final Hearing, the parties requested further time to engage in discussions. Over the course of the first day, the combined skill of counsel and the intermediaries, the Court checking at appropriate junctures as to the trajectory of those discussions, led to the Court being informed by the afternoon session that the parties had reached agreement on all aspects of the case, including threshold. The Court was informed that the parents did not oppose the making of Care Orders for the children and did not oppose the Local Authority&#8217;s care plans. Agreement was reached in respect of all aspects of contact. The Court was careful to ensure that the parents did not feel pressured into making concessions or reaching agreements relating to their children. The Court is confident in concluding that, with the benefit of counsel and the intermediaries, the parents understood the process and were fully and fairly engaged in that process. By being included in an effective manner in the process by which the Court came to make its decisions, this Court is confident that the prospect of the parents supporting the children&#8217;s future placements is enhanced, which ultimately is in the children&#8217;s best interest. </p>

Courts should approach such cases with a recognition of the possible barriers to appropriate support being provided to parents with learning disabilities. Parents with learning disabilities can often be &#8216;good enough&#8217; parents when provided with the ongoing emotional and practical support they need.&#160; The concept of &#8216;parenting with support&#8217; must underpin the way in which the courts and professionals approach parents with learning disabilities wherever possible.&#160; The competencies of parents with learning disabilities must not be judged against stricter criteria or harsher standards than other parents. The Court must take steps to ensure that there are no barriers to justice within the process itself.&#160; Parents must have meaningful and informed access to reports, time to discuss the reports and an opportunity to put forward their own views.&#160; The hearing should include special measures, including adequate breaks in sessions.&#160; The Court must be careful to ensure that the supposed inability of parents to change is not in fact due to the inability of the professionals involved to engage with the parents in appropriate terms.</span></p>

She is said to be doing well at school and is making progress academically. Her behaviour is described by the professionals as having rapidly changed since being in her interim foster placement. There are no longer concerns about her being aggressive, shouting and swearing. She has responded well to the boundaries and routines in place and is reported to be happy in her placement. She has asked to remain living there in the future. The Children's Guardian observed positive relationships between &#8216;O&#8217;, her carers and the two other children in the placement. She was observed to be happy and comfortable. She is reported to have stated that she likes her placement because there is no shouting. Each of the professionals concludes that the placement is providing her with stability and consistency and &#8216;O&#8217; is responding well to this. The Guardian concluded that &#8216;O&#8217; would benefit from that safe, stable environment for the rest of her childhood, to ensure she is able to develop into a healthy adult. The Guardian observed that, as the older child at home, &#8216;O&#8217; experienced more difficulties than her sister. She had been exposed to the difficult relationship between her parents, where at times she intervened by shouting and telling her father to stop. She reported being physically harmed by her father but subsequently retracted these allegations.

She has been assessed as functioning at the age of around 18-24 months. She is also echolalic. In her parents&#8217; care, her development was not being supported well, despite encouragement and professional input, including help to progress her to move out of nappies and to stop using a dummy. &#8216;Y&#8217; was not consistently taken to health appointments by her parents to manage her epilepsy in the way she needed. She experienced a number of seizures. Following the making of the Interim Care Order, &#8216;Y&#8217; was placed in a specialist residential placement where she lives with two other children who have additional needs. &#8216;Y&#8217; is reported to have settled well and to have a good relationship with her foster carers and with the other children in the placement, who also have additional needs and have been &#8216;matched&#8217; with each other. More recently, before and after contact with her parents, &#8216;Y&#8217;s behaviour is reported to have escalated, with increased swearing and distress, including scratching people and pulling their hair. She is reported to have said that she does not want to see her parents. However, when she spends time with them during contact, she is reported to be calm and interactive. Since being in her placement, there have been no other reported incidents of physical violence or swearing beyond those recent incidents prior to and after contact with her parents. &#8216;Y&#8217; is reported to be &#8216;doing well&#8217; and progressing with milestones such as toileting. She no longer uses a dummy and she sleeps through the night. She is reported to have experienced only one seizure since moving to foster care. There has also been a significant improvement in her speech and communication skills. She is making good progress in her specialist school provision, which she is reported to enjoy, where she understands her routines. </p>

He has diabetes, which is reported to have been poorly managed. He has difficulties with his mobility which in recent months appears to have become worse with him being more unsteady on his feet. He is reported to have some nerve damage in his spine. He is also having health checks completed in respect of his heart. He was noted by the Guardian to be engaging with health support more recently, following a background of previous poor engagement. </p>

They have both suffered from significant harm in the form of neglect and emotional harm, which could have a long-lasting impact upon them and their development. In the short period of time they have lived in interim Local Authority care during these proceedings, both children responded extremely well and have made significant progress in respect of their behaviour and development. As the Guardian noted, this demonstrates that with parenting that meets their needs, the children are able to attain their individual potential.</p>

Further, they engaged with the Court process even though this was plainly a distressing process for them. Each of the professionals notes that the parents have evidenced their love and commitment to the children and the parents have strived to make sure the children are aware of this. They miss their children dearly. The professionals acknowledge that both parents have been able to demonstrate some strengths in their parenting capacity. Contact between the children and their parents is also reported to be a positive experience generally for the children. To their credit, the parents had always been able to make sure the children attended school. Furthermore, the home conditions were reported always to be clean.</p>

The assessment highlighted that the parents are not able to meet all the needs of their children, even with professional support. Further, the parents have a limited support network outside the professional network. The Local Authority and the Children's Guardian conclude that, despite the parents&#8217; love for their children and their desire to care for them, the children could not return to their care safely, without experiencing further significant harm of the type they have suffered previously. The professionals agree that, if the children returned to their parent&#8217;s care, the children would experience further neglect, significant emotional harm and be at risk of physical harm.</p>

They have lived separately for the past five months, which has allowed them to have their individual needs met. The assessment identifies that neither child has been distressed by living separately from the other and there is little mention from either of them about the other.  The sibling relationship they share is described as difficult. The Guardian&#8217;s observation during contact, consistent with other professional observation, was that neither sister acknowledged each other, they did not greet each other and there was no attempt from them to play with each other. Their sibling relationship was described as complex and difficult, &#8220;characterised by violence and jealousy.&#8221; Nevertheless, the professionals recognise that if the children do not live together, it is important that they spend time together and that professional assistance is provided to help to nurture that relationship. In that regard, regular, structured sibling contact is envisaged to take place. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:-0.03in">Both children are thriving in their interim placements. The advantage for both children of making a Care Order with the plan of long-term foster care is that, given their individual and specific needs and profile, foster care has a strong likelihood of providing them with a stable, safe, nurturing environment throughout their minority where their individual needs can be met. In the case of &#8216;O&#8217;, such placement would also be consistent with her consistently expressed wish. The plain disadvantages of long term foster care include the ongoing involvement of the Local Authority throughout their childhoods and the interference with their private and family life. That interference is mitigated to some extent, with ongoing regular contact between the children and their parents and between the siblings, such that there is no severing of the parental relationship or birth family ties. </p>

The best person to bring up a child is the natural parent, provided the child's moral and physical health are not in danger. The State does not take away the children of all the people who suffer from physical or mental ill health.

In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the single conclusion reached by the Social Worker and the Children's Guardian is clear and convincing. Sympathetic as this Court is to these parents in the context of their vulnerabilities, it is essential that in reaching this decision the Court maintains focus on the welfare of the children as the Court&#8217;s paramount consideration. In the judgement of this Court, the individual welfare needs of both children demand the remedy of a Care Order, with the care plan of long term foster care. On the specific facts of this case, there is no other suitable course available which is in the best interests of either child, motivated by the overriding requirements pertaining to their welfare. Furthermore, the high degree of justification necessary under Article 8 is established. That interference is necessary and is a proportionate response, having regard to the risks and having regard to the welfare evaluation. </p>
