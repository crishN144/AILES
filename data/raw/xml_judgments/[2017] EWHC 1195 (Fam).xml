	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having concluded that A (the subject child) could not be returned to Pakistan pursuant to any order of the Family Court, in the light of his &#8216;refugee status&#8217; I made provision for this fact finding hearing to consider M&#8217;s allegations against F in order to inform future welfare decisions.   It is integral to the father&#8217;s case that M&#8217;s application for refugee status was predicated on false and / or exaggerated allegations.  Recognising the parameters of this Court&#8217;s authority, as analysed in my earlier judgment, the father wished to pursue his applications for both residence and contact (as an alternative).  F&#8217;s ambition, were I to conclude that A&#8217;s best interests required him to live with his father, was to take my conclusions back to the SSHD in the hope that they identified a dishonest application by the mother or, more generally, to identify material  which would cause the SSHD to revoke the grant of refugee status. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations brought by the mother have been extensively pleaded and responded to voluminously.  It had been submitted that, given my earlier decision, any application for residence by F was unarguable and should be prevented.  I declined to follow that submission, in part, for pragmatic reasons.  I was satisfied that whatever the nature of the order sought, the evidential material would be very much the same. More importantly however, I am resistant to denying any father a full opportunity to advance his case where the welfare of a child is in issue. </p>

As a consequence, HHJ Bromilow went on to order A&#8217;s return to Pakistan forthwith and by no later than 23.59 hrs on 5 April 2016. Mr McGavin was directed to meet with A to inform him of the decision. M applied to HHJ Bromilow for permission to appeal and also for a stay, which applications were refused and thereafter M applied to the Court of Appeal for the same relief. </p>

The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything (see </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">R v Lucas <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">).  The fact that someone has lied about something does not prove the reverse of that lie.  The lie must be viewed in the context of a wider canvas to determine what inference can legitimately be drawn from it.  Credibility generally is relevant not just to establishing the facts, but also to the evaluation of the welfare issues when considering risks and capability.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The jurisdictional questions having been resolved, this hearing, in essence, is a private law dispute between two separated parents.  There is an international complexion to it, in the sense that F lives in Pakistan and has attended this hearing, via video link, from there.  There are serious allegations made by M against F and allegations of physical abuse have also been made by A against his father.  Having heard the evidence I have found the unvarnished truth, at times, to be illusive.  I have reminded myself in the passages below that there may be a variety of reasons why people feel unable to provide a wholly honest and accurate account, notwithstanding the terms of the oath they take.  Here there are subtle concepts of family pride and loyalty which have to be negotiated.  Judges at all levels of the Family Justice system have become used to assessing them in the many multicultural cases that come before these Courts.  The process is inevitably imperfect but it requires the Judge to do the best he can to establish clear facts on the balance of probabilities.  </p>

I do not intend to be critical of those who have had responsibility for the preparation of this case.  Indeed I am quite certain that the lawyers concerned have addressed their task with diligence and great integrity.  However, the evidence is unbridled and unconstrained.  By way of illustration I need only point out that the mother&#8217;s most recent statement, filed on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017, is 102 pages in length.  Her earlier statement (13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015) is 108 pages.  The father, both when represented and more recently, as a litigant in person, has responded with similar prolixity.</p>

Mr Setright QC, on behalf of M, whose task it was to prosecute the allegations, found himself, inevitably, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the material.  He, entirely correctly in my judgement, elected to focus on those allegations which were key to establishing M&#8217;s case.  Mr Williams QC, on behalf of A, adopted a broadly similar approach.  Nonetheless, the case took 5 days of court hearing.  Had it not been reduced through the efforts of experienced leading counsel it might otherwise have been much longer.  I should also say that F is an intelligent, educated businessman who cooperated with these forensic objectives and displayed an easy facility with the electronic bundle.  </p>

The allegations relate to conduct between the parents at an earlier stage, either before T's birth or when he was much younger, and did not directly impact upon him with respect to contact. It may be that some would be relevant to the current and the future but that would need to be evaluated, and it is not plain to me from what we have been told by Mr Von Berg and Ms Huda that Judge Wulwik engaged in the process that the Practice Direction requires in deciding whether what is on the schedule of allegations is relevant to the issues which would be current in the subsequent welfare decision for the child.&#8221;</span></p>

More than any other feature of his evidence it was this period in F&#8217;s life that he was able to talk about with candour and detail.  Unusually for modern Muslim couples (so I was told) this couple remained engaged for 4 years.   F told me that the marriage was delayed in order that he &#8216;could establish himself&#8217;.  In his evidence he described how they had little money and so limited their entertainment to long walks, sometimes &#8216;on the beach&#8217;.  Frequently they would buy &#8216;street food&#8217; and eat outside.  When describing these small details to me F showed obvious pleasure.  This, he told me, was a very happy time in his life, his demeanour as he talked about it changed dramatically.  He seemed visibly more relaxed.   </p>

She told me that F had blamed his father for the death of his mother.  He described him as a bully who would beat his mother.  F was sent to Pakistan military school which M told me he described as a brutal and brutalising regime.  In his evidence F denied having said these things.  He told me that he enjoyed military school and had only positives to say about his father.  I do not accept his evidence on these points.  I see no reason why M should lie about them and even within F&#8217;s own written statements it is certainly plain that there were times in his adolescence when he did not get on well with his father.  However, I do not think F&#8217;s disavowal of his accounts to M cast much light on his credibility generally.  His father is now dead and I do not believe that F feels able to speak adversely about him.  Couples often speak intimately about their lives and families in the early stages of relationships and I have little difficulty in preferring M&#8217;s account, which resonates with the evidence more generally.  </p>

F denied that there was any problem at all.  He could see no reason why there should be.  Neither could he see why A might benefit from having a sibling.  It was clear to me that he is a man who struggles to understand others.  To some extent I think F recognises this short coming in himself but the extent of his self awareness is limited.  </p>

He told me how he had set creative homework for him, which they worked on together.  I accept this, indeed the mother does not dispute it.   F was, however, unable to communicate to me anything of A&#8217;s personality or character.  I do not believe, that in this respect, he was being evasive in any way.  It was, I consider, simply that F has very little understanding of his son.  He could not see, for example, how if A were to be returned to Pakistan now it might cause him distress, to leave his friends, his school where he is evidently thriving and a pattern of life where he is, according to the CAFCASS officer, now very settled.  Nor could F really accept in any instinctive or intuitive way that A is very closely attached to his mother and would be distressed if separated from her.  F told me that in comparison to their life in Pakistan, M and A were now living &#8216;like beggars&#8217; supported by the English state.  It had not occurred to him that his continued failure to provide financially for his son might also be viewed as controlling behaviour.  Mr Williams QC and Ms Renton, on behalf of A, identified F as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;able to shut down his emotional response&#8217;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M contends that between 2011 and 2014 F displayed explosive temper and was regularly physically violent to her.  In his cross examination F avoided, entirely, engaging with any of the specific details of the allegations against him.  His approach was to seek out inconsistency of whatever weight and cogency, in order to undermine M&#8217;s credibility as a witness.  He was in some instances successful in this technique.  I do not believe that M has given a wholly accurate description of this unhappy marriage either.  What however remained from M&#8217;s evidence was a coherent, internally consistent account that unified the evidence as a whole.  By contrast F offered no alternative narrative, confining him self predominately to simple denial.  It is important that I record that his command of English is excellent and he was often insistent on forensic precision.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no technique by which a Judge may unassailably determine disputed facts.  The Court simply has to rely on established techniques, looking for e.g. consistency, coherence, external support and detail.  At the same time there must be an evaluation of the witness&#8217;s demeanour, in simple terms, how he or she presents in the witness box.  What is particularly striking about M&#8217;s allegations is her capacity to record detail.  She alleges, for example, that as long ago as December 2011, her parents were invited to F&#8217;s family for dinner.  It did not go well and during the course of it M asserts that she was pushed and slapped by F.  Though it had not been recounted in her statement I asked her, somewhat tangentially, who had prepared the food and what it was.  She was able to tell me spontaneously about the entire menu.  In response F said there was indeed a dinner, it all went very well, there was no fight.   He was unable to say more.  Once again I found M&#8217;s spontaneous capacity for detail to be supportive of her account. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2013 when the couple were living in Saudi Arabia, M told me that it was F&#8217;s habit occasionally to come home for lunch.  She told me that he would often enter the house extremely quietly, something that plainly unnerved her and she believed was intended to.  She had formed the view that he wanted to sneak up on her.  M told me that this particular afternoon a row developed and F pushed her deliberately along the tiled floor.  He did so, she said, with such force that her foot was fractured.   M described how she told A, at the time, that F had caused her injury.  She was very clear that she did not keep anything from her son, as others in these circumstances sometimes try to do.  When asked whether she might have been placing an adult burden on her 7 year old child, she seemed unable to comprehend the point.  There is a naivety to her account which, in my judgement, belies a tendency on M&#8217;s part (which I have seen elsewhere in her evidence) to funnel her emotional energy into her son, which strikes me as sometimes putting her needs over his.  This said, her candour here only serves to enhance the reliability of her account.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In another allegation, settled upon by Mr Setright, M told me that F had a cousin who was killed in circumstances arising from an infidelity in the course of marriage.  F accepted that there had been such a killing but purported to have no knowledge of the reasons behind it.  It is plain that this incident profoundly disturbed M.  It, in my assessment, developed in her a sense of her own fragility.  She told me that F would often threaten to kill her.  Whilst the family were together in Saudi Arabia M states that F told her that he had sought advice from a Dar Ul Aloom on a suitable punishment for her as he believed she was having an affair.  M&#8217;s evidence was that F told her that he had obtained an edict that she would be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;subject to lashes or killed&#8217;</span>.  As I understand M&#8217;s evidence, she took this seriously enough to make her own enquiries of the Dar Ul Aloom.  F contends this is simply made up.  Again I accept M&#8217;s evidence.  It is rooted in an established fact (i.e. F&#8217;s continuing belief that M had an affair), it is characterised by detail and it is consistent with M&#8217;s narrative of her marriage.  By contrast it is met by F&#8217;s simple and blanket denial.</p>

M said that F became convinced that she was having an affair but, entirely to her surprise, became much nicer to her and far more solicitous at least for some time.  I watched her carefully as she described this and it struck me that she had no greater understanding now than she did at the time why F responded as he did.  I do not believe that I have heard a true account of this relationship from either M or F.  M denies there was any affair. However, F produced an email, dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2012, addressed to his email account.

It also echoes my own observations, earlier in the judgment, that F seemed proud to have an educated and attractive wife but recoiled from physical intimacy.  The author of this email appears to have taken a very similar view.  M refuses to engage with any of this.  She denies categorically that there was any affair.  However, it is very clear that she had formed a relationship with a man who admired her, in whom she confided but by whom she feels compromised.   In the light of what I have said above about M it may be that to acknowledge this relationship would also be seen by her as compromising her own safety and reputation.  </p>

She was equally respectful about his family.  Having considered the contents of the email and M&#8217;s responses I am satisfied that this was not an adulterous relationship though I am equally sure that M has not been frank about it.  To the extent that M seeks to insinuate that the email may be a document fabricated by F, I entirely reject that.  Not least because its content is of an emotional complexion far beyond F&#8217;s ability to forge.  As Mr Williams points out, the email does not say that M loved the author, nor is it asserted that they were in love.  This also struck me as telling.  I have formed the impression that at this point in her life M wanted security and safety for herself and her child to the exclusion of any other emotional feelings.  </p>

I find that she did not conceal this from her son and, in any event, I am satisfied that no party took any measure to protect A from the adults conflict in this household.  Thus, it is entirely unnecessary for me to consider the extent to which A&#8217;s recollection, now aged 11, of an incident which occurred 4 or 5 years ago in Saudi Arabia, is accurate or reliable.  Moreover, such a finding might only stand as an obstacle to any future relationship between A and his father.   </p>

In a case where the families are so divided, I must regard her account with a healthy degree of scepticism.  What struck me however, was the extent to which her evidence lacked drama or embellishment.  She told me that F was quick to anger and had locked A in the washroom on one particular occasion. If she were determined to lie, in a partisan way, one might have thought she would have fabricated an account rather more damning than this.  The significance of Ms Majid&#8217;s evidence is that it resonates with M&#8217;s account, A&#8217;s own complaint and my own impression of F.  He is quick to anger and easily irritated.  Indeed, F revealed something of his predisposition to become irritated in his cross examination of Ms Majid. </p>

Almost all this aspiration is focused on academic achievement and, it strikes me, that F was at times, simply too hard on his son.  I do not know whether F threatened to send A to the Pakistan Army or to fight as a jihadi.  Sometimes otherwise loving parents say stupid things.  What I am clear about however, and what it is important for A to know is that F would, in my judgement, never carry out such threats. The real harm to A in consequence of F&#8217;s actions was his prolonged exposure to physically and emotionally bullying behaviour (towards his mother) and a home life which was lived in a corrosive atmosphere of parental conflict.  </p>
