The LA applied for Interim Supervision Orders in respect of the children. No change was proposed to the interim arrangements which were governed by the written agreement which the parents had signed months before the issue of proceedings. The Court determined that the interim threshold was made out on the basis of the allegation that B had caused injury to Z&#8217;s genital area. No public law order was made at that hearing, by agreement between the parties. There has never been cause, throughout these lengthy proceedings, for that decision to be reviewed. The children have therefore, with the exception of a few days in foster care in July 2023 and the following week with a maternal aunt on holiday, remained in the care of A where they are thriving. They see their father regularly and no difficulties or concerns have been reported with that contact or the adherence to the written agreement which governs it. </p>

Lord Nicholls was not laying down any rule of law. There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one's reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.&#8217;</span></p>

As to the seriousness of the allegation, there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent's Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions' enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog. </span></p>

It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what has happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it. The inherent improbability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied.&#8217;</span></p>

Where the "lie" has a prominent or central relevance to the case such a self-direction is plainly sensible and good practice.  100 &#8230; In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt."</span></p>

If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe X or Y on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness's reliability of recall on a particular issue.</span></p>

In these circumstances, I venture to suggest that it would be good practice when the tribunal is invited to proceed on the basis , or itself determines, that such a direction is called for, to seek Counsel's submissions to identify: (i) the deliberate lie(s) upon which they seek to rely; (ii) the significant issue to which it/they relate(s), and (iii) on what basis it can be determined that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. The principles of the direction will remain the same, but they must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the witness before the court.&#8221;</span></p>

This Court has considered appeals based on failures to comply with the Guidance on a number of occasions in recent years, most recently in Re JB, supra. For present purposes, the key point is that made by MacDonald J in Re P, endorsed in Re JB, and recited above. Significant departures from the Guidance are likely to result in reduced, and in extreme cases no, weight being attached to the interview. It is for the judge to consider the interviews, and the extent to which they comply with or depart from Guidance, in the context of all the other evidence. The approach of the appellate court to this exercise is no different from every other appeal against findings of fact. The assessment of evidence, and the apportionment of weight to be attached to each piece of evidence, are matters for the judge at first instance. An appeal court will only interfere with findings of fact by trial judges where there is a very clear justification for doing so.&#8221;</span></p>

He was also concerned that, if there had been an injury identified, the pool of possible perpetrators was significantly wider than seemed to be being looked at by NSC. Dr L  was worried that Z was being placed at risk of significant harm by this approach and he felt, as per the guidelines to him as a professional person where a safeguarding issue had been raised in relation to a child, that he should raise the issue with the relevant authorities.

She told me that if the images are of poor quality that should be recorded on the peer review, and it was not in this case. Her recollection was that she had seen a lot worse in terms of the quality of images and the images of the second examination had been good. The first set of images were good enough for the people present to see what they thought might be findings. Z was wriggling quite a lot on the first examination but those present at the peer review were able to see something at 3 o&#8217;clock. All persons present at the peer review have a chance to say what they think and what they can see on the images: the examining doctor then states her own view.

She told me that it was difficult to say on the available evidence because there was no clarity about the extent or the depth of that injury. If it was a small laceration, it might only produce small amounts of blood which might still be apparent to a carer. If it had been a larger injury, then it would have bled a lot more. Soiled nappies might have hidden any bleeding from the genital area, but it was still possible for blood to be seen because the soiling of a nappy is towards the rear of that garment. Dr Teebay was reluctant to speculate on how a child might react on this injury being caused to her genital area. </p>

This is more than just a technical breach of guidelines: the failure to record, at anything like the time of the examination, a set of observations about the appearance of the laceration to Z&#8217;s hymen, is a significant issue and one which has to call in to question the reliability of those later observations. Of course, Dr Teebay did not see either the red raw edge or the white slough in her viewing of the images and whilst it was Dr R&#8217;s position that she could see them on the video, she accepted that they may not have been visible to someone who had not conducted the examination. </p>

He spoke with X alone and asked him about the events of the Sunday evening when Z was at his home. These answers were extracted by the use of open questions, Mr McAteer said. X stated that his mother and Y had gone to get the cot for Z but that he had not gone with them. He played on his Playstation and his father was in the bath. The Playstation is in the living room: Mr McAteer could not help with whether X routinely played on it with headphones or not. Z had been sleeping. X had gone on to say that he heard a mumbling from Z who was upstairs, and he went upstairs and tiptoed quietly into the room to see her. X said his father was still in the bath. Mr McAteer said that nothing in X&#8217;s account made him feel that it had been rehearsed and he felt it was a genuine account of X&#8217;s recall of that evening. X&#8217;s account was itself consistent with what A had told Mr McAteer about the evening, namely that Z had been asleep when she left the home and she found her in the same position when she returned, asleep. </p>

I do not reference that by way of criticism of C but rather an acknowledgement that A&#8217;s feelings about the process and C&#8217;s central involvement in it are understandable. </p>

There does not appear to be any other outward sign of pain: C did not report Z to have been crying or otherwise upset at this point. Z also complained of pain when being held by C when she was carrying her away from the SARC medical with her nappy on. I remind myself of Dr Teebay&#8217;s evidence about complaints of pain from young children and of the evidence which suggests that Z had runny stools and foul-smelling nappies at this time. It is difficult to attribute, with clarity, general complaints of pain to any specific issue. </p>

It contends that this was a spontaneous allegation made to a trusted carer in C. However, there are two parts of this allegation which are not relied upon by the LA: that B used [redacted name&#8217;s] clippers to hurt Z and that A was somehow aware of what was happening and said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">no no no&#8217;</span>. The former would have been totally impossible because [redacted] is the adult child of the foster carers and her clippers, whatever that word meant, were not anywhere near to Z at the relevant time. Neither has it been suggested to any witness that there was an alternative interpretation of what Z was trying to say in using this phrase or what she might have been trying to impart. </p>

In my view the presence of those statements serves as an important reminder of what the Court is dealing with. These are the reported words of a toddler undergoing a significant period of emotional transition and a degree of disruption in her life. Much has been made of Z&#8217;s capabilities with language and her ability to identify people using clear words. Yet she said two very significant things in her first set of allegations which are demonstrably untrue. I exercise real caution about a heavy reliance on Z&#8217;s remarks to C on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023, although of course they fall to be considered in the wider canvas of evidence and are certainly not dismissed entirely. </p>

I don&#8217;t doubt that Z said to D<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;uncle daddy touched my [unclear] bottom&#8217;</span> and this was reported to E at the time and was D&#8217;s clear evidence to the court. Z was not distressed when she said this and gave no context to her remarks but carried on playing. It could well be that this repetition is as a result of Z remembering something that had happened to her that weekend. Equally, she could simply be recalling and repeating what she had said the day before. </p>

Ms Anning put directly to B that he heard Z cry out, he got out of the bath, went to her room and lifted her out of her travel cot, took her in to the bathroom, undressed her (including sleeping bag, pyjamas and nappy), abused her to cause injury to her genitals and then redressed her and placed her back in her travel cot in a position which A said was exactly the same position in which she had left her.

However, it is not just the moment of assault that falls to be considered but all that must have led to it:  Z had woken or been woken from sleep (both of which would have been unusual), had been taken into the bathroom and undressed (at least partially) and then abused in her genital area. She had then been redressed and put back into her cot bed. The notion that a child of Z&#8217;s age who had been subjected to all of those acts would have made no sound at all that would have been audible to X who was very alert to Z&#8217;s wellbeing is extremely unlikely in my judgement. When X checked on Z, she had mumbled but was settled by the time he saw her. The LA&#8217;s contention that this was Z <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;comforting herself after the assault&#8217; </span>is a rather unattractive attempt to make the reliable X&#8217;s evidence fit the LA&#8217;s theory of what happened that evening. </p>

Z had a short shower in the bath before getting ready to leave with C that morning. There is no evidence of B being anxious about Z or concerned that she might tell A or the children about something that had happened to her the evening before. B knew that Z was about to spend her last days in the care of C and D before being placed with A&amp;B permanently very shortly after this weekend. </p>
