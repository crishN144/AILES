	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The background to the case is tragic.  K&#8217;s birth mother was born and brought up in Country A. His father was a British citizen.  The father and birth mother met in Country A where the father was working, and K was born there.  When K was very young, his birth mother killed his father in circumstances which are set out in some detail in the court documents that have been disclosed from the criminal proceedings in Country A.  I will not set out the details here, but they were horrific as the murder was planned, involved others, and was carried out for financial gain.  After a trial mother was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, and her appeal was dismissed.  There are detailed judgments from both the court of first instance and the Court of Appeal in that jurisdiction, which I have read. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">K was placed in an orphanage where he remained for several months.  The applicants, who are members of the father&#8217;s family, went to Country A to apply for custody and permission to bring him to this country.  There were court proceedings there, which led ultimately to the birth mother accepting that she was not in a position to care for K.   She entered into an agreement, which was ratified by the court, to relinquish custody and parental responsibility in favour of the applicants, and that they could bring him up in this country. </span></p>

Proceedings were brought in this country and he was made a Ward of Court, with care and control granted to the applicants.

Parental responsibility which exists under the law of the State of the child&#8217;s habitual residence subsists after a change of that habitual residence to another State (Article 16(3)).  It is notable that there is no reference here to the termination of parental responsibility. Article 4 provides that the Convention does not apply to decisions on adoption or measures preparatory to it.  Whilst the decision as to parental responsibility may not have been part of a decision on adoption or a measure preparatory to it, (if it was, the Convention would not apply under Article 4), the provisions of Article 16 do not apply to cases where parental responsibility has been terminated by judicial intervention. </span></p>

In her skeleton argument Ms Reed for the applicant submitted that the effect of the order was that the mother had no parental responsibility in English law, and that there was no requirement to join her as a party. Ms Daly, for the local authority submitted that because there is no provision in English law to terminate a mother&#8217;s parental responsibility that the court should take a cautious approach. </span></p>

Parental responsibility under the law of Country A is defined very much as it is here. The mother and K were domiciled and habitually resident there at the time of the making of the order and the mother was legally advised at the time she gave her consent.  The reasons for her doing so were overwhelming and in the best interests of the child, and the order made and acted upon many years ago.  The fact that there is no corresponding provision here to terminate a mother&#8217;s parental responsibility should not mean that that a decision to that effect in another country cannot be recognised if there are no reasons of public policy reasons to the contrary.  There is no doubt that the court would have been able to recognise an order terminating a father&#8217;s parental responsibility and it would seem anomalous if the same principle could not apply to a mother in these circumstances. </span></p>

The applicants believe that notification to the mother poses a risk of harm to K, both physical and emotional.  The murder of the father was premeditated and for financial gain, and was carried out by the mother with other relatives and the assistance of a &#8216;hit man&#8217;. The applicants fear that notifying the mother could lead to K being traced by people who wish to gain financially from him and/or cause him harm. They also fear that notifying the mother will affect K emotionally. He suffered great trauma in his early life as a result of his mother&#8217;s crimes, spending several months in an orphanage whilst proceedings about his future took place. The applicants secured the services of an eminent expert, Dr. Dora Black, to advise them how to ameliorate the emotional harm caused to him.  K has flourished with the exceptional care and loving security he has been provided with by the applicants and wider paternal family, but he remains vulnerable, suffering from an episode of depression in early 2020.</span></p>
