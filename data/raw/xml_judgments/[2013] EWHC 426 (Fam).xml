At the hearing on 14 February 2013, as well as considering the court bundle, both applicants gave oral evidence and I heard submissions from the applicants, Ms Logan and the parental order reporter. I made the parental order and gave brief reasons but indicated that full reasons would follow in this judgment.</p>

They set out in their written and oral evidence that this move was intended by them both to be a permanent move. They sold their home in America and severed all financial ties with America. A had an automatic right of entry as an EU citizen and B entered as a family member. The domestic partnership is recognised in this jurisdiction as a civil partnership pursuant to the provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 215 (1)</ref>, 212 (1) and Schedule 20 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Partnership Act 2004</ref>.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The primary reason given by both applicants for making their permanent home here is founded on the legal recognition and protection of same sex partnerships. They wanted to start a family and wanted to ensure they raised their child in a jurisdiction that was tolerant and protective for such families. They considered a number of options. A said same sex partnerships are not recognised in Poland and same sex couples are not allowed to adopt. He has not lived or visited there for over 13 years and has no family or other connections there. He was very concerned about the attitudes to same sex couples there and B does not speak Polish. They considered moving to other States in America, but as a civil partner of a US Citizen A is unable to become a permanent resident or citizen as the U.S. Government prohibits same sex couples from federal benefits such as immigration, tax equality and health care. In oral evidence A said they considered Canada as well but there were restrictions on the entry requirements. It was in this context they decided in 2008 to move to England and cut all ties with America, save for visiting their family.</p>

Following DNA testing to establish C&#8217;s biological connection with B, C was issued with a U.S. Passport. It was not necessary for entry clearance to be obtained to return to this jurisdiction as both the applicants had residency status here and C was treated as a family member of an EEA citizen exercising freedom of movement in the EU. The applicants returned to this jurisdiction in April with C and applied to the UKBA for confirmation of C&#8217;s residency status. This was granted on 23 January 2013.</p>

Their application for a parental responsibility order for A was made on 25 May 2012.

It is uncertain whether he gave up his domicile of origin when he moved to America. He was under 18 years and the precise details of the move are not entirely clear. The circumstances surrounding the move from America to this jurisdiction are much clearer. There was a strong motivation to move here permanently, connected to the legal framework that exists in this jurisdiction in relation to same sex couples and his wish to ensure their child was brought up in an environment that did not discriminate or was intolerant to such family arrangements. The decision he reached to move here was carefully thought out and planned. His statement and oral evidence makes clear he retains no ties with Poland, either through family, friends or property. He has not lived, or visited, for a number of years and has no intention of ever returning to live there, he wants to remain living here permanently. He has made his life here and intends to apply for British citizenship as soon as he is eligible to. In oral evidence he gave more details about his integration here, which I accept. They run their business from home, see A&#8217;s cousin and her son regularly and have a circle of friends who live in the area. </span></p>

His written evidence sets out what he considered to be the intolerance to same sex relationships in the State of Tennessee, including proposed legislation that would make it unlawful to provide any instruction or material in schools that discusses sexual orientation other than heterosexuality. Following the registration of their domestic partnership in California they found, when they returned to live in Memphis, they could not live openly as a couple as it would have put B&#8217;s job at risk. In addition, A was ineligible for any benefits through B&#8217;s job or to be included in A&#8217;s healthcare. A considered, with B, moving to other more tolerant States but B was still denied a range of federal benefits. Together with A the decision to move permanently to the United Kingdom was a planned thought out decision. He sets out in his statement the considerations that provided the powerful motivation for this decision, in particular the legal recognition of their domestic partnership and the legal protection to prevent discrimination if they had a family. In his oral evidence, which I accept, he confirmed that this move was permanent, lifelong and he had no intention of returning to live in America.

It is conceded that this payment is for more than expenses reasonably incurred. Therefore, consideration needs to be given as to whether the court should exercise its discretion to authorise that payment pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54 (8)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>. In exercising that discretion the court needs to take into account a number of matters, including whether the applicants have acted in good faith and without moral taint in their dealings with the surrogate mother; whether the applicants were party to any attempts to defraud the authorities (per </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Hedley J Re X and Y <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 FLR 733" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 FLR 733</ref> at paragraph 21</span><span style="color:#000000">). The court also needs to be alert to public policy considerations to ensure that commercial surrogacy arrangements were not used to (a) circumvent childcare laws in this country, so as to result in the approval of arrangements in favour of people who would not have been approved as parents under any set of existing arrangements in this country; (b) not to be involved in anything that looked like the simple payment for effectively buying children overseas; (c) to ensure that sums of money that might look modest in themselves were not in fact of such substance that they overbore the will of a surrogate. Although as Hedley J noted in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re L (Commercial Surrogacy) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/3146" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 3146 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 3146 (Fam)</ref> </span><span style="color:#000000">the court&#8217;s paramount consideration is the welfare of the child (pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>), therefore it will only be in the clearest case of the abuse of public policy that the court will be able to withhold an order, if otherwise welfare considerations support the order being made.

The agreement with the respondent and payments to her were through a third party and the agreement is legal in India. The parental order reporter details in her report her enquiries made with the clinic in India, which enables her to conclude that she is satisfied with the propriety and legality of the arrangements that were entered into. Whilst the level of payment is worth considerably more in India than elsewhere there is no evidence to suggest that it overbore the will of the respondent, or in any other way put undue pressure on her. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the court should exercise its discretion and authorise the payment to the respondent.</span></p>

It is then necessary to consider the welfare of C, which is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration taking into account the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A and B have set out their circumstances and plans for C&#8217;s care in their statements. The parental order reporter has visited their home on three occasions. She describes the applicants as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;utterly committed to meeting his [C&#8217;s] needs and providing him with the best opportunities throughout his life&#8230;..They are extremely child focussed and interact with C constantly. He experiences much emotional warmth and positive reinforcement&#8217;.</span> This assessment was wholeheartedly supported by enquires she made with the health visitor who said she had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;absolutely no concerns&#8217;</span> about C. The parental order reporter has discussed with the applicants how they will share C&#8217;s birth history and origins, she describes their approach and attitude to this, and the issues that may lay ahead, as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;open, positive, educated and child-focussed&#8217;.</span> Her report recommends a parental order should be made. I agree with her detailed analysis of the issues. C&#8217;s welfare demands that he has life long security and stability. That welfare need requires an order that will secure his legal relationship with the applicants. This can only be achieved by a parental order, which is the order I shall make in favour of the applicants. </p>
