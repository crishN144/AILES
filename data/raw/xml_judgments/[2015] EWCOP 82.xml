At that time, I was not living in close proximity to my mother, was working a lot of hours and had other commitments. I did not think it would be in my mother&#8217;s best interests for me to be appointed as her deputy. I therefore did not oppose the Council&#8217;s application.</p>

I am able to visit her at least once a fortnight, which is certainly more often than anybody from the Council.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.25in">I have made enquiries with the Council on numerous occasions in order to try to establish that things are currently arranged in the most favourable way possible for my mother, but have been unable to obtain any information due to my current lack of legal authority. The Council also appear to be quite disorganised in dealing with such enquiries and this has led me to be concerned about the Council&#8217;s ability to act on her behalf. Whilst the Council are no doubt providing accounts to the court and are required to act in my mother&#8217;s best interests at all times, I am concerned that, due to their case load, they do not have sufficient time to dedicate to each individual matter and cannot fully take into account in any detail my mother&#8217;s individual personal circumstances and be proactive in their decision making on her behalf.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.25in">One matter of particular concern to me is that the Council are planning to sell a property which my mother has inherited from my sister. The property is in a poor state of repair following my sister&#8217;s death, as she died in the property and her body was not discovered for two months. My mother will be inheriting my sister&#8217;s entire estate under the intestacy laws, but it has been very difficult to deal with the estate with the Council acting as my mother&#8217;s deputy. I incurred significant costs myself in making arrangements following my sister&#8217;s death, including paying the funeral expenses, arranging for the central heating to be fixed at the property, replacing the doors and getting the property cleaned once my sister&#8217;s body had been removed. However, I found that the Council were not very cooperative in making arrangements for me to be reimbursed from the estate, even when the estate received a payment from an insurance company. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.25in">The current estimated value of the property is &#163;149,000. I am a builder and have estimated that the cost of carrying out the necessary repair and refurbishment works is likely to be in the region of &#163;35,000, following which the value of the property would be enhanced to &#163;220,000. I have contacted the Council and offered to fund the works myself in order that the property value can be increased before a sale takes place. However, the Council have indicated, without explanation, that they do not wish to pursue this option. I fail to see how it cannot be in my mother&#8217;s best interests to obtain the best possible price for the property as this would help to secure her future financial position, thereby ensuring her security of occupation at the care home where she currently resides. In addition, I am concerned that the condition of the property is continuing to deteriorate as the Council are not dealing with essential repairs and maintenance. The house is getting damp due to a leak and one of the neighbours is seeking to take part of the garden. Therefore, the value of the property may continue to drop. Again, I would be willing to take responsibility for maintaining the property until a sale in order to protect the value for my mother, but am not prepared to do so if the Council will not arrange reimbursement in due course.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.25in">Whilst I accept that it was in my mother&#8217;s best interests for the Council to be appointed as deputy in 2013, when no individual family member was able to fulfil that role, now that I am able to be involved, I feel that it would be in her interests for a family member also to be appointed so that we can be more &#8216;hands on&#8217; and proactive in managing things on her behalf. My mother has six living children and I feel that it would be beneficial to her for one of us, with our personal knowledge of her, to act with the Council in making sure that any arrangements made are as advantageous to her as possible. The Council simply does not have the capacity to be as actively involved in my mother&#8217;s affairs as is necessary to protect her and her financial position. </p>

Then, from the point of view of the local authority the benefit of that procedure is that the pension is obtained and not lost, and the rights of the local authority are preserved in the same way as creditors would be preserved under the ordinary jurisdiction in mental cases.

Because Joan is comfortably ensconced in a care home, I consider that four visits should be sufficient for him to comply with his duties as deputy. If he wishes to visit her more frequently, then he should do so gratuitously, as one would hope that any loving son would do gladly. </p>
