In light of this, I gave the Crown the opportunity to intervene.  In September 2023 it exercised its right to do so.  I therefore joined the Secretary of State for Justice as a Second Respondent pursuant to section 5 HRA 1998 and rule 29.5(4) Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;). The Secretary of State instructed Mr Cross.  The application was re-listed.</span></p>

In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Akhter v Khan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> a Muslim couple had celebrated an Islamic marriage ceremony (Nikah) conducted by an Imam in the United Kingdom in 1998.  The parties had apparently intended to follow this with a civil marriage ceremony, but this never happened; it was accepted that they knew that the Nikah was of no legal effect.  The parties lived together for eighteen years, and had four children.  When the relationship broke down, the &#8216;wife&#8217; presented a petition for divorce and consequently sought financial relief.  She accepted that the Nikah was not a marriage, but she argued that the fact that the parties went through the Nikah enabled her to claim that this was a &#8216;void&#8217; marriage which was susceptible to a decree of nullity.  Williams J accepted this argument, and granted the decree of nullity, taking what he himself described as a &#8220;flexible approach&#8221; (see [69] of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment) to the interpretation of section 11(a)(iii) MCA 1973 (a marriage entered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage: see above), </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">having regard to the &#8216;wife&#8217;s&#8217; rights under Article 8 and Article 12 of the ECHR</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

(Marriage under Marriage Schedule) did not create a marriage, even a void marriage for the purposes of section 11(a)(iii) of the MCA 1973.  The parties were therefore not entitled to a decree of nullity.  Importantly for present purposes, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the ECHR could not be relied upon to support any departure from that construction since the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8) and the right to marry (Article 12), and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions (A1P1) were not engaged by the State&#8217;s failure to accede to an application for a decree of nullity.</span></p>

AP seeks formal recognition and/or legal acknowledgement of the status of the marriage, and of the ability to form a new marriage (which, he argues, is captured by Article 12 and/or Article 8).  It is argued that the State owes a &#8216;positive obligation&#8217; to facilitate the grant of a nullity decree in circumstances such as these; in this regard, Mr Tabori picked up the argument relying on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Hamer v UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (1979) 4 EHRR 139 (&#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Hamer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;) in which it was said that &#8220;positive action is required &#8230; to make the rights effective&#8221; (in this case, the right of prisoners to marry: see [68]) and that, in that case, the State&#8217;s failure to make administrative arrangements to enable a prisoner to marry constituted an interference with the exercise of the Article 12 right of the complainant prisoner.  Mr Tabori argues that the delay of three weeks while the registrar considered the documents generated from the 2018 proceedings represented an &#8220;unreasonable restriction&#8221; of AP&#8217;s right to marry; in this regard he relies on the comment at [106] from the ECtHR judgment in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">VK v Croatia</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (App. No. 38380/08); [2013] 2 FLR 1045 (&#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">VK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;).

In other words there is no &#8220;possession&#8221;. In order to qualify as a &#8220;possession&#8221;, a &#8220;legitimate expectation&#8221; must be, inter alia, a &#8220;currently enforceable claim that was sufficiently established&#8221; in domestic law and is &#8220;of a nature more concrete than mere hope&#8221;: see e.g. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Kopecky v Slovakia</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (2005) 41 EHRR 43.

Any difference in treatment (assuming AP could prove it) would not be on the basis that he is transgender, but instead on the ground that AP did not have the characteristic(s) entitling a person to a decree of nullity in the remaining categories.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In resolving the wide range of arguments which have been so skilfully marshalled before me, I have first considered whether AP can be said to be a &#8216;victim&#8217; as that term is understood, in the context of section 7(1)/(7) HRA 1998.  As I earlier remarked (&#167;38), the claim that he was/is a &#8216;direct&#8217; victim was only tentatively presented by AP&#8217;s counsel.  The witness statement (see &#167;12 above) was couched in correspondingly hesitant terms (&#8220;we may want to obtain a decree.. we may need a nullity order&#8221;).  Of course, as it turns out AP and JP have been able to marry without having in their hands a decree of nullity; there was no legal impediment to them doing so, and there is no evidence that the 2024 marriage will not be universally recognised.   Now that they are married, they have all the rights available to each other under Part II of the MCA 1973.  There is therefore no proper basis on which I can conclude that AP is a &#8216;direct&#8217; victim of any alleged unlawful act under the ECHR.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In this regard, I am similarly not persuaded that AP &#8216;runs the risk&#8217; in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Norris</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Shortall </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">terms (see </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">39 and </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">41 above respectively) of being a victim, so as to bring himself within section 7(1)/(7) HRA 1998.  In order for AP to be able to claim to be a potential victim, he was obliged to produce reasonable and convincing evidence of the likelihood of a violation affecting him personally; &#8220;mere suspicion or conjecture is insufficient in this respect&#8221; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Shortall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, above </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">41, at [48]).  In my judgment, AP has failed to adduce evidence or argument which gets close to this.   He has no case for asserting that the General Register Office will not accept that the 2009 marriage is void; it does recognise this.  Moreover, he has no claim for financial relief arising from the void marriage; now that he is lawfully married to JP, he has full access to Part II MCA 1973, thus he runs no risk of being barred from access to a financial remedy in the event of marital breakdown.  Were he and JP to divorce, and either of them launch a financial remedy claim under Part II MCA 1973, the court when considering &#8216;duration&#8217; of the 2024 marriage as one of the discretionary factors under section 25(2)(d) MCA 1973, would be bound to take into account the fact that the parties had previously been through a ceremony of marriage in 2009, believing thereafter that they had been lawfully married.  After all, it is well known in matrimonial jurisprudence that even a period of settled and committed cohabitation can be, and is not uncommonly, considered in this regard.  </span></p>

For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must&#160;be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.""</span></p>
