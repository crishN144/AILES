Almost immediately, the parents were in conflict with the Local&#160;Authority, believing, as they did, that it was the Local&#160;Authority's responsibility wholly to provide for the family.  The father's extreme behaviour was exhibited as early as 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;May&#160;2014 when he threatened to jump into the river off a bridge together with the children if a new house and financial assistance to the level he sought was not provided.</span></p>

As at this stage there were no concerns about the parents' general abilities to provide the children with good enough care, and it was anticipated that a reasonable working relationship could be achieved.  Not only did this prove not to be the case, but the parents used their children as a means to put pressure on the Local&#160;Authority to give them more money with wholly callous disregard for their emotional wellbeing.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The judge's judgment sets out the background and makes extensive findings of fact.  The parents' strategies, amongst other things, included using the children directly to demand money, as well as keeping them off school and even hiding them in cupboards in order to prevent social workers from seeing or talking to the children.  The most serious matter occurred in 2015 when the parents coached M to make, what are now accepted to be, wholly false allegations of physical and sexual abuse directed at the school and social workers.  This, inevitably, resulted in a full investigation and the involvement of the police, including the arrangement of an intimate child protection medical for M, although the parents, in fact, failed to take her to the appointment.</span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The father maintained these very serious allegations at trial, although he now accepts the finding made by the judge that the allegations were wholly fabricated.  Mr.&#160;Amin on behalf of the father in accepting this to be the case, says that the parents were motivated by a misguided notion that such allegations would help them to achieve their aim of somehow stopping the professionals at the children's school from asking about the welfare of the children.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:14pt">By May 2015, there were, understandably, very serious concerns about the children.  Not only were the social workers unable to see the children at home, but P's attendance at school was falling away, his behaviour was deteriorating, and M had been removed from nursery.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Local&#160;Authority's view is that the children suffered significant emotional harm as a consequence of being made the puppets of, in particular the father, in his war of attrition with the Local&#160;Authority.  The Local&#160;Authority wished to facilitate regular contact, but as is often the case, asked the parents to sign a contact agreement whereby they would agree not to make inappropriate remarks about the professionals in front of the children, that they would not discuss the case with the children and would not speak to the children about returning home.  </span></p>

The evidence is to the contrary.  In the premises, the father's application to discharge the care orders is dismissed.</span></p>

The parents do not consent to the same.  I have no doubt that, very sadly, they will be heartbroken at my decision.  I am satisfied, for the reasons given, that the welfare of the children requires me to dispense with the parents' consent.  Accordingly, I do dispense with the consent of the mother and of the father to P and M being adopted.  I make a placement order in respect of both of them.</span></p>

They will be the subject of a statutory review in March next and then again September.  By that latter review, if prospective adopters have not, unfortunately, been found, I would have thought it in the best interests of the children for the Local Authority to reflect on the care plan and for the decision to be made to revert to a plan of long-term foster care.  In that event, the Local Authority will apply to revoke the placement orders.</span></p>
