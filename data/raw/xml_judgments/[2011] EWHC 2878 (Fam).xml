	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Both parties are French.  The Wife was born near Paris in August 1961 and is therefore 50 years of age.  Prior to the birth of the children, she was employed in the cosmetics industry and then in an advertising consultancy.  Since the arrival of the children, she has been a full-time housewife and mother.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The Husband is of Armenian descent but he was born in Paris in March 1958 and is therefore 53 years of age.  He worked in his family&#8217;s business until 1987 when he joined VCF.  He has steadily risen up the ranks and is currently Managing Partner, private equity, based in Paris.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">They met whilst the Husband was working in his family business.  They commenced a relationship in around 1985 and began to cohabit in the Wife&#8217;s flat in Paris in 1990.  The relationship did not run entirely smoothly as there was a period in 1986 when the relationship was broken off and another in 1992, when the parties separated.  On each occasion this was for approximately six months.  These two periods of separation were both at the instigation of the Husband, who was not ready to commit fully to the relationship.  I accept that this was in part because of his parents&#8217; wish that he should settle down with an Armenian girl but I have no doubt it was not the only reason.</p>

The Wife sold her flat to assist with the apartment&#8217;s acquisition and the Husband additionally paid for the majority of the quite considerable refurbishment works.  The property is now valued at &#8364;1,685,775 and is free of mortgage.  </p>

This is a very important feature of this case, to which I will return in due course.</p>

The legal title and beneficial interests are held as to 85% to the Husband and 15% to the Wife.  This reflects the proportions of the purchase price that each contributed.  The purchase contract specifically refers to the marriage contract.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In June 2007, the parties discussed separation.  The Husband had formed a relationship with another woman but it is clear that he was undecided as to what he wanted for the future.  The Wife, on the other hand, was keen for the marriage to continue.  Nevertheless, both parties instructed French Avocats.  Draft separation agreements were prepared and exchanged by the parties themselves but no agreement was reached.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In November 2007, the parties discussed a three month trial separation, although it was not until February 2008 that the separation commenced.  Even then, it was a secret separation in the sense that the children were unaware of it.  The Husband moved into another apartment in the same building but returned to the family home every other week-end and, in April 2008, the family had a holiday together in Mauritius.  To explain the Husband&#8217;s absences, the Wife told the children that their father was travelling more than before.  The Husband wanted to use the three months to decide on what he wanted to do in the future.  Before he left, he signed a letter dated 4th February 2008.  It is clear that there was a draft of this letter before it was signed.  The signed letter is in a slightly different form to the draft.  I will have to return to this letter in due course as its true meaning and importance have been in issue in the case.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">On 2nd July 2008, the Husband told the children that their parents had separated.  This marked the end of the marriage.  The Husband moved to rented accommodation in Chelsea in August 2008.  The Wife had already instructed solicitors in May 2008 in case they should ever be needed.  On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2008, she issued a divorce petition here.  This led to a contested jurisdiction dispute.  The Husband filed an answer on 18th August 2008 pleading that there was no jurisdiction as both parties were domiciled and last habitually resident in France.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The matter came on for hearing before Ryder J on 21st October 2009.  The judgment is reported as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Z -v- Z</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 694" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 694</ref>.  It was held that the parties were both habitually resident in this jurisdiction on the date on which the Wife presented her petition, as it had been both parties&#8217; intention to reside in London at the time of the family&#8217;s move here, even though the Husband had subsequently changed his intention.  Although there was no order as to costs, Ryder J indicated that he would have ordered the Husband to pay the Wife&#8217;s costs had he not already done so and that, in consequence, the amount of the costs should be added back to his assets for the purpose of the hearing I am now undertaking.  Following on from this order, a Decree Nisi was pronounced on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2010.  It has not, as yet, been made Absolute.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Fortunately, there is complete agreement as to the capital position of the parties.  This is a great tribute to both the parties and their advisers.  If only this was the situation in every case.  An Agreed Schedule of Assets has been prepared by the Husband&#8217;s junior counsel, Miss Cowton.  It shows total assets of &#163;15,088,419.  Of this total, the wife has &#163;1,285,488 with the husband having the balance, namely &#163;13,802,930.  The Schedule can be summarised thus.</p>

The properties are subject to French usufruct (effectively a life tenancy) in favour of her mother and her late father&#8217;s girlfriend.  Whilst these are clearly non-matrimonial assets that would be excluded from a sharing division, the Husband has also inherited a French property which is subject to usufruct for the life of his mother.  Although the value of the Husband&#8217;s inheritance is slightly greater than that of the Wife, they effectively balance each other out and can be ignored for all practical purposes.  </p>

The period of investment ended in 1997 and the scheme paid out between 2001 and 2005.  Inevitably, there have been further  such schemes.  The proceeds are held in various investments and structures as shown in the Assets Schedule.  In addition, the Husband has a significant number of shares in VCF.  The recession has not been kind to the VCF share price which has reduced dramatically during the course of the proceedings.  Indeed, the reduction in the share price, along with an across the board fall in stock markets over the past few months, has reduced the assets from around &#163;18 million to its current figure of just over &#163;15 million.  It is, of course, impossible to say what will happen hereafter.  </p>

It is estimated that it will produce &#8364;72,654 pa when he is aged 65.  Roberts DJ gave the Wife permission to instruct a pension actuary to assess the value of this pension but she has not done so.  It is suggested to me that it may be worth &#163;1 million.

First, there is potential French tax totalling &#163;3,239,292.  As I understand the position, this would only arise if the French authorities successfully challenged the Husband&#8217;s tax status during the period he was working in this country.  Second, there is potential UK tax if the Husband was deemed not to have had &#8216;Not Ordinarily Resident&#8217; status during his time here, totalling &#163;902,078.  Third, there is a potential liability for tax on offshore funds if remitted to the UK.  It has not been quantified.  It would clearly make a very serious difference to this case if &#163;4,141,370 or more had to paid to the tax authorities.  The matter has, however, been presented to me on the basis that it is pretty unlikely that any of these liabilities will accrue.  Again, I will return to this in due course.  </p>

There is some chance that he may get a two year assignment to run the Asia operation based in one of the Asian offices.  Whilst I cannot be certain as to his future, I accept that he is coming towards the end of his career with VCF.  He does, of course, have skills that could, if he so wished, enable him to undertake other work in the future, perhaps as a Non-Executive Director but I am satisfied that his earnings would be far lower than in the past.  Moreover, the current economic difficulties suggest that he is unlikely to return to the sort of levels of remuneration enjoyed in the period before the recession although I consider the projections for the future to be conservative so long as he remains at VCF.</p>

Nevertheless, Paragraph 108 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher</span> makes it clear that issues of foreign law are relevant to the intentions of the parties (eg whether or not they intended that the ante-nuptial agreement should be binding upon them).

I agree entirely with the findings that Ryder J made when he heard the jurisdiction dispute.  Both spouses were doing their best to be honest to me, although at times I consider their respective recollections were in error.  At times, they recollect what occurred in such a way as to fit in to their respective cases.  The Wife is clearly far more emotional than the Husband.  I have no doubt that this has been a very painful process for her.  The Husband gave his evidence with great care and thought and displayed far less emotion.  Where their evidence conflicted, I find that it was because each interpreted the position of the other at the time differently to what it really was.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In France, as in many other European countries, every married couple is subject to a matrimonial property regime, either by express agreement or by default.  The default regime is community of goods but agreements that provide for separation of goods are very common.  In this particular case, the agreed evidence was that both parties&#8217; parents and the majority of their friends entered a separation of property agreement prior to their marriages.  In effect, this was the norm for these families and it would, in my view, have been very surprising if they had not entered such an Agreement.</p>

He would have viewed it as bad faith if the Wife had not agreed.  At one point, Mr Scott put it to him that he wanted to share his life with the Wife but not his money.  That is, of course, true but it is true in virtually every case where there is such a regime and is certainly not considered &#8220;bad form&#8221; in France, even if it might be so considered here.  </p>

It is of course true that Article 5 of the Agreement provides her with protection from such debts and that there would have been no such protection without the Agreement.  I accept that the Husband mentioned this to her but I do not accept that it was the overriding reason for the Agreement.  The Wife may well have since justified it to herself on this basis but I believe that, at the time, she knew that entering such an Agreement was what was expected and she went along with it.  I do not accept that the Husband told her before she signed that he would not rely on the Agreement if they separated.  This did not feature in her written evidence and is, in my view, erroneous recollection based on her perception of what is fair.</p>

It is a bit like Child Abduction cases where any consent to removal of a child has to be clear and compelling.  In my view, there has to be the clearest possible evidence of such an oral agreement before a court could even contemplate using this as a reason not to enforce an agreement.  Any other approach would encourage false testimony and potentially drive a coach and horses through the need for such agreements to be varied formally.  Of course, there is an argument that there is written evidence in this case and I will deal with that later.  All I will say, at this stage, is that there was not a clear and compelling oral agreement that the Husband would not rely on the Agreement.  Indeed, all the evidence points to the contrary.</p>

Second, when the parties bought the property in Suresnes in 1997, the Agreement is specifically referred to in the contract.  I accept that the Wife may not have paid close attention to this legal document but the Husband must have brought the contents of the Agreement to the attention of the conveyancers.  Third, the 2007 draft separation documents refer to the Agreement.  I accept entirely that these were merely drafts that were not finalised.  Equally, I accept that they do not follow the Agreement blindly as they provide for the transfer of both Paris properties to the Wife.  Nevertheless, no-one was suggesting in these negotiations that there should be community of property.  Finally, throughout this marriage, these parties arranged their financial affairs in a way that was entirely consistent with the Agreement.  There was no mingling of resources.  The Husband did transfer his income into the joint account but that was because the Agreement did not cover maintenance.  His bonuses were paid into the joint account but very swiftly thereafter transferred into assets in the Husband&#8217;s sole name.  The proceeds of his carried interest and co-investment schemes were all paid direct into accounts and structures in his sole name.  </p>

I am not going to take advantage of this three month period and run off to the court to divorce you.  To prove my bona fides, this is what I will give you if I break my promise&#8221;.

Quite rightly, both counsel were very cautious in relation to this aspect.  I do not intend to make any findings as to whether or not the Husband did do so and, if so, how it came about.  It is not right for any litigant to involve the children in the detail of these financial cases.  If children do raise the matter, it puts their parents in a very difficult position and it would not be right to rely on anything that transpired as a result.  </p>

She did indeed do so but this will form a part of her needs case.  Second, she had children.  Again, this forms part of her needs case.  Moreover, in both regards, it is right to note that Mr Granatino had given up his job and the marriage had led to the birth of children.  Third, Mr Scott says that the Wife followed her husband to London even though the marriage was already in difficulties.  This is also true but this has been to her financial advantage as she is now able to bring this application before the English courts, it being accepted that the approach here to needs is more generous than it would be in France.</p>

It is right to note that this means that suitable property for her and the girls will be considerably more expensive in London than it would be in Paris but, conversely, the cost of general living here is lower than in Paris.  According to Table 31 of &#8220;At A Glance&#8221;, Paris is 21% more expensive at the moment.  This is a reflection of the current Euro exchange rate but Paris has for the last few years at least been more expensive, although not always as high as 21%.  </p>

In fact, in 2006, the parties had a particularly extravagant year when they spent in the region of &#8364;70,000 including an expensive additional trip to Mauritius.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Since the separation, the Wife has not gone on expensive holidays but the Husband has.  In successive years, he has taken the children to Las Vegas at a cost of around &#8364;50,000; to Tanzania, also at a cost of &#8364;50,000 and this year to Armenia/Russia, again costing &#8364;50,000.  In between, he asked the children if they would like to go on a cruise or to India.  The girls chose a cruise.  This was not, however, two weeks on the QM2 but rather a private charter on a luxury cruiser at &#8364;100,000 for two weeks.  This year, he has had two further expensive holidays with his girlfriend in Morocco and Mauritius, although I entirely accept that the Husband works very hard and also that he goes on holiday with the children for only limited periods.  </p>

This is far higher than the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage at any stage.  The Wife has in fact been managing on only &#163;7,000 per month plus her rent and school fees.  I do not however take this into account.  First, I do consider that the Husband was misleading about his income when he put the Wife on this regime.  Second, just as over-spending should not be rewarded, under-spending should not be penalised.  Having said that, the Wife&#8217;s budget is demonstrably wrong in a number of particulars and just too high in others.  </p>

I accept Mr Marks&#8217; submission that the figure of &#163;40,000 per annum per child is too high and only really suitable in cases where the levels of income are far higher than the Husband&#8217;s income is likely to be in the years ahead.  I take into account that his best years are behind him, that he is likely to have to retire from VCF sooner rather than later and that he must pay the school fees (and extras on the school bill) and the costs of University tuition.  On the other hand, he is highly likely to have considerably more resources than the Wife and a higher income than her.  </p>

Having considered the matter carefully, I do not propose to go behind the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> figures save in one respect.  There is clear authority that it is appropriate to use <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> Tables in such cases as a guide.

It is therefore impossible to see why they should be amortised.  In addition, she has a portfolio of shares which was inherited.  Rather than attempt a complicated calculation, I have formed the view that the simplest approach is to exclude the usufruct properties from the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> calculation but include the portfolio.  In effect, this means that I will exclude &#163;174,961 from the calculations of the Wife&#8217;s reasonable requirements.  </p>

She can either continue to live in the same property and spend at a rate of &#163;100,000 per annum or, if she so chooses, she can sell up and buy somewhere cheaper, which would enable her to live at a standard closer to the &#163;175,000 per annum which she will have whilst the children are fully dependant upon her.  </p>

Nevertheless, it is appropriate to perform a cross-check against the overall assets if only to make sure that the award is not in excess of half the assets.  On the basis that the overall assets are &#163;15 million, this award amounts to 40% on the assumption that the no tax is payable.  In my view, that is a suitable departure from equality to reflect the Agreement.  Nevertheless, it is possible that there will be a tax liability and I entirely accept that it is not appropriate for the wife to have more than half the assets.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I have come to the conclusion that the appropriate way to proceed is to give the Husband a choice.  He can assume all liability for any tax debts, in which case there will be a clean break.  However, if he is really concerned about tax, the Wife must provide him with an indemnity for one-half of any tax over &#163;3 million that he has to pay in relation to obligations relating to income/capital gains as set out in the report and updates from SJ Berwin and Deloittes in the bundle.  If he has to pay &#163;3 million, each party will have &#163;6 million but if the liability goes above that amount, the Wife will have more than half the assets unless I make this provision.  In such circumstances, the Wife might receive less than the amount I have assessed as necessary for her reasonable needs.  It would follow that she would then have a nominal maintenance order solely to cover the possibility of such a shortfall and there would be a recital in the order to that effect.  The choice is the Husband&#8217;s as only he can really assess the true likelihood of these tax liabilities coming to pass.  For my part, I would have thought that the clean break would be preferable, particularly as the Husband does additionally have the French pension but it is a matter for him.</p>

If it does not, his case is that both French properties be transferred to the Wife to avoid any French Wealth Tax.  I agree but it follows that, if the Wife sells either property for a net sum less than the amount in the Asset Schedule, he must make the shortfall up by an additional lump sum.  It follows that he must consent to any such sale but with liberty to apply.  </p>
