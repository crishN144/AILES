	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a case under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>). I shall set out the relevant  terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>  in a moment. In summary, however, it is sufficient for the purposes of this introduction to say that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> adds a new Part IVA to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> and empowers the court to make orders designed to protect a person from being forced into marriage, as well as a person who has been forced into marriage. Such orders, known as Forced Marriage Protection Orders (FMPOs)  may be made without the respondent to the order being given notice of the proceedings in which the order is made. The application for such an order may also be made either by the person to be protected or &#8220;a relevant third party&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the instant case, two sets of proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> have been consolidated. Thus the applicant in the primary proceedings is a relevant third party namely a police force (the police) and the person to be protected (A) is the fifth defendant. The applicant in the second set of proceedings is A&#8217;s former boy friend  (C). The first and  second defendants in both sets of proceedings  are A&#8217;s parents (the parents) They are in person. The third defendant in the consolidated proceedings is  one of A&#8217;s cousins  (the cousin). The fourth defendant in those proceedings  is A&#8217;s prospective bridegroom (B), and  the sixth defendant is B&#8217;s father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It  is of the utmost importance that, for the time being at least, confidentiality is maintained in this case, and I propose throughout to identify the parties by using the anonymised terminology  specified in the previous paragraph. At the same time, the case raises points of considerable public interest, and it is right that this judgment should be in the public domain. For reasons which will be apparent,  however, nothing must be published which would identify any of the participants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C&#8217;s  case poses fewer legal problems. C alleges that he has been assaulted by B (together with two other men unknown to C) and that the cousin has also harassed him and threatened to kill him, thereby causing him to flee to Pakistan. He also alleges that during his absence in Pakistan,  B&#8217;s father has threatened his (C&#8217;s) grandparents. The allegations which he makes &#8211; and the relief which he seeks &#8211; are both capable of being dealt with in the normal way, subject, of course, to any measures which may be necessary to protect B&#8217;s  whereabouts. This judgment will, accordingly, concentrate on the police&#8217;s application for a FMPO designed to protect A, and on any application by A to set the FMPO aside.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment has two purposes. The first is to give directions in the case before the court. This includes the important question of whether or not it is appropriate to invite the Attorney-General to appoint special advocates to enable affected parties to deal with information which (inter alios) the police  do not wish to be disclosed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is, accordingly,  an open judgment designed to be read by all the parties and by the public at large. Certain information will, however, remain &#8220;closed&#8221; &#8211; that is to say  it   will not be disclosed in this judgment. The reason for the existence of, and the need for &#8220;closed&#8221; material can be shortly stated. There will be cases both of &#8220;honour&#8221; violence and forced marriage in which disclosure to all the parties will reveal not merely information but also the source or sources of that information. This,  in the wrong hands, could  expose the source(s) of that information  to violence and, possibly, death. For a graphic illustration of the nature  of  the violence which can occur (albeit not in a forced marriage context) see the facts of  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re B-M (Care Orders)</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/205" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 205" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 205</ref>. <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 20" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 20</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do, however, need to make it very clear that in the instant case there has been no substantive hearing, and the court has made no findings of fact. Any allegations which are disclosed in this judgment are, accordingly, just that &#8211; they are allegations, and no more. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless forced marriage cases are likely to throw up issues which are profound in the extreme. The subject matter itself is highly sensitive. In every case, as it seems to me,<span style="color:#000000">  a clear distinction needs to be drawn between, on the one hand,  forced marriage as a form of domestic violence and a serious  abuse of human rights, and, on the other, the concept of the consensual arranged marriage which is rightly perceived as a cultural norm in certain societies and thus wholly acceptable: - see, for example the decision of Singer J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Re SK</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"/><span style="color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/3202" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 230</ref>  and that of Munby J (as he then was) in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Re K </span><span style="color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2956" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2956 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2956 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 399" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 399</ref>.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal conundrum potentially thrown up by the instant case (and certainly likely to arise at some point in the future) is one which, potentially, goes to the root of family justice, namely how is it possible to achieve a fair hearing (i.e. comply with ECHR Article 6) if parts of the evidence which it is necessary for  parties to know in order to enable them to meet allegations made against them cannot safely be revealed to them  on the ground that disclosure of the information or its source is  likely to identify the informant (and thus place him or her at risk)?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a forced marriage case, the problem may, hypothetically, be particularly acute, if either the informant is another member of her family, a boyfriend or a member of his family, the party to be protected herself, or, indeed, any  third party close to her. She (the person to be protected) may, once again hypothetically &#8211; and I emphasis that word -, be living in the household of those against whom the order is sought.</p>

It is extra-territorial in its application and orders may be both made and discharged <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte. </span>Secondly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/2" uk:canonical="2005 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> plainly creates a protective / injunctive jurisdiction. Its object is to prevent forced marriages by protecting those who may be, or have been,  forced into marriage.  The position in relation to respondents, moreover, seems to me robust, and the only criterion for protecting a respondent to such an order appears in  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/2/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>D(3), where the order is made <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> and  the court is required to give any respondent &#8220;an opportunity to make representations&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic"/>(see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/2/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>D(3)).

He accepted that such a course of conduct was exceptional, and should be considered to be the exception, rather than the rule in any case.

If procedure is the servant rather than the master, then dealing with some cases "justly" may sometimes require a rather different approach (it follows that I take issue with CPR, r 76.2, which requires that in control order cases the overriding objective be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the duty to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest, thus apparently requiring that the court deal otherwise than justly with at least some cases). </p>

They are, firstly, that whilst an entitlement to a fair trial under ECHR Article 6  is absolute,  this does  not mean that a party has an absolute and unqualified right to see all the documents. Secondly, the advent of  the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> means it is no longer the case that the only interests capable of denying a litigant access to documents are the interests of children involved in the litigation. Thus the  interests of anyone else who is involved,  whether as victim, party or witness and who can demonstrate that their ECHR Article 8 rights are sufficiently engaged, can also have that effect.  Thirdly, a limited qualification of the right to see the documents may be acceptable if directed towards a clear and proper objective. Non-disclosure, as Munby J made clear,  must be limited to what the situation imperatively demands and is justified only when the case is compelling or strictly necessary, with the court being rigorous in its examination of the feared harm  and any difficulty caused to the litigant counterbalanced by procedures designed to ensure a fair trial.</p>

In this case the special advocate procedure allowed the court and the special advocates to discharge the duty described by Baroness Hale of Richmond in testing &#8216;with the utmost scepticism&#8217; the MPS&#8217;s blanket assertion of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PII</span>. The result was that the vast majority of the MPS material (some 90% in my estimation) was disclosed in one form or another. In relation to the small amount of material that remained undisclosed, the special advocates, again with Baroness Hale of Richmond&#8217;s strictures in mind, conducted a process of cross-examination and submission designed to test the material and enable the court to see any weakness there may be in its evidential value&#8221;.</p>

He cited a number of examples of such schemes, some of which I have already identified. He submitted that the express legislative basis for the procedure adopted was significant. In each situation, the  legislation permitted one of the parties to the proceedings (in each case the relevant Secretary of State / government department) to rely on &#8220;closed evidence&#8221;, provided; (1) that the court was satisfied that disclosure of the material would be contrary to the public interest; and (2) a special advocate had been appointed. </p>

Point (3), he argued. must be addressed by reason of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Al Rawi</span>: see in particular paragraph 71 of the Court&#8217;s judgment</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the assumption that the  admission of and reliance on evidence not disclosed to all parties to the proceedings was permissible in the instant case,  the further questions to be addressed, Mr. Swift argued,  concerned firstly  whether the consequence of a disclosure decision was non-compliance with ECHR Article 6; secondly. whether the presence of a special advocate was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">necessary</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>to address the resulting deficit, and, thirdly, whether the presence of a special advocate <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">would in fact</span> address that deficit. It was important to recognise that even in situations in which a special advocate procedure could properly be adopted, the appointment of a special advocate procedure was a means to an end &#8211; that is so say a means by which compliance with ECHR Article 6 could be achieved where this would not otherwise be the case.</p>

Could the Article 6 issue be addressed by action which the court could take itself? If the answer to that point was &#8220;no&#8221;, the question which still had to be asked was  what was it that a special advocate could do that would address the Article 6 issue?</p>

Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Murungaru</span><span style="font-style:italic">,</span> he argued, the Court of Appeal had accepted that the Administrative Court could consider the material which was the basis for the decision to revoke the visa, and determine the application for judicial review, without the need to seek the appointment of a special advocate. </p>

That, in turn, depends on her wishes and feelings, which I am taking steps to ascertain. In these circumstances, it seems to me that there is no role for the special advocate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as disclosure <span style="font-style:italic">simpliciter </span>is concerned, as I have already made clear, it does not seem to me that special advocates have any role to play.  The court, in my judgment, is entitled to take the view that any forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and that where &#8211; as here &#8211; a responsible body such as the police have credible information sufficient to invoke the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and form the basis of court orders, an issue arises which &#8211; in the context of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the jurisdiction it provides &#8211; entitles the court to act and make its orders, irrespective  of the truth or otherwise of information which has led to the application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficulties which arise &#8211; or may arise &#8211; come into focus when an application is made to set the order or orders arise. In such circumstances,  I fully recognise that factual issues may arise which  the court is required to investigate. However, not only is that not this case,  but, even if it were, it does not  seem to me that that special advocates have any role to play. The police  - or the alleged victim &#8211;  argue that  certain information likely to lead to a breach of  the rights provided by ECHR Articles 2, 3 or 8 should not be disclosed. Balanced against that are the ECHR Article 6 (and possibly 8) rights of the persons subject to the order.  Given the protective nature of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction, it seems to me that the court can decide the issue of whether or not the order should stand without either detailed investigation of the factual issues or the intervention of special advocates.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, when I come to analyse the ECHR Article 6 rights of the parties affected,   I  am tempted to the view that  ECHR Article 6 is not engaged at all.  Article 6 protects a party&#8217;s right  to a fair trial &#8220;in  the determination of his civil rights and obligations&#8221;.  To force a person into marriage is manifestly not a civil right, still less an obligation.   In my view, accordingly, it is arguable that ECHR Article 6 is not engaged in an application for a FMPO. In any event, since the court permits the exercise of jurisdiction <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> and on the basis of the applicant&#8217;s belief,  it does not seem to me that  a respondent&#8217;s right to apply to set the order aside entitles him or her to access to information which, if abused, will lead to serious breaches of the rights of the person to be protected. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Any application to set aside a FMPO, however, is likely to engage ECHR Article 6.  A person against whom the order has been made (A&#8217;s parents in this instance) may well deny forcing A into marriage &#8211; or any intention of  doing so &#8211; and may assert that the order represents a breach of their ECHR Article 8 right to respect for their family life in arranging a marriage for their daughter. We are thus back to the dichotomy identified in paragraph 9 of this judgment. Assuming, therefore, that ECHR Art 6 is engaged, it nonetheless seems to me that the right to a fair trial manifestly does not entitle a party either to see all the documents in the case or to have all the information  in the possession of the court: - see Munby J&#8217;s analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re B</span>.</p>

The first, in paragraph 87 of the judgment,  immediately precedes his reference to Baroness Hale of Richmond&#8217;s speech in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">MB </span>where he says: </p>

That submission was made in robust terms, supported as it was by the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R v Davis</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/36" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 36" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 36</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 AC 1128" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 AC 1128</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 3 WLR 125" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 3 WLR 125</ref> which had recently been handed down. In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Davis</span><span style="font-style:italic"/>the House of Lords held that in a criminal trial the use of anonymous evidence was not acceptable and did not satisfy the requirements of Art&#160;6 of the European Convention. In considering that submission, there is, in my view, a clear and vital distinction between the criminal jurisdiction and the wardship jurisdiction. Unlike the criminal jurisdiction, where the sole issue before the court is determining the guilt or otherwise of the defendant on a particular charge, the wardship court has a duty to investigate all of the relevant circumstances that may touch upon the ward&#8217;s future welfare. That investigation must include receiving evidence, even if it is anonymous, hearsay evidence from an unknown individual, as part of the process. Thus, for the wardship court, it is not a case that a certain category of evidence cannot be acceptable or must be excluded, rather, it is a question of what weight is to be attached to that evidence when the court comes to evaluate it. During the exercise of determining the weight to be given to material such as the &#8216;Crimestoppers&#8217; call, the principles underpinning the House of Lords decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R&#160;v&#160;Davis</span><span style="font-style:italic"/>will be of substantial relevance and may well be determinative, but the issue will be weight rather than admissibility. In this context the distinction apparently drawn by the M(etropolitan P(olice) S(ervice) as to &#8216;information&#8217; or &#8216;material&#8217; or &#8216;intelligence&#8217; was, in the family court&#8217;s eyes, a distinction without a difference; all of the data produced by the MPS was in some form or other evidence which was admissible in family proceedings; the task for the court was to evaluate it and determine what, if any, weight it may attract in the overall process&#8221;.</p>

If such an expert is satisfied that A genuinely and independently wishes the order to be discharged, I will, of course listen to that evidence and any cross-examination of that witness by the police very carefully.
