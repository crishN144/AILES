	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s parents are Spanish and now aged forty-nine years old. The father is an osteopath by profession, the mother a cardiologist. They were married in Barcelona in 2002 and moved to Pamplona two years later where the older child, A, was born on 14 October 2003. In 2006, the parties moved to Kent, England, where the younger child, J, was born on 1 December 2006. In July 2011, the family moved back to Pamplona but a few weeks later moved to Tenerife. In July 2012, the father moved back to Pamplona, the mother and children remaining in Tenerife. At that stage, it seems that the parties&#8217; relationship was continuing, but it broke down in the course of 2013. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 3 September 2013, the mother started divorce proceedings in Spain, in the course of which she sought an order for custody of the two children. The mother had by that stage obtained employment as a cardiologist in Sussex, England, and therefore applied for interim custody and permission to remove the children from Spain. A psychological assessment of the children carried out in October 2013 concluded &#8220;there are indicators of abuse within the family sphere resulting from the behaviour and educational style of the father. Therefore, it is our opinion that the maternal family environment is the most appropriate, safe and comfortable for the minors.&#8221;  The Spanish court granted the mother&#8217;s application and shortly before Christmas 2013 the mother and children arrived in England. At all times since that date, the children have lived with the mother in this country, but until 2016 they have, in accordance with the interim order of the Spanish court, spent one month each summer and one week at Christmas with the father in Spain. Under the interim order, the father was also permitted to have contact for one weekend a month in England, but according to the mother he has only occasionally taken up this contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Meanwhile, the divorce proceedings were continuing in Spain. In March 2014, there was a hearing before a judge in the Court of First Instance No 3 in Pamplona over two days, in the course of which the judge interviewed the children. Subsequently, the judge decided that the children should be seen by a court-appointed psychologist. Her interview with the children took place in the presence of the judge on 31 July 2015. The psychologist saw both children again on two occasions in August 2015 and saw A for a further interview on 8 January 2016. The mother asserts that she was unaware of this latter visit which took place when the children were in Spain for contact with the father over the Christmas period. On 5 February 2016, the psychologist prepared a written report in which she recorded that the both children had expressed a wish to be with their father and family in Pamplona. She reported that both children had close relationships with each parent but was concerned about the high level of conflict between the parents and the impact of the conflict on the children. With regard to A, she concluded that both parents &#8220;are reference and significant figures for A. Her belonging feeling is placed in the family from Pamplona and [she] has expressed her wish to come to live in Pamplona and she is also currently settled and integrated in England at school level.&#8221; With regard to J, the psychologist concluded: &#8220;J is integrated in the school environment in England and is focused on interests corresponding to his age. Both parents are important persons for J. The child has safe emotional bonds with both parents and has not stated any preference in relation to the cohabitation with one or the other parent.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further hearing took place before the court in Pamplona in May 2016. Eventually, on 27 June 2016, the judge in Pamplona delivered her judgment and decision. She awarded guardianship and custody of the children to the father and directed that thereafter the children should spend one half of the school summer holidays and Christmas holidays, the whole of the Easter holidays, and other half term holidays, with the mother, the contact to take place in London unless the mother travelled to Spain on those dates. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2016, the mother filed a notice of appeal against the Spanish judge&#8217;s decision and brought the children back to England. On 20 September 2016, the Spanish judge ordered the mother to hand over the children to the father&#8217;s care and to pay a daily fine of &#8364;100 for each day that passed when she failed to hand the children over to the father. On 5 October 2016, the father filed an application in this court for a location order under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction and also for registration and enforcement of the Spanish orders dated 27 June 2016 and 20 September 2016. On the same day, a location order was made by Roberts J and orders for the registration and enforcement of the Spanish orders were made by District Judge McGregor. The location order was executed and on 14 October the matter came back before MacDonald J who gave a series of case management directions within the inherent jurisdiction proceedings. On 7 November, the mother filed a notice of appeal against the district judge&#8217;s order for the registration and enforcement of the two Spanish orders. In her statement in support, the mother stated that the children did not want to leave England where they were settled living with her and in their current schools. She stated: &#8220;the children need stability and we intend to remain in England long-term&#8221;. She exhibited to her statement a letter written by A stating that she wished to stay living in England with her mother. At a further hearing on 9 November, Francis J refused an application by the mother for the children to be interviewed by Cafcass and gave further case management directions for the filing of evidence. On 24 November, an application was made by a solicitor on behalf of A for an order joining her as a party to the proceedings. In her statement in support of the application, the solicitor recorded that she had been contacted by A&#8217;s mother and had subsequently spoken to A by telephone who had confirmed that she wished to remain living in England with her mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Around the time of the hearing in November 2016, and subsequently over Christmas, the father had contact with the children in England, although the arrangements were to some extent frustrated as a result of medical appointments during which A underwent a lumbar puncture procedure. The evidence suggests that the father was not informed or consulted about this procedure. Meanwhile, the father had filed an &#8220;enforcement claim&#8221; in the court in Pamplona seeking enforcement of the order of 20 September 2016 for the &#8220;handover&#8221; of the children to the father. The mother opposed the enforcement claim on the grounds inter alia that the children did not want to return to Spain. On 19 January 2017, the court in Pamplona made an order that the mother&#8217;s objection to the enforcement claim be &#8220;dismissed in its entirety&#8221;, holding that her arguments based on the children&#8217;s current wishes were &#8220;utterly insufficient&#8221;, and declared that it was appropriate for the enforcement to proceed and for the custody regime established by its earlier judgment to be immediately and effectively complied with by handing over the children to the father. A further fine of 100 euros per day was imposed on the mother for each day that the provisions of the enforcement order were not complied with. </p>

She reported that A had told her: &#8220;I want to stay here, in England. We have all our friends here and our home and everything. We have never really lived in Spain and we don&#8217;t want to go there because we are happy here.&#8221; She told the guardian that, although she loved her father, she believed that a move to Spain would mean that she and J would be largely in the care of the paternal grandparents because her father works long hours. The guardian reported that J had a negative view about a move to Pamplona, and about his relationship with his father, although, with encouragement, both children spoke about good things they had enjoyed during contact with him. The guardian reported that both children had told her, individually, that their father persuaded them to tell the Spanish court-appointed psychologist that they wanted to live in Spain. In contrast, they said that their mother had encouraged them to say what they really wanted. </p>

From the information available to me, the Spanish court took no account of the life in [Sussex], nor obtained the view of the school and other support services involved with the children in the UK, which I consider is a gap in the welfare consideration for these children. The court appears to have been largely influenced by the Spanish court-appointed psychologist, who expressed real doubts about [the mother&#8217;s] ability and willingness to ensure the children&#8217;s psychological and emotional well-being by promoting contact with their father. Regrettably, [the mother&#8217;s] actions in taking the children to the UK, and the failed Christmas contact provide some evidence of what the psychologist predicted.</p>

The children have made their views very clear. [The mother] is the children&#8217;s primary attachment figure and they want to be with her. A&#8217;s current key developmental challenge has been the delicate process of rebuilding a relationship with her dad while &#8216;owning&#8217; that she does not want to live with him in Spain. I fear that &#8211; if the children are &#8216;forced&#8217; to go to Spain at this juncture &#8211; there is a real risk that they will be resentful towards their dad which will get in the way of their ability to truly establish the relationship with them he is so keen to recapture.&#8221;</p>

At that hearing, the father was represented by leading counsel, the children by junior counsel, and the mother appeared in person. After hearing argument, Mostyn J refused &#8220;at this stage&#8221; the father&#8217;s application to lift the stay of the recognition and enforcement proceedings imposed by Holman J in November 2016. Both parties undertook that they would seek to expedite the appeal before the Spanish court. In the interim, Mostyn J ordered that the father should have contact with the children in England over the February half term holiday and in Spain over the Easter holiday. The terms of the order were carefully defined. Thus, in respect of the Easter holiday, the judge directed, under paragraph 7 of the order, that the mother should ensure that the children had contact with the father:</p>

Some of the details of what happened thereafter are a matter of dispute between the parties but, in summary, the following facts are established. The father and the children stayed with the paternal grandparents in North Spain for about ten days. On about 13 April, they flew to Dubai and then on to Bangkok. After a few days, they flew to Indonesia. According to the mother, on 16 April, she received an email from the father via his former solicitor stating that he was going to start a new life away from the UK and Spain. According to the guardian, on the same date the father sent an email informing her that the children had been taken to another country and that he was &#8220;prepared to stay abroad and not return&#8221;. On 18 April, the mother made an emergency application to the High Court in London where Francis J made the children wards of court, and ordered the father to immediately return them to England. The mother then flew to Bangkok and on to Jakarta where she met the Spanish Consul. With his assistance, the children were located and in due course, in the presence of the Consul, they stated that they lived in England and wanted to come back home. The children were returned to the care of the mother and flew via Singapore back to the UK, arriving at Heathrow on 26 April. </p>

As this court is not in a position at this stage to make findings on this issue, it is unnecessary to set out his account in any detail. In summary, however, it is his case that the children enjoyed their time in Spain with him and his family until he observed a man following them and taking photographs. Believing the man to be a private detective instructed behalf of the mother and her family, he decided to take children to Thailand to visit a nanny who had looked after them for some years in England. While in Thailand, he received news of efforts by the mother to take proceedings in Spain and England to recover the children and he therefore decided to take them to Jakarta. He says he told the children that they were going to &#8220;extend the holidays a few more days and since we were in Asia for the first time we could do something to remember.&#8221; He was surprised when the mother and the Spanish Consul arrived at the hotel in Jakarta but says that at that point he and the mother </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As stated above, at the hearing on 17 May 2017, Holman J had identified several issues to be determined at this hearing. The first was the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to make orders concerning children. In his earlier judgment delivered on 20 November 2016, Holman J had referred to the &#8220;somewhat unusual situation&#8230; that the courts of Spain have continued to make welfare decisions in relation to two children long after they ceased to be habitually resident in Spain.&#8221; Earlier, in his order dated 18 April 2017, Francis J had included a recital that he &#8220;was satisfied on the basis of the evidence&#8230; that the courts of England and Wales have primary jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over the [children] pursuant to article 8 and 10 of Brussels IIA&#8221;. In his written submissions, Mr Perkins submitted that the children had become settled and integrated in England, probably during the spring or summer of 2014 and certainly long before any of the Spanish orders were made during the course of 2016. He conceded, however, that, as a consequence of the divorce proceedings which it is assumed have continued seamlessly and remain the substantive application currently before the Spanish courts, the court in Pamplona was &#8220;first seised&#8221; within the meaning of Article 19(2) of Brussels IIA. Accordingly, he accepted that this court is &#8220;second seised&#8221; and, subject to any transfer made under Article 15 considered below, is therefore obliged under Article 19 (3) to decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court. </p>

It follows that this court has no jurisdiction to consider the second question identified by Holman J in his order of 17 May 2017 &#8211; the future care arrangements of the children &#8211; save under Article 20 of Brussels IIA which empowers the court to take &#8220;provisional, including protective, measures&#8221; in respect of the children. Orders made by other judges sitting in this court earlier in the proceedings were plainly &#8220;protective measures&#8221; made lawfully under Article 20. I shall consider whether any further measures under Article 20 need to be taken by this court at this stage at the end of this judgment.</p>

As to this, both the mother and Mr Perkins on behalf of the guardian submitted that there was no justification in lifting the stay on the recognition and enforcement proceedings imposed by Holman J in November 2016 until the determination of the mother&#8217;s appeal in Spain. The father, whilst not conceding that the order should not be registered or enforced, did not invite the court to lift the stay immediately. In my judgment, given the mother&#8217;s pending appeal before the Spanish court, and in view of the clear evidence of the children&#8217;s strong opposition to being returned to Spain, it would not be appropriate to lift the stay on the registration and enforcement process imposed by Holman J at this stage. The father may, however, if and when the circumstances so warrant, renew his application for the stay to be lifted and the issue of registration and enforcement of the Spanish orders determined by this court.</p>

She wanted the guardian to ensure the court was aware of the strength of her feelings about wanting to remain in England. She was also concerned that the process had taken so long. The guardian thought that A would appreciate the opportunity to talk to the Spanish judge and psychologist, but did not want to go to Spain to do so and in the guardian&#8217;s view could not be forced to get on the plane. The guardian&#8217;s view is that to compel her to go to Spain would be counter-productive and would not assist in restoring relations with her father. With regard to J, the guardian thought that if he was forced to go to Spain the effect would be more profound. A, being older, has an understanding of the process of having her voice heard. J does not have that understanding and in the guardian&#8217;s view would be scared. The guardian&#8217;s opinion is that the fear is getting in the way of the children remembering the positive features of their relationship with the father. </p>

She replied that they had had some anxiety about going there before Easter but, since the events of Easter, that anxiety has increased, in the guardian&#8217;s phrase &#8220;to the power of ten&#8221;. She added that it should have been an opportunity to restore relations with the paternal family and build a trusting relationship with the father as a person they could rely on and on whom they could depend. Instead, they were exposed to a frightening experience. In answer to a further question by the father, the guardian acknowledged that the were obviously aspects of the trip that they enjoyed but they had been concerned about the circumstances of not being able to maintain contact with the mother and knowing that they should be back at school. In response to the father&#8217;s assertion that A had been able to speak to her mother via her iPod when in the Far East, the guardian said that A had not felt able to talk freely. </p>

The father challenged this when cross-examining the mother, pointing out that he had allowed A to use her iPod and arranged for WiFi to be available. The mother said that J was now keeping everything to himself and had not said anything about what had happened over Easter. At present he is having weekly counselling sessions.

In her closing submissions, the mother said that she thought it positive that the Spanish judge and psychologist wanted to speak to the children again, but only if this could be achieved without the children going there. If the children travel to Spain, she thought that the Spanish orders would be enforced so that they would be unable to return here. Overall, she thought it would be easier for this court to assess the evidence. </p>

In saying this, I understood the father to be making the point that the Spanish courts have had more extensive experience of the case because it has been going on for much longer than the proceedings in this country. In closing submissions, he responded to the mother&#8217;s complaint about the delays in the Spanish proceedings by observing that the responsibility for the delay lay with the mother herself. He thought it was in the best interests of the children for the proceedings to remain in Spain which he described as a Catholic country where &#8220;family is all&#8221;.

He acknowledged that the starting points in evaluating this question are the principles of comity and cooperation between Member State and the assumption that all courts are equally competent. He submitted, however, that, as a consequence of the father&#8217;s actions in seeking to enforce the current orders and invoke the criminal jurisdiction in Spain, the mother will be arrested if she returns to that country and as a result is unlikely to be able to participate in person in proceedings there. In contrast, Mr Perkins pointed out that the father had travelled to this court for the purposes of the hearing on fourth September and it could therefore be assumed that he would be able to travel here again to take part in further proceedings in this country. He further submitted that the courts of this country are better placed to evaluate the issues now in dispute between the parties, namely the disputed events of Easter 2017, and the various factors relevant to determining the future arrangements for the children, in particular their wishes and feelings. Mr Perkins acknowledged that the proceedings had been continuing in Spain for a number of years, but submitted that the circumstances now are very different from what they were at the start of those proceedings. Now, the issue is how the father&#8217;s relationship with the children can be managed going forward. Given the strong reluctance &#8211; indeed, the refusal &#8211; of the children to return to Spain, which Mr Perkins on behalf of the guardian argued has been significantly strengthened as a result of the father&#8217;s actions over Easter 2017, it was submitted that it will be much harder for the Spanish court to investigate and evaluate the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings which, given the ages of the children, are a central feature of the welfare analysis in this case. In addition, Mr Perkins submitted that the children have the advantage of separate legal representation in this jurisdiction which puts this court in a better position to determine the issues.</p>

The test for habitual residence adopted by the CJEU and the courts of this country is &#8220;the place which reflects some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment&#8221; in the country concerned. As Baroness Hale of Richmond observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v A </span>, supra, this is an essentially factual enquiry which depends on numerous factors, including the reason for the family&#8217;s stay in the country in question. In this case, the children have been in England for over four years. They are well settled in schools here with many friends and are involved in various activities. It is notable that the family moved here in 2006 when A was aged three, that J was born in this country, and that the family remained here until 2011 when they moved to Spain, staying there for two years until the breakdown of the parents&#8217; marriage. It follows, therefore, that both children have lived in this country for the majority of their lives. In all the circumstances, it is manifestly clear that the children &#8211; and their mother &#8211; are now habitually resident here and therefore have a particular connection with this country within the meaning of Article 15 (3).</p>

In this case, the hearing at first instance concluded over a year ago and the hearing currently in preparation in Spain is in respect of an appeal against that decision. Although the English court has now acquired a considerable amount of information concerning the case, I accept the father&#8217;s assertion that the Spanish proceedings have generated considerably more documents, not surprisingly as the proceedings in court have been continuing for over four years in contrast to these proceedings which have been ongoing for less than twelve months. It is accordingly likely that Spanish court has acquired more information concerning the history of the case and the background of this family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept the evidence of the guardian that the children now have a strong antipathy to returning to Spain, an antipathy that has increased as a result of the father&#8217;s actions in taking them to the Far East over Easter in contravention of the terms of the order of this court dated 3 February 17. They fear that, if they travel to Spain, they will not be permitted to return. Although it would in theory be possible for this court to make an order forcing the children to travel to Spain to be interviewed by the judge and psychologist in that country, such an order is likely to cause them very considerable anxiety and also emotional and psychological harm. In theory, it would also be possible for the Spanish psychologist and judge to interview the children by Skype or some similar method, but that does not seem a satisfactory way of carrying out what is bound to be a sensitive conversation. If, on the other hand, the case is transferred, the children can be interviewed by their guardian &#8211; and if appropriate by the judge in this court &#8211; to ascertain their wishes and feelings. In this way, a transfer of the proceedings to this court would provide a &#8220;genuine and specific added value&#8221; in the form of a thorough analysis of the children&#8217; wishes and feelings based on face-to-face interviews of the children which would not be possible if the case remains in the Spanish courts.</p>

But at the same time the CJEU accepted that it may be appropriate to compare the rules of procedure in the two courts when assessing which court is better placed to hear the case. It is recognised that the courts of England and Wales do have the advantage of being able to join children as parties to the proceedings and allocate a professional specialist to act as guardian in the proceedings. This is particularly valuable in complex cases and situations which call for a thorough analysis and exposition of the children&#8217;s emotional needs and their wishes and feelings. Without in any way disparaging the Spanish family justice system, I do consider that the fact that the children can be represented by a guardian in these proceedings in England is a significant advantage, given the issues that have now arisen.</p>

The question at this stage is whether the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">transfer</span> of the proceedings is in the children&#8217;s best interests, not what eventual outcome would be in their best interests. They are likely to suffer very considerable anxiety and emotional and psychological harm if forced to travel to Spain to see a judge and psychologist. Refusing to transfer the case would, in my judgment, have a negative effect on the children&#8217;s family, social and emotional attachments to their mother and on the other attachments they have formed in this country since 2013. If the proceedings are transferred, the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings, and their overall welfare needs, can be assessed by professionals and the court in this jurisdiction without the children having to travel to Spain. The immediate consequences of a transfer in the short term would therefore be the lifting of the anxieties in the children&#8217;s minds that they will be sent to Spain before a thorough analysis of the issues relevant to the decision as to the future care arrangements, including their own wishes and feelings.</p>

Article 15 (6) expressly provides that the courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article, either directly or through the Central Authorities. The Practice Guide, at paragraph 3.3.1, specifically provides that the judges should cooperate to assess whether a transfer is in the best interests of the children. Paragraph 3.3.4.2 suggests that it may be particularly useful for the judges concerned to communicate to assess whether in the specific case the requirements for transfer are fulfilled, in particular if it would be in the best interests of children. I therefore propose to send this judgment, and my consequent order, to the International Family Justice Office for England and Wales for onward transmission to the Spanish network judge, with a view to facilitating communications between the two courts in accordance with a duty to cooperate imposed by the Article. Both courts must work together to do everything possible to ensure that the issues concerning the children&#8217;s future care arrangements are determined fairly and as quickly as possible.</p>
