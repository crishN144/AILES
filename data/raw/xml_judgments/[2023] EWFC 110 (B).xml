I have been provided with two bundles of documents, the main one being the Family Law Act applications, but I also have one for the previous Children Act proceedings. Mr B produced additional papers today, which I have looked at. Most of what was in them I have seen before and are in one or other of the bundles.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16 May 2023, I gave a judgment in the Children Act proceedings between Mr B and Ms D. I found that Mr B was unacceptably abusive to Ms D, to her solicitors, to my court staff, to Cafcass staff and to the London Local Authority X staff. I found that there was no need for a trial in Mr B&#8217;s application to spend time with his son P, as I was able to determine at that hearing there could be no contact as it was unsafe for P, his mother, his mother&#8217;s family, and no professional person or member of court staff could be further exposed to Mr B&#8217;s abuse.</p>

I made a s.91(14) order preventing Mr B from making further applications in relation to P for one year without first obtaining the leave of the court. I explained to Mr B on 16 May that any application he wished to make relating to P would first be considered by me before deciding whether it could go ahead. I said in my judgment that the litigation was being used by Mr B to further abuse Ms D. I also said that Mr B&#8217;s applications were taking up an unreasonable amount of court time.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The next day, 17 May, Mr B issued an application to vary or discharge the non-molestation order of 6 April 2023. That is one of the applications which I am hearing today. I directed Mr B to file his evidence in support and to send a copy to the solicitors for Ms D. I understand that once again Mr B did not send his evidence to Ms D&#8217;s solicitors, but the court has now done so. Unfortunately, this was only done today, and it became apparent from Mr Lansman&#8217;s position statement that no evidence had been received by Morrison Spowart from Mr B. Ms D has not had the opportunity to respond, but I do not think it is necessary to give her time to do so.</p>

Mr B did not attend that hearing. I think he said that he was away and did not have sufficient time to get to the court. He had been served by email on 17 April. It is not clear whether or not he resides at the address which is provided to the court and to the mother&#8217;s solicitors.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of 6 April was made following an application by Ms D to extend a previous non-molestation order she had received last year which was about to run out. Mr B&#8217;s application to discharge the order of 6 April should therefore be understood as being an application to discharge the order of 20 April as well. I also extended the non-molestation order on 16 May, and I shall consider Mr B&#8217;s application ought to be to vary or discharge that order. I shall return to that application shortly, and this application is opposed by Ms D.</p>

He said in the statement that the police are looking into charging Ms D with stalking and threatening him, that Ms D&#8217;s mother had been arrested for stalking and harassing him. I have no evidence that any of that is true. This application is opposed by Ms D.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2 June 2023, Mr B issued an application for myself and HHJ Hughes KC not to be involved in any hearing concerning himself or Ms D. Judge Hughes has not dealt with this matter since June 2022 as far as I can see. She has retired and only sits occasionally as a deputy circuit judge in retirement. Judge Hughes will therefore play no part in any proceedings relating to Mr B or Ms D. I interpret this application as an application for me to recuse myself. In his application in relation to myself, Mr B considers that I am biased, but gives no reasons for anybody to conclude that that is the case.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I am aware that Mr B has appealed my decisions of 16 May, but that is not a reason for me to recuse myself. He mentions the Family Court being very secret in that application, but my judgment on his case has been published, it is on a publicly accessible website, and it had been picked up by the Press, so that makes little sense. This application is also opposed by Ms D.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The law on recusal is as follows: the House of Lords set out the test for actual or perceived bias in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Porter v Magill </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2001/67" uk:canonical="[2001] UKHL 67" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] UKHL 67</ref>, namely whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased. Mr B has failed to give me any examples which would suggest that a fair-minded and informed observer would consider that I am biased. I do not consider that I am biased, and I do not consider the fact that I have made orders which Mr B does not like is a reason to recuse myself. I therefore dismiss this application to recuse myself.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr B has put in another application since 16 May, date unclear, asking for the Children Act case to be moved to Bromley Family Court. This application is opposed by Ms D. I believe I already said in the hearing on 16 May that this was not something that would happen. Mr B wants it to go to Bromley in part, he says, because I should be removed from the case. As I have said, I am not recusing myself. The case is properly brought at Central Family Court, judicial continuity is important and there are no grounds in law why this case should be moved to another court. As Mr B does not have permission to make any application regarding P without my permission being obtained first, it would make no sense for the case to be heard in a different court. Our system is not one where a litigant who does not like a judge, or her decisions, can have his case moved to another court in the hope that another judge may take a different view. There has to be a good reason for a case to be moved and none has been put forward.</p>

Much of his statement has been cut and pasted from a previous statement, and it seems to me that the behaviour he complains about took place, if it took place at all, in 2021. The only matters which, as far as I can tell, he is saying have happened recently has been that he says, though Mr Lansman says it is not accepted, that Ms D has messaged him since the hearing on 16 May. He has not shown me such a message and the fact that there may be a message in itself does not support the making of a non-molestation order. The other fresh evidence seemed to be that he has made a complaint against the long-suffering Ms Owen, Ms D&#8217;s solicitor, and that of course does not support an application for a non-molestation order either.</p>

Previous judges and I have found that to be necessary. There is nothing in Mr B&#8217; statement, or in what he has said to me today other than bare assertion, to support either his application for a non-molestation order or to support his application for the discharge of the existing non-molestation order.</p>

In my judgment, Ms D and P still need the protection of the non-molestation orders which this court has made. Both Ms D and P&#8217;s safety and wellbeing require the non-molestation order to continue. I do not find that Mr B requires or is entitled to a non-molestation order against Ms D. I do not have any evidence that a non-molestation order is needed to secure Mr B&#8217;s health, safety, or wellbeing.</p>

Similarly, I consider Mr B&#8217; application for a non-molestation order against Ms D to be totally without merit. I find that the application for the case to be moved to Bromley Family Court to be totally without merit. I find the application which I have interpreted as an application for me to recuse myself to be totally without merit.

He also emailed the court, telling the court staff not to put his application for me to recuse myself in front of me, which they obviously ignored. He also attended the court in person to try to get an earlier hearing. He has also posted at least one further abusive message about my court staff.</p>

They do not have the time to spend on applications which have no merit. Similarly, I am extremely busy and have urgent cases to deal with which do need judicial time. I have had to spend a totally unreasonable amount of my time in the last six weeks on matters relating to Mr B, and this has to stop.</p>

Clearly, the ones relating to the Family Law Act were not. I therefore have concluded that I have to take stronger measures. Pursuant to pt.4.8 of the Family Procedure Rules, the court has the power to make a civil restraint order against a party to proceedings. Practice Direction 4B sets out in detail how this works, and the consequences. Practice Direction para.3.1 sets out that an extended civil restraint order may be made where a party has persistently made applications which are totally without merit. Paragraph 3.2 gives the court power to make an extended civil restraint order which will restrain Mr B from making applications in any court concerning any matter involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to the proceedings with which I am concerned today and on 16 May, without first obtaining the permission of an identified judge. A subsequent paragraph sets out more detail.</p>

Mr B has taken up, over the past 14 months, a massive amount of HMCTS staff time, and I have no doubt the same applies to Morrison Spowart, Ms D&#8217;s solicitors. He is, in my judgment, using proceedings as another way to torment Ms D who has been forced to be repeatedly in court or to deal with litigation over the past 14 months. This has to stop.</p>

I have, within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> proceedings, made an order under s.91.14 against Mr B.

Thirdly, Mr B may apply for permission to appeal this order and, if permission is granted, may appeal this order.

If his application succeeds, the fee will be refunded to him. To be plain, so that Mr B understands, and I think we will have to have another transcript so Mr B can read or have this read to him, he can no longer make applications without first paying the fee.</p>

If he repeatedly makes applications for permission which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if he makes any further applications for permission which are totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal.</p>

Having obtained the response, Mr B must then make his application for permission in writing and must include Ms D&#8217;s response, if any, to the notice served. His application for permission will then be determined without a hearing. My clerk was intending to provide Mr B with a printed copy of the relevant Practice Direction to assist him, but we will probably put that in the post to him instead.</p>
