They wish the media to be allowed to attend forthcoming hearings of the care proceedings. The question is whether they are entitled to do so. </p>

I have decided that the parents and the media are in substance, though with some amendments, entitled to the relief they seek.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can take the background facts quite quickly. I have not seen, nor have the media seen, the papers either in the previous or in the current care proceedings, so I know little about the detail of either case. It does not matter. Subject only to one matter, which I deal with at the end of the judgment, I know enough to be able to decide the issues that are currently before me for determination. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents live in Norfolk. Their three older children, who I will refer to as A, B and C, were the subject of care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> brought by the relevant local authority, Norfolk County Council (&#8220;NCC&#8221;). The case was heard in the County Court. Judgments were given by His Honour Judge Barham on 21 May 2004 and on 24 November 2004. Threshold was found established. Full care orders were made. Freeing orders were made. All three children were subsequently adopted. The outcome &#8211; permanent loss of all their three children &#8211; must have been devastating for both parents. Even those of us who spend our professional lives in the family courts can have, even with the assistance of the most vivid imagination and a superabundance of human empathy and fellow&#8211;feeling, but a dim awareness of what the parents must have gone through and must, indeed, still be going through.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I understand it, the fundamental basis of the care proceedings was an allegation that one or more of the children had been physically abused by the parents. This is an allegation that they have always denied. They assert that the children were wrongly taken from them on the basis of flawed and incomplete medical and other evidence. A fracture suffered by one of the children, they say, had an innocent explanation, for what is commonly referred to as &#8217;brittle bone disease&#8217; &#8211; osteogenesis imperfecta &#8211; runs, they say, in the mother&#8217;s family. (That may be, but as NCC points out, recent DNA testing of the mother has apparently demonstrated that she is not a symptomless carrier of the disease. Furthermore, says NCC, this was never a &#8216;single issue&#8217; case.) </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Put shortly, the parents say that they and their three children were all the victims of a miscarriage of justice. Their cause has been taken up by both the print and the broadcast media &#8211; the BBC, the &#8216;Times&#8217; and the &#8216;Mail on Sunday&#8217; amongst others. Responsible journalists have suggested that a &#8220;terrible miscarriage of justice may have occurred.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother became pregnant in the latter part of 2005. Not surprisingly in the circumstances, NCC started child protection procedures before her new child was born. Brandon &#8211; for that is his name &#8211; was born on 29 May 2006 in Ireland, where the parents had fled shortly before his birth, fearful that care proceedings would be begun and that he too would be taken away from them. More or less voluntarily &#8211; in reality they probably had little choice &#8211; the parents returned to Norfolk with Brandon. Care proceedings followed. An interim care order was made on 10 June 2006 and the parents, with Brandon, were placed in a residential unit for the purposes of a detailed assessment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By that stage there had been a very considerable amount of publicity about the case. Media coverage had started in about November 2005, before Brandon was born. Perhaps not surprisingly the parents&#8217; flight to and return from Ireland attracted very considerable media attention. The parents and Brandon were photographed and shown on television. Their first names were freely reported in the media, though the media chose to use the mother&#8217;s maiden name rather than their true surname. The most recent broadcast was on 9 June 2006.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 June 2006 His Honour Judge Curl, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, made an order imposing very drastic reporting restrictions. Addressed contra mundum (to the world at large), it prohibited, subject only to one minor exception, the publication of &#8220;any &#8230; information relating to&#8221; Brandon and the soliciting from the parents of &#8220;any information relating to [Brandon] or his parents&#8221;. There was no &#8216;public domain&#8217; proviso. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 August 2006 the BBC gave notice that it intended to apply to vary Judge Curl&#8217;s order. On 18 October 2006 Associated Newspapers Limited, the publishers of the &#8216;Mail on Sunday&#8217;, made a similar application. Both applications came on for hearing before me on 26 October 2006. By then there was some degree of urgency, for the care proceedings were listed for a one&#8211;day hearing on 3 November 2006, the purpose of that hearing being to consider the interim placement arrangements for Brandon following the anticipated conclusion in the next few days of the residential assessment.</p>

It is convenient to take their submissions together. NCC, which had its own reasons for favouring at least some degree of relaxation of Judge Curl&#8217;s order, was represented by Ms Rachel Langdale. Brandon&#8217;s children&#8217;s guardian, who opposed any relaxation of Judge Curl&#8217;s order, was represented by Mr Jonathan Bennett. Norfolk Primary Care Trust, which was agnostic in relation to the main dispute between the parties but wished to ensure appropriate protection for its staff, was represented by Mr Prashant Popat. I am grateful to all counsel for their very considerable assistance in a difficult case. I only fear that I cannot do proper justice to the full subtlety and nuance of the very skilful arguments they have put before me.</p>

It moves Bentham over and over again. &#8220;In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.&#8221; &#8220;Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.&#8221; &#8220;The security of securities is publicity.&#8221; But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten: &#8220;Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.&#8221;</p>

If the way that courts behave cannot be hidden from the public ear and eye this provides a safeguard against judicial arbitrariness or idiosyncrasy and maintains the public confidence in the administration of justice. The application of this principle of open justice has two aspects: as respects proceedings in the court itself it requires that they should be held in open court to which the press and public are admitted and that, in criminal cases at any rate, all evidence communicated to the court is communicated publicly. As respects the publication to a wider public of fair and accurate reports of proceedings that have taken place in court the principle requires that nothing should be done to discourage this.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The need to be vigilant arises from the natural tendency for the general principle to be eroded and for exceptions to grow by accretion as the exceptions are applied by analogy to existing cases. This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public&#8217;s confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties&#8217; or witnesses&#8217; identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely. If secrecy is restricted to those situations where justice would be frustrated if the cloak of anonymity is not provided, this reduces the risk of the sanction of contempt having to be invoked, with the expense and the interference with the administration of justice which this can involve.</p>

No one nowadays surely can doubt that his presence in court for the purpose of reporting proceedings conducted therein is indispensable. Without him, how is the public to be informed of how justice is being administered in our courts? The journalist has been engaged upon this task in much the same way as he performs it today for well over 150 years. In her work, Justice and Journalism (1974), p. 24, Marjorie Jones, making a study of the influence of newspaper reporting upon the administration of justice by magistrates, stated, having referred to a case decided in 1831:</p>

The journalist entered, and has remained, in magistrates&#8217; courts as a member of the public taking notes. The constant presence of newspaper men in magistrates&#8217; courts provided not only a record of the proceedings but also a means of communication with the public. Through newspaper reports magistrates had access to a wider audience beyond the justice room or the police office. Communication is particularly important for deterrent sentencing, which requires that potential offenders shall be aware of the punishment they are likely to incur.&#8221;</p>

In the provinces, particularly, the same reporter might often cover the local courts for year after year. These men regarded themselves as representing the absent public. And they were the first to concern themselves with the defence of the defenceless in the summary courts.</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;A newspaper reporter is in every court. He sits through the dullest cases in the Court of Appeal and the most trivial cases before the magistrates. He says nothing but writes a lot. He notes all that goes on and makes a fair and accurate report of it. He supplies it for use either in the national press or in the local press according to the public interest it commands. He is, I verily believe, the watchdog of justice. If he is to do his work properly and effectively we must hold fast to the principle that every case must be heard and determined in open court. It must not take place behind locked doors. Every member of the public must be entitled to report in the public press all that he has seen and heard. The reason for this rule is the very salutary influence which publicity has for those who work in the light of it. The judge will be careful to see that the trial is fairly and properly conducted if he realises that any unfairness or impropriety on his part will be noted by those in court and may be reported in the press. He will be more anxious to give a correct decision if he knows that his reasons must justify themselves at the bar of public opinion.&#8221;</p>

The majority can participate only indirectly, by exercising their rights as citizens to vote, express their opinions, make representations to the authorities, form pressure groups and so on. But the majority cannot participate in the public life of their society in these ways if they are not alerted to and informed about matters which call or may call for consideration and action. It is very largely through the media, including of course the press, that they will be so alerted and informed. The proper functioning of a modern participatory democracy requires that the media be free, active, professional and inquiring. For this reason the courts, here and elsewhere, have recognised the cardinal importance of press freedom and the need for any restriction on that freedom to be proportionate and no more than is necessary to promote the legitimate object of the restriction.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The value of free speech in a particular case must be measured in specifics. Not all types of speech have an equal value. For example, no prisoner would ever be permitted to have interviews with a journalist to publish pornographic material or to give vent to so-called hate speech. Given the purpose of a sentence of imprisonment, a prisoner can also not claim to join in a debate on the economy or on political issues by way of interviews with journalists. In these respects the prisoner&#8217;s right to free speech is outweighed by deprivation of liberty by the sentence of a court, and the need for discipline and control in prisons. But the free speech at stake in the present cases is qualitatively of a very different order. The prisoners are in prison because they are presumed to have been properly convicted. They wish to challenge the safety of their convictions. In principle it is not easy to conceive of a more important function which free speech might fulfil.&#8221;</p>

The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither article has precedence over or &#8216;trumps&#8217; the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.

In my judgment, for the reasons given by Mr Price in his submissions in <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton</span>, and repeated by Mr Warby, Mr Wolanski and Mr Hudson in their submissions before me, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/97/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(4)</ref> has to be read as permitting the court to dispense with the prohibition on publication in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(2)</ref> where the right of free expression under Article 10 or other Convention rights require it.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That this is the true view is, in my judgment, supported by two additional considerations. In the first place, as Mr Wolanski points out, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(2)</ref> is not confined to cases heard in private.

And it would also mean that the power of the Family Division to permit the identification of a child would be significantly more limited than the power of the Court of Appeal (to which, as <span style="font-style:italic">Pelling v Bruce-Williams (Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs Intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/845" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 845" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 845</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 823" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 823</ref>, shows, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(2)</ref> does not apply).

The Court notes that the Austrian Non-Contentious Proceedings Act now in force gives the judge discretion to hold family-law and guardianship proceedings in public and contains criteria for the exercise of such discretion. However, no such safeguards were provided for in the 1854 Non-Contentious Proceedings Act. It is therefore not decisive that the applicant did not request a public hearing, since domestic law did not provide for such a possibility and the courts&#8217; practice was to hold hearings in camera.</p>

The present case concerns the transfer of custody of the first applicant&#8217;s son to a public institution, namely the Youth Welfare Office, thus, opposing an individual to the State. The Court considers that in this sphere, the reasons for excluding a case from public scrutiny must be subject to careful examination. This was not the position in the present case, since the law was silent on the issue and the courts simply followed a long-established practice to hold hearings in camera without considering the special features of the case.&#8221;</p>

There are two aspects of the latter which in the present context, as it seems to me, are of fundamental importance. The first I have already touched upon.

By reference to what criteria is a judge to decide whether or not to accede to an application to disapply rule 4.16(7)? The answer can only be that the judge must apply the Convention, ensuring that his decision is Convention-compliant. Rule 4.16(7), after all, falls to be justified in accordance with the Article 6(1) tests of what is &#8220;required&#8221; or (as the case may be) what is &#8220;strictly necessary&#8221;. And, as the decisions of the Strasbourg court in both <span style="font-style:italic">B v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 34 EHRR 529" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 34 EHRR 529</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 261" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 261</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Moser v Austria</span> [2006] 3 FCR 107 make clear, such a blanket rule can be justified only if it remains &#8220;subject to the court&#8217;s control&#8221; and only if the court exercises a proper discretion in the circumstances of the particular case. Moreover in a public law case, as <span style="font-style:italic">Moser v Austria</span> [2006] 3 FCR 107 makes clear, &#8220;the reasons for excluding a case from public scrutiny must be subject to careful examination&#8221; and the judge must &#8220;consider &#8230; the special features of the case.&#8221; </p>

I agree, therefore, with Mr Wolanski, when he submitted that rule 4.16(7) is properly to be regarded simply as a &#8216;default provision&#8217; but not as a provision indicating some heavy presumption in favour of privacy. In my judgment, rule 4.16(7) must be read, construed and applied compatibly with the Convention. Once the point has been raised, the outcome must be determined in accordance with the Convention, &#8216;balancing&#8217; all the various interests which are engaged and <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>giving any special pre-eminence to the claim to privacy. Moreover, and as Thorpe LJ pointed out, a judge must be alert to the dangers inherent in what he called the &#8220;strong inherited convention of privacy&#8221; and careful not to be &#8220;prejudiced by the tradition or an unconscious preference for the atmosphere created by a hearing in chambers.&#8221;</p>

The absence in this case of any criminal prosecution, it is suggested, makes the family proceedings all the more particularly worthy of proper analysis and coverage.</p>

It is less likely in these circumstances that the evidence will be misrepresented by a partial or one&#8211;sided account provided by one or more of the parties, either while the case is underway or after it has concluded. The risk of one&#8211;sided or inaccurate reporting while the current restrictions remain is, if anything, a reason for greater openness, not greater restriction.

If, as the parents allege, they have lost three children and stand at risk of losing a fourth due to deficiencies in the system, then there is a pressing need for the true facts to be exposed. If, on the other hand, the parents are wrong, and the system has performed conscientiously, competently and correctly, then it is equally highly desirable that this should be known and publicised. Given all the publicity there has already been, the issue is in the public domain already. It is, therefore, important for public confidence in the system &#8211; public confidence in the court &#8211; that both the resolution of the issue, and the way in which it has been resolved, should be known. For that purpose, it is said, nothing short of access to the court along the lines proposed will suffice. On the contrary, to cut off the stream of information already provided to the public at the very point where the court is poised to take important decisions, would, it is said, be both artificial and potentially harmful to the public interest.</p>

It is difficult, so it is said, to identify how a public hearing or public identification would be injurious to Brandon&#8217;s welfare. He is far too young to be aware of the proceedings. It will be years before he learns of them or is able to understand their significance. If a child is &#8220;too young at this stage to be directly affected by anything in the media&#8221; the court must ask whether the child would be <span style="font-style:italic">indirectly</span> affected by the publicity which is in prospect, for instance by its having a grave impact on the child&#8217;s carers: see the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Roddy (A Child) (Identification: Restriction on Publication)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/2927" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 2927 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 2927 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 949" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 949</ref> at para [71].

In relation to any impact upon him when he is older, counsel pray in aid the sceptical observations of the President and Wall LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton</span> to which I referred in paragraphs [63]&#8211;[64] above.

It is, she asserts, an accepted fact that candour and frankness is much more likely in proceedings such as these where there is privacy surrounding the giving of evidence. She suggests that what she calls the matter of actual reporting relevance is the court&#8217;s determination and conclusions. Identification of individual social workers, of NCC&#8217;s legal representatives and of expert witnesses is opposed as being &#8220;unnecessary, unhelpful in the pursuit of NCC&#8217;s wider aims and tasks, and irrelevant to the issues&#8221;.  </p>

As Mr Bennett puts it, the guardian&#8217;s view is that the parents&#8217; focus needs to be exclusively upon Brandon, to ensure his safety and wellbeing. &#8220;They should not be sidetracked by arguing old battles and anything which raises or increases the possibility of this is likely to have an adverse effect upon their availability for and care of Brandon and therefore upon Brandon himself.&#8221; Mr Bennett expresses concern at the prospect of what he calls persistent approaches by members of the public in the streets whilst the parents and Brandon are going about their daily business and &#8220;media scrums&#8221;. Further media attention, the guardian fears, will only escalate interest among the local community. That said, the guardian would have no objection, she tells me, to a suitably anonymised judicial press release. </p>

This is not merely a point of general application. It has, at it seems to me, a particular resonance in this particular case. Rightly or wrongly, correctly or otherwise &#8211; and for present purposes it matters not which &#8211; the media have suggested that the parents and their children A, B and C have been, and that the parents and Brandon are at risk of being, the victims of a miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances there is a pressing need for public confidence to be restored &#8211; either by the public and convincing demonstration that there has <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>been a miscarriage of justice or, as the case may be, by public acknowledgement that there has been. That is not, of course, the purpose of the current proceedings, and it is very possible that the outcome of the judicial process, whatever it may be, will not be a clarity and certainty that all will accept. But as few obstacles as possible should be placed in the way of the media doing their job. For in the proper exercise by the media of their investigative and other functions there exists perhaps the best chance of the truth, whatever it may be, emerging at the end of the day. And that, at least in the circumstances of this case, points to the media having access not merely to more information than Judge Curl&#8217;s order would permit them but access also to the forthcoming hearing.</p>

Those who without justification attack the family justice system can all too easily do so by feeding the media tendentious accounts of proceedings whilst hypocritically sheltering behind the very privacy of the proceedings which, although they affect to condemn, they in fact turn to their own advantage. It is all too easy to attack the system when the system itself prevents anyone correcting the misrepresentations being fed to the media: see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris; Attorney-General v Harris </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 895" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 895</ref> at para [386].  </p>

In the first place it suggests that too relentless an enforcement of the privacy of family court proceedings may be counter-productive and that the courts should perhaps in future be more willing than they have been in the past to exercise the disclosure jurisdiction so as to permit matters such as these to be put into the public domain. Secondly, if disclosure is to be permitted, the person seeking disclosure &#8211; here the mother &#8211; may have to be prepared to take the rough with the smooth. The mother is not necessarily entitled to set the media agenda. If she wants to put some parts of the case into the public domain, then she may have to accept that other less appealing parts of the case are also put into the public domain.&#8221;</p>

The ability to correct false impressions and misconceived facts will go further to help secure the Art 6 and Art 8 rights of all involved than would the court&#8217;s silence which in this case will only promote further speculation and adverse comment that will damage both the interests of those involved and the family justice system itself.&#8221;</p>

Moreover, if leave is confined in practice to those cases which are, for some reason, thought to be worthy of reporting in a law report, the sample of cases which will ever come to public attention is not merely very small but also very unrepresentative.</p>

It should not be necessary to show that there is some particular reason to justify why leave should be given in the particular case, let alone any need to justify leave on the basis that the judgment deals with some supposedly interesting point of law, practice or principle. For my own part, I should have thought that the proper approach ought to the other way round. It is not so much for those who seek leave to publish an anonymised judgment to justify their request; surely it is for those who resist such leave to demonstrate some good reason why the judgment should not be published even in a suitably anonymised form.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case there are, I think, overwhelmingly strong reasons for authorising the disclosure &#8211; perhaps subject to some degree of necessary anonymisation &#8211; of Judge Barham&#8217;s two judgments. And in many cases adoption of the practice recommended by Wall LJ will be sufficient to meet the needs of transparency and to facilitate appropriate public debate. But cases of alleged miscarriage of justice seem to me to stand on a somewhat different footing. After all, what is being alleged in such cases &#8211; what is being asserted in this case &#8211; is that there has been a failure of the <span style="font-style:italic">judicial </span>process. Sometimes it may be said that that is the fault, the responsibility, of the judge. Here, as it happens, responsibility seems to be attached more to deficiencies in the evidence and what are said to have been failings on the part of the local authority. But on either basis, if what is being said is that there has been a failing in the <span style="font-style:italic">judicial </span>process, it might be thought &#8211; and certainly will be thought by some &#8211; to be less than satisfactory that the only accounts of what has happened, the only explanations to be given to the public, are those which a judge thinks it appropriate to include either in a judgment or in a judicially approved press release. After all, the complaint may be that the judge has misunderstood the evidence, overlooked some vital piece of evidence or gone against the weight of the evidence &#8211; and how can that case be made if the only material available to the public is the very judgment whose alleged deficiencies are under challenge? How can the media properly assess things if denied access to the hearing? </p>

I do not doubt the strength of the guardian&#8217;s views, and in particular the concerns she has as to the possible effect on Brandon if the applicants achieve what they desire.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first is that the risks to Brandon are in significant measure speculative and in any event not as large as the guardian would have it. Given all the publicity there has already been &#8211; and it is not said that it has been in any way damaging to Brandon &#8211; one has to ask, taking a realistic view, what additional risks he is likely to run if exposed to further publicity. Moreover, one has to bear in mind that even if Judge Curl&#8217;s order were to remain in place, there can be no assurance that there will not be continuing publicity, and continuing publicity which, however much anonymised, those &#8216;in the know&#8217;, including, it may well be, many in the local community, will readily appreciate is about Brandon and his parents. The media, after all, are adept at working their way &#8211; quite lawfully, I might add &#8211; around even the most drastic restraints.</p>

In the particular circumstances of this particular case, an intense focus on the comparative importance of all the various rights which are in play leads in the final analysis to an ultimate balancing which satisfies me that, subject to one important qualification, the outcome contended for by the applicants involves no disproportionate interference with Brandon&#8217;s rights, whilst any greater degree of restraint would indeed involve a disproportionate interference with the applicants&#8217; rights.</p>

His first name and his photograph are already in the public domain, and those &#8216;in the know&#8217; and, I suspect, many in his local community are well aware that Mr and Mrs Hardingham (as they have hitherto been referred to) are in fact Mr and Mrs Webster. There is, in my judgment, no disproportionate interference with Brandon&#8217;s rights in permitting him and his parents to be identified by their true name. On the other hand, and in the particular circumstances of this case, it would, in my judgment, be a disproportionate interference with the parents&#8217; rights to deny them what they want, the right not merely to argue their case in public but to do so under their true name and not under a pseudonym.</p>
