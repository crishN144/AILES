[EMP] started to become upset and responded; &#8220;because he hurts me.&#8221; [EMP] and I then attempted to explore the alternative ways in which he could re-establish/maintain a paternal relationship which did not involve him either being alone with his father or having face to face contact. Having listened very carefully, [EMP] clearly stated &#8220;I do not want to see him. I don&#8217;t want any contact.&#8221; When specifically asked whether he would wish to agree to any about indirect contact option, [EMP] again clearly and somewhat wearily responded &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any contact.&#8221;</span></p>

Both parents and EMP need time to reflect and recover from all that has gone before. EMP&#8217; established level of paternal fear is of some concern and if he is unable to make sense of this over the passage of time, he may require further support around this to manage these complex and potentially emotionally unhealthy feelings and make better sense of his life story. Whilst recognising the impact on DG if the Court decides that paternal contact is not in EMP&#8217;s interests and what would be a natural wish for him to [issue] a further application to the Court within a short timeframe will be of no benefit to EMP as is most likely to cause him further distress and entrenchment of his position. That said, these highlighted issues need to be balanced against DG&#8217;s further right to apply to make an application to the Court should he wish to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

DG explained that it was his intention to take legal proceedings against the barrister who represented <span style="font-style:italic">KB</span> at the December 2021 because that barrister had failed to highlight to the then judge the appropriate law and therefore has cost DG money by setting up a situation that could be appealed. Leaving aside argument about whether there is any real possibility that someone could claim compensation from an opposing parties&#8217; legal representative for failing to mention something in court, the comments made by me at paragraph 100 of the fact-finding judgment pertain to this suggestion &#8211; it is a highly speculative suggestion that in no way justifies a refusal to pay or attempt to pay the costs order.</p>

A child usually has two parents. A child does not choose his or her parents. The<span style="font-style:italic"> child&#8217;s right</span> to know and have a relationship with both parents is a powerful imperative that should only be displaced in exceptional circumstances and where the child&#8217;s welfare will be sufficiently compromised by that imperative being given concrete form to justify substantial interference. A child has, in my view, a right to <span style="font-style:italic">know</span> from whom they came and it is generally a long term right and welfare benefit for a child to have the building blocks to, in time, reach their own decisions about their parents. Children cannot and in my view should not be shielded from <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> mistakes, flaws, poor parenting or indeed <span style="font-style:italic">harm</span> and the risk of harm that a relationship with a parent may bring.

As EMP enters and progresses through adolescence he will have a growing understanding that he is the product of two people. They are his genetic make-up and although he may or may not have scientific understanding of that reality, the intangible quality of inherited characteristics and a sense of origin generally becomes an increasing consideration as children grasp the concepts. Given EMP&#8217;s obvious intelligence, it seems to me very likely that for EMP an understanding of these concepts is inevitable.</p>

That behaviour represents both a direct and indirect threat of harm to EMP. The direct threat originates (but does not end) in the possibility of a repetition of such behaviour which EMP may witness or become aware of.

Whilst I have found that <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> aspect of that negativity had been as a consequence of KB&#8217;s influence on EMP, I also found for reasons I explained at length that it has also been contributed to by DG&#8217;s own direct behaviour towards EMP. Whilst KB&#8217;s view of DG is unlikely to change, an acceptance by DG of some responsibility would allow at least one aspect of EMP&#8217;s negativity towards his father to be addressed with the prospect of an improvement in the quality of contact and thereby EMP&#8217;s own view of his father. In the absence of such improvement, the court would be, in effect, forcing an intelligent and sensitive child to maintain a relationship with someone with whom he has no wish so to do.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Third, the conflict of narrative extends to more medium- and long-term considerations. Children inevitably ask about their parents&#8217; relationship and indeed their parents themselves. DG considers this entire situation to be orchestrated by KB and denies, in effect, all of the findings that form the foundation for EMP and KB&#8217;s past life with regard to the father. The conflict with the narrative of his primary carer is incapable of being compromised.</p>

Assuming (as I do) that KB is not intending to tell EMP her truth (which aligns with the court&#8217;s findings) of the relationship and EMP&#8217;s father now but also assuming that gradually that narrative will form part of KB&#8217;s explanation to KB as he increases in age and maturity, the potential future harm can be demonstrated by imagining EMP asking one question: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">why did the court involve someone who treated my mother that way in my life</span>?&#8221; It is a question which I can answer with theoretical manifestations of the concepts expressed above but I find it difficult to contemplate answers that would be truly satisfactory. There may come a time when EMP wishes, notwithstanding what has happened in the past, to know his father, for all of the reasons alluded to above when discussing genetic make-up. That will be his decision to take but not one that in my evaluation should be imposed upon him at this stage.</p>

The father&#8217;s repudiation of my findings (and therefore the mother and child&#8217;s &#8216;truth&#8217;) leaves no room for any form of therapeutic work known to this court, be that at an individual level (e.g. a Domestic Violence Perpetrators Course) or as a &#8216;family&#8217;.

The logic applied often rests upon the fact that a surname represents a tangible and important link to an immutable fact i.e. parentage. The context of such applications is often parental dispute where the court is left with the strong impression (or indeed concludes) that the aim of one or other parent is to distance the child from the other parent without real justification but rather as part of the ongoing adult dispute.</p>

The concept of rival presumptions is not helpful, although I entirely accept that the fact of parenthood raises the welfare question, hence the right of a parent (with or without parental responsibility) to make an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> without permission (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 10(4)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>). There is also ample case-law describing the imperative in favour of a continuing relationship between both parents and a child so that ordinarily a child's upbringing should be provided by both of his parents and where that is not in the child's interests by one of them with the child having the benefit of a meaningful relationship with both. A judge would not be criticised for identifying that, as a very weighty, relevant factor, the significance of the parenthood of an unmarried father should not be under estimated."</span></p>

However, in light of his view with respect to his father&#8217;s involvement in his life, it is clear that he is unlikely to think of his father as having responsibility for him. Indeed, the father&#8217;s actions (as set out in the fact-finding judgment) reveal the father taking insufficient responsibility for EMP, including financially. However, the key issues must relate to what EMP is likely to want his father to be able to do with respect to his PR?

First, on consideration of the day-to-day elements of PR that remain to be exercised it is difficult to identify what should be left or what may raise itself as an issue in the future. Secondly, and more importantly, in this case the &#8216;representative&#8217; value of having PR is in my view significant. PR is important not just for the practical &#8216;rights and responsibilities&#8217; it manifests but also because of its intangible quality as a statement of those rights and responsibilities. From the mother&#8217;s (and I am sure in due course the child&#8217;s) perspective it is difficult to ignore the fact that however &#8216;ring fenced&#8217; or restricted, the father retaining PR represents an individual who has raped her retaining a legally recognised statement of his ability to involve himself and be consulted regarding the child. I fail to see how in the circumstances of this case that is a proportionate outcome.</p>

This was an investigation into the allegation by the mother within an application for contact made by the father that in the marriage he had perpetrated acts of violence towards her, including in the presence of one or other of the two children of the marriage, and indeed had to a limited extent been violent towards the older child.&#160;</span></p>

In particular and importantly the court concluded that (i) the father&#8217;s treatment of the mother included acts of abusive behaviour of a very serious nature and (b) that the mother&#8217;s influence upon EMP (which informs <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> of his negative view of his father) was consequent upon a rational and understandable set of beliefs about the father which had, at their genesis, the father&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

Further, the graduated fee rates have not increased since 2013. I make no observation on either point beyond referring to them to highlight that that there is regularly a <span style="font-style:italic">substantial</span> difference between the amounts paid to counsel when instructed privately and those who are paid through public funding. Of course, it is a matter for the individual instructing the barrister/barrister&#8217;s clerk to agree fees with counsel and the other parties have no standing with respect to that negotiation. Neither, in particular in family cases, where there is a wide discretion (see above) with respect to costs can such negotiation take place with any assumption that those fees will ultimately be paid by the opposing party, even if they are largely &#8216;successful&#8217; with respect to the relevant issues.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The inclusion of the above observations in this judgment should not be taken as an indication that they are factually or legally correct. I did not hear evidence in the fact-finding hearing from CG1 (and was not asked to do so). My observations concerning CG1 were limited to those set out at paragraphs 290 to 293 of the fact-finding judgment. The <span style="font-style:italic">merits</span> of such a costs application are not straightforward &#8211; for example and as counterbalance to that which the mother sets out above, KB was represented by counsel at the hearing in December 2021 (the subject of the successful appeal) and my understanding is that no mention of PD3A was made on KB&#8217;s behalf. Further, as I observe in the fact-finding judgment and as is set out in the chronology within that judgment, identification of the precise point at which CG1 fell into error and the degree of that error is not a simple matter. An order of November 2020 records that &#8220;mother is not opposed to contact in principle but states that it is too soon for the child for unsupported contact&#8221;. A different judge rejected the mother&#8217;s application to change the Guardian in March 2021 and the allegations of rape was not made in a statement to the court until October 2021 (see fact-finding judgment). The allegation of rape was an important factor in my decision to hold a fact-finding hearing. Ultimately, the error identified by the appeal was judicial - Guardians advise, they do not decide.</p>

In the context of the pandemic providing numerous experiences of dealing with large numbers of hearings remotely, sometimes of considerable length and complexity, I will simply observe that this is the first time I have had the experience of such circumstances giving rise to the assertion that a remote hearing substantively added to the difficulty in taking instructions, absent technical difficulties. Throughout all of the hearings in this matter (where in person or remote) and to the best of my memory I never denied an application by any party for time to take instructions, consider their position or otherwise have appropriate breaks to be able to participate in the hearings fully. I make that observation not as a negative or positive point with regard to the issue of the costs application but to explain why I have not taken the assertion into account in reaching my decision, absent detail with respect to the contribution such asserted difficulty made in a way that was relevant to this specific issue.</p>

For example, the court may decide to make directions in relation to matters such as the structure and the timing of the hearing, the formality of language to be used in the court and whether (if facilities allow for it) the parties should be enabled to enter the court building through different routes and use different waiting areas.</span></p>
