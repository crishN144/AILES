[&#8216;FT&#8217;] left and when he returned 1-2 days later his face was bandaged. Mum told me not to tell anyone about this and was not concerned about the fact that I had seen it. </span></p>

I think for as long as I can remember Mum has never cleaned any room. I clean her bedroom and see bottles of alcohol, white powder on flat surfaces such as [on the] iPad, picture frames, lots of &#8216;baggies&#8217; and once I tidied up and found a pot of pee under [the father of the youngest child, &#8216;FF&#8217;s] side of the bed. I clear up vomit, they trash it, they stay in there sometimes for two days. It stinks so bad. When they leave the room, I clean it again and the cycle starts&#8230;there is often limited food in the house but I cook from scratch with whatever is in. Many times there has been not a lot of food so I have not eaten. I made sure all the children ate before me. Mum insisted that I make her and [&#8216;FF&#8217;] food, although they rarely eat with is and they leave it until they are not drunk/high.</span></p>

Mum told me I was a bad sister and took away my TV and my phone. I was so exhausted, the previous night was it was my Yr10 mocks.

None of us ever asked for anything good for our birthdays as we knew she spent all the money on drugs/drink&#8230;last year for my birthday she gave me &#163;50. I went to Asda on my own, bought a couple of books and some noodles and spent the day alone in my house. There were no celebrations, no cake, no friends&#8230;[Mum] had been in bed all day&#8230;it was a miserable day.</span></p>

It&#8217;s tough&#8230;when I get home nobody is there. When I don&#8217;t have a phone, I have no idea where both [&#8216;FF&#8217;] and Mum are. As soon as they return&#8230;they tend to rush upstairs to their room and I see nothing of them both for a day. If Mum wants something she either bangs on the floor or, if I have a phone, she texts me. The messages are so garbled as she is high. [&#8216;FF&#8217;] and Mum ask for drink or food or a container for vomit. When they &#8216;come down&#8217; I am like a runner, I am constantly getting them food, water, towels, plus looking after all the children. I have not been to school much lately as when they sleep for hours/days, nobody but me looks after [&#8216;G&#8217;].</span></p>

The Local Authority is a public body with a statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of children and support of families. Where that work has resulted in Court proceedings, the Local Authority is held accountable for its actions with families by the Court. The need for a public body to be identified when acting in respect of citizens is important. Naming the Local Authority in a public document in this case, however, may set clear geographical boundaries to the location of the children, all of whom remain vulnerable. Naming this Local Authority may serve to undermine the redaction of other parts of the judgment. In this case, having balanced the risks between transparency of justice on behalf of the State where life changing decisions are made for the children and ensuring their privacy, welfare and safeguarding needs are taken seriously and protected, the Court concludes that the public interest in identifying the applicant Local Authority is outweighed by the risks of identification of the children in this large sibling group.</span></p>

No party sought the mother or &#8216;FF&#8217; to give evidence. &#8216;FT&#8217; was permitted to attend the hearing remotely by video. He lives a considerable distance away from this Court in another part of the country. The Court was informed on the first day of the Final Hearing that &#8216;FT&#8217; could only make himself available to attend for 1 &#189; hours, as he had work commitments. He was able to hear some of the evidence of the Social Worker before he absented himself. He was due to give evidence on the second day of the Final Hearing, remotely by video. He did not attend. The Court was informed initially that he could not access the video link. When he was afforded the opportunity to give evidence by telephone in the alternative, using a freephone number, the Court was informed that &#8216;FT&#8217; declined. An oral application was then made to adjourn the Final Hearing so that he could give evidence on another day. The Court was then informed that &#8216;FT&#8217; would not make himself available to give evidence at any point in the month of February, due to his work priorities, expressing &#8220;extreme frustration&#8221; and then being unavailable when further attempts were made by Counsel to receive his instructions by telephone. The adjournment application was not supported by any of the parties. The Court dismissed &#8216;FT&#8217;s application to adjourn for reasons given in an extempore oral judgment. In short, &#8216;FT&#8217; had been aware of the Final Hearing dates for some time and had adequate time to make alternative arrangements with regard to his self-employment. There was no solid reason to conclude that &#8216;FT&#8217; would make himself available to give evidence on another day, if the proceedings were adjourned. Moreover, the children all required decisions to be made in respect of their futures without further delay, to provide them with certainty and stability, in proceedings which had already exceeded the statutory 26-week timetable. The adjournment application having been dismissed, the Court proceeded to determine the case in &#8216;FT&#8217;s absence.  &#8216;FT&#8217; remained fully represented throughout by Counsel, who proceeded to undertake full and proper cross-examination of the Children's Guardian and make full and detailed written submissions at the conclusion of the Final Hearing, properly advancing &#8216;FT&#8217;s case. </span></p>

Prior to that, the family was the subject of involvement from two other neighbouring Local Authorities. There concerns have remained consistent, regarding domestic abuse, drug and alcohol misuse, poor management of parental mental health and extremely poor living conditions. The older children have had to take on caring responsibilities for their younger siblings. There have been multiple police call-outs due to domestic abuse within the mother and &#8216;FF&#8217;s relationship. The children have been exposed to their mother&#8217;s and &#8216;FF&#8217;s drug and alcohol use. In August 2022 there was an incident where &#8216;G&#8217; ingested white power from a cup. There were concerns that it could be cocaine as both her parents had been using the drug and her mother appeared agitated and had clumps of white powder up her nose. In November 2022 &#8216;FF&#8217; was arrested and charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, drug driving and driving without insurance. The children have reported physical chastisement from the mother and &#8216;FF&#8217; who have also encouraged the older children to hit their younger siblings as a form of discipline. The home conditions have been observed to be extremely poor when unannounced visits have taken place. In August 2022, the police attended the family home following an allegation that the mother had been raped by &#8216;FF&#8217;. The police report notes, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;mother was reviewed, and the police deemed she may be on drugs at the time. Police described the house as an absolute mess, cigarette butts were all over the floor, the house really smells, there is little food but there is some in the freezer. Only tinned tomatoes in the cupboard. There was a child sleeping on the floor in the dining room. Poor mattress and filthy beddings, awful conditions overall&#8221;.</span></p>

Further, Dr &#8216;T&#8217; concluded that the mother would not likely be able to protect the children from harm if they were placed in her care. She would need to undertake substantial intervention to address her needs before the children could be placed in her care. Dr &#8216;T&#8217; recommended offering the mother ongoing support from a drug and alcohol service together with a care coordinator as part of her assessment and treatment, noting that the mother, &#8220;appears not to be fully open about her drug and alcohol use and the impact of such dependency&#8230;but with minimal motivation to address her drug use, the likelihood of success is low&#8221;. Dr &#8216;T&#8217; recommended a psychological intervention such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy over twelve weeks and support from a domestic abuse worker, after the completion of the recommended substance misuse intervention. </span></p>

No positive memories.&#8221; She reported, &#8220;every time I came out of class, I was targeted by bullies,&#8221; and felt &#8220;overwhelmed managing this and the challenges in the family home&#8221;, being &#8220;battled on both sides.&#8221; &#8216;A&#8217; told Dr &#8216;T&#8217;, in respect of the mother&#8217;s drug use, &#8220;You could tell that the drugs were changing her as a person,&#8221; noting that the mother became more violent towards her and her siblings, and &#8220;her judgement was getting more clouded and becoming more spiteful in how she would deal with us.&#8221; She described at times being taken by &#8216;FF&#8217; to collect and sell drugs, stating, &#8220;I knew if I got caught, I wouldn&#8217;t have to go back home.&#8221; She described &#8216;FF&#8217; backing her siblings into a corner and repeatedly hitting them. She described how &#8216;FF&#8217; did this to &#8216;E&#8217; &#8220;so bad, he was screaming and nothing was coming out.&#8221;  She described how &#8216;D&#8217; was mistreated &#8220;more than any of us&#8221; and was largely used as a &#8216;scapegoat&#8217; by the mother and FF, &#8220;if she did the tiniest think wrong, he would hit her and blame her for things and if they couldn&#8217;t get drugs, they would blame her for everything.&#8221; &#8216;A&#8217; was clear in expressing her wish that she did not want to return to her mother or &#8216;FF&#8217; and she would not want any of her siblings to return to their mother&#8217;s care. Further, she expressed clearly that she does not want any further contact with her mother. Dr &#8216;T&#8217; concluded that &#8216;A&#8217; is struggling with aspects of her daily functioning and relationships. &#8216;A&#8217; experiences levels of anxiety in public, largely due to previous experiences of critical judgements in the family home, leading her to fear the same judgement from others. She has had her emotional needs neglected. The mother putting her drug use and FF before &#8216;A&#8217; has impacted on her sense of self-worth and self-esteem. Further, &#8216;A&#8217;s ongoing wellbeing is impacted by the mother&#8217;s position towards her, accusing her of having told lies. &#8216;A&#8217; has experienced being a carer to her mother and siblings and now feels rejected by her mother through the denial of her experiences. She is not able to recall positive memories from her childhood and &#8220;her account is suggestive,&#8221; Dr &#8216;T&#8217; concludes, &#8220;of considerable abuse and neglect&#8230;Her current presentation is suggestive of a young person who has been through such ongoing trauma in their life.&#8221;</span></p>

She described, &#8220;a lot of negative male influence&#8221; at home and her mother&#8217;s &#8220;bad pick of boyfriends.&#8221; She described being asked to go with &#8216;FF&#8217; to get drugs. &#8216;B&#8217; was noted to remain very guarded about her experiences, stating that she would, &#8220;prefer not to say anything&#8221; and that she can shut emotions off: &#8220;system shut down.&#8221; She expressed being keen to remain in foster care and to have contact with her siblings. She expressed not wanting to have any contact with her mother as, &#8220;she wasn&#8217;t there for me&#8230;I was blamed for everything. I took the blame mainly for things.&#8221; She told Dr &#8216;T&#8217;, &#8220;the closer you are to people, the harder it is to open up&#8230;I have made people cry by telling them only part of the story.&#8221;  Dr &#8216;T&#8217; concluded that &#8216;B&#8217;s, &#8220;positive upturn in mood is attributed to her leaving the family home and being in the current foster care placement.&#8221; &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8220;has reported much traumatic experiences in her childhood that are highly concerning. This includes physical chastisement, neglect, lack of supervision, exploitation around being taken by an adult to procure drugs, exposure to adult conversations and information inappropriate for a child of her age, parental conflict, parental substance misuse and parental mental health difficulties. The impact of this has been significant&#8230;in that she herself identified as not feeling safe whilst in the care of her mother and [&#8216;FF&#8217;]&#8230;I was of the view that [&#8216;B&#8217;] also likely experienced developmental trauma&#8230;which includes difficulties in her level of attachment to adult caregivers, emotional distress&#8230;and relationship difficulties that impact on [her] being able to trust others and utilise support made available to her.&#8221;  Dr &#8216;T&#8217; concluded that &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8220;reported no positive connection and/or attachment to her mother, highlighting a lack of trust that she appears to have generalised to all others. This impacts upon her ability to be open with those around her, regarding her own emotional needs&#8230;[she] has developed a coping strategy which consists of supressing her own emotions.&#8221;</span></p>

However, it is apparent that [&#8216;C&#8217;] has had both difficult traumatic experiences that she has self-reported and from her siblings also and that she has presented with strong emotions.

They present with difficulties around managing their emotions, attachment related difficulties in trusting and being care for by a care giver, attention seeking behaviour to get their needs met, which can be extreme, including self-harming behaviour. They are additionally repeating and expressing multiple disclosures around their experiences in the care o [the mother and &#8216;FF&#8217;] and this includes awareness of adult information&#8230;the children present as having damaged sibling relationships with identity and self-esteem difficulties, anxiety, intermittent low mood, with some of the children&#8230;having reported experiencing exploitation from [&#8216;FF&#8217; and the mother]...the impact appears to be that the children have experienced developmental trauma which has impacted on the sibling relations.

He has not taken accountability for his behaviours in recent reports of domestic abuse with his current partner nor historically...[his current partner] called the police and there is a reference to strangulation.

The main concern is around [&#8216;FT&#8217;s] history and the traumatic impact this has had on the children within their earlier years. The true extent of his relationship with [the mother] and criminal activity is not completely known and we are not entirely sure how much of the opinions the children have are based on stories they have been told and what they have experienced and what would happen if [&#8216;P&#8217;] and [&#8216;FT&#8217;] are to have broken up and the contingency plan surrounding this. There have been three reports of alleged concerns of behaviour that highlights concerns for domestic abuse in his current relationship including non-fatal strangulation, throwing items whilst [&#8216;FT&#8217;s] child was in the property and a verbal argument which led to calling the police, which highlights that [&#8216;FT&#8217;] would not be recommended to be in a position to raise all four of his children alone without the children being at risk of further harm. The true extent of the trauma [&#8216;FT&#8217;] inflicted on the children&#8217;s earlier years cannot be minimised and needs to be considered, including the children&#8217;s current views and feeling surrounding [&#8216;FT&#8217;]. [He] states he has now turned his life around and the evidence supports this to an extent but there are still concerns for current domestic abuse. The children would require a lot of connection work to build this relationship, contact and trust. Therefore, he has also not been recommended to take on the sole caring responsibility of his children.&#8221;</span></p>

Currently [he] lives with his partner and daughter&#8230;During the assessment [he] admits he dealt drugs when he was in a relationship with [the mother]. In the assessment [he] appears to recognise that the children experienced poor parenting at times when he lived with them. When I spoke with [him] we spoke about the arguments and violence between himself and [the mother]. He told me that the children were not affected by their arguments because they were not present in the room. [He] did not accept that even if they were not in the room time [the children] would have been frightened by their arguments. [&#8216;A&#8217;] has spoken about [him] smashing a plate in his face as the most frightening time of her life. Given [&#8216;C, D, E and F&#8217;] have already lived with their mother and [&#8216;FT&#8217;] when drugs, domestic abuse and poor parental mental health affected the care they were given, it is very important that there is no risk of this happening again&#8230;There must also be an understanding that the children are likely to have memories of the time their father lived with them&#8230;We also know from the chronology and police information that the children witnessed violence and drug use, both of which are likely to have been frightening for them. As a result, it is unsurprising that [&#8216;C, D, E and F&#8217;] appear to have mixed feelings about spending time with their father which does need to be guided by the children&#8217;s needs and views about seeing him.&#8221;</span></p>

The reality is that the demand on his time, in terms of parenting his children, is going to be vast. That would need to be his priority. There is no evidence he is in a position to offer children the time and the parenting they need.&#8221; Further, the Children's Guardian told the Court, &#8220;I spoke to [FT] in January 2024. He felt that the parenting assessment had not highlighted the strengths he offered to the children. There was information in that assessment that raised concerns as well as strengths. The concern about his current relationship with his partner&#8230;further, the contact he could have with children going forward was based on a need for him to have a real understanding of the children&#8217;s needs. In the conversations I had with him I don&#8217;t think at this stage he has that level of insight in the children&#8217;s needs. The children have said at various points they don&#8217;t want to see their father. I appreciate that must be upsetting for him. He has tried to progress that through emails from his legal team but from the conversation I had, he seems to think that the children should feel ready to have contact. He is not really reflecting on the fact that they&#8217;ve not seen him regularly for quite some time and that they are very likely to need a greater period of time to want to see him. His desire to see the children is at the fore of his thinking rather than what is the right timing and preparation needed for the children. That&#8217;s a further example of him being led by what he wants, rather than what is in best interests of the children.&#8221;</span></p>

Further, &#8216;FT&#8217; had no contact with his children for four years. He does not have a current relationship with or familiarity with his children and their specific needs. None of the professionals considers that any form of support nor any form of Court Order could protect the children form further harm sufficiently in his care or reduce the risks to an acceptable level. Whilst the Local Authority&#8217;s parenting assessment of &#8216;FT&#8217; did identify strengths, and whilst placement of the children with him would have the benefit of them being raised in a family placement with their natural father and the opportunity to potentially have a relationship with their half-sibling, such that their identity needs could be promoted and nurtured within the birth family, the professionals identify considerable weaknesses with such placement.  The children have only just started the process of establishing a relationship with their father during supervised contact. To date, the professional consensus is that the children have not responded well to contact with him. They currently do not wish to see him. There is unanimity of professional opinion that placement of the children, &#8216;C, D, E and F&#8217; with their father, contrary to their expressed wishes and feelings and having regard to the real risk of further significant emotional harm, outweighs any benefit to the children. The professionals agree that the risks to the children are too high and could not be ameliorated or reduced sufficiently by any support services put in place under any form of Court Order.</span></p>

Within this context, and on the face of it, the older the child the more influential will be their views in the decision-making process.

The Local Authority plan will enable the children to continue their important sibling relationships, with the children being grouped as siblings in two different placements that best meets their individual needs, each sibling group having regular contact with the other. The children will have the potential to benefit from consistency in their education. They will have access to therapeutic support. The strengths of long term foster care include providing these children with an environment that will afford them a level of stability where their needs would be met consistently. Long-term fostering will give the children the opportunity to maintain a connection with their birth family and promote contact with important family members in a safe and supervised way, so as to maintain their identity individually. The Local Authority would also share Parental Responsibility for the children, which would help ensure their safety and wellbeing. A weakness of long term foster care for these children is the counter side of the Local Authority sharing Parental Responsibility, namely that the children will have a corporate parent for the duration of their minority with frequent reviews and intervention from Children&#8217;s Services, including Child Looked After Reviews every six months until the children achieve the age of majority, with the potential for feelings of stigmatisation, which in turn might affect their self-esteem and social interactions. This may particularly impact the younger children who would potentially have longer involvement with the Local Authority.</span></p>

His inability to prioritise this case and attend the Final Hearing, even with the flexibility of remote attendance, was consistent with his failure to engage in a parenting course, when offered and domestic abuse work, when offered. It is also consistent with his unwillingness to engage in indirect contact with his children by writing letters, to assist in the reintroduction of contact with the support offered by the Local Authority. The Court makes clear that it has considered &#8216;FT&#8217;s written evidence, notwithstanding the fact that he did not make himself available for cross-examination for his evidence to be tested.  This Court accepts the professional consensus that &#8216;FT&#8217;s lack of insight into the needs of the children, at a time when each of his children has expressed a clear wish not to see him, is evidenced further by his suggestion that he would take six weeks off work to help the children settle into his care.    That proposal fails to have any regard to the unchallenged expert evidence from Dr &#8216;T&#8217; that the children will require caregivers who can provide sensitive parenting that is also therapeutic, being able to provide a high level of structure and boundaries, in a calm manner to the children. This is especially so for &#8216;D&#8217; and &#8216;E&#8217;, who have struggled with their behaviour and managing and regulating their emotions and this will need support from the caregiver to address. The Court finds no reason to depart from the consensus of professional opinion that the high level of attention needed for the children to address the difficulties in sibling conflict and challenging behaviours, the nurturing and sensitive approach and the high level of attention essential to support the children with their developmental sense of identity, could not be achieved by &#8216;FT&#8217;.</span></p>

In this Court's judgement, the single conclusion reached by the Social Worker and the Children's Guardian is clear and convincing. Maintaining focus on the welfare of each child as the Court's paramount consideration, in the judgement of this Court, the individual welfare needs of each child demands the remedy of a Care Order. In respect of the oldest six children, the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan of long term foster care, with the siblings being grouped as identified, is the option that best meets their individual needs. In the case of the youngest child, the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan of placement with her Paternal Grandparents as family and friends foster carers under a Care Order is the plan that best meets her needs. On the specific facts of this case, there is no other suitable course available which is in the best interests of any of the children, motivated by the overriding requirements pertaining to their welfare. Furthermore, the high degree of justification necessary under Article 8 is established. That interference is necessary and is a proportionate response, having regard to the risks and having regard to the welfare evaluation.</span></p>

The children described the sessions as uncomfortable and found him to be rough when play fighting with them. They have asked since not to have contact with him. Contact had been arranged monthly, however, the children have refused to attend. The Local Authority care plan envisages contact between the children as a sibling group and their father three times each year. The Social Worker told the Court in her oral evidence that the plan balances the current wish of each child not to have any contact with their father, whilst having a structure in place to develop their relationship with their father, regularly reviewing their wishes and feelings.  The Social Worker informed the Court of the ongoing work with the children around contact, including support from a therapist, once they have settled into their new regime, post-Care Order, together with ongoing support from the Allocated Social Worker in the Looked After Child team and support from the CAMHS worker at school to reflect on their trauma. It was noted by the Social Worker that since &#8216;C, D, E and F&#8217;s Paternal Grandfather withdrew from full assessment, he has not sought to contact the Local Authority to facilitate time with the children. The Local Authority is alive to keeping the situation under review, once the Paternal Grandfather has &#8216;time to process&#8217;.  This Court finds no reason to depart from the professional consensus that the plan for contact for the benefit of &#8216;C, D, E and F&#8217; with their father three times each year properly balances the need for the children to develop, and thereafter maintain, a safe relationship with their father, balancing their current clearly expressed wishes, whist also supporting the development of that relationship, with necessary therapeutic input, once the children have settled into their new regimes. The Court rejects &#8216;FT&#8217;s submission that the Local Authority&#8217;s plan &#8220;pays lip service&#8221; to the role &#8216;FT&#8217; has in the children&#8217;s lives. On the contrary, the Local Authority plan is, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, sensitive to the individual needs of the children, is child-focussed and appropriately aims to build upon what is presently a difficult relationship between the children and their father. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the Local Authority plan is entirely consistent with the Local Authority&#8217;s obligations under Article 8 and by reference to the legal authorities, to take measures to facilitate contact with a non-resident parent by way of appropriate and necessary preparatory therapeutic work, consistent with the best interests of each relevant child individually.   The Local Authority continues to have a positive legal duty to review contact as part of its ongoing Looked After Child reviews. This Court is confident, on the evidence in this case, that the Local Authority will comply with its legal duty to do so.</span></p>

The mother has more regularly attended the contact centre to see &#8216;G&#8217; since &#8216;FF&#8217; was remanded in custody in September 2023.

The Local Authority advances a contact reduction plan for &#8216;G&#8217; for two sessions of weekly contact, moving to fortnightly contact for two sessions and then two monthly sessions ending in June 2024, before implementing six contact sessions each year. The Social Worker told the Court in her oral evidence that &#8216;G&#8217; will be supported with the transition from the current high level of contact to six times each year. The contact plan was justified by the Social Worker on welfare grounds, to allow &#8216;G&#8217; to settle into her new placement with her Paternal Grandparents as her primary carers. &#8216;G&#8217; was noted be unsettled on occasions following contact with her mother. More frequent contact, the Local Authority concluded, would cause &#8216;G&#8217; to be unsettled and reduce the prospects of her successfully developing new routines with her Paternal Grandparents. The Local Authority considered that contact of six times each year as a starting point would maintain the important relationship &#8216;G&#8217; has with her mother, balancing her needs to form new routines and bonds with her new primary carers, having specific regard to her age and welfare needs.</span></p>

The Guardian told the Court, &#8220;I&#8217;d expect contact to be reviewed as part of the Looked After Child reviews, as a mechanism for formal review post-final Orders. This is the starting point. The primary focus for the children needs to be for them to settle in their new placements and for them to show in their behaviour and emotional wellbeing that they are as settled as can be and feel secure. For &#8216;G&#8217; she has different relationships with her siblings. &#8216;G&#8217; will need to develop secure relationships with her Paternal Grandparents and look to them for all her needs to be met emotionally and physically as well as having a meaningful relationship with her mother. Increasing time with her mother too soon may make that more difficult. I would not want to set a timescale around that. Monthly contact between &#8216;G&#8217; and her mother, which is what mother seeks, is likely to be quite a lot for &#8216;G&#8217; when she needs to shift her attachment bonds.&#8221;  The Guardian considered the mother&#8217;s proposal that, until &#8216;FF&#8217; is released from prison, the time &#8216;G&#8217; would have spent with her father is offered to the mother. The Children's Guardian told the Court, &#8220;It is not as straight forward as swapping father&#8217;s contact with mother. The primary focus for &#8216;G&#8217; is being able to develop a trusting secure bond with her Paternal Grandparents. I sympathise with the mother. I understand why she wants more contact but right now, in my opinion, contact time needs to be reduced, to start to transfer those attachment bonds. That takes time. For &#8216;G&#8217;, that&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;</span></p>
