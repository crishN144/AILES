	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0in">S was born in June 2020, so he is almost nine months old.  His parents told the Guardian that the pregnancy was uneventful and when the mother went into spontaneous labour at 40 weeks they had every reason to expect a healthy full term baby boy, a sibling for the father&#8217;s older son who is 9 years old.  Soon they were confronted with the unimaginably harrowing circumstances that something was wrong given the immediate and intensive response of the medical professionals following the birth. S was born without any heart rate, breathing movement, spontaneous movement of his limbs and with very poor colour and abnormal cord blood gas result.  He required active resuscitation including intubation and ventilation, external cardiac massage, medications and blood transfusion.  After about 30 minutes of resuscitation his heart rate achieved a normal level, but it took some 18 hours for him to have a sustained respiratory effort, even with ventilator support.  </p>

Where the parents spend a great deal of time with their child, their views may have particular value because they know the patient and how he reacts so well; although the court needs to be mindful that the views of any parents may, very understandably, be coloured by their own emotion or sentiment. It is important to stress that the reference is to the views and opinions of the parents. Their own wishes, however understandable in human terms, are wholly irrelevant to consideration of the objective best interests of the child save to the extent in any given case that they may illuminate the quality and value to the child of the parent/child relationship.  </p>

If the treatment is not in his best interests, the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it follows that it will be lawful to withhold or withdraw it. Indeed it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it. It also follows that (provided of course they have acted reasonably and without negligence) the clinical team will not be in breach of any duty towards the patient if they withhold or withdraw it&#8221; And from paragraph 39:- </p>

It is Dr. C&#8217;s view that S will (100%) suffer global developmental delay, and it was very likely indeed (90%) that this would be severe.  In his second report, Dr. C described the consequences of this as being that S is unlikely to ever be able to react in any way to anyone or anything. There is no indication that he derives pleasure from any source, but unfortunately there is evidence that he responds to the discomfort of his treatment including suctioning and turning. There is no prospect of him ever mobilising, he has significant sensory impairment affecting his vision and hearing, and he will never be able to perform any functions of daily living at all.  He is unlikely ever to feed without either an NG tube or a PEG (feeding tube passed through the stomach wall).  He has no intentional spontaneous movements.  </p>

It seems unlikely that he will ever be able to breathe without the support of a ventilator, or be able to feed.  An EEG carried out at his request demonstrated that during stimulation he moved his limbs exhibiting stretching/arching movements of his back without producing any significant changes on the graph.

Not only are these cases medically complex, but emotionally they are as hard as is possible to imagine for the parents.   In this case, the father works and his wages mean that the family are over the limit for assistance with representation.  Unsurprisingly, they could not afford to pay for a lawyer themselves.  Upon hearing of their plight through counsel for the Hospital Trust, Mr. Mylonas QC, Mr. Thomas, counsel from Serjeants Inn Chambers stepped in to help and represent them for free.  He assimilated all the documents and spent time discussing the case with the parents.

The medical evidence is, however, that the brain damage that he has suffered is permanent and irreversible.  There is therefore no realistic prospect of S ever being able to breathe without a ventilator, to feed or be fed orally, or do anything for himself at all. He cannot and will not ever be able to see or hear.  I can see why the parents believe that S&#8217;s limb movements are more than reflex ones, but I accept, sadly, the medical evidence that this is not so. Although the mother in particular has been able to spend considerable periods of time with S in hospital, I believe that her longing to see a reaction in her son is likely to have coloured her observations.  In all the circumstances the continuing artificial ventilation cannot, in my view, offer S the benefit of any chance of an improvement in his condition.  </p>

The medical professionals are concerned that the measures required to keep him alive cause him discomfort and even pain. S has deep suctioning every two or three hours every day, his nasogastric tube is replaced every three days, and his NETT tube is replaced every three weeks.   Replacement of each of these tubes needs to be followed by abdominal or chest x-rays to ensure they are properly sited.   The fact that S moves his jaw in response to being suctioned suggests he does react and therefore in turn that he might well be able to experience pain and discomfort. S could have a tracheostomy and/or surgery to have a PEG tube inserted, but each of these require surgery which brings with it risks and the possibility of more pain and discomfort.  The tubes would still need to be regularly cleaned and replaced and there is an ongoing risk of infection in any of these scenarios.  In addition to the procedures I have set out above, S also has heel prick tests every two days and his body position changed regularly.  He is on a variety of medication.  </p>

Option 3 is much the same again.  Option 4 would relieve S of invasive ventilation, but even if it was successful (which is highly unlikely) the other burdens in being kept alive would remain.  The parents have said they would like S to be able to go home, but given the need for surgery and all the other risks, this is not a realistic option.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is a case where the burdens and possible suffering that continuing treatment brings with it outweigh the benefits of prolonging life. In my judgment the treatment cannot bring about any real improvement in his overall condition. Although the preservation of life is a very important consideration, continued living means S being exposed to repeated medical procedures that may well be uncomfortable or even painful.  If he lives long enough his condition may worsen, and either way he may die suddenly from apnoea or heart failure without time to administer palliative care to relieve any possible distress.  I understand and respect the parents&#8217; views, including their religious views (which no doubt S would share) but it is not in his best interests to put him through so much simply to keep him alive even if he is able to experience some comfort from being looked after by his parents.  If he were able to express any wishes about this it is difficult to believe he would choose this sort of existence for himself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It speaks volumes about the parents and the medical team who have treated S that they have worked so well together and continue to do so despite the different views they hold.  The care S has received in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has been of the highest quality.   It is also right, as Mr. Thomas has said, that there is one area of his life in which S has been fortunate, and that is in having the unstinting love and devotion of his mother and father.    </p>
