	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Following a contested hearing in this matter I handed down a judgment in which, in addition to my findings on the evidence, I also made trenchant criticisms of the Local Authority&#8217;s conduct of the case and of two social workers in particular. As I made clear in the judgment, now reported as (insert), I am usually disinclined to review a Local Authority&#8217;s failings during the course of care proceedings unless it is necessary to do so in order to ensure fairness to all the parties.   In this case I considered that was necessary but even had it not been I am clear that failings on this scale cannot go unheeded. I do not think that I have ever had to criticise a Local Authority to the extent that I have found it necessary to do in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In the draft judgment, initially circulated to the parties, I named the Local Authority and the social workers. I did not intend that the published judgment should identify the subject children, the parents or the Schedule 1 sex offender who had brought such trouble to this family. To do so would have been manifestly corrosive of the children&#8217;s privacy. Both of the children, subject to the Public Law proceedings are, in different ways, vulnerable. The social restrictions required in consequence of the pandemic public health crisis have added particular challenges especially, in my assessment, for B (the younger child).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">This case has a long and complex history and first came before the Courts in the context of the parent&#8217;s determination to ensure that the family home could be extensively adapted in order that their eldest child, who has a raft of disabilities, could live at home. In order to finance those proceedings, the mother was adroit in harnessing &#8216;crowd funding&#8217; and in encouraging local media coverage. Inevitably, child A was named and, as I understand it, his images were broadcast in a variety of media. Mr Perkins, who appears on behalf of the Local Authority, now submits that if I were to name this Local Authority and/or the social workers it would, by means of &#8216;jigsaw identification&#8217;, quickly identify the subject children. Ms Kelly, who appears on the children&#8217;s behalf, via their Guardian, agrees. Indeed, by entering three seemingly disconnected words in to a search engine Ms Kelly illustrated how easily child A could be identified. Though the Guardian had been forensically critical of the Local Authority&#8217;s conduct of the case she did not consider that naming the authority or the social workers was in the best interests of the children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The canard of secrecy has bedevilled the family justice system in the past. The significant strides towards transparency in recent years have not yet entirely changed the public perception. There is, in my view, an understandable concern amongst the public and members of the press that failings by public bodies, particularly on the scale I identified, should not be concealed in any way.  For many the importance of scrutinising such failings in a fully transparent way transcends the need to protect the privacy of vulnerable children. There are two fundamental rights engaged here, freedom of speech and children&#8217;s privacy as a facet of their family life. When evaluating where the balance lies between these two competing rights and interests it is important, to my mind, that judges of the Family Court do not allow ourselves to remain magnetically attracted to the welfare principle (i.e. that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration). To do so distorts the relevant balancing exercise. </p>

Equally, each Article qualifies the right it propounds so far as it may be lawful, necessary, and proportionate to do so in order to accommodate the other. The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or trumps the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each. It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided on the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual cases is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in the terms of proportionality is carried out.&#8221; </p>

But if such criticism exceeds what is lawful there are other remedies available to the local authority.

How can such errors be exposed, how can public authorities be held accountable, if allowed to shelter behind a judicially sanctioned anonymity? This is particularly so where, as in the present case, a public authority has been exposed to criticism. I accept, as the local authority correctly points out, that many &#8211; indeed most &#8211; of the matters in dispute in this case were never the subject of any final judicial determination, but the fact remains that in certain respects I was, as my judgment shows, critical of the local authority.

He lives in a rural community where, because of the comparatively unusual nature of his disability, he is more likely to be identifiable than if he lived in a massive conurbation. In the area of this county council there are only two schools, one in the north and one in the south, which cater for needs akin to those of A. The identification of the school is, therefore, a relevant issue. He is cared for primarily, but not exclusively, by his grandparents who oppose any relaxation of anonymity. His mother, who shares increasing care of him, clearly wants anonymisation relaxed. When she was represented it was said that she agreed that A should not be identified. Her own submission in para 28 is equivocal. I am, however, abundantly satisfied on the evidence that A's welfare positively requires that he be protected from identification.</span></p>

ITV Wales have no such agenda and will, I have no doubt, seek scrupulously to avoid the identification of A. The difficulties in this approach are twofold. First once disclosure is allowed it is disclosure to all the world and not every organ of the media may be as scrupulous or indeed as concerned to protect the identity of A. Secondly, I doubt that the mother shares that concern to the same extent and, as I have indicated in earlier judgments, I have serious doubts about her judgment and that certainly extends to the assiduous protection of A's identity. </span></p>

In my judgment, it is not enough that it is unnecessary to identify the local authority or X; in order to prevent that disclosure it seems to me that I need to be satisfied that it might reasonably lead to the identification of A, no more and no less. Still less, in my view, should the court prevent the disclosure of X simply to save her the annoyance and discomfort of being pursued by ITV Wales and the mother over the criticisms of her found in my judgment. Of course it has always been (and remains) possible for the mother to make a formal complaint against X to the Care Council for Wales. However, as I understand it, she has not chosen to do so. In my view, the decisive issue in any balance in this case is the Art 8 rights of A reinforced by the demands of his welfare that he be not identified outside the scope of these proceedings. I do not disagree with the judgments of Munby J, Ryder J and MacFarlane J that are cited in the skeleton arguments, I merely conclude that in this case the position of A merits special protection. </span></p>

I am wholly satisfied that the disclosure of the identity of any family member (and in particular the mother) will not only reasonably tend to the identification of A but will be highly likely to have that consequence especially if (as inevitably will be the case) disclosure once made is in effect made to all the world. I had wondered whether I could allow the mother's face to appear without her being named but I do not think that will guard against the risk of identification of A. I am also satisfied that the school and therefore staff members at the school should not be identified on the same basis. As I have said, this is a lightly populated rural area and information can all too easily get out. What I have, however, found more difficult is the question of the identification of the local authority or social worker X. </span></p>

The nature and extent of the failings, as well as their persistence, can only give real cause for public concern. There is an undoubted public interest in the Local Authority being named, in order that they might be subject to the kind of public scrutiny that many would regard as necessary. Mr Perkins has told me that, at the highest level within the Social Services Department for this Local Authority, there is real concern as to what has happened and a determination that there should be a full investigation. I am told and accept that there will be. Mr Perkins submits that there are &#8220;lessons to be learned&#8221;.  It has to be said that this phrase is deployed so regularly when public bodies fail that it is in danger of becoming platitudinous. It is easy to see how lessons might be learned more thoroughly in the spot light of media scrutiny.  </p>

She has however, come to the conclusion that the interests of these two subject children tip the balance in favour of preserving their privacy.

As was discussed in exchanges with counsel, jigsaws come with varying complexities. A 500-piece puzzle of Schloss Neuschwanstein is a very different proposition to a 12-piece puzzle of Peppa Pig. By this I mean that whilst some information in the public domain may be pieced together by those determined to do so, the risk may be relatively remote. The remoteness of the risk would require to be factored in to the balancing exercise when considering the importance of the Article 10 rights. Indeed, as I have averted to above the Article 10 rights may be of such force as ultimately to outweigh the risk of identification of the children. In this case the background of the proceedings is important. Such is the level of information in the public domain including A&#8217;s full name and images in national newspapers and various social media platforms that I am satisfied that were I to name the Local Authority, the family and therefore both children would be identified with ease.  </p>

Though it may be painful to the family to express it bluntly, in my judgment, it requires to be. The care plan is a very poor second best. Child A wanted nothing more than to return to live permanently at his family home. The outcome of the case is that A now faces the prospect of a lifetime of institutional care, interspersed with occasional weekend and holiday visits to the home in which his father will now live. Child B is extremely close to his brother. He fervently wanted his brother to come home. I have no doubt that the extent of his disappointment, from what I have been told, is properly characterised as a grieving process. In light of my findings about M&#8217;s deception regarding her ongoing contact with a Schedule 1 Offender, it was necessary for B to move to live with his father, in accommodation which is far too small for them. This was to have endured only until the tenancy of the former family home could be transferred in to the father&#8217;s name. That has now been done. Into this sad cluster of circumstances must now be factored the &#8216;social isolation&#8217; required by the current viral pandemic. This has left B living in unsatisfactory circumstances with no outside space and with limited contact to either his brother or mother. I am told by F&#8217;s counsel that B has been stoic and mature. Nonetheless, I consider that both the Guardian and the Local Authority are right to emphasise his vulnerability and the present fragility of his situation. Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that this tips the balance in favour of prioritising the children&#8217;s family life and emotional well-being over the legitimate public interest in identifying the Local Authority and the relevant professionals.  </p>
