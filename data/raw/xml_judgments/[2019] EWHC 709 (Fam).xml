The issue is whether I should permit the applicant local authority to withdraw its applications for female genital mutilation protection orders with respect to all five girls, for a forced marriage protection order with respect to A, and for orders pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction.  A and B are wards of court and on 12 December 2018 I made female genital mutilation protection orders with respect to all five girls, those orders being due to expire on 12 April 2019. On that date I also made A the subject of a forced marriage protection order, that order also being due to expire on 12 April 2019. </p>

The respondents to the proceedings are the girls&#8217; mother, A and B&#8217;s father (to whom the mother was previously married) and the father of the three younger girls to whom A&#8217;s mother is presently married. The family are of Somalian origin. A and B&#8217;s father resides in Somalia with his present wife and their children. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I summarise the background to the proceedings as follows. The family were not known to the local authority until October 2018 when a referral was made by A&#8217;s former primary school. The school reported that it had been informed that A had not taken up her place at a local secondary school and that the mother had said A had stayed in Somalia with her father following a family holiday over the summer. In response to that referral the local authority undertook an assessment of the mother which found there were no concerns in relation to her ability to meet the children&#8217;s basic needs. However, the circumstances in which A had been left with her father coupled with concerns that A might be the subject of either a forced marriage or female genital mutilation, led the local authority to issue proceedings on 30 November 2018. A had had no direct contact with her father for the previous 8 years before travelling to Somalia in summer 2018 and her mother was unable to be sure that A would not be safe in her father&#8217;s care. I note that the mother was herself the victim of female genital mutilation as a child. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 7 December 2018 HHJ Turner QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) made A and B wards of court; made all five girls the subjects of short-term female genital mutilation protection orders; made A the subject of a short-term forced marriage protection order; and made orders preventing A&#8217;s removal from her current address in Somalia and preventing B&#8217;s removal from this jurisdiction. The matter was listed before me on 12 December 2018. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 11 December the mother informed the social worker that A was on a flight to London and would arrive at Heathrow later that day. A and her mother attended court on 12 December 2018. Before me, the mother sought the discharge of the wardship orders with respect of A and B. I refused that application and made the orders set out in paragraph 1 above together with order prohibiting the girls&#8217; removal from this jurisdiction. I listed the matter for a final hearing commencing on 8 April 2019 and for further directions on 30 January 2019.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">By 30 January 2019 matters had developed as follows. A underwent a medical assessment at University College Hospital which confirmed that she had not been subject to female genital mutilation. The mother had also engaged in work with Forward UK. This is a support and campaign charity which aims to support African women, in particular with respect to female genital mutilation. Forward UK was to undertake work with the mother to increase her insight into the dangers of female genital mutilation. Feedback from this work indicated that the mother had engaged meaningfully and that her level of understanding and insight was excellent.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A was interviewed by the social worker and the children&#8217;s guardian and gave a similar account to each of her time in Somalia. She was clear that she had not been maltreated in any way and had not been forced to stay in Somalia against her wishes. There had been no suggestion of marriage during her time in Somalia. A said she wanted to attend school in this jurisdiction and complete her education here.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother told the children&#8217;s guardian that she was strongly opposed to female genital mutilation, having been cut herself at the age of 9. She did not want her daughters to go through this experience and knew that the practice was unlawful in this jurisdiction. She was also very opposed to forced marriage and said that she had not been forced to marry either of her two husbands. The mother explained that she had left A in Somalia with her father as she trusted him to care for her properly. However, she was glad A was back in this jurisdiction and had returned her in December 2018 because she had nothing to hide. The mother&#8217;s male cousin was also seen and was very clear that the family regarded female genital mutilation as a terrible thing which they would not allow to happen to the children in their family.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The father in Somalia was also spoken to by the children&#8217;s guardian and confirmed his opposition to female genital mutilation and forced marriage. He was happy for A to live with her mother and complete her education in this jurisdiction and had agreed with the mother that A should return in December 2018 to be educated in this jurisdiction.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The assessment of the local authority and of the children&#8217;s guardian was that the evidence did not establish a risk of either female genital mutilation or of forced marriage.  All the children in this jurisdiction were well cared for and there were no other child protection concerns. All the parties thus invited the court to permit the local authority to withdraw its applications and to discharge the existing framework of protective orders. </p>

Whilst discharge of the wardship proceedings are plainly proceedings governed by the paramountcy principle, the application of that principle to discharge of the proceedings under the 1996 and 2003 Acts is less clear. Whilst the paramountcy principle applies in full to the decision-making process in relation to many substantive orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> such as a child arrangements order or a parental responsibility order, it only applies in other cases to the decision to make orders once the court is satisfied that additional criteria are satisfied, for example, the threshold criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the Children Act.

The specific reference to those factors in the test in the 1996 and 2003 Acts suggests to me that Parliament intended welfare-based considerations to be matters of particular weight and importance when the court exercises its protective powers.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Likewise, when viewed though the prism of respect for a private and family life contained in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the health, safety and wellbeing of the person to be protected from forced marriage must also be the court&#8217;s first and paramount consideration. Additionally, Article 12 provides that men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and found a family, according to national laws governing the exercise of this right. Although the consent of the intending spouses is not mentioned in Article 12, it is fundamental to the exercise of the right.  It is thus plain that forced marriage represents, at the very least, a profound and unjustifiable interference with an individual&#8217;s right to respect for his/her private and family life and with their right to marry freely. Whether it also constitutes a violation of a person&#8217;s Article 3 right is not a matter which I need consider in this ruling. The breaches of Article 8 and 12 rights inherent in forced marriage add force to my view that the health, safety and wellbeing of the person to be protected from forced marriage should likewise be the court&#8217;s first and paramount consideration when it exercises its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>. </p>

Miss Cabeza submitted that the paramountcy principle applied to all three set of proceedings as the court was determining a question with respect to the upbringing of a child. I disagree. Even though I consider that, in exercising its powers under the 1996 and 2003 Acts, the health, safety and wellbeing of the person to be protected should be the court&#8217;s first and paramount consideration, that analysis does not necessarily apply to an application to withdraw those proceedings. Rule 29.4 read alongside Rule 1.1(1) and Rule 1.1(2) requires the court to survey all the circumstances, having regard to any welfare issues but does not give priority to welfare above all other matters.  </p>

However, I accept Miss Cabeza&#8217;s submission that the court should, when surveying the circumstances, consider if there is some solid advantage to the person to be protected from continuing the proceedings [see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">London Borough of Southwark v B</span> [1993] 2 </p>

In this case, there is little evidence on which it might be said that continuing such orders was justified. Both the mother, the father and A have been consistent in saying that A remained in Somalia to live with her father rather than a means to procuring either her forced marriage or female genital mutilation. A did not feel under threat whilst in Somalia and was not forced into marriage or genitally mutilated whilst there.  Looking to the future, both A&#8217;s mother and father are opposed to forced marriage and female genital mutilation. They are supported in that stance by the maternal extended family. The mother has engaged meaningfully with an assessment by Forward UK, a specialist resource with experience of working with African women about female genital mutilation and has also co-operated with the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian. Both the mother and father accept that A should complete her education in this jurisdiction rather than in Somalia. It is also evident that the mother recognised the need to demonstrate that A was safe by taking steps to return her to this jurisdiction within a very short time of the matter being first before the court. Finally, there are no other child protection concerns in circumstances where all five girls appear to be thriving and well cared for.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In order to come to a meaningful assessment of future risk, I have evaluated these factors mindful that the court should look beyond mere compliance with its orders or lip-service (by parents and sometimes by the person to be protected) to the convention that forced marriage and female genital mutilation are profoundly harmful. I note that the local authority&#8217;s concerns about the risk to A of female genital mutilation and forced marriage appear never to have been adequately explored with the mother prior to the issue of these proceedings. Had they been, these proceedings might not have been necessary. In that respect, the swift return of A to this jurisdiction very early in these proceedings indicates to me that the family wished to co-operate with the court and the professionals and were anxious to show they had nothing to hide. That cooperation has continued to date as I have summarised in paragraph 23 above. In these particular circumstances and with the girls&#8217; welfare in its broadest sense as my first and paramount consideration, I am satisfied that the wardship orders, forced marriage orders and female genital mutilation protection orders should be discharged.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Turning to the application to withdraw the various proceedings, the local authority&#8217;s request was in written form and gave reasons. The parties present at the directions hearing on 30 January 2019 all signalled their agreement to the local authority being given permission to withdraw these applications. The father of A and B was not at court and was not on notice of the local authority&#8217;s wish to withdraw. It is plain from his discussions with the children&#8217;s guardian that the father had no concerns about A and B&#8217;s welfare and he cooperated with the mother to return A to this jurisdiction. There is, accordingly, no basis upon which this court might believe the father would wish the proceedings to continue. I have decided that I should dispense with the formal requirement to give the father notice of the local authority&#8217;s application to withdraw. This is proportionate in the circumstances in helping the court deal with the matter justly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I accept Miss Cabeza&#8217;s submission that there is no solid advantage to the proceedings continuing. The evidence now before the court rebuts the circumstantial evidence that gave rise to a legitimate concern that A had been left in Somalia as part of a plan for her to be forced into marriage and/or subjected to female genital mutilation. For the proceedings to continue would be disproportionate; would generate further expense for the local authority and for the Legal Aid Agency; and would delay the expeditious resolution of the proceedings. It would also not be in the children&#8217;s welfare especially in circumstances where future risk is assessed as being low and where no purpose would be served by an enquiry into how A came to be left in Somalia and whether she was at risk of forced marriage/female genital mutilation. Indeed, it is highly doubtful if the local authority could establish on the evidence any case for the making of protective orders under either the 1996 or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>s.  </p>
