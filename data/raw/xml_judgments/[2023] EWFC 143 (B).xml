However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability.  Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them.  However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not &#8220;who is the more likely?&#8221; but &#8220;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8221;  In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability.  Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion.  </span></p>

Skull vault fractures do not occur in minor domestic impacts and low level falls.  Skull vault fractures become increasingly unlikely in falls below 0.9  to 1 metres height, especially if the fall is onto a cushioned surface such as a carpeted floor or item of soft furniture.  Skull vault fractures are extremely painful. When they happen the child will react accordingly. They will cry, often hysterically and for prolonged periods of time.

Comminuted fractures imply a substantial impact force.  Linear fractures are commonly accepted to be the result of &#8216;low level falls&#8217; ie fall from adult waist height.  R presents with a delayed swelling of the area of impact which is common in trauma of this type.

Dr S clarified that the mechanism is blunt force impact trauma. It would have to be high force to cause these injuries. That is the mechanism that would cause the soft-tissue swelling, the complex skull vault fracture, and the subdural haematoma. The head has struck a hard, unyielding surface or object, or has been struck by a similar hard object.  Dr H was in agreement, setting out that there are two different sites, and to have the parietal fracture, you need an impact on the parietal fracture, on the parietal side of the head. The marks that they considered were burn marks, are over the right orbit and nose, and that is so remote from the skull fracture site, that cannot make sense.

She also said that N put cotton around T's neck and tried to 'strangle' her. Mother is suffering with depression and feels suicidal as she cannot cope with N's behaviour.

M stated that she has little control over his behaviour and that he has threatened her with a knife. She is worried to leave the younger child in the company of N unsupervised.

She said she did not hear anything more than that as she was running the tap and stood next to it. She said she walked back into the lounge with the bottle to give to R, and saw him lying on his front on the floor. She went straight over to pick up R. She said that N was &#8220;lying over the bouncer with his arm on the sofa to steady himself. He looked a bit dazed&#8221;.   She goes on to say &#8220;I did not take much notice as my main concern was R who was on the floor. As I picked him up off the floor I noticed that he had a graze on his head which at the time was very pink&#8221;. She said that she was upset and crying.

It seems to me those two options could easily be misunderstood in how they're written down, as to whether it had been said that night, or in general, and whether that was a mother who did not want N to pick up his brother at all, or a mother reminding others she did not want them picking up the baby every time he grizzled.

Inevitably, the medics will defer to those who have greater expertise in a particular field. Having considered the medical evidence in conjunction with all of the other evidence in this case, I am quite satisfied that the expert consensus in terms of the severity of the skull fracture and the force needed for that and the bleeding is correct.  Similarly, I am satisfied that the facial injuries are some form of contact burn marks with R's face being moved over a rough surface.  Given the point of contact that must have caused the skull fracture, and associated bleeding, it is impossible to imagine a scenario where one single application of force created both of those injuries, and again, I accept the expert evidence that whilst this might have been one event, there were two separate applications of force to R to cause those injuries.</span></p>

The reality is that I cannot accept those injuries were caused by that mechanism.  I remind myself particularly of the extremely clear evidence of Dr S of the necessity of there being some form of high impact blow.  Any drop, even from a standing height would simply not cause that complex skull fracture, as all of the experts agree. I am mindful of course of the vagaries of modern science, and that strange and unusual things do happen.  Even balancing those matters, I am quite satisfied that the mechanism for the skull fracture is not that N simply dropped R as he passed out.</span></p>

They both agree that R was in his bouncy chair when the mother went into the kitchen to make a bottle. They both agree that N had been asleep on the other sofa.   N asserts that he got up, and the mother says that she heard him speak to her.   The mother was then in the kitchen and there was certainly some background noise for her as she asserted but she was standing in front of a sink running cold water onto a bottle to cool it down.  The mother suggests in general making up the bottle she could have been out of the room for as much as 5 minutes.  As I have set out above, it was very apparent from the photos that she was merely steps away from being able to see what was happening in the sitting room.  A relevant matter that I must bear in mind is that given I have concluded there were two injuries, R would have cried at the point immediately of any of those injuries being sustained, and that cry would immediately have alerted the mother.  The mother did not suggest at any point in her evidence that when she turned the tap off R was already crying.    Instead, she says that as she went to come into the room she heard R crying in an unusual way, and N said that he saw her come into the room.  As the mother said that R was already on the floor, and she had heard the cry as she took the few steps into the room, most of these accounts is inconsistent and simply makes no sense. </span></p>

He would immediately scream or cry out in an entirely obvious fashion that he had been significantly injured.  Similarly, if his face is dragged along a rough surface such as the carpet at some force he is immediately going to be crying out.   </span></p>

	      <p class="BodyA" style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The mother is clearly intelligent enough to be able to understand the medical evidence.   Although in her statements she sets out that she will keep an open mind in relation to what N has done, her evidence to this court was very much that she asserted what happened to R was an accident, and she did not believe that N could have caused these injuries.   I bear in mind how challenging it is for a mother when faced with this situation in relation to two of her children.  Although N is now an adult, he is still her son, and she is undoubtedly protective towards him.  She must be mindful of the potential for criminal proceedings in relation to him, and the impact of any conviction and sentence for such a serious offence.  She is also however aware of the need for a proper understanding of what happened to R, so that professionals can assist the family going forwards and most importantly to ensure that R and T are properly safe.</span></p>

	      <p class="BodyA" style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The mother's reaction to N such that at the conclusion of whatever happened, she threw him out of the house, to the extent that he did not even have shoes on, and locked the door on him is very troubling.  Whilst I accept that none of us know how we would react in very stressful situations, if the rest of her evidence were true, that she found both of her sons in a distressed state with some form of accident having taken place, I simply cannot accept that she would show so little care for N that she would throw him out of the property.  That is particularly because on her evidence at that point she did not think the injuries to R were particularly significant, merely that he had some kind of mark to his face. On her description of entering the room, she would have perceived N to be in some distress if he were in some way just waking up from having passed out.   I bear in mind the other evidence of the mother at times overreacting and lashing out verbally, but I still cannot reconcile that with a loving mother who genuinely believes N has in some way passed out causing an accident, as she asserted to this court, and that she would quite literally then throw her child who had just passed out, out of the house.</span></p>

	      <p class="BodyA" style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I am also troubled by the contradictory evidence in relation to what the mother had seen of Rs injuries at the time that N left the house. The mother has been clear that she initially just saw a facial injury, and even the mark on the nose was not properly showing.  N told the court in his evidence that he saw a bump on R's head, and that his mother had brought that to his attention saying that he should &#8216;look at what he had done&#8217;. The mothers evidence of course is that she only saw a bump at the time she called for help at about 8.20pm.</span></p>

In my view this very recent evidence was a fabrication by N to try and resolve this issue of whether he had been told not to pick up R or not given it had never been mentioned previously.</span></p>

In relation to that, although N appears to have subsequently received some medical attention for that, at the earliest that was several months after this incident. Neither the mother nor N were able to explain why, if that significant medical event had indeed taken place, they had not sought medical attention far sooner.   It seems to me that the only possible explanation for that is that neither the mother nor N considered he genuinely needed any medical treatment, as they would surely have thought if their version of events were true. </span></p>

The overwhelming weight of evidence in relation to this mother is that she is torn between her children, but not that she would herself physically injure any child of hers.</span></p>

Each of the advocates addressed me in relation to this. It of course relates to the issue of whether N has behaved in an aggressive way towards a child before.  I'm quite satisfied that the mother lied in relation to her knowledge of this as she was worried it might make the court think that it was more likely that N has in some way deliberately harmed R out of anger towards him.  The fact that the mother has lied about that, does not in my view go very much further.  It does not seem to me that enables me to consider everything else the mother has said is untruthful, as there is a very logical and rational explanation for her anxiety about that evidence and why she would lie. </span></p>

I do not stray into speculation as to what took place, but it seems to me that on the weight of the evidence the mother would never have permitted N to cause those injuries, and on the balance of probabilities N caused those injuries at least to start with whilst the mother was out of the room.  She then became aware of what was happening, and was aware that N had acted in a seriously violent way towards R, although she may not have witnessed all of the attack.   I am quite satisfied that is why she reacted in the way that she did to N to throw him out of the property.  </span></p>

It was apparent she was very troubled about this, whilst being clear that of course it was dependent upon what findings I would make.  The guardian told me that in her view in relation to R a care order was the more appropriate order so that the local authority could share parental responsibility and that would allow access to greater scrutiny of the family, a statutory responsibility for visits, an IRO to be working with the family, and greater oversight. It would also enable the local authority to bring the matter back to court in a way that a supervision order simply would not.</span></p>
