	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">  The application was issued late on 13 April 2005 (stamped as received on 14 April 2005) in the Inner London Family Proceedings Court at Wells Street in circumstances where the two children were in hospital and the Council was concerned that, upon discharge into the care of the mother, she would be unable to cope with their health and general care requirements.  That remains the position.  The first hearing was listed for 19 April 2005 but was not effective because the Council&#8217;s initial social work statement had only been received by the Court that morning and the Council agreed to an adjournment without an order until 21 April 2005 on the basis that the children were in any event not going to be discharged from hospital until early the following week.  On 21 April 2005, the Council received the mother&#8217;s statement, unsigned, which indicated that she welcomed the assistance of Social Services, and would cooperate in their finding her suitable accommodation, and in arranging for her to attend the Brunel Family Centre for a parenting assessment as soon as the children were discharged from hospital.  The final paragraph stated:</p>

I will not oppose that application on the basis that the children are not removed from my care, however I would ask this Honourable Court to consider making a Supervision Order so as to satisfy Social Services that I am able to care for the children.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, on arrival at court, counsel for the mother, Mr Crawley, who appears for her today, indicated that he considered the Council&#8217;s application was &#8216;ultra vires&#8217; and in breach of the mother&#8217;s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the basis that, despite opportunity, there had been no multi-disciplinary meeting held by the Council to which the mother had been invited before care proceedings were commenced and/or the Interim Care Plan (proffered to the Court on that day) was made.  Counsel also made clear that (despite the statement of the mother quoted above) she objected to an Interim Care Order being made in any event, although she would agree to a Supervision Order. As there was no time to hear the application, the hearing was adjourned to 4 May 2005. At that point, because it appeared that the children were to be discharged from hospital the following week, the mother agreed neither to oppose nor consent to the Council&#8217;s application and an Interim Care Order was made until 4 May 2005.  On that day, the skeleton argument of counsel was served only 15 minutes before the hearing and the case was immediately transferred to the Principal Registry of the Family Division whence it was transferred to the High Court in the light of the &#8216;ultra vires&#8217; point taken.  The Interim Care Order was not renewed at that stage because the children were still in hospital and not yet due for release.  Upon the mother&#8217;s undertaking not to remove them, the matter was relisted on 9 May, the anticipated discharge date for the children being 15 May.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is an Iraqui born in Kuwait and the father is Algerian.  In 1998 they married when the mother was only 15 and at school in East Ham, having come to this country in 1997.  It was a secret marriage because her parents had other plans and would not have approved.  The mother therefore left London with the husband and went to Leeds, as she believed, to meet his family.  However, there she was effectively made prisoner in a one-bed flat with no window and no contact with the outside world, whether by telephone or directly.  She was physically abused.  Her parents did not report her missing.  When she was pregnant with B (born 12 March 2000) she was not allowed out of the flat or to seek any medical attention.  B was delivered at home by an old Arab woman.  B&#8217;s birth is not registered anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

She was not using her arms and legs properly, had no appetite and could not look at people properly.  She had difficulties feeding and with movement.  However, the mother continued unable to leave the house.  The father would take B out twice a week.  The mother is unaware what, if any, medical treatment the father sought for B, though she believes B may have had an operation on her eyes.  Leeds Health Authority have no record of B.  The mother says that the father was violent to her throughout the marriage and that he deliberately hit her causing her to miscarry twice subsequent to B&#8217;s birth.   The father blamed the mother for having a &#8216;sick&#8217; child.  However, he was very loving, and never violent, towards B.</p>

Having arrived in London the father told the mother he did not want her any more.  He went off with B, leaving the mother at the Edgware Road tube station in an area where members of her extended family were known to reside.  She waited for three hours for the father and B to return.  She then started to walk and saw a man she recognised as her uncle who took her to her parents.  At this time she was pregnant with S although the father was not aware of this.  She made no attempt to find B, nor did she report her missing.  She states that she was not concerned for her welfare because the father had always been a very attentive and caring father so far as B was concerned.</p>

After initial assessment, her case was allocated to a Children and Families&#8217; social worker, Ms Keane. She was encouraged by Ms Keane to report B missing.  She failed to do so however.</p>

It was decided that consideration would need to be given to convening a Child Protection Conference as well as obtaining legal advice in relation to the lack of proof of anyone holding Parental Responsibility for B, and whether legal proceedings should be initiated.</p>

The mother agreed that she would not remove or allow anyone else to remove either child from the ward over the weekend.  Ms Keane advised the mother that further discussions would be necessary between the Social Services Department and the family, that the police Child Protection Team had been informed and they too might wish to talk to her and her family.  The mother said that she understood and was in agreement with Social Services, because she wanted B to be &#8216;helped&#8217;.</p>

It was decided that continued joint investigation under s.47 of the Children Act was required.  It was agreed that a Review Strategy meeting would be held on 15 April 2005.</p>

That was necessary in the light of the new development that, Mr A-D (who had previously wished to assist the mother in caring for the children) had become aware that S had additional health needs and he no longer wished to continue his relationship with the mother.  Ms Keane told the mother that there was evidence that B had suffered significant harm, that the Council were working within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, but were unclear at that stage what steps needed to be taken to protect the children.  Ms Keane said that the Council would wish to undertake an assessment of the mother&#8217;s ability to parent her children and to meet their needs.  The mother stated that her family would help her to care for both children.</p>

Mr Crawley submits that, because of the failure of the Council prior to the issue of its care proceedings, to involve the mother in a multi-disciplinary case conference in order to arrive at and/or recommend an agreed Care Plan for B and S as the subjects of the Council&#8217;s concern, the Council has acted in breach of the mother&#8217;s rights under ECHR Article 6 and Article 8, the appropriate sanction for which is for the Court to refuse to make an Interim Care Order.  He submits that, in the circumstances, for the Court to make such an order as opposed to dismissing the application, or at least making &#8216;no order&#8217;, would be to endorse what he dubs an &#8216;ultra vires&#8217; application and to involve the Court itself in breaching the mother&#8217;s Convention rights.</p>

No decision to initiate proceedings should be taken without clear evidence that provision of services for the child and his family (which may include an accommodation placement voluntarily arranged under section 20) has failed or would be likely to fail to meet the child&#8217;s needs adequately (see paragraphs 3.19 and 3.20 on significant harm) and there is no suitable person prepared to apply to over care of the child under a Residence Order.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>

Nonetheless, Mr Crawley submits, that the human rights arguments should not be left for disposition in the ordinary course of the care proceedings; because the breach is so clear and flagrant the application should effectively be dismissed at this stage of the proceedings, leaving the Council to start again if it thinks it necessary and appropriate in a situation where the mother is in fact willing to cooperate under the terms of the Placement with Parents Agreement of 25 April 2005 without the need for court involvement.</p>

It is apparent that the first occasion that any objection was voiced to the Council&#8217;s proposed course was when the mother&#8217;s older brother intervened and stated his objection to the involvement of the Court on the day <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> proceedings had been commenced (see paragraph 26 above).  Even then, the unsigned statement delivered on behalf of the mother indicated her acceptance of the position.  One can only speculate what caused the mother to change her view by the time counsel appeared on her behalf at the first effective hearing on 21 April 2005.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, although it is technically correct that a multi-disciplinary meeting of the kind referred to in the 1991 Guidance quoted was only held the day after issue of proceedings, it is not suggested that the mother objected to the proposals as they then stood.  Indeed, it is clear that, prior to the issue of proceedings on 13 April, she had expressed her acceptance and, at the multi-disciplinary conference which followed such issue, she made no objection of any kind.  Nor, prior to the issue of proceedings, or at any time before 21 April was she treated unfairly or in any way or deprived of the opportunity to say what she thought should be done.  I find no hint or suggestion of procedural unfairness to support Mr Crawley&#8217;s submission that, prior to proceedings, there was any breach of the mother&#8217;s Article 8 rights.  Nor (if indeed it is alleged) do I find any suggestion of such breach or irregularity in the conduct of the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One aspect of Mr Crawley&#8217;s argument has been to complain of the Council&#8217;s failure to draw up a care plan and to suggest that the Council was remiss in failing to obtain the input of the mother into such a plan when it was unaware whether or not she would cooperate.  I have already indicated my view that the Council were justified in considering that the mother&#8217;s attitude was one of acceptance of their proposals.  However, it is worth making two further points.  There is no guidance or practice direction which compels the local authority to prepare and file a care plan before or with an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Protocol for Judicial Case Management in Public Law Children Act Cases</span> itself suggests at paragraph 18 of Appendix F that interim care plans should be prepared, filed and served so as to be available to the court at the Case Management Conference occurring between Day 15 and Day 60.  In this case a hand-written Interim Care Plan was produced, signed, on behalf of the Council on 26 April 2005, the day following the signing by the mother of the Placement with Parents Agreement.  The two separate and comprehensive Care Plans drawn in respect of each child were dated 29 April 2005.  Thus, by the time the matter came successively before the Family Proceedings Court and the Principal Registry, all was in order for the case to be dealt with under the terms of the Protocol.  Instead, it was transferred to the High Court on the basis of what I can only assume was a perceived difficulty arising from the misnomer applied to the legal point taken.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons I have set out, this case never was, nor should it have been treated as, a case involving any &#8216;ultra vires&#8217; exercise by the Council of its powers and duties under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  Put at its highest, it simply involved an argument of procedural unfairness prior to proceedings giving rise to an arguable breach of the mother&#8217;s Article 8 rights under the ECHR.  The position in relation to such cases has been made clear in the decisions which I have already cited at paragraph 36 above.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Human Rights Act complaints arising before the making of a final care order can, and normally should, be dealt with in the care proceedings by the court dealing with those care proceedings when the full merits of the care plan, as opposed to its bare lawfulness, fall to be debated.  It is neither necessary nor desirable for the family proceedings court or the Principal Registry to transfer proceedings to a superior level of court merely because a breach of Convention rights is alleged.  In my view, no very detailed examination of the statements and skeleton arguments in this case was necessary in order to see the straightforward, yet insubstantial nature of the complaint raised against the Council and the fact that it did not of itself justify transfer to this Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is sufficient to dispose of the point which gave rise to the transfer of the proceedings.  However, as an additional or alternative argument, Mr Crawley has also shortly submitted that the evidence filed to date is insufficient to show that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the threshold criteria set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> are met in respect of B and S.  In this respect I have also heard short argument from the Council and the guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am in no doubt that, as at the date of the hearing before me, the threshold criteria are established.  Both children have acute medical needs which will require close care and attention following their discharge from hospital, when it was anticipated at the date of hearing to take place on Friday 13 May.  It was the view of the Multi-Disciplinary Strategy meeting at St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital on 5 April 2005 that the failure of the mother and father to ensure comprehensive treatment for B earlier in her life may have impacted upon her functioning and life expectancy and constitutes neglect.  There are also concerns regarding the credibility of the mother and doubts concerning her earlier failure to take proactive steps to locate B which, in the light of B&#8217;s condition, she should have treated as a matter of urgency.  These matters have not been fully resolved.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position is still also unclear as to the help available to the mother in caring for B and S on their release and the likely situation which might be presented by a return on to the scene of the father.  In addition, the immigration status of the mother is uncertain, as is the participation of members of her family and their attitude to the intervention of the welfare services.  It is clear to me that unless an Interim Care Order is made which enables the children to be discharged into the care of the mother under a close regime of monitoring and support, the mother&#8217;s ability to look after them would be seriously in question.  Prior to the return of B she had been able to care for S in his then state.  However, in the light of the very close care and attention which the mother will need to give to B, coupled with the deterioration in S&#8217;s own condition, which justified his hospitalisation at the same time as B, this is no longer the case.  Without the care and support to be provided under the Care Plan it is neither likely nor reasonable to expect that the mother, with such (uncertain) assistance as the family may provide would be able to cope.  If she could not, the children would be likely to suffer significant harm.  Because of the general uncertainty surrounding the position of the mother and her family and the possibility of medical emergency befalling the children, it is necessary to provide the Council with the ability swiftly to take decisions on the basis of shared parental responsibility. The intervention of the Council and the order sought are thus both appropriate and proportionate.  Accordingly, I approve the Interim Care Plans placed before me and make an Interim Care Order in favour of the Council for the purposes therein set out, subject to further consideration at a hearing on 26 May 2005 in the light of an anticipated application by the guardian for a section 38(6) direction that there be a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">residential</span> parenting assessment of the mother.</p>
