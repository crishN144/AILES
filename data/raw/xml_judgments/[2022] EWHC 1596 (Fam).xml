The paramedics found her lying on the floor, pale and looking glazed and limp. She recovered on the way to hospital. She was admitted for observations and all tests were normal.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to know what to make of this episode. There was no medical cause found despite extensive investigations. Y was 2 years old, so if the Father did in some way induce the episode it would have been physically much more difficult to do so than with a younger child, further one might expect Y to have become scared or at least wary of his Father, and there is no evidence that happened. I do not think it is possible to reach any conclusions on this episode, and I have discounted it for the purposes of my ultimate findings.</p>

A blood gas test was undertaken with a pH of 7.25 and the lactate reading was 8.5 (normal is 2.5). The heightened lactate levels are a result of inadequate oxygen being carried to the body&#8217;s tissues. This is a consequence either of inadequate circulation, possibly as a consequence of an infection, or a respiratory issue. Dr Samuels (expert Respiratory Consultant) said this was a life threatening event (&#8216;ALTE&#8217;).</p>

On 16 March the Mother gave a statement to the police setting out this abuse, which she alleges included serious physical violence, an incident when the Father forced her to continue with sexual intercourse against her will, and more generalised coercive control. On 18 March the Father called the Mother at 2am and the Mother recorded the conversation. I have listened to that recording. The Father is both angry and upset on the call and is highly abusive to the Mother, including a great deal of swearing at her. If it were not for the background to this case, I would not consider the contents of the recording particularly surprising in the context of the apparently unexpected breakdown of a long relationship. However, it is noteworthy that the Father is very unpleasant and demeaning to the Mother, including calling her a &#8220;retard&#8221;, which supports her case that he undermined her confidence and made her feel that no-one else would want to have a relationship with her.</p>

Dr Robinson agreed with Dr Samuels that it was unlikely that the cause was an infection given Z&#8217;s very rapid recovery.</p>

He told the hospital that he had injured his hand on a car bonnet. However, in his statement and oral evidence he said that he injured his hand by hitting it on the kitchen hob, and he said he had subsequently made an insurance claim for the hob. The Mother said this was an incident when he had been arguing with her and tried to hit her but actually hit his hand on the hob. I have no doubt the Mother&#8217;s version is true. The reason for lying to the hospital was because he would inevitably have been asked why he hit his hand on the hob so hard he injured it, and the domestic abuse might have been revealed. He said in court that he did not remember telling the hospital about the car bonnet. But again, the record is clear. Notably, in oral evidence he accepted that he and the Mother were having an argument, having previously denied that they argued. He said this is the only occasion they shouted at each other, which is simply unbelievable. This is a good example of the way the Father&#8217;s evidence came out.

Firstly, he told the police he had bought the kit off eBay and he would check his eBay account. However, he told the court he had done so and could find no trace of the purchase, whether on eBay or Amazon. If he bought the kit on the internet, then he would be able to trace and prove the purchase. However, he did not do so and gave no explanation for why not. Secondly, there is no reason he would have put the syringes in the safe. Thirdly, he said he did not know where to dispose of the syringes, but the Mother regularly disposed of her EpiPens so it would have been easy to ask her how to dispose of them.

However, even in the context of child care law, I think the courts should be slow to allow parties to advance theories for which they could have sought to obtain supporting evidence, but did not do so. The Father did not try to obtain a witness statement from C even though he lives close to the Father and they saw each other so recently. In those circumstances I dismiss the suggestion that C was responsible for the chocolate bar.</p>

In A County Council v K D &amp; L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref> at paragraphs 39 and 44, Charles J observed, "It is important to remember (1) that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and (2) it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence.  The judge must always remember that he or she is the person who makes the final decision." Later in the same judgment, Charles J added at paragraph 49, "In a case where the medical evidence is to the effect that the likely cause is non-accidental and thus human agency, a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence either (a) that on the balance of probability an injury has a natural cause, or is not a non-accidental injury, or (b) that a local authority has not established the existence of the threshold to the civil standard of proof &#8230; The other side of the coin is that in a case where the medical evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of a non-accidental injury or human agency and the clinical observations of the child, although consistent with non-accidental injury or human agency, are the type asserted is more usually associated with accidental injury or infection, a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence that, on the balance of probability there has been a non-accidental injury or human agency as asserted and the threshold is established."</span></p>

The possibility was articulated by Moses LJ in R v Henderson-Butler and Oyediran [2010] EWCA Crim. 126, and in the family jurisdiction by Hedley J in Re R (Care Proceedings: Causation) [2011] EWHC 1715 (Fam): "there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown.  That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof.

That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and the objective standard of care elements of section 31(2)&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

That is why, when presented with a speculative theory based on an unlikely hypothetical base, an expert will rarely discount it and will, in effect, never say never. Fanciful speculation is not an appropriate method of inquiry. What is needed and what the experts have endeavoured to achieve in this case is to piece together all the available information and look at the differential diagnosis. Some of the experts in this case specialise within a particular and very narrow field, and by reason of being experts of referral at centres of excellence, they acquire special knowledge and skill. However, concentration on a very narrow area of expertise can sometimes render it difficult for the expert to see the whole picture. It is for that reason that I find Dr S is best placed to view the overall picture. The judge has the duty of sifting the evidence from the experts, who form their assessments within their particular area of expertise, and the judge has to decide the case by reference to the identified issues. Although the medical evidence is of very great importance, it is not the only evidence in the case. Explanations given by carers and the credibility of those involved with the child concerned are of great significance. All the evidence, both medical and non-medical, has to be considered in assessing whether the pieces of the jigsaw form into a clear convincing picture of what happened.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion&#8221;.</span></p>

If such an identification is not possible &#8211; because, for example, a judge remains genuinely uncertain at the end of a fact finding hearing, and cannot find on the balance of probabilities that A rather than B caused the injuries to the child, but that neither A nor B can be excluded as a perpetrator - it is the duty of the judge to state that as his or her conclusion. To put the matter another way, judges should not, as a result of the decision in Re B, and the fact that it supersedes Re H, strain to identify the perpetrator of non-accidental injuries to children. If an individual perpetrator can be properly identified on the balance of probabilities, then for the reasons given in Re K it is the judge&#8217;s duty to identify him or her. But the judge should not start from the premise that it will only be in an exceptional case that it will not be possible to make such an identification.  There will inevitably be cases - of which this, in our judgment, is one &#8211; where the only conclusion which the court can properly reach is that one of the two parents &#8211; or both - must have inflicted the injuries, and that neither can be excluded.&#8221;</span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8221;. In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt.&#8221;</span></p>

It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household.

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. This professional and realistic approach allowed the Court to focus on what was, in reality, the only live issue, namely; was GL's history of violence sufficient to lead to a finding of failure to protect upon the mother's part?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My starting point is the medical evidence. During and after the three episodes in September 2020 Z was subject to a barrage of tests and subsequent expert consideration. All possible causes of the three episodes have been extensively considered, and ultimately excluded, save for suffocation. It is possible that the first two episodes were instances of either exaggeration or fabrication of symptoms by the Father. However, on the third episode the blood gas readings indicate very clearly that there was a lack of oxygen in his blood. Mr Roche suggests this might have been caused by an infection, but there are absolutely no indicators of infection. Probably most importantly the issue resolved far more quickly than would be expected with an infection. Both the treating clinicians and the experts consider infection highly unlikely in these circumstances. </p>

X suffered three events prior to her sudden death. The medical evidence is that it is more likely that there was one unifying cause rather than a number of coincidental incidents.

I accept that it is necessary not to fall into the trap of thinking that a series of unlikely or unexplained events necessarily leads to a conclusion of FII. The caselaw shows that unlikely events do happen.  However, in this case we have the large number of unexplained events, primarily to X and Z, combined with the lack of any supporting evidence for a medical diagnosis other than airway obstruction. Combined with this is the medical evidence that Z has suffered no similar incidents since he was removed from his parents&#8217; care, a factor which Dr Robinson places very considerable weight upon.</p>

On each occasion it was the Father who found them or was with them, and the Mother was either not in the room or asleep. When X was alive the Father was not living in the house full time, often being away during the week for work. Therefore, the coincidence of the timing becomes more important. Further, when Y was born the Mother said (and the Father agreed) that the Father was not left alone with him because of the onset of the Father&#8217;s seizures. Therefore, the opportunity for the Father to inflict injury upon Y when he was a baby was much more limited than upon either X or Z.</p>

I have set these out above, but they include lying about the abusive phone call, lying to the supervisor about being unconscious for 40 minutes, lying to the hospital about the car bonnet and lying about the syringes. It is important that the Father is prepared to tell clear &#8220;bald faced&#8221; lies with complete composure and no outward sign he is telling a lie. The Mother&#8217;s assessment appears to me to be correct, the Father will tell a lie until he is confronted with absolutely unequivocal evidence to the contrary. He then says he either does not recall the event or thinks of another lie to avoid the conclusion that is contrary to his case. This case is a good example of the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gestmin</span>, it would be very difficult to tell the Father was telling a lie except where there is clear third party evidence.</p>

The motivation for his lies may vary, but he appears to have no regard for the truth, and he tells deliberate lies to deceive for his advantage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, there is a clear pattern of the Father seeking medical attention when there is no evidence of any objective cause. There are, as set out above and in detail in the CLINCO report, a truly extraordinary number of medical presentations for the Father with very little, if any, evidence of underlying medical causes. The psychological reasons behind this presentation is unfathomable, and ultimately not my task to determine. It seems likely that it is some form of medical attention seeking, but the degree of conscious or unconscious motivation is unknowable. However, according to Dr Robinson and Dr Fear there can be some correlation between such behaviour and FII. On a fairly basic level, if the Father is constantly seeking medical attention for himself because of some underlying psychological need, then that may well give rise to the same pattern of behaviour with the children. It might be, in some cases, that this would be an instance of extreme anxiety leading to exaggeration. However, here the Father&#8217;s lies and the fact that the incidents only occur when he is alone with the children points strongly to induced rather than exaggerated disorders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, and closely related, is the history of the Father&#8217;s seizures and other disorders. Dr Yogarajah&#8217;s view is that these were functional seizures, and Dr Fear considers that the Father suffers from a somatoform disorder. I have very real doubts about this, although of course I am not a clinician. Both Dr Yogarajah and Dr Fear made clear that they did not investigate the veracity of the Father&#8217;s account. Dr Yogarajah said it was simply not possible for him to do so with his patients, and Dr Fear said clinicians generally accept their patient&#8217;s account. The Judge however is in a different position. I have heard the Father give evidence for a day, have heard the Mother&#8217;s evidence, and have examined a wide range of written records. Having undertaken this exercise I have reached the conclusion that the Father has been deliberately inaccurate, or lied, in a number of respects, including exaggerating and lying about his condition on at least two occasions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have also reached the view that the only rational explanation for the chopped up chocolate bar is that the Father was inducing serious allergic reactions in the Mother. The Mother has undoubtedly had a great many serious allergic reactions since she has been in a relationship with the Father. It is noteworthy that she had her allergies under control until she met him. It is simply not possible to decide what proportion of the allergic reactions were induced by the Father. It may be that she became more susceptible for a period after the children were born. However, 19 such reactions in a five year period for someone who was very careful is a surprisingly high number. Added to that is the coincidence of timing, that the reactions only came on after she met the Father. Critically, there is simply no other rational explanation for the chocolate bar incident, bizarre though it is.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These conclusions cast real doubt on whether the Father has lied to the clinicians rather than merely exaggerating symptoms. Dr Yogarajah said that the Father&#8217;s description of his seizures rang true and would be difficult for a lay person to make up. However, the Father was in my view quite capable of reading symptoms on the internet. Whether he had genuine seizures as a child and then this tied into his adult presentation goes beyond my role or expertise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence as to the domestic abuse. It is correct that there is very little corroborative evidence, but that is often the case with domestic abuse. The most surprising aspect of this issue is that no professional spotted any signs of domestic abuse, neither Mr P nor the health visitor, nor any of the various midwives and doctors who saw the Mother through the relevant periods. Further, it appears that the Mother&#8217;s own family were wholly unaware. It is also somewhat surprising that the Mother at no point confided in her family, even though they live close by and she has a warm and apparently supportive relationship with them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother&#8217;s presentation I can only describe as odd. She appeared both incurious and highly passive in the witness box, but that is not the way she came across in the March phone call, nor the way the family support worker described her, and also not the way Mr P had perceived her. I also note that she had an element of planning, and perhaps even guile, which were not apparent in her oral evidence. She took photos of her injuries years before she told anyone. She sent a photo to make the Father think she had gone to the cinema when she had not done so. She took photos of the syringe and the chocolate bar even though she did not at that stage plan to leave the Father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, despite these factors I accept her evidence for the following reasons. Firstly, she has given a very detailed account, in particular of the incident when she says the Father forced her to continue with sex against her will. I do not think the Mother has the imagination or the self-confidence to make up such a detailed account. Mr Roche suggests that she had a long time to concoct the story, and the detail may have come out of effectively leading questions from the police. But there is no evidence to support this, and the detail is very unlikely to be something the Mother was led into by the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, there is clear evidence that the Father loses his temper and is abusive. This comes from the recorded phone call when he was highly abusive to the Mother, but also the fact that he now accepts he lost his temper when he hurt his hand on the cooker, and with his mother at Christmas 2021. He had previously made no admission about losing his temper. It seems that the Father, even on his own narrative, has not given an honest account of the relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, and importantly, the Mother&#8217;s account fits into a fairly classic pattern of domestic abuse. The Father diminished her self-confidence and told her than no-one else would want her. The fact he called her a &#8220;retard&#8221; on the recorded phone call strongly supports this analysis. Many such relationships are characterised by the abusive partner saying that they will change, but also undermining the victim. I continue to find it odd that the Mother did not tell her family. This is not a situation where the Mother was socially isolated, or that the Father kept her away from her family and friends. But I accept Mr Samuels&#8217; submission that the Mother knew her family liked the Father, and she may have felt there was a risk that they would not have believed her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, the Mother&#8217;s explanation that she is a private person and did not want to share details with her family is not inherently implausible. There is potential shame and embarrassment about admitting that she was in an abusive relationship. The contents of the phone call certainly suggest that the Father undermined the Mother&#8217;s confidence in a very broad way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do, however, find that the Mother has failed to protect the children, not merely to the degree accepted by Mr Samuels in her remaining in abusive relationship. I take into account the need to be careful about &#8220;hindsight bias&#8221; and not expect the Mother to have understood events she did not see. However, she was fully aware that the Father was not just aggressive and violent to her, but also that he was a persistent and determined liar. He was presenting himself as a loving partner when he was violently abusing her. On one occasion she says he tried to hit her when Y was in her arms. Despite X&#8217;s death and the younger children being taken into care after an ALTE to Z, she still waited another 17 months before informing the professionals about the abuse.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, beyond that, the Mother was living in a house with the Father when he was calling the emergency services on a truly extraordinary number of occasions, either for himself or the children. Her reaction to this is impossible to understand. Perhaps, as she suggested, she had become completely normalised to it, but in a situation where one child had died, her complete lack of curiosity or questioning about what was happening, is in my view itself a failure to protect. This is the distinction from some of the other cases. The Mother knew X had died when the Mother was asleep. Her failure to question the Father when similar incidents started with Z is in my view a failure to protect.</p>

But the key point in my view is that the Mother knew that he was manipulative and untruthful and therefore was not in the same position as the professionals. In the light of that knowledge, her failure to apparently ask any questions of the Father about what was happening to the children or raise her knowledge of the Father&#8217;s conduct with the professionals is in my view a failure to protect the children. </p>
