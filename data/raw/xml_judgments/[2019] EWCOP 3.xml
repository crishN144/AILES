The Official Solicitor, who acted for A in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, has submitted through Mr Karim QC and Miss Gardner that the relevant information can be pared back to three essential components; the Official Solicitor took a different, and more expansive, approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>. The local authority (adopting a line more akin to the arguments advanced across the board in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>) has proposed that it should involve a fuller range of information.  As it will be seen ([37]), I have taken a view which is closer to the approach of the local authority in this case, and of all of the parties in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have approached the central issues arising here with keen attention to the statutory assumption that Miss B has &#8220;capacity unless it is established that [she] lacks capacity&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>).  My focus has been principally on <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref></span> and <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref></span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span> &#8211; and specifically, on whether, in relation to the matters under debate, she is unable, &#8220;at the material time&#8221; (i.e. now), to make a decision for herself &#8220;because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>).  It is important in this case (and, as will be seen, influential in the outcomes proposed) to have regard to the availability and appropriateness of &#8220;practicable steps&#8221; to help Miss B to make the relevant decisions (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>); this is one of the three key parameters of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>.   As the Mental Capacity Code of Practice stresses: &#8220;it is important not to assess someone's understanding before they have been given relevant information about a decision&#8221; (para 4.16) and that &#8220;it is important to assess people when they are in the best state to make the decision, if possible&#8221; (para 4.46). </p>

If it is shown on the balance of probabilities that she is unable in any of these respects, then she is regarded as &#8220;unable to make a decision for [her]self&#8221;.  As is commonly the case, I have been most concerned with the issues of &#8216;understanding&#8217; ((a) above) and &#8216;using and weighing&#8217; ((c) above). </p>

Particularly given the essentially binary nature of the capacity question, I am keen to ensure that all reasonable opportunities have been given to Miss B, where relevant, to demonstrate her abilities before reaching definitive conclusions.  </p>

Miss B&#8217;s social media activity has, over the last three years, caused repeated concern to her adult social care workers.  She has been known to send intimate photographs of herself, and to communicate her address and other personal information about herself, to male strangers.  She is very keen to be in a relationship with a male.  She is known to search the internet for a boyfriend by typing in male forenames, and when men respond, she asks them directly whether they will be her boyfriend.  Once she has made a link with a potential mate, and they respond to her, she views them as a &#8216;friend&#8217; and will quickly tell them that she loves them and wants to meet with them.  She routinely &#8216;sex chats&#8217; with males.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Unsurprisingly, a number of specific safeguarding concerns have been raised in this respect.  For example, in 2016, she established contact with a male (Mr D), who early on in their communications told her that he would slit his wrists if she did not send him money. It is not known whether she did send money.  Miss B told her care workers that she planned to live with Mr D &#8220;and have children&#8221; with him, though she had not at that point actually met him.  Mr D had a history of criminal offending, including domestic assaults, and was said to suffer from a personality disorder and mental ill-health; through multi-agency intervention, the police managed to track down Mr D and dissuade him from meeting with Miss B.  However, during 2017, Miss B &#8216;met&#8217; a number of other men through social media.  Adult social services continued to monitor her behaviour and sought to advise her of the risks and support her. </p>

Ostensibly inconsistent conclusions have been reached through these assessments over time about Miss B&#8217;s capacity: while she has been shown to lack capacity in relation to consenting to sexual relations in October 2016, she was found to be capacitous in this respect in January </p>

While she was assessed as not having the capacity to understand the risks associated with engaging in conversations with males unknown to her in October 2016, she was found to be capacitous in this regard in January 2017; by May 2018 she was assessed as lacking capacity again to understand the risks of befriending strangers on the internet.  Notably, Miss B has been assessed in relatively recent times as having capacity in relation to her care and support needs (assessment 4.11.16).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no single or clear explanation for the discrepancy in outcome of these assessments, as Miss B&#8217;s learning disability and cognitive functioning is assessed as static not fluctuating. It seems likely that some &#8216;teaching&#8217; offered by the community team for learning disability in 2017, educating her in relation to sexual relations and social media, was effective in those areas. Miss B appears to have retained information following that learning, at least for a short period; it is possible that she then forgot this information (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(3)</ref></span><span/><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span> of course provides that: &#8220;The fact that a person is able to retain the information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent him from being regarded as able to make the decision&#8221;).  There is also a small chance that there may have been either a lack of clarity on the part of the assessors about the application of the statutory criteria or the &#8216;relevant information&#8217; which Miss B should know, and/or an inconsistency has crept in to the outcomes through assessments undertaken by different assessors.   The variability of outcome might serve to underline the importance of presenting information to P in a way that is consistent and appropriate to meet the individual&#8217;s needs and circumstances, attaching importance to explaining information using the most effective form of communication for that person (such as simple language). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In 2018, fresh concerns were raised about Miss B sending explicit sexual messages, intimate photographs, and money to men who were not known to her, but who she referred to as her &#8220;boyfriends&#8221;.  It was through this behaviour that she met Mr C.  He is a man in his seventies who is a convicted sex offender, classed as &#8216;medium / high risk&#8217; and subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (&#8216;SHPO&#8217;).  Although Miss B has been advised of the risks posed by Mr C, she bluntly refuses to believe the truth about his offending history.  She remains in regular contact with him; she has met him several times, causing him on one occasion to be in breach of his SHPO.  On at least one occasion she has stayed overnight with him at his home.  Messages sent to Miss B by Mr C reveal that he describes her as his &#8216;mistress&#8217; or his &#8216;slave&#8217;.    Miss B has confided in her social worker that she wishes to have his baby.  Through Mr C it is believed that Miss B has met three of Mr C&#8217;s &#8216;friends&#8217; on social media, with whom it is said she has engaged in sex chats.  Even recently, in discussion with Dr. Rippon, Miss B refuted as &#8216;lies&#8217; what she has been told of Mr C&#8217;s offending history.  For his part, Mr C has worryingly confirmed to his probation officer that: </p>

In this regard, counsel has rightly focused, when testing the evidence and making submissions, on the extent to which Miss B is influenced in her decision making by others &#8211; notably her father and/or Mr. C.  Undoubtedly both men do exercise an influence over her; I was told (though make no finding) that her father can be abusive to her, verbally, and imposes boundaries on her which she finds unwelcome, whereas Mr C is persistent, and it may be thought controlling through his continual communications with her via social media (generally WhatsApp). I am satisfied that influence is a factor, but I share the view of Dr. Rippon that it is not actually operative on her decision making, and is in any event not more significant than the clearer evidence about impairment of the mind (Parker J in <span style="font-style:italic">NCC v PB &amp; TB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/14" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 14</ref> at [86]).   </p>

This case has revealed for me, once again, some of the anomalies of the required and disciplined approach in cases concerning capacity: thus, it will be shown that Miss B will be assessed as having capacity to decide on residence, but not her care (even if her proposed favoured residence is with someone who palpably will not care appropriately for her); she may have capacity to consent to sexual relations, but not have capacity to decide with whom to have those relations, or indeed any form of contact.  That is the law which I must apply. </p>

The local authority submitted that there was reason to believe that Miss B lacks capacity in this area of decision-making for the purposes of <span style="font-style:italic">section 48</span>; Mr Garlick submitted that the fact that the family arrangements for dealing with finance had allowed Miss B no experience of being responsible for her finances meant that there was insufficient evidence that she would not in the future be able to manage her property and affairs, and therefore that a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref></span> declaration was not appropriate.

In this regard, I have reminded myself of the cautionary words which I cited above (see [21]) &#8211; namely that I should not impose too high a test of capacity to decide issues such as residence for fear of discriminating against Miss B.  In this regard, I am not satisfied that the local authority has discharged the burden of proving that Miss B does not have capacity; I find &#8211; as the Official Solicitor argues &#8211; that she <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> have capacity to make decisions in relation to residence.   </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.59in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[25] The first question on which I am asked to rule is whether, in undertaking a capacity assessment, internet and social media use should form a sub-set of a person&#8217;s ability to make a decision about either &#8216;contact&#8217; or &#8216;care&#8217;. Having heard argument in this case, and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, I have reached the clear view that the issue of whether someone has capacity to engage in social media for the purposes of online &#8216;contact&#8217; is distinct (and should be treated as such) from general consideration of other forms of direct or indirect contact.  I am satisfied that wider internet use is different from general issues surrounding care.  There is a risk that if social media use and/or internet use were to be swept up in the context of care or contact, it would lead to the inappropriate removal or reduction of personal autonomy in an area which I recognise is extremely important to those with disabilities.  As the Court of Appeal made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">PC v NC and City of York Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/478" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 478" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 478</ref> at [35], the court should consider the issues reasonably specifically:  </p>

The use of the internet and the use of social media are inextricably linked; the internet is the communication platform on which social media operates.  For present purposes, it does not make sense in my judgment to treat them as different things.  It would, in my judgment, be impractical and unnecessary to assess capacity separately in relation to using the internet for social communications as to using it for entertainment, education, relaxation, and/or for gathering information.&#8221; </p>

Although counsel in this case [<span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>] prepared an &#8216;agreed&#8217; formula, I have had the benefit of wider argument on the issue in the two cases.  Critical to my assessment of capacity in this regard, and the issue on which focus has been brought in this hearing, is what should be the &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; which P needs to understand for the purposes of determining capacity to make a decision to use social media for the purposes of developing or maintaining connections with others (within the functionality / ability test).  I have been careful not to overload the test with peripheral detail, but to limit it to the &#8220;salient&#8221; factors (per <span style="font-style:italic">LBL v RYJ</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/2664" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 2664 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2664 (Fam)</ref> at [24], and <span style="font-style:italic">CC v KK &amp; STCC</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2012/2136" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCOP 2136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCOP 2136</ref> at [69]).

It is widely known that internet-use can be addictive; accessing legal but extreme pornography, radicalisation or sites displaying inter-personal violence, for instance, could cause the viewer to develop distorted views of healthy human relationships, and can be compulsive.  Such sites could cause the viewer distress.  I take the view that many capacitous internet users do not specifically consider this risk, or if they do, they are indifferent to this risk.  I do not therefore regard it as appropriate to include this in the list of information relevant to the decision on a test of capacity under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>.&#8221; </p>

When asked in 2016 about contacts made through social media, Miss B was unable to say how she would tell if someone was &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;bad&#8217; on Facebook.  Miss B was further asked two years later (May 2018) how she would be able to work out who was a good or not a good person on social media; Miss B stated: </p>

Dr. Rippon was of the view that Miss B had struggled to identify strategies to keep herself safe, and was concerned that Miss B viewed &#8216;friends&#8217; who she met on Facebook as important to her, not considering it possible that they were capable of doing her harm.  She had difficulty in understanding what other people&#8217;s motives might be.  There is strong evidence that she is victim of the behaviours described as &#8216;conduct risk&#8217; and &#8216;contact risk&#8217; set out at [4] in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>.  Miss B&#8217;s behaviours are not, I am satisfied, merely &#8216;unwise&#8217;.  They are attributable to the impairment of her functioning of her mind.  </p>

As I earlier indicated, in 2016, a mental capacity assessment concluded that Miss B lacked capacity to consent to sexual relations because she did not understand the risk of sexually transmitted infection.  Later assessment, following a period of education, (see [15] above) concluded that Miss B <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> understand that risk, had retained that information, and was able to weigh the information, sufficiently to satisfy professionals that she was capacitous in this regard.  That said, there was some doubt about whether the professional conducting the assessment had done so applying the correct test (<span style="font-style:italic">IM v LM, AB and Liverpool City Council</span> [2014] EWCA 37).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence placed before me reveals that she continues to understand the mechanics of sexual intercourse and the risk of pregnancy (per Dr. Rippon).  The evidence however reveals that she is once again less objectively clear in her understanding or appreciation of the risks of sexually transmitted infection.  She recently told the social worker that she did not consider that risk of a sexually transmitted infection arose unless the male had a &#8220;dirty penis&#8221;, and that as Mr C has a shower in his house (&#8220;and he had a clean dick and showered every day&#8221;), this risk would not arise.  I regard this as such a flawed appreciation (her &#8216;using or weighing&#8217;) of the risks of sexually transmitted infection through sexual relations that it falls outside a proper &#8216;understanding&#8217; for the purposes of <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref></span>; indeed her &#8216;appreciation&#8217; of the risks would be likely to give her a false sense of security on the issue.  Dr. Rippon was not sure why Miss B&#8217;s appreciation of sexually transmitted infection appears to have changed, but felt that with some practicable help, her understanding could potentially be restored and/or improved. </p>

I do not agree, and share Dr. Rippon&#8217;s view that Miss B&#8217;s understanding of the information relevant to sexual relations is currently erroneous, and that currently therefore there is reason to believe that Miss B lacks capacity in relation to this matter.  The local authority proposes some education for Miss B in this area, with a view to re-assessing the capacity question once she has had that practicable help.
