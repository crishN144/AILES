Regrettably, the parents have now been engaged in one form of litigation or another since 2009.   Within that context, I made clear to both parties at the outset of these proceedings that in determining the issues before the court I would not be assisted by a detailed forensic exploration of each and every allegation and counter-allegation levelled by the parents over the course of the past 8 years.  It is within this context that I begin by examining the background that leads up to the present situation.  </p>

By the Nepalese Bikram Samvat calendar, on 20 August 2062 T was found abandoned in a temple in Chitwan in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (although I note that other documentation seen by the expert appears to suggest that T was discovered near a bridge in Kathmandu).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the record of T&#8217;s discovery provided by the first orphanage to which she was taken converts the Bikram Samvat calendar date of 20 August 2062 to 13 August 2005 AD, the expert in Nepalese law makes clear that the correct conversion is in fact to 6 December 2006 AD.  It would appear however that the date in the documentary record of T&#8217;s discovery provided by the first orphanage is in any event incorrect.  Subsequent Police documents examined by the expert suggest that the date of T&#8217;s discovery was 13 July 2006 and that she arrived at the first orphanage on 15 July 2006 before being transferred to an orphanage in Kathmandu on 16 July 2006.  In the circumstances, the miscalculated AD date given in the records of the first orphanage of 13 August 2005 appears to predate the date given by the Police for T&#8217;s discovery by nearly 12 months, and the correctly calculated AD date of 6 December 2006 post-dates the date of discovery given by the Police by nearly six months.  Notwithstanding these discrepancies, thereafter T&#8217;s date of birth was consistently recorded in the Nepalese documentation as 13 August 2005.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Police documents examined by the expert indicate that on 16 July 2006 the relevant Ward Police Office in Kathmandu instigated a search for the birth parents or relatives of T by writing to the central Police Office in Kathmandu reporting the discovery of T.  A further letter was issued by the Police on 18 July 2006 providing details of T and her discovery.  A public notice was issued and placed in the National Daily Vernacular newspaper with a picture of T giving 21 days to a parent or concerned relative to claim T and register her birth.  It would appear that Police investigations continued until at least October 2006. There is no evidence that a parent or relative came forward. On 7 December 2006 T was certified by the District Administration Office in Kathmandu as being an orphan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequent to T's move to an orphanage in Kathmandu, the mother and the father were introduced to T.  Thereafter there followed an adoption of T by the mother and father under Nepalese law in 2008.  It is important to note that on the evidence available to the court it is clear that neither parent was domiciled or habitually resident in Nepal at the time they adopted T in that jurisdiction in 2008.  Neither parent seeks to dispute this conclusion in respect of domicile or habitual residence.</p>

That documentation indicates that that adoption took place on 28 July 2008 and was completed under the law of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.  As I have noted, prior to the adoption the evidence demonstrates that an extensive search was carried out in an attempt to locate members of T&#8217;s birth family.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following their adoption of T the parents moved with her to live in Dubai.  Following her arrival in Dubai T was granted British Citizenship.  I have had sight of a Certificate of Registration dated the 16&#160;September 2008, registering T as a British citizen.  The precise circumstances in which T was granted British Citizenship remain, despite considerable efforts by the parties, unclear.  However, the &#8216;Adoption Guarantee Letter&#8217; dated 5 December 2006 to which I have already referred states the intention to grant British citizenship for T upon her adoption by the parents by way of the discretion afforded to the Home Secretary by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61" uk:canonical="1981 c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">British Nationality Act 1981</ref>.  That letter was signed by the British Consul in Kathmandu.  Within this context, and in accordance with the intent of the &#8216;Adoption Guarantee Letter&#8217; T&#8217;s Certificate of Registration makes clear that she was registered as a British Citizen by the Home Secretary pursuant to the power conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/61" uk:canonical="1981 c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref> on 16&#160;September 2008.  The British Certificate of Registration uses the date T&#8217;s birth was <span style="font-style:italic">registered </span>in Nepal, namely 15 October 2005, as her date of birth rather than her given birth date of 13 August 2005.  Notwithstanding the use of the 13 August 2005 in the Nepalese documentation, T now considers 15 October 2005 to be her date of birth.  I agree with the view taken by all parties that there is no merit in seeking to disturb this position notwithstanding the uncertainties as to her date of birth raised by the documentation now available.</p>

On or around 14 July 2010 the mother left the family home taking T with her and moved to Sharjah whilst the father was away on business.   The law of the UAE required the father to give his permission for the mother to take up her new employment.  The mother contends that the father refused to take the necessary steps in this regard.  The father contends that the mother left no indication as to where she and T were and that it took him some weeks to locate them.  The mother enrolled T in a school in Sharjah.</p>

In light of the mother&#8217;s travel ban in the UAE the mother contends that the authorities would not agree to a member of the maternal family travelling to collect T in order to bring her to England.  In April 2013 the mother&#8217;s name was removed from the travel ban list of the UAE following assistance rendered by the UK Government and the Ambassador to the UAE in London.  The mother commenced monthly trips to the UAE with a view to seeing T.  She was detained by the immigration authorities upon entry on each occasion that she visited before being allowed to proceed.

Following her deportation, the mother commenced a campaign on Facebook, with a Facebook page entitled &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Rescue T</span>&#8221;.  Whilst the mother contends that this site evolved, ultimately, into a blog through which she seeks to assist people in a similar situation to her own, it is plain on the mother&#8217;s own evidence that over a significant period of time she placed into the public domain information that concerned matters intensely private to T.  The mother also used the medium to address T publically. The father asserts, in evidence that was not challenged, that at Christmas 2014 the mother posted publically the following message to T &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he even abandons you for a significant part of the Christmas holiday to go abroad leaving you alone with a maid for days on end.  How utterly, incredibly selfish!  Again, you best interests are being ignored.

The mother further conceded that she did not respond to a request from the father that she provide him with T&#8217;s vaccination records, following which refusal T had to be re-vaccinated and suffered a dangerous reaction to one of the additional inoculations, leading to her admission to hospital.</p>

It is clear from the oral evidence I heard that the foundation of their marriage was insecure from the outset.  Both now have a very fixed view about what happened as a result of this.  The father is convinced that he acted with justification having been pushed to the limit by the mother&#8217;s actions in removing T from the family home and denying what he considered proper and consistent contact.  He candidly admits that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was still not getting reasonable access to my daughter, and so in desperation, I filed a case with the relevant authorities</span>&#8221;.  The father contends that he was shocked that this led to a deportation order, worked hard to try and prevent the mother&#8217;s deportation and was bemused as to why the mother acquiesced to her deportation from the UAE.  For her part, the mother is equally convinced that the father deliberately reported her to the authorities in the UAE with a view to teaching her a lesson for leaving and conspired to get her deported from the UAE so that he could resume care of T and thereafter obstruct her relationship with her daughter.   It was clear from her evidence that she considers her subsequent online campaign to have been entirely justified.  As a result of her experiences, the mother is now understandably fearful of travelling to the UAE.</p>

T undertakes a range of extra-curricular activities including ballet, riding, swimming and sports.  It is clear from the school reports available to the court that T has progressed well in her education.  Her school report from October 2015 shows she is working at or above year group expectations in all areas.  T is described by the school as a happy and sociable girl who enjoys the friendships of her peers and who is polite and well-mannered in the company of adults.

As noted, in 2009 Nepal signed and ratified the 1993 Hague Convention on intercountry adoption.  In 2010 the Special Restrictions on Adoption from Abroad (Nepal) Order 2010 SI 2010/951 placed restrictions on intercountry adoptions in this country where the child was from the jurisdiction of Nepal.

When a court of any country makes an adoption order for an infant child, it does two things: (1) it destroys the legal relationship theretofore existing between the child and its natural parents, be it legitimate or illegitimate; (2) it creates the legal relationship of parent and child between the child and its adopting parents, making it their legitimate child. It creates a new status in both, namely, the status of parent and child. Now it has long been settled that questions affecting status are determined by the law of the domicile. This new status of parent and child, in order to be recognised everywhere, must be validly created by the law of the domicile of the adopting parent. You do not look to the domicile of the child: for that has no separate domicile of its own. It takes its parents' domicile. You look to the parents&#8217; domicile only. If you find that a legitimate relationship of parent and child has been validly created by the law of the parents' domicile at the time the relationship is created, then the status so created should be universally recognised throughout the civilised world, provided always that there is nothing contrary to public policy in so recognising it. That general principle finds expression in the judgment of Scott L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Luck's Settlement Trusts, Walker v.

I think it is correct, notwithstanding that the majority in that case created a dubious exception to it. But it is an essential feature of this principle that the parents should be domiciled in the country at the time: for no provision of the law of a foreign country will be regarded in the English courts as effective to create the status of a parent in a person not domiciled in that country at the time: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re Grove, Vaucher v.

I ought to say, however, that in order for adoption to be recognised everywhere, it seems to me that, in addition to the adopting parents being domiciled in the country where the order is made, the child should be ordinarily resident there: for it is the courts of ordinary residence which have the pre-eminent jurisdiction over the child: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re P.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;It has been suggested that according to the theory of our law no foreign adoption should be recognised unless, at the time it was made, both adopted child and adoptive parent were domiciled within the jurisdiction of the foreign country and that this appeal should be decided accordingly. Our law, however, develops in accordance with the changing needs of man. These have always been ascertained by experience rather than by the rigid application of abstract theory. Experience has shown that there are sound sociological reasons for recognising an adoption in circumstances such as these. Adoption - providing that there are proper safeguards - is greatly for the benefit of the adopted child and of the adoptive parents, and also, I think, of civilised society, since this is founded on the family relationship. It seems to me that we should be slow to refuse recognition to an adoption order made by a foreign court which applies the same safeguards as we do and which undoubtedly had jurisdiction over the adopted child and its natural parents.<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:9.5pt"/>The laws of adoption in South Africa are very nearly the same as our own. The principles underlying them are the same. The whole emphasis is upon the welfare of the child and elaborate precautions are laid down for assuring that the adoption order shall not be made unless it is for the benefit of the child; the consent of the natural parents is required. It is difficult to see why in these circumstances, unless compelled to do so, our courts should refuse to recognise these adoption orders made lawfully in South Africa which conferred nothing but benefits on all the parties concerned.&#8221;</p>

It may or may not be absurd but the danger would exist only if the considerations for adoption in the foreign country concerned were quite alien to our own and our courts were obliged to recognise the adoption whatever the circumstances. This is not so, for it is always open to our courts on grounds of public policy to refuse to recognise a foreign adoption even when the domicile of the adoptive father is impeccable.&#8221;</p>

The second question relates to the concept of adoption for the word itself can bear many shades of meaning from the idea of complete substitution of adopted family for natural family at one end of the spectrum through to an idea much more closely akin to our concept of special guardianship. Clearly the English court should not be recognising (and thus giving effect to) a foreign adoption unless what was conferred by that order is substantially the same as would be conferred by an English order. The third question relates to matters that would be repugnant to our jurisdiction as, for example, if what in reality was involved was the buying and selling of children irrespective of their actual welfare needs.&#8221;</p>

Adoption is taken very seriously indeed in this country and is surrounded by all the safeguards which an active social policy can devise. In some other countries it is taken far less seriously and serves quite different objects. If the foreign adoption was designed to promote some immoral or mercenary object, like prostitution or financial gain to the adopter, it is improbable that it would be recognised in England. But, apart from exceptional cases like these, it is submitted that the court should be slow to refuse recognition to a foreign adoption on the ground of public policy merely because the requirements for adoption in the foreign law differ from those of English law. Here again the distinction between recognising the status and giving effect to its results is of vital importance. Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself&#8230;It is also the case that in interpreting and applying public policy as a ground of non-recognition regard must be paid to the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular the right to family life in Art. 8 and the right to a fair trial in Art. 6.&#8221;</p>

The fact that a child has been living with one parent for a significant period of time does not create a presumption in favour of that person.  However, when considering the outcome that best meets T&#8217;s welfare needs the court should also consider, as an element of its analysis of best interests, the extent to which it is desirable to maintain T&#8217;s current status quo (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E-R (a child)(child arrangements order: best interests)</span> [2015] 2 FCR 385 at [35]).

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;What we heard of the contact and residence arrangements, made as a result of the conditions imposed by the Court of Appeal&#8217;s order granting a stay, confirmed the view that considerable disruption to Harry&#8217;s life would have been involved in a transfer to live with his father.  The distance between the homes of his grandmother and his father exceeds 30 miles, we were told.  It seems inevitable that, if he were to live with his father, he would no longer be able to attend the nursery where he has already made good progress.  Transfer of his residence would involve a great deal more than a change of address.  Many of the familiar aspects of his life which anchor his stability and sense of security would be changed.  The justices were, therefore, right to give significant weight to the desirability of preserving the status quo.  This is a factor which will not always command the importance that must be attached to it in the present case but we are satisfied that it was of considerable significance in the debate as to where this child&#8217;s best interests lay&#8221;.</p>

This is in no way surprising when one considers the efforts to which the mother (and the father) went to adopt T and the loss for the mother that followed consequent on the breakdown of the parents&#8217; marriage.  The mother presented as inward looking and self-involved in the witness box.  She rarely mentioned T&#8217;s interests and tended to view any given issue from her own perspective rather than that of T.  Whilst she plainly cares deeply for her daughter I was left with significant concern about the mother&#8217;s ability to prioritise T&#8217;s emotional needs and her relationship with her father.  Whilst I accept the mother&#8217;s outlook is likely to be, at least in part, a function of her experiences in the UAE following the adoption of T, the best interests of T remain my paramount consideration.  Four points of particular concern arose from evidence I heard from the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the mother&#8217;s negative feelings in respect of the father run very deep indeed and impact heavily on her ability to promote him in a positive light.  Listening to the mother&#8217;s evidence I was left with grave misgivings about the extent to which the mother will be able to promote a relationship between T and her father and to promote for T a positive image of her father were T to move to England to live with her mother.  </p>

I know that she has been well looked-after and her needs are being met</span>&#8221;, in evidence the mother reverted to asserting that T would be at risk of emotional harm in the care of her father and stated that she remained concerned that the father would cause physical and emotional harm to T by reason of him being controlling and manipulating.  The mother appeared <span style="font-style:italic">extremely</span> reluctant to accept the overwhelming weight of evidence showing that father and daughter have a positive relationship, appearing highly sceptical that this was the case.   She characterised the father&#8217;s parenting as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not allowing her the freedom to be herself and being controlling and regimental, quashing some of her sparkle</span>.&#8221; The mother contended that the father&#8217;s parenting style &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">creates a fear in her of not doing or saying the right thing</span>&#8221; and the father &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">has taken advantage of her need to please</span>&#8221; and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">her schedule is based on his needs and not hers</span>&#8221;.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s concluded position in oral evidence appeared to be that T was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">probably</span>&#8221; physically safe in the care of her father but that she was not emotionally safe, claiming &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it is damaging for her to remain with her father, in emotional terms</span>&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, of further concern was that, even with the benefit of hindsight and as I have already noted, the mother struggled to recognise the undesirability of certain of her actions following her departure from the UAE.  The manner in which she pursued her Facebook campaign and blog were, at times, clearly antithetic to T&#8217;s needs. Whilst the project evolved, it appeared that over a significant period of time it involved publicising matters private to the family, and private to T, including photographs of T.  In explaining why she had set up a website that placed T&#8217;s private life on public display the mother said the site provided her (the mother) with support.  When pressed that she had placed private details online her response was simply &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that is what people do</span>&#8221;. When asked about the name of the project she said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I felt she had been kidnapped, that is why I called it &#8216;Rescue T&#8217;</span>&#8221;.   The mother said she did not think she regretted anything about this online activity.  She finally conceded that T may well be upset but did not know whether she would be embarrassed as she questioned whether a 10-year-old would get embarrassed.  The mother concluded that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">at a certain point, she has to know the truth</span>.&#8221;  When it was pointed out that her account was only one version of the &#8220;truth&#8221;, the mother was emphatic that T would need to know &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Not a truth, the truth.  Certain undeniable facts</span>&#8221;.   The evidence of the mother on these matters acted to reinforce my concerns regarding her ability to promote T&#8217;s emotional welfare moving forward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, the mother&#8217;s evidence indicated that she struggles to see T&#8217;s clearly expressed wishes and feelings regarding where she wishes to live as in anyway genuine.  The mother strongly suggested that T had been indoctrinated, saying that she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would not expect her to say anything different</span>&#8221;.  At other points she ascribed T&#8217;s wishes and feelings to habit or lack of understanding, saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she does not know any different so it is not surprising she would say this</span>&#8221;.  When asked by Mr Ford to elaborate the mother said that, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">She has no experience of knowledge of being anywhere else</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The idea of going somewhere else is not within her capacity to understand</span>&#8221;. The mother eventually conceded that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">In so far as she is capable of understanding the issues, they are her genuine wishes</span>&#8221;.  Whilst I have taken account of the fact that the mother has had little direct experience of T over the last three years and that T&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings are antithetic to the mother&#8217;s case, her limited ability to accord respect to T&#8217;s wishes and feelings that the evidence before the court suggests are genuine in nature is troubling.  Allied to this, the mother simply dismissed the impact of T of a change of circumstances that involved her leaving her established life in the UAE and coming to live in England, saying simply that T is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in the position of every other ex-pat child</span>&#8221;. </p>

The mother confirmed she had not responded.  Whilst, when pressed she said she did, with hindsight, regret not answering these emails, ultimately she explained these actions by reference to her own needs, saying, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I had gone through an extreme trauma of my own.  I had to re-build my own life, I had to re-build my own strength before I could offer a life to T.  Although from the outside looking in it is difficult to understand my position it was because I had been through a trauma</span>&#8221;.  A particularly illuminating reply when pressed on why she had not responded to birthday and valentine messages from T the mother said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">To get a random email, it did not fit with </span>my<span style="font-style:italic"> requests for contact with her</span>&#8221;.  Likewise, whilst acknowledging that her failure to provide the father with details of T&#8217;s vaccinations had worked to the manifest detriment of T because she was ill, the mother made clear that she did not regret her actions in this regard.</p>

From her evidence it is clear that the mother remains intensely pre-occupied with the history of this matter, largely to the exclusion of being able to consider matters from T&#8217;s perspective.  One of the most illuminating statements made by the mother in evidence was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am so full of hurt and betrayal as to what happened it is hard for me to communicate</span>&#8221;.  Once again, whilst I accept the mother&#8217;s outlook is likely to be, at least in part, a function of her experiences in the UAE that followed the adoption of T in Nepal, the best interests of T are my paramount consideration.</p>

He rejected the assertion that his views on internet use by T (that her use of the internet should be rationed and monitored) showed an inability to meet T&#8217;s needs and prepare her for the modern world.  He also rejected the (somewhat peculiar) criticism levelled by the mother that his dismay at football supporters swearing in front of T on a train during a visit to England demonstrated an inability to meet T&#8217;s needs.  In response to being challenged about being the father of a teenage girl going through puberty, he stated that he trained as a secondary school teacher and makes clear that he has available to him advice from other parents with daughters.

In respect of where T should live, through Mr Bagchi QC the father submits that it is in T&#8217;s best interests to remain living with him in the UAE and to have extensive contact with her mother.  The father relies on the fact that T has had her home in Dubai since 2008, that she is plainly happy living with him, that she has expressed a strong wish for this to remain the position, that she is thriving at school with a rich social life filled with activities that she loves.  The father submits that the contents of the CAFCASS &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">How it looks to me</span>&#8221; document completed by T shows clearly that Dubai is the centre of her life, that she is closely attached to her father and that she is, in his care, a stable, secure and happy child.   The father submits that to move T from her primary carer, her friends and her school, as well as other aspects of her life she values such as her pets will have an adverse impact on her, especially where such a move will be to a country that is strange to her, in which she has never lived and which has different social and cultural values and a very different climate.  Through Mr Bagchi, the father submits that a move will be further antithetic to T&#8217;s best interests if made at a time when T will have only recently commenced re-building her relationship with her mother and, in any event, in context of T being a child who has already suffered the significant losses associated with being an adopted child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As nature and legal effect of adoption under Nepalese, the adoption law of Nepal (which is provided only by the Country Code and not by a separate statute) does not specify in terms the legal effect of adoption on parental responsibility (as broadly defined by the Nepalese Children Act 2048 (1992) s 4(1)) and the child&#8217;s legal relationship with his or her natural parent.  However, it is clear from the terms and conditions set out in document permitting the adoption of T by the mother and father that it was a requirement of the adoption that they would bring T up &#8220;as their own daughter&#8221;.  Further, under Nepalese law the adopted child is entitled to the same rights as any natural born children of the adopters (Chapter 15(9)(c) of the 1963 Country Code).  Indeed, Nepalese law provides that permission for adoption by a foreign adopter shall only be given if the law of the country of the foreign adopter provides that an adopted child has the same rights as a natural born child (Chapter 15(12)(B) of the 1963 Country Code).  Under Nepalese law the adopted child is not entitled to make a claim on the property of their natural parent (Chapter 15(9)(c) of the 1963 Country Code).  An adoption is not capable of revocation, save by reason of specifically defined defaults (Chapter 15 of the 1963 Country Code).   It is also important to note that under Nepalese law it is a condition of the adoption that the adopter will not permit the conversion of the child to another religion or allow the child to be adopted by a third party.</p>

Further, in circumstances where the order made by the Court of Cassation to surrender T&#8217;s passport to the father may still result in the issuing of an arrest warrant for the mother which would be executed upon her arrival, either the father will need either to forfeit and waive his rights under the judgment of the Court of Cassation and close the current execution file or the mother will need to honour the judgment of the Court of Cassation and surrender T&#8217;s passport to the father.

Whilst I have been mindful of the fact that in 2010 the Special Restrictions on Adoption from Abroad (Nepal) Order 2010 SI 2010/951 placed restrictions on intercountry adoptions in this country where the child was from the jurisdiction of Nepal following concerns regarding such adoptions prior to 2010, the expert evidence in this case, taken with the documentation available to the court, demonstrates to my satisfaction that Nepalese adoption was properly constituted under the laws of that jurisdiction, the adoption process following the law and practice of Nepal and being regarded as lawful in Nepal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am further satisfied on the evidence that the concept of adoption in the jurisdiction of Nepal conforms substantially with the English concept.  Whilst the adoption law of Nepal (which is provided only by the Country Code and not by a separate statute) does not specify in terms the legal effect of adoption of parental responsibility and the child&#8217;s legal relationship with his or her natural parent, the terms and conditions set out in document permitting the adoption of T make clear that it is a requirement of the adoption that they bring T up &#8220;as their own daughter&#8221;.   Within this context, the requirement under Nepalese law that the adopted child have the same rights as any natural born children of the adopters and the fact that the adopted child is not entitled to make a claim on the property of their natural parent speaks to the concept of adoption in Nepal being one of in the legal substitution of the adopted family for the birth family and which creates the legal relationship of parent and child.  The fact that an adoption is not capable of revocation, save by reason of specifically defined defaults, reinforces this conclusion. </p>

I further note the checks and assessments that were conducted before the parents were permitted to adopt T, including an assessment by a competent authority of the parents&#8217; home circumstances in the UAE, which checks and assessments were similar in nature to that required by our domestic legislation.  In the absence of parental consent, the documents indicate that consent was given by the state prior to the adoption being finalised.</p>

In circumstances where Mr Power is clear that T, as a child adopted from a foreign country with parents who have separated, has an enhanced need for certainty as an adopted child in a trans-racial placement, recognition of her adoption will assist in providing this and will assist T developing and making sense of her identity as she grows older.   Recognition will also provide T with greater legal certainty throughout her life with respect to such matters as inheritance rights.

In Wagner an enforceable Peruvian adoption order was denied enforcement in Luxembourg on the grounds that it did not comply with Luxembourg choice of law rules; the latter designated Luxembourg law, which in turn permitted adoption only by married couples. The strict application of the choice of law rules was held to be a violation of Article 8. The European Court of Human Rights, noting that the best interests of the child were paramount in such a case, held that the Luxembourg courts &#8216;could not reasonably disregard the legal status validly created abroad and corresponding to a family life&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I must consider the public policy criterion.  A decision to recognise a foreign adoption in circumstances where the status conditions ordinarily needed to justify such recognition have not been met plainly raises an issue of public policy.   There is a plain public interest in the maintenance of all the safeguards which the developed law of adoption in this jurisdiction has devised in respect of foreign adoptions.   In this regard, it is useful to recall the salutary words of Peter Jackson J in <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v M and Others</span>:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;It is at least arguable that there is good reason why standards for recognition should not be relaxed where approved procedures have not been followed in the case of an adoption from a country that is neither a signatory to the Hague Convention nor a designated country. The world has indeed changed since 1965, and with it the world of intercountry adoption. The ease of international travel has made adoption from overseas more available, with all its benefits and possible pitfalls. The Hague Convention and the overseas adoption procedure are mechanisms that increase confidence that standards are maintained. The same confidence cannot always be felt in relation to adoptions effected in countries that are not Convention signatories, and the importance for child welfare of following approved procedures in these cases is consequently the greater.&#8221;</p>

Rather, this is a case in which the safeguard comprised of the status conditions fall to be considered in respect of a foreign adoption achieved in good faith and which complies with the requirements for recognition in all other respects, the recognition of which adoption is manifestly in the child&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

Whilst not determinative, I am satisfied that T&#8217;s wishes and feelings should be given significant weight.  Those wishes and feelings have been firmly and consistently expressed.  Mr Power was clear when giving evidence that T is a self-assured and forthright girl, comparatively mature who at interview he found to be convincing as to the integrity of her ascertained wishes and feelings.

Having regard to the clarity, strength and consistency of T&#8217;s expressed wishes, I am satisfied that they should attract substantial weight within the court&#8217;s analysis of T&#8217;s welfare and that the court would need a good reason to act against these clearly expressed views in circumstances where, as identified by Mr Power, to do so could well result in her emotional wellbeing and security being jeopardised.   </p>

What cannot however be easily transposed to England are T&#8217;s well established peer and educational relationships and community.

An order requiring T to live with her mother in England would impose upon T a change in direct contradiction to her expressed wishes and would result in the loss of her peer and educational relationships and disruption to her education and current medical treatment and the enhanced need for certainty T has as an adopted child in a trans-racial placement. Such a change of circumstances would remove her from the stability and security she has known for a significant part of her childhood and from a situation in which she is plainly thriving physically, emotionally and educationally.  I am satisfied that this would be antithetic to T&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

In my judgment this need is best met by maintaining the status quo that T is content with and wishes to continue.  I am not able to accept Mr Perkins&#8217; submission that the adoption research he cites in his closing submissions points to a move to the mother care as being in T&#8217;s best interests.  Indeed, in so far as that research is relevant to the welfare analysis that the court has to undertake in this case (and I entertain significant doubts that it is), the fact that difficulties emerge for internationally adopted children during their secondary school years (<span style="font-style:italic">The Study of Intercountry Adoption Outcomes in Ireland </span>(2007) Children&#8217;s Research Centre at Trinity College Dublin) and that nearly two thirds of adoption disruptions occur during secondary school years (<span style="font-style:italic">Beyond the Adoption Order: Challenges, Interventions and Adoption Disruption </span>(2014) DfE) is, of course, an argument <span style="font-style:italic">for</span> maintaining the stability and security currently provided by T&#8217;s placement with her father and an argument <span style="font-style:italic">against</span> any disruption of this absent very good reason.  Further, in circumstances where T, as an adopted child, needs a clear sense of her life story and of being valued by her family, for the reasons I have already articulated, I have grave concerns over the ability of the mother to provide a balanced account of her life story for T. I am satisfied that the father clearly recognises the issues of identity that may face T as she goes through her teenage years and wishes to be able to take T to Nepal to see where she was born and to her experience her birth culture first hand.</p>

It is however crucial that the parents now find a way to co-operate in the upbringing of T that does not expose her to further family strife if further emotional harm to T is to be avoided.   The tentative steps taken by the parents recently towards this end by agreeing contact arrangements are to be heartily commended.  It is also the case that the mother&#8217;s actions in posting information intensely private to T risk causing her emotional harm in the future.  The father is clear that T has already come across her image online.

I consider that the fact that T was able to settle back into the company of her mother with such ease to reflect the level of emotional care that the father has provided to T during the period she has resided within him in the UAE.   Within this context, I do not accept the mother&#8217;s assertion that the father would fail promote a relationship with the mother or that he would seek to obstruct that relationship.  The fact that T was able to resume a natural and relaxed relationship with her mother almost without pause negates any allegation on the part of the mother that he has sought to influence T against her mother.
