	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">A is a little boy, now 14 months of dual British / Ghanaian nationality and heritage. He is much loved by his natural family, seven members of which have attended each day of this hearing and by his foster carer who has cared for him since he was six days old.  The focus of this hearing has been to determine who should now care for A : members of his extended natural family, Mr and Mrs H,  in Ghana, or his foster carer, Ms GG, here in England. It is not possible for either of his parents, his grandmother or any other family member to look after him here.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">This is the second final hearing in public law proceedings concerning A brought by the London Borough of Enfield. The first final hearing concluded with the making of a special guardianship order (&#8216;SGO&#8217;) in favour of GG. The local authority successfully appealed that decision. The SGO was discharged by the Court of Appeal on 16 October 2018 and the matter was remitted for rehearing before me. The judgment of Jackson LJ is reported at <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A (A Child) </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">2018 EWCA Civ 2240.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The local authority&#8217;s case remains that A should be placed under a special guardianship order with remote members of his natural family, Mr and Mrs H, A&#8217;s second cousins (previously described as his aunt and uncle) in Ghana.  </p>

A&#8217;s father, JK, is only able to contemplate a return of A to his joint care with the mother. Neither the mother nor the father, both of whom suffer with significant mental health problems, has pursued a positive case for the return of A to their care. Each recognises that the only realistic options now before the court are for A to be placed with the H&#8217;s in Ghana or with GG in England.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr and Mrs H were joined as parties following the appeal which they attended and have remained in England pending the outcome of this hearing. They continue to offer themselves as long term carers for A in Ghana; in this they are supported by their adult daughter, H. The SGO assessments of them are positive. Since the appeal hearing, A has had contact with Mr and Mrs H and H and a warm relationship has developed between them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">There remain, therefore, as was the position at the first final hearing, two contenders for a SGO, one supported by the local authority and the maternal family and the other by the guardian. As Jackson LJ made clear in his judgment in remitting the case for rehearing, my task has been to look at the matter entirely afresh and independently to determine the appropriate arrangements for A&#8217;s future. </p>

GG, was not entitled to public funding and represented herself. She has done so with considerable skill, dignity, courage and with respect for everyone. Mr and Mrs H were assisted by a friend who acted as an interpreter, the Court having been informed shortly before the hearing began that it had not been possible to secure the services of a court interpreter. With the agreement of all parties, I permitted the maternal grandmother, MA (&#8216;the grandmother&#8217;), supported by her sister, H, the adult daughter of Mr and Mrs H and a friend to support GG to be present.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">A&#8217;s foster carer, GG, is a single British woman of Afro-Caribbean origin. She is a professional state foster carer and is also fostering an Eastern European 15 year old boy on a long terms basis for the local authority. Before seeking a SGO, GG and the maternal family enjoyed a positive relationship. She and the grandmother got on extremely well and shared confidences. GG looked on the grandmother as a mother and the grandmother on GG as a daughter. They live close to each other and Ms GG supported regular contact between A, the maternal family and the siblings in the grandmother&#8217;s home which she also attended. Initially the grandmother was very supportive of A remaining in GG&#8217;s care under a SGO. The guardian described the grandmother and foster carer as &#8220;euphoric&#8221; when this possibility was suggested to them by her. The grandmother later withdrew her support for A remaining with GG: she wished A to be brought up within his natural family. The relationship between the GG and the maternal family thereafter soured and became very hostile; to the extent that the grandmother refused to see A or support contact between A and his siblings in her care. SJ, reflecting the views of her grandmother, refused to see A and is said to have expressed negative views about GG. In evidence the grandmother repeatedly spoke of feeling betrayed, let down by GG and the lack of trust that now exists between them. She sees no hope of their relationship&#8217;s being restored. </p>

The guardian later supported an adjournment of the final hearing to allow for an assessment of the father&#8217;s cousin and the paternal family members in Ghana advanced by the father. They subsequently withdrew from the assessment and the direction for an assessment of them was discharged. At that hearing the guardian supported exploring whether A&#8217;s foster carer could be an alternative option for A. The SG assessment subsequently undertaken of GG was positive. </p>

The local authority later made luke warm attempts to persuade the grandmother to enter into mediation but there was no real enthusiasm for this and the grandmother&#8217;s refusal was taken at face value. Having heard from the grandmother, however, I am satisfied she would have continued to reject mediation; even if more strenuous efforts had been made.  </p>

Her continuing negative influence against GG was such that she interfered in the arrangements being made for GG to be involved in the contact Mr and Mrs H were having with A. The grandmother wrongly informed the local authority that Mr and Mrs H did not agree to GG&#8217;s being present during their contact. I am quite satisfied, having heard the evidence of the guardian and Mr and Mrs H, that the guardian has accurately recorded Mr and Mrs H&#8217;s views at her meeting with them on 23 October 2018 and that their later change of mind was a direct result of the negative influence of the grandmother.  </p>

Where there are competing outcomes, the choice of one outcome over another will commonly entail some degree of interference with those rights. It is well- established under European and domestic law that where there is a conflict between the welfare of the child and the rights of an adult, the child&#8217;s interests will predominate. What is necessary in the individual case is to identify the nature of rights that are engaged and the extent of the proposed interference. This cross-check prevents the choice of an unnecessary interference or one that is disproportionate to the problem. </p>

Without deciding the matter, it would seem that [A] has &#8216;family life&#8217; with his foster carer, qualified by the fact that she has been a professional carer providing a neutral, holding placement. He also has important family life rights with his parents, grandmother and siblings. As to the H&#8217;s, they are the only viable placement within the birth family, but he has never met them, and he might therefore be said to have a right to private life in their regard with the potential for it to develop into family life if he was placed with them.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>It is therefore important to identify not only what rights are engaged but also their short, medium and long-term significance, before going on to consider the justification for any proposed interference. This exercise is of particular importance when the choice is between a placement with relatives and a placement outside the family, certainly where the decision is finely balanced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The Guardian was unable to explain why she had not provided in any of her reports or earlier evidence the detail she had now provided in cross examination on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day of this final hearing about the advantages to A of being placed with Mr and Mrs H. She also struggled to explain how she had reached some of the conclusions she did and why there were important omissions in her report. Her reasoning for concluding that there is a high risk, as opposed to a raised risk that a move from GG to Mr and Mrs H would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;negatively impact upon his overall development and ultimately his mental health in his adult years&#8221;</span><span/><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

	      </authorialNote> was clearly flawed and she had to concede that there was no evidence to support her assertion. The Guardian conceded there was a conflict in her conclusion that an advantage of A going to Ghana would be that he would avoid the negative influence of the grandmother on his primary carer whilst at the same time saying she was relying on the grandmother to underpin sibling contact if A stayed with GG. Further doubt was cast upon the validity of the Guardian&#8217;s analysis and reasoning by her inability to explain what she meant by &#8220;African/English&#8221; <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">At the end of her evidence the Guardian agreed that it would have been very difficult for SJ not to have been aware of the very strong views and feelings of the grandmother and that if the M made negative comments to A, this would be very damaging for him and harmful to M and SJ. It would also be damaging for the children to be involved in court proceedings if disputes occurred over contact. The Guardian&#8217;s optimism that the grandmother would support contact and that no order was necessary was patently misplaced.  </p>

Is it necessary for A to grow up with his foster carer when such a placement with his natural family is available to him? As Mr Twomey submits, this is not a case where a sibling will lose contact with his brother or sister if he is placed with the extended family in Ghana or a case of a life long relationship being lost as the consequence of the placement. It is in reality, a comparison of the nature and quality of the contact A will have with his siblings and maternal family. Each form of contact has its own benefits, advantages and disadvantages. If placed with Mr and Mrs H, A will enjoy contact with his siblings and maternal family in the UK for extended concentrated periods during school holiday times (the school holidays in Ghana and the UK coincide). </p>

I have made some observations about her evidence and analysis earlier in this judgment. It is disappointing that, despite the length of these proceedings and despite an informative judgment from the Court of  Appeal, the Guardian failed to consider the matters drawn to her attention and highlighted by Jackson LJ, particularly at paragraph 31 of his judgment<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="18">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.51in"> A55 </p>

The Guardian&#8217;s written and oral evidence shows that she failed to engage with the most significant and prominent advantages to A of a placement with Mr and Mrs H and that she failed to consider and analyse equally the risks and positives of each placement. She has given insufficient consideration, for example, to A&#8217;s identity needs, the importance of his Ghanaian heritage and cultural background and the strong support for the placement from the maternal family. And she has placed too much weight and optimism on good sibling contact resuming if A remains with GG.  Significant parts of the Guardian&#8217;s written evidence central to her analysis were flawed and did not withstand scrutiny in her oral evidence<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="19">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I referred at the outset of this judgment to the high quality care that Ms GG has given to A. With her, he has had the very best start in life he could possibly have had, the foundations of which will now stand him in good stead, not only for his move to Ghana with Mr and Mrs H but also for the rest of his life. Ms GG is a gentle and caring woman of integrity with a strong Christian faith.  She is a foster carer of the highest calibre who has found herself, through no fault on her part, ostracised by A&#8217;s family and treated with disdain and distance by the local authority. Foster carers of the calibre of Ms GG are a rare resource and should be valued and supported.  I hope that Ms GG, though very bruised by the experience she has had with A and this local authority, will feel able to reflect on her decision to stop fostering. I trust that the local authority too will reflect and recognise the immense contribution Ms GG can make to other children in need of the high quality care she can offer. Without making any statement of policy or guidance, I would encourage guardians to think and long and hard before canvassing and encouraging a state foster carer who is holding a child in a neutral interim position, to apply for a SGO when there is a good placement available within the natural family. This is particularly so where<span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>as in this case<span style="font-weight:bold">,</span> there is a family placement available with a glowing assessment, a recommendation for placement of the child with that family member and where the placement has the support of the child&#8217;s mother and immediate family. Each case will turn on its own facts. There will, of course, be cases where it is right for a child to remain with his or her foster carer on a long term basis, sometimes under a SGO or, exceptionally, even with an adoption order being granted in their favour. This is not such a case. </p>
