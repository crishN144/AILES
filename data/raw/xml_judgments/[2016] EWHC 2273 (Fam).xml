I have now given final judgment in thirteen cases (Cases A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L, M and N). This is Case O. Case K, which was before me in July 2016, has been adjourned part heard for further argument. Six further cases (Cases P, Q, R, S, T and U) are currently awaiting final hearing. There is at least one other (Case V) pending. There are probably others, for the HFEA has identified no fewer than 90 cases where there are &#8220;anomalies&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant, who I will refer to as X, is a woman who was at all material times in a relationship with the first respondent, a woman who I will refer to as Y. They entered into a civil partnership in 2009, which was converted into a marriage in 2015. They had planned their family carefully. Each wanted to bear a child, using sperm provided by the same donor. Because X is somewhat older than Y, they decided that X should be the first to have treatment. Following IUI treatment provided by St Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Centre for Reproductive Medicine, operated by Barts Health NHS Trust, which I shall refer to as Barts, a clinic which is and was regulated by the HFEA, X gave birth to their first child, who I will refer to as C1, in 2010. C1 had already been conceived when X and Y entered into their civil partnership. Following further treatment at another clinic, Y gave birth to their second child, who I will refer to as C2, some years later. No issue arises in relation to C2; the issue (see below) arises in relation to C1.  X seeks, together with other relief, a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 55</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> that Y is, in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/36" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 36</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>, the legal parent of C1. Y is wholeheartedly supportive of X&#8217;s application.</p>

With the exception of the clinic, which was represented, although not joined, none has sought either to be joined or to attend the hearing. The clinic&#8217;s position, entirely supportive of X&#8217;s application, is set out in various witness statements and in the position statement prepared by Ms Dorothea Gartland, who appeared before me on its behalf. Given the nature of one of the issues (see below), I decided that C1 needed to be joined and a guardian appointed. Happily, it was possible for the same guardian to act in this case as had acted in all the other cases before me where there was a guardian. The guardian was represented by Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC and Mr Thomas Wilson.  X was represented by Mr James Turner QC.</p>

This is partly because it affects the status of the person adopted, and indeed adoption modifies the most fundamental of human relationships, that of parent and child. It effects a change intended to be permanent and concerning three parties. The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents.&#8221;</p>
