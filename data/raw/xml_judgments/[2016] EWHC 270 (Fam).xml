	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">X was born following a surrogacy agreement between DM, <span style="font-size:11pt">LK </span>and Mr and Mrs J. Although she was born in this jurisdiction, the embryo transfer took place at a clinic in Cyprus, called the Genesis Centre for Fertility and Human Pre-Implantation Genetics (the Clinic). At the time of this arrangement there were no statutes and/or regulations regarding surrogacy in Cyprus. That changed in May 2015 when provisions were made to regulate these arrangements through a system that permits altruistic surrogacy; commercial surrogacy is prohibited.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The original surrogacy agreement entered into in 2012 was between <span style="font-size:11pt">LK</span>, her then husband and Mr and Mrs J. There were two embryo transfers, created using the gametes of <span style="font-size:11pt">LK </span>and her then husband. Both were unsuccessful. <span style="font-size:11pt">LK </span>and her husband separated in mid 2013 and have since divorced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">LK </span>subsequently met DM. Early in their relationship they discussed having children. They decided to pursue surrogacy and travelled to Cyprus in January 2014 to donate their gametes at the Clinic. According to LK she asked the doctor at the Clinic whether the surrogate should be informed that the embryo was created from DM&#8217;s genetic material, rather than her former husband&#8217;s. She reports she was told that was not necessary and that she and DM were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;surprised&#8217;</span> but <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;relieved&#8217;</span> by that advice. Their relief was from concerns that any delay may impede their chance of a successful transfer. It has not been possible to get any information from the clinic regarding this advice. Written requests have not been responded to.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">According to LK the advice from the Clinic mirrored the legal advice she was getting at that time. According to her, that advice subsequently changed when LK expressed concern to her previous solicitors about giving her former husband&#8217;s name to the hospital where X was due to be born. She states the legal advice changed to that she should inform the surrogate mother that DM was the genetic father. She did this when Mrs J was 7 months pregnant.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs J informed the parental order reporter, Ms Baker, she was very upset and shocked to learn of this from LK; initially she did not want to have any contact with LK other than via her husband, Mr J. After further consideration she became concerned about the lack of a surrogacy agreement that named DM. She insisted there was a fresh surrogacy agreement, which the parties then entered into in September. The care and delivery plan at the hospital was then updated.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Following X&#8217;s birth she has been in the care of LK and DM albeit, for reasons which I shall explain below, they have had to maintain separate homes due to their responsibilities to their older children, from their previous relationships.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has had the benefit of two detailed and perceptive reports from the parental order reporter, Sylvia Baker. She was instrumental in arranging and facilitating a recent meeting between the parties; in the end LK and Mr J attended. It was a fruitful meeting where both parties were able to address the issues they wanted to discuss and agreed to keep in touch. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It was of great concern to this court, as it was to the parental order reporter, that a situation had arisen whereby Mrs J had embryos transferred to her that were different than what she understood to be the position under the agreement she had signed with LK and her former husband. It was of even more concern that this was done, according to LK, on the advice of the doctor at the Clinic and her previous solicitor. The court has not been able to investigate this matter as the Clinic has not responded to requests for information on this issue. </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that the respondents consent to the making of a parental order has limited the need for the court to consider this issue in any more detail. The position may have been very different if that was not the case.</p>

	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have no doubt prior to the embryo transfer Mr and Mrs J should have been informed of the change in genetic material and, if required, a new agreement should have been entered into. This failure to disclose obviously caused Mr and Mrs J enormous distress, to learn during the pregnancy the position was not as they understood it to be. At their recent meeting Mr J made it clear that as far as they were concerned X was not their child, she had always been LK and DM&#8217;s child and that he and his wife wanted a parental order to be made.</p>

X is also an important person to wider families as well. LK and DM are the only carers that X has known and she looks to them for all her needs to be addressed and met.  In my view, X&#8217;s needs are addressed to a high standard, by both LK and DM, who clearly only want the very best for their daughter.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">A parental order was specifically devised for surrogacy arrangements. It is a transformative order with the effect that the child is treated as though born to the applicants. This order clearly meets the lifelong welfare needs of X and is the order the court made.</p>
