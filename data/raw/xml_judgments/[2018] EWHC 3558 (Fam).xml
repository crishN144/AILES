	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0in">The husband and wife met in 2001 and married in 2006. They were married for 5 years and had three children, aged between 4 and 9. Following the separation, the husband remained in the matrimonial home in France and the wife rented a property nearby while the children divided their time between both parents. The family's wealth was derived from the husband's lucrative business activities after the parties met which continued throughout the marriage. One of the main issues left for determination in the long-running financial remedy proceedings related to a trust, NHT, settled by the husband in 2002 in the British Virgin Islands. The husband and children were discretionary beneficiaries under the trust. NHT owned a number of corporate entities which held assets including properties and a vintage or collectable car collection. When the family moved to France, the husband and children were excluded as beneficiaries under the trust for tax purposes for a fixed but revocable period but he continued to have the use of a CHF25m drawing facility secured by trust assets. The husband now claimed that he had in the course of these proceedings been permanently and irrevocably excluded as a potential beneficiary of the trust to protect trust assets and that his financial resources had been wiped out by the trust pursuing a claim for $7.06m against assets held in the husband's name. The wife submitted that NHT or its component companies were susceptible as antenuptial settlements to variation pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/42/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 42(1)</ref>(c) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. The wife sought a lump sum of &#163;27m on the basis that the matrimonial acquest was at least &#163;54m. The husband submitted that he was only able to make nominal maintenance payments and nothing by way of a capital award. The parties had spent approximately &#163;2m on legal costs so far in this jurisdiction alone. </p>

It could further be described as fraud, a deliberate design to deceive, inflicted on the wife and on the court, and found by the court so to be. Careful scrutiny of the totality of the evidence led to a conclusion that the wife's suspicions and her case against the husband and the trust were made out.

I take his earning capacity at that figure as its minimum.

The agreement provides that there would be no order for costs and that no existing orders for costs would be enforced. Importantly, the agreement provides that it is in full and final settlement of any claims the wife may have against SCT-UK, CFL or CTSAT, in this jurisdiction or anywhere else in the world and further that she is making no other claims over any assets/entities legally or beneficially owned (directly or indirectly) by CTSAT; that she will make no such claims of whatever nature against such assets in the future; and that neither she, nor the husband, has any beneficial interest in any assets legally owned (directly or indirectly) by CTSAT.   </p>

The husband in his oral evidence explained that he was the &#8220;rainmaker&#8221; for this greatly successful financial speculation and that he would negotiate the borrowing of vast sums, billions of dollars, which would be traded for a short time making a modest (relative to the principal) profit, and then returned to the lender. The husband says that since the global financial crisis of 2008 this kind of trading has basically become impossible, and that as a result his skill set has become obsolete. It is true that collateralised debt obligations, syndicated loans, and mortgage-backed securities are all examples of structured finance and that these products were the prime cause of the global financial crisis of 2008. </p>

Very large fees were paid to JAS by CTSAT; indeed, it had no other source of income. It was essentially a service company for the receipt of fee income paid to the husband as remuneration for his role as financial and investment adviser to the project. In 2005 fees of &#163;533,000 were paid; in 2006, &#163;636,000; in 2007, &#163;600,000; and in 2008, the year of the financial crisis, &#163;80,000. </p>

The husband explained that the latter of these was referable to the extensive work that needed to be done to secure the &#163;20 million settlement from G Bank. That may account for the abnormal excess, but it does not explain the 2009 fee, nor the fees that were paid in 2011 of &#163;900,000 and in 2012 (the year of the breakdown of the marriage) of &#163;950,000. The husband was not able to give me any kind of coherent explanation for what financial advice or services these fees in 2011 and 2012 were paid. Moreover, it is clear from the BDO report of 13 June 2014, that none of these fees made their way to the husband. Rather, the profit element of these fees was virtually entirely paid to his partner Rumit Shah. In 2010 Mr Shah was paid &#163;850,000 out of the fee of &#163;1.53m. The husband was paid nothing.

As I recall, only 1 of the 16 possible stereoisomers is psychoactive. The cocaine plant naturally produces only this stereoisomer but in the lab this is quite difficult. This is why cocaine is extracted from the plant for commercial use rather than synthesised as methamphetamine is. (Walter White&#8217;s particular expertise in Breaking Bad was controlling which enantiomer he produced but he only had to worry about 2 possibilities and both left and right-handed meth are psychoactive &#8211; dextromethamphetamine being the stronger drug.)&#8221; </p>

I therefore order that with effect from 1 March 2019 the husband shall pay to the wife periodical payments of &#163;5,333 monthly in advance during joint lives or until the wife&#8217;s remarriage or further order. The existing maintenance pending suit order will continue until that date and all arrears under it must immediately be discharged. The figure of &#163;5,333 will be adjusted on each successive 1 March by reference to the most recently ascertainable annual movement in the CPI.  </p>

Although he has been reticent in the extreme in divulging what considerations prevent him from commencing employment while residing primarily in France, I conclude that they are fiscal. Paying some tax and having an income would appear to most people to be preferable to having no income upon which to pay tax. </p>

In this case, however, such an application should leave it open for the tribunal hearing it to make whatever lump sum award it might appear appropriate to impose in exchange for a clean break, without limiting the exercise by reference to the periodical payments order which might be in force, either then or after appropriate variation. In short, in the particular circumstances of this case the quantum of a lump sum should upon any 31(7A) application be at large. </p>

Appellants must, however be aware that there is no obligation on a Judge to give a particular response to every submission made (judgments in this country are quite long enough already) and that, unless it becomes apparent in the course of the appeal that a serious injustice has been done, appeals on the ground of inadequacy of reasons in complex factual disputes are likely to fail.&#8217;&#8221; </p>

I have received a swathe of purported corrections from the husband which were a poorly disguised attempt to cause me to revise my core findings of fact. These were accompanied by a lengthy request, which I take to be made pursuant to FPR PD30A para 4.6, for me to consider whether my judgment contains material omissions by virtue of inadequate reasons. I have considered those representations and reject them. I am satisfied that I have made the essential findings needed to dispose justly of the wife&#8217;s claim (see para 54 above) and that no correction or amplification of the judgment is needed. </p>
