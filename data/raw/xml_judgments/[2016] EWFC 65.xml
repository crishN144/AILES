Although he is hard of hearing, he seemed in remarkably good health for someone of his age.  He gave a spirited display and, although I will make my findings of fact in due course, he certainly gave the clear impression that he remained the patriarch of the family, with his fingers well and truly on the financial pulse.   </p>

Without the surrounding land, the value of the home itself would fall to &#163;1.4 million given the disadvantage of not being able to engage in equestrian activities.  The value falls to &#163;1.25 million if the Show Home is also excluded.  The market value of the two adjacent plots is &#163;50,000 each.

He appears to have had a difficult progression from adolescence to adulthood.  I heard a number of allegations during the case that did not go to his credit but I have not heard from him and therefore intend to be careful as to my findings.  He has, though, not been successful in business to date.  Most recently, he has been financed to a very significant extent in relation to a property development business.  I will return to this in due course.  I am told that he recently returned to live in the Show Home after a tenancy at a hotel in Cardiff came to an end.  It had been paid for by the Husband&#8217;s Father to the tune of around &#163;1,800 per month.  </p>

Thereafter, however, he decided to stay abroad to make his fortune.  It is clear that the crippling taxation regime in Country E played a large part in the decision.  Indeed, I was told that his older brother, QF had moved separately to Switzerland.  The Husband came to Wales.  Whilst I am satisfied it was his decision, it is clear that his Father was heavily involved in the matter.  </p>

It is clear that the availability of substantial grants in Wales to those wishing to set up manufacturing businesses formed an important part in the thinking of commencing Y Plc here.  Machinery was shipped from Country E and an off-the-shelf company, G Ltd was purchased in 1978 by X AG.</p>

X AG held the other 4,999 shares.  He was then employed as Managing Director.   There has been much debate as to whether the Husband or his Father was the &#8220;founder&#8221; of H Ltd.  It is certainly true that the UK publicity for the business has repeatedly referred to the Husband as the founder.  </p>

I was told that CD and AB requested that this be corrected.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003, the Husband&#8217;s Father sent a letter of wishes in relation to the X Foundation.  In essence, this letter was converted into the by-laws of the Foundation which are dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2003.  The primary beneficiaries were stated to be the Husband and the children of the family.  The Wife was not a beneficiary.  The secondary beneficiaries were QF and his children.  Up to 90% of the Foundation&#8217;s funds were to be used to support the progress and development of F Family Companies.  10% was to be available for investment in private residential properties, boats etc and in other types of private facilities customarily used and enjoyed by the members of the F Family (by-law 1).  The assets must, however, be wholly owned by the Foundation and, if sold, all the income of the sale must go back into the Foundation.  By-law 2 provides that 80% of the income was to be retained by the Foundation.  There was a discretion to benefit the primary beneficiaries with up to 20% of the income by loan or outright appointment to assist them in the purchase in the name of the Foundation of residential property for their occupation or in the purchase of other private items which may assist them in maintaining their established standard of living.  The Husband was able to receive &#163;25,000 pa and &#163;50,000 pa whilst he remained working full-time for Y Plc.  The children were able to be supported up to &#163;50,000 pa from the age of 30.  Prior to that, there was to be a maintenance fund for their exclusive benefit but there could be no capital distribution prior to the age of 30. </p>

Thereafter, between &#163;300,000 and &#163;350,000 of the sale proceeds was used to renovate the Country E flat.

I declined to rule on that at the time, saying I would return to it later once research had been carried out on the law.  In fact, I was never asked to return to the issue.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In May 2005, the Husband transferred 900,790 shares in Y Plc to a trust for the children of the family.  This left him with only 448 shares in his sole name.  At the time, Y Plc was making good profits and paying significant dividends.  For a couple of years, the dividends were used to pay U&#8217;s school fees as a boarder, although the Husband was taxed on the income as he was the settlor of the trust.  The Wife has been very exercised as to this transfer, believing it was done to defeat her claim for financial provision.  She has not, in fact, applied pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> to set aside the disposition and she clearly feels reluctant to do so, given that the children are the beneficiaries of the Trust.  The children have not therefore been joined as parties although I did read a statement from U that was produced by her grandfather&#8217;s legal team.  I will have to return to this issue in due course but a secondary argument advanced on behalf of the Wife is that the Husband would only transfer such a high proportion of his shares if he knew that the shares in X were his resource.  His response is that he did this solely for reasons of Inheritance Tax planning and that it was something that the Wife&#8217;s parents had done for her.  The CW Trust was subsequently &#8220;exported&#8221; to Liechtenstein in April 2008 and CD and AB became the new trustees, replacing the Husband.</p>

Notwithstanding this, the family had incurred a very significant unsecured overdraft with HSBC.  In early 2009, it was about &#163;450,000.  The Bank got nervous and required a charge against the matrimonial home.  It is clear that the Wife refused.  The Husband therefore made other arrangements.  In June 2009, X bought art in the matrimonial home for &#163;263,690 but the art remained in place.

Until the oral evidence, I had not appreciated that QF had been running K Ltd.  It appears that, initially, it was intended that the Husband would henceforth own the shares in K Ltd but in due course it was decided that the Husband and QF would have 50% each.  The mechanism for doing so was by incorporating on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2011 a company known as Z Holdings AG.  The loan can truly be said to be &#8220;soft&#8221; in that it is interest free and is not repayable until 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021 and then only if K Ltd is in a position to do so.

The Husband has had costs of &#163;671,114 of which he has paid &#163;566,253 by cashing in the remainder of his pension funds (which comes with a heavy tax burden) and taking a Novitas loan of (&#163;206,000).  I regularly warned both parties about the horrific costs of this case as contested application after contested application was heard by me and other judges over the past year.  </p>

He says that 50% of the boat was already owned by his Father.  It goes without saying that divesting oneself of assets, even relatively modest ones, in this way raises strong suspicions with your former spouse, particularly when the Husband&#8217;s Father later agreed that he should &#8220;waive&#8221; the money allegedly owed by the Husband to him in relation to the outgoings on the Country E flat.  It was said he did so as a result of the cost of the refurbishment of the property paid for by the Husband.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 12th October 2015, the Wife applied to prevent any dealings by the Husband with his pensions, referring to the sum of &#163;100,000 that had been cashed in around the time of the maintenance pending suit application.   On 24th November 2015, the Husband applied for me to vary the maintenance pending suit order I had made only six weeks earlier, arguing that his Father intended to stop paying his non-dom tax charge and would not pay the tax on any remittance of the &#163;75,000 to the UK to discharge my order. No reason was given for the Father&#8217;s alleged position.  There was a directions hearing before me on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2015 when I set the matter down for this hearing with a ten-day time estimate.  I heard the substantive cross-applications on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016.  By then, the Wife had found a large number of documents (the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Imerman</span> documents) in the matrimonial home over the Christmas period which she gave to her solicitors.  </p>

As this was a cheaper means of securing funding than taking pension (which immediately incurs a hefty tax liability), I granted an injunction to prevent him drawing down on his pensions until he had exhausted the litigation funding.  I dismissed the application to vary the maintenance pending suit order on the basis that there had been no change in circumstances and his Father had been paying his entire non-PAYE tax bill to date.

The Father also set up a business in Switzerland for QF to run.  The Father provided money to buy O Ltd of which the Husband and he held 25% each.  They also owned 50% each of J Ltd.  All three companies went into Y Plc in 1989 in preparation for flotation.  After flotation, X held 53% of the shares and the Husband and he would have 15.5% each in their names.

He wrote that the Husband has severe problems with dyslexia which continue to impact on his ability to read and understand letters and documents and communicate ideas.  He believes the Husband suffers from Aspergers Syndrome although he has not formally carried out an assessment.  The Husband finds it difficult to sustain eye contact, can misread social cues and can be very literal in his interpretation of communications.  Further distressing matters about the Husband&#8217;s past are included in the letter.  He is concerned that, if in oral evidence, he avoids eye contact, appears hesitant or confused or does not directly address the intended meaning of questions posed, it may not necessarily imply he is being evasive.  I make it clear that it is for me to assess the Husband&#8217;s evidence and I will do so.

Once I have done so, I must consider the sharing principle.  There are non-matrimonial assets in this case that have come to the parties by way of inheritance and/or lifetime provision from relatives.  In general, they would be excluded from the sharing principle.  Matrimonial assets, however, created during the marriage, would undoubtedly be subject to sharing.  Nevertheless, the authorities make it clear that I must also consider compensation and needs.  Nobody has suggested this is a case for compensation but, depending on my findings of fact as to the assets, it may very well be that it is a case where needs take centre stage.  If so, I can invade even non-matrimonial property to provide for those needs but I must consider the needs of both parties not just those of an applicant.</p>

First, I must decide whether or not any of them did deliberately tell lies.  If I find that they did, I have to ask myself why they lied.  The mere fact that a witness tells a lie is not in itself evidence that the person concerned has undisclosed assets or controls assets.  A witness may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones.  For example, they may be lies to bolster a true case; or to protect someone else; or to conceal some other disreputable conduct; or out of panic, distress or confusion.  It follows that, if I find that a witness has lied, I must assess whether or not there is an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; explanation for those lies.  However, if I am satisfied that there is no such explanation, I can take the lies into account in my assessment of the assets available and the relative strength of the respective cases.   </p>

She was asked about HSBC&#8217;s request to have a charge on the matrimonial home.  She denied that she knew anything about it until she got a letter from HSBC on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1989.  It was clear at the time that this could not be correct as the letter says that the Manager, Mike Kear was &#8220;extremely disappointed at AF&#8217;s refusal to sign the Legal Charge over the property&#8221; so she must have known about it before and refused.  Eventually, she was recalled and shown a letter to her dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2009 telling her that she needed to see a solicitor before signing the charge.  I accept entirely that she did not want her property charged.  Indeed, as things have turned out, it was very sensible of her not to agree to it being charged but I cannot accept she was kept in the dark.  It follows that I also accept that she did not offer any of her inheritance as a means of discharging the overdraft.     On the balance of probabilities, I find the Husband did not know exactly how much she had.  </p>

I find that she must have known that the parties only owned the main house under title WA****** whilst the rest of the land, as well as the land at P Farm, was owned by X.   After all, she told me that X had not been properly maintaining its land such that it was unsafe for her horses. Equally, she said she always believed the Country E flat was owned equally by the parties but it was noticeable that she did not include it in either of her Forms E as an asset of hers.  Having said all that, I am not entirely sure where this takes me in relation to the main evidence in the case.  At the end of the day, it is not my findings as to the Wife&#8217;s evidence that is important.  It is the evidence of the Husband and his Father that really matters.</p>

He even instructed his leading counsel to complain that I had been wrong to say that he must tell me what they were at an earlier stage of the proceedings.  I reject entirely his case that he did not know that he was a beneficiary, albeit a secondary beneficiary, of the Z Foundation.  He knew very well the arrangements.  I am equally clear that he has attempted to mislead me as to the relationship between him, his Father and X.  I reject the suggestion that CD and AB take the decisions as to what X will invest in.  They are professional trustees who know little of the business world occupied by the Husband and his Father or the merits of acquiring land in Wales.   That is not to say that X is a sham.  It is not.  CD and AB operate in accordance with the by-laws but, if they are asked to buy some land around the matrimonial home or some timeshares in the Bahamas, they do so without question, provided it comes within the by-laws.    </p>

That was nonsense as the Father confirmed.  It was equally nonsense to suggest that he required the permission of the trustees before he used it.  I accept that his first manuscript Form E was woeful but I do not consider that helps me as to his veracity thereafter.  He was, after all, acting in person and his dyslexia cannot have made it easy for him to complete the document.  Nevertheless, his second Form E claimed that he owed (&#163;322,161) to his Father for the bills on the Country E flat, whilst totally ignoring the money invested in the refurbishment of that property.  I find he knew he would never have to repay that money.  It also includes as his personal debt the loan secured on the Country E flat.  His Father confirmed in his evidence that this was a loan that he had made to his grandchildren after carefully considering the position.  The Form E also included the loan to his Father in relation to K Ltd.  Whilst I accept the loan agreement was disclosed, the net effect of all of this in the Form E is to show every liability as a hard debt at the same time as distancing himself as far as possible away from X.  This led to the Form E showing a total value of his assets as being negative (&#163;3,197,449).  </p>

Indeed, I have referred already to a number of occasions when his frank answers contradicted the position of his son.  Having said that, he did not tell me the true position as to Z Foundation until very late in the day.  Moreover, there were aspects of his evidence that I cannot accept.  He too peddled the myth that he was the founder of Y Plc.  He denied the company had been built up by the Husband when it clearly was.  He said he did not know what the assets of X were when I am clear that his finger is still very much on the pulse.  He did say that he had an idea that there was some money there but his grasp of financial matters remains amazing for someone of his age.  He knew that over &#163;12 million had been paid in dividends from Y Plc into X.  I find he knows exactly what is there.  Indeed, at one point he referred in passing to some assets in China that had not done well.  If X has invested in China, it is clear to me that it is not because AB thought it was a good idea.  Indeed, I cannot see that the Husband would have done so either.  I find that it would have been at the suggestion of the Father.  Finally, he denied that X was for the Husband and Z Foundation for QF.  I have already found that X is a genuine foundation and not a sham but within the context of a Stiftung and the by-laws of that foundation, it is clear that X is for the Husband and his children in so far as it is for anyone.  It is certainly not for the Husband&#8217;s Father.  He settled the shares into the Foundation and approved by-laws that do not provide him with any benefit whatsoever.  He does, however, still clearly have influence, as one would expect from the Settlor of such an entity.</p>

He told me that he would definitely not be prepared to change the by-laws to pay millions to the Husband.  I will make my findings as to this in due course but I am satisfied that this structure has been set up for many years.  Whilst I cannot say exactly what will happen after his death, I cannot find that he would permit the Husband to withdraw all the assets of X, even if the shares in Y Plc were all sold, for example if there was a takeover.  He would certainly not do so to enable his son to pay off an ex-wife.  After all, avoiding such liabilities was an important reason for setting this structure up in the first place.    </p>

I recognise that the flat was bought for the parties rather than for the Husband&#8217;s Father and/or Mother.  I am sure the Wife and the Husband thought of it as theirs.  For this reason, the proceeds of sale of MH1 were used on its refurbishment.  As a matter of Country E law, however, it remained owned as to 90% by the Husband&#8217;s Father.  This is not unfair to the Wife for three reasons.  First, the Husband&#8217;s Father provided the purchase price.  Second, the 90% to 10% arrangement is exactly the same as the way in which U&#8217;s flat was purchased.  It would be illogical to treat the two assets differently.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is extremely difficult for a court to grapple with complicated family financial arrangements involving different generations of a particular family who are helping each other.  I have to consider three particular matters.  First, there is the loan secured on the Country E apartment that was used in part to fund U and T.  It is, however, equally clear that it was also used in part for an investment with a Mr B which has not been investigated fully.  The loan is shown as being (&#163;792,350) and the Husband&#8217;s schedule attributes it entirely as his debt.  In one sense, this seems unfair given that his Father told me that he had decided to help his grandchildren.  I accept that, at one point, he said that the Husband took out a loan, but he later told me that the money came from him from the apartment in Country E.   Whilst I consider it is unrealistic to think that the Husband will ever have to repay this money to his Father, I cannot ignore the loan whilst including the loan due to the Husband by M2 Ltd of &#163;533,000 and his 90% share in the value of U&#8217;s property.  The latter is put in the schedule at &#163;291,000 net but I think it should be &#163;261,900 to account for U&#8217;s 10% share.  The two assets and the liability therefore almost exactly cancel each other out.</p>

Whilst I cannot see that the Husband is ever likely to have to repay his Father, it is equally unlikely that he will ever be paid the equity in U&#8217;s flat.  It is possible that he may get some benefit from the M2 Ltd loan but, on balance, I take the view that these are all family arrangements that will, in due course, sort themselves out.  It follows that the Husband has a 10% share in the Country E flat worth &#163;128,097.  The loan on the Country E flat and the children&#8217;s assets effectively cancel each other out.  The equity in the Summer House is &#163;255,742.  The boat house on the Husband&#8217;s Father&#8217;s land is worth &#163;40,000.  </p>

It is on the market for sale at &#163;279,000 whereas the Single Joint Expert valued it at &#163;180,000.  I have no evidence as to whether or not the marketing figure is unrealistic.  I do not know what interest there has been in the property.  It would, however, be odd if the court was to accept a valuation of &#163;180,000 when the property is on the market for &#163;100,000 more than that figure.  In the same way, there is a dispute as to the 47.6 acres of agricultural land which may or may not be subject to a tenancy in favour of the Wife&#8217;s brother.  I am no expert as to agricultural tenancies but I suspect that an oral tenancy may well be sufficient, particularly if it is supported by use over a long period of time.  In one sense, I have the same difficulty here as with the family arrangements surrounding the children&#8217;s loans.  The land is not owned jointly so the brother has no incentive to cooperate.  Doing the best I can, I will take &#163;250,000 as the value of the property but &#163;200,000 as the value of the land subject to the tenancy.  This gives net figures to the Wife of &#163;102,358 for the property and &#163;156,000 for the land.  I remind myself that these are non-matrimonial assets but I will undoubtedly need to consider them in the context of need.</p>

The Husband was wrong to pay the proceeds of sale of the RIB boat to his Father when he had not previously been paying the outgoings on the Country E flat.  I am prepared to accept that half of it was owned by his Father but I reattribute &#163;18,209 to the Husband on the basis that the Father accepted that the liability for the outgoings on the Country E flat should be written off entirely.  The Husband says he has sold his Ferrari to pay his costs and there is no evidence to contradict this.  I have heard no evidence about Ebel watches, Mercedes cars, number plates or Nimbus boats, although the Husband says his Father owns the latter and that LM owns a sailing boat.  On the Wife&#8217;s side, there is reference to a Volvo and some jewellery.  I propose to ignore all these items on both sides.</p>

It is said that there is a joint debt of (&#163;69,462) in relation to litigation relating to the shop case.  I have heard very little about this.

The Wife says I should take the value of the Husband&#8217;s share at &#163;647,634 whereas the Husband says it should be &#163;201,782.  There appear to be two issues.  The first is whether or not there should be a 50% discount for a minority holding.  The second is whether there should be a 40% discount for tax.  I accept that this is not a liquid asset and any valuation is somewhat arbitrary.  Nevertheless, this is a family company that should be treated as a quasi-partnership.  It is therefore unrealistic to deduct anything for a minority holding.  On the other hand, the tax must be deducted. The value should therefore be taken at &#163;388,588.</p>

The SJE valued it at &#163;800,000, which would give the Husband&#8217;s shares a value of &#163;400,000 (&#163;320,000 after tax).  I certainly intend to ignore the very large loan to the Father, which is currently (&#163;4,765,404), as being entirely theoretical.  It will only be paid if the company can afford it.  It does therefore cast doubt on whether I should include any value but I have decided to do so, whilst accepting that it is very illiquid.  This exercise does, however, show how difficult the exercise of computing the assets in this particular case has been.

It is, of course, possible that she did not know the source of the assets in the Trust but there is no evidence that the Husband did this to defeat her claim.  To make such a finding, I would have to rely on the consultation with Mr Mostyn QC and that is an inference that is not permissible.  I do, however, consider that the transfer is very important.  I will return to this when I consider the question of my approach to the Trust but the Wife has satisfied me that this transfer would only have taken place if the Husband was confident he could rely on the X Trust and the very significant block of shares in Y Plc that it contained.   </p>

It goes without saying that this figure dwarfs all the other assets in terms of value that I have considered so far in this judgment.  There was some debate about the shares transferred relatively recently from X to the Z Foundation for QF and his family.  I have been unable to say why that happened but I do not consider it significant, given that shares worth over &#163;50 million remain.  It may be that the Husband&#8217;s Father thought that the Husband&#8217;s trust held too high a percentage as against QF&#8217;s trust.

The Wife&#8217;s team say that dividends from Y Plc in excess of &#163;14 million have been paid to X.  The Husband&#8217;s team believes it was around &#163;12 million.  Either way, these are substantial sums.  The Husband now says that he believes X has a portfolio of between &#163;7 and &#163;8 million, although this information is around four years old.  It is a great shame that AB refused to cooperate. It makes it very difficult for a judge.  I cannot, of course, double count the dividends and the investment portfolio as Mr Warshaw originally suggested as the portfolio can only realistically have come from the dividends.  I would, however, be entitled to draw an adverse inference by the failure to give me chapter and verse given that the Settlor and the Primary Beneficiary (ignoring the children) are both parties to this case.  I cannot, however, ignore two aspects.  First, over &#163;2 million has been spent on the items set out above.  Second, there has been a very bad recession within the last ten years.  The Husband&#8217;s Father suggested that part of the fund was invested in China and that the investment had not done well.  This is possible although I find without hesitation that the Husband and his Father could have provided me with chapter and verse had they wished to do so.  It is nonsense to suggest that AB will not tell them. If that was genuinely the case, nobody would ever be so foolish as to place their assets in a Liechtenstein Stiftung.  Having said that, I am going to be generous to them and take the figure at &#163;7.5 million if only because I do not believe it matters very much in the context of what I have to decide.</p>

I have, however, already made it clear that I accept that X is not a sham.  I have decided that I should proceed in accordance with the by-laws but X is clearly a resource available to the Husband which is not available to the Wife.  The by-laws are clear and provide him with substantial benefit.  The Husband cannot simply pretend that X does not exist or that the by-laws may not be followed.  This is reinforced when this finding is put alongside my finding that the Husband has, in effect, created the value in X as founder and driving force behind Y Plc, even if his Father provided the seed-corn to enable him to do so.</p>

This was clearly permissible in accordance with either by-law 1 or by-law 2.  I am quite satisfied that these assets were provided for the enjoyment and use of the parties and their children.  I simply could not understand why it was even suggested that the Husband would have to ask his Father before he used the timeshares.  There is absolutely nothing in the by-laws about doing so.  The Husband&#8217;s Father is not a beneficiary under the by-laws.  The timeshares were bought because the Husband requested it.  He did not have to ask anybody first.  Whilst the Trustees had to agree, the by-laws made it clear that this was a legitimate request and, unsurprisingly, they agreed without demure.  The same applies in relation to all these assets.  The only people who really benefited from the artwork were those living in the matrimonial home, namely the Husband, the Wife and the children.  </p>

The by-laws were applied but the money was provided to buy the artwork.  This is important for two reasons.  First, it makes it clear that, if I was to order a lump sum of &#163;18 million to the Wife, X would not come to the rescue.   Second, however, it is equally clear that the Husband will, in the future, be able to rely on X to provide assets to him to fund his lifestyle.  I am quite clear that this includes the provision of accommodation.  It is right that the matrimonial home was not owned by the Trust.  This was probably to take advantage of Principle Private Residence relief and, possibly, to avoid tax difficulties but the Trust could have done so to the tune of 10% of the value of the Trust.  At present that would be &#163;6.1 million.  </p>

This is not fanciful.  It is what the by-laws, on which he relies, say.  Indeed, following the sale of the matrimonial home, assets to the tune of &#163;583,000 will immediately become available, even if the artwork and the timeshares are ignored.  The value of the artwork bought in Country E shows itself how significant the benefit is to him.  In one sense, this all makes the provision of a schedule of assets somewhat otiose as it is never going to exceed the figure of up to &#163;6.1 million that is available in X.  I find that X is in a position to fund a suitable home in Wales for the Husband and that, in accordance with the by-laws, it will do so.</p>

These were undoubtedly arrangements that made continuing provision for the parties to the marriage in their capacity as such.  The timeshares were for them.  The artwork was in their matrimonial home.  The land was part of the matrimonial home.  It increased the amenity value of the property and allowed the Wife to engage in her equestrian activities.  This does not, however, take me far because I do take the view that the parties were given no more than a licence to occupy, determinable on reasonable notice.  The assets were made &#8220;available&#8221;.  They were to be wholly owned by the Foundation and, if sold, the proceeds were to go back to the Foundation.  I have therefore formed the clear view that I could not give the Wife a lifetime interest in the land even if I wished to do so.</p>

It forms Annex A attached to this judgment.  It shows assets in the name of the Husband of &#163;1,481,741 and assets of &#163;1,290,065 in the name of the Wife, making a total of &#163;2,771,806.  The elephant in the room, however, is that it shows nothing for X.  I have found that up to &#163;6,131,670 can be made available to the Husband.  I accept that it is not the same as liquid capital as it can only ever be held by X.  I further accept that it might be said that some of this money should be for the children, although the Husband and his Father have been clear that provision for the children would not be made through X.  I reject the suggestion that this would be as a result of the views of AB.  It would have been the decision of the Husband and his Father.  I further accept that there may be tax difficulties for the Husband in acquiring a property through X but that is just a problem that will have to be met.  If a family arranges its affairs in the expectation of avoiding large amounts of tax, the same family cannot complain if part of those resources then have to be used to fund tax that the structure has created.  </p>

I cannot simply add the &#163;6.1 million onto the schedule and divide by two.  But, I must take regard of the fact that &#163;2.3 million has already been made available to the Husband.  Moreover, I am simply not prepared to find that there is no further liquidity in a situation where the books of X have simply not been opened for me to see.  In any event, a modest number of shares in Y Plc could be sold.  The Husband can hardly say that this would be deleterious to the company when he has sold so many in the past.  </p>

Fine distinctions between matrimonial and non-matrimonial assets become irrelevant.  I am entirely clear that the matrimonial home will have to be sold.  I cannot transfer the land surrounding it to the Wife.  The Novitas loan must be dealt with.  Indeed, the property is well in excess of the Wife&#8217;s needs.

I calculate that this will give her around &#163;1,046,500.  It will be up to her if she invests this in one property in Wales or in a smaller property here (such as the properties suggested by the Husband at around &#163;700,000) and a holiday home overseas.  She will then have her remaining inherited resources available to supplement her position.  She must be indemnified against the costs debt but will have to pay her share of the joint overdraft and electricity bill.  The jointly owned chattels will be transferred to the Wife.  After all, the Husband will have the use of those owned by X.   </p>
