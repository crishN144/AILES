The application is made in the context of some of the least attractive and commercially suicidal litigation that I have seen for a long while. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I ask myself the questions raised by Ryder LJ, quoted above, before coming to what is the nub of this appeal.  Is the husband, the father, in contempt?  Well, that is admitted, as it has to be.  He is a rich man.  He has chosen not to pay the maintenance that was due on 1 June or 1 July.  There is another payment that was due today, which it is assumed has also not been paid.  He can pay easily.  The sum due under the order is currently &#163;5,546 per month as a result of index linking, and he is either two or three months now in arrears. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Two, is it an impediment to justice?  In my judgment it is an impediment to justice if a father simply chooses to pay nothing whatsoever towards the support of his children, particularly when the payment is the subject of a consent order.  This is all the more so when at the same time, he comes to court to say that he should not pay anything towards the cost of the failed litigation which he supported in relation to the very same child, or children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Three, is there an effective alternative means to enforcement?  The answer is plainly not.  He says as much in the passages which I have read.  The fact that the wife has taken out proceedings for enforcement which so far have simply lead to an order that he file a statement of means and appear at court, seems to me fairly unlikely to produce anything at all, if, as the husband says, he has nothing whatsoever in this jurisdiction apart from the home in which the children live and when he lives in the UAE.   That property, pursuant to the consent order which the parties entered into, goes to the children when they reach the age of majority.  So, all the wife can seek to do is to deprive the children of their asset in order to meet the husband&#8217;s default.  That does not seem to me to be an effective means of enforcement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The most substantial point that the husband raises is that these proceedings are not the same.  The Hadkinson order is sought in Family Law Act proceedings and the maintenance order was made in Financial Remedy proceedings.  Related they may be, but not the same, And, says, Miss Bangay QC, the Family Law Act proceedings were a case of daughter against stepfather;  The proceedings which the mother is seeking to stop are those which arise out of an order made against the father in favour of the new husband. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Well, that is all right as far as it goes, but it does not go very far, in my view, when it is quite clear in the father&#8217;s mind that these two sets of proceedings are intrinsically linked, and it is directly as a result of the outcome in one hearing that he has chosen not to pay the money that is due pursuant to an order in other proceedings.  In his mind there is a very clear link between the two sets of proceedings. </p>

But it seems to me that this is a remedy which is not so closely confined that it cannot be extended to this situation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Miss Bangay says to me that this is a very draconian remedy.  In one way it is, in the sense that the father will not be allowed to prosecute his appeal if he does not pay the existing arrears.  But in another way it is not.  It is a very small sum of money to him, but it is a sum of money which he has been ordered to pay, and which he agreed to pay to his children. </p>

I am not persuaded that the breach can be clearly shown to be anything beyond the failure to pay the child maintenance that is due under the order.  There are arguments about other sums of money which it is said are owing but it seems to me proper that the appeal process should be allowed to take its course without the father&#8217;s ability to conduct it being hampered by disputes about money matters in respect of which he may have a valid defence.  But he has no defence whatsoever to the payment of maintenance. </p>
