Until January 2012 he lived with his parents, RM and SH, who I shall call the mother and the father.  At that point he was placed in foster care, where he remains.  The issue between the parties is whether he should now return to the care of his mother or whether he should be placed in the family of his maternal great uncle, who live in Belgium.  The mother and the father, who have now separated, argue for the former outcome, the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian for the latter.  It is agreed that a care order should be made, final or interim, whatever the outcome.</span></p>

His death was the result of injuries suffered at home on 5 January 2012 of which he died the following day.  Both parents were arrested, and in July 2012 the father was charged with murder and the mother with allowing the death of a child.  They were remanded in custody, where the mother remained for two days and the father for eight months.  In October 2012, the charge against the mother was dropped and in January 2013 the father pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  In March, he received a suspended sentence from the Honorary Recorder of Manchester, leading to his immediate release from custody.  The father accepts that he has no further role to play in the day to day care of MI but it is agreed that limited monthly supervised contact should now be attempted.  The mother, who is in the process of divorcing the father, has been having supervised contact three times a week.</span></p>

There are written assessments from the social worker, from a children and families worker and from the Guardian, as well as opinions on Belgian law and immigration law.  The issues have been argued concisely and skilfully. </span></p>

In the first place, there has been significant delay as a result of the criminal investigations and a firm decision about MI&#8217;s future is now overdue.   Secondly, the case has evolved considerably throughout its course.  It began with both parents under suspicion of causing Baby I&#8217;s death, and thereafter the mother faced criminal charges until October 2012, while the criminal case against the father did not conclude until six weeks before this hearing began.  Even after that, there was a significant addition to the evidence at the very last moment, in the form of advice about the mother&#8217;s immigration position if the local authority&#8217;s plan to place MI in Belgium is carried out.  The third point is that there is now hardly any dispute between the parties about the facts that must be taken into consideration in reaching a decision: as a result the background history that follows is closely based upon the account given by Mr Rowley QC in opening.  Where the parties disagree is about the consequences of those facts for the assessment of MI&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

By then, the parents were, with apparent justification, unhappy at the way they were being treated by the paternal grandfather.  In October 2009, on the mother&#8217;s initiative, they went to a police station for help and left Yorkshire, moving to the Manchester area to stay with the mother&#8217;s uncle K and his wife P (who is also the father&#8217;s half-sister) before moving to their own small property in March 2011.  That property remains the mother&#8217;s home.  By then, MI was 2&#189; and the mother was pregnant again.  She attended her scheduled antenatal appointments.</span></p>

When he was two years old the parents expressed concern about his squint.  Delay in communication skills was noted and speech therapy was provided.  Anaemia, vitamin D deficiency and dental decay were issues identified as requiring follow-up.  Despite advice about diet, only limited improvement was made; a referral to a food health group was not pursued by the parents and MI was therefore discharged by a dietician.  The parents were encouraged to take him to a dentist but did not do so. </span></p>

The mother was receiving no help from the father, who is fond of MI but has no real parenting ability.   She informed a nurse that she and the father had separated but were living together in the same house.  There were arguments, usually when the mother reproached the father for going out and not helping her.  There was some violence on the father&#8217;s part, the worst incident being an occasion when he threw a stool at the mother and MI, which would have hit them had she not moved.  After the start of these proceedings the mother at first told the social worker that her relationship with the father did not feature violence but at a later stage she said that she had been assaulted twice by him.</span></p>

The mother said that she left the child with the father while she took MI to the toilet. When she returned she noticed that the baby &#8216;wasn&#8217;t right&#8217;.

After the father&#8217;s remand in custody, this was extended until August to assess the mother as a sole parent.  Despite good participation, shortcomings of the parents as a couple were identified in relation to them not acting on advice on the basic care of MI, babying him, letting him lead play rather than guiding him, giving in to his tantrums, and showing disharmony in their parenting styles.  Similar observations were made of the mother on her own.   Ms Thornley concluded that concern remained as to the couple&#8217;s ability to parent safely and consistently and that failure to respond to advice and guidance indicated a poor prognosis for the future.</span></p>

The assessors concluded that it was difficult to be confident about the mother&#8217;s ability to meet MI&#8217;s needs in the future.

A variety of concerns are set out.  The mother is said not to have fully acknowledged the deficits in her care when MI was at home.  She has failed to demonstrate, over the lengthy assessment period, that she can effect the necessary changes in order to fully meet his needs.  These deficits cover response to MI&#8217;s needs; a tendency to treat him as a younger child; unrealistic expectations; management of his behaviour or mood; issues over routines; and diet.  She has made some improvements during contact sessions since the initial parenting assessment but there is insufficient evidence that she can achieve consistency without prompting.  MI will require a very good level of care to ensure that he can achieve a maximum level of independence when he grows up and would be likely to suffer developmentally, physically, socially and emotionally if those needs were not met. Sadly, the mother has not demonstrated sufficient change to ensure that such harm is likely to be avoided for MI were he to return to her care.</span></p>

She told the contact supervisor that she had been &#8216;experimenting&#8217; with her sister-in-law.

The local authority had initially declined to assess them on the basis that it could not be in MI&#8217;s best interests to move there, but it then relented in the face of the Guardian&#8217;s advice.  The eventual assessment of that family is positive, reporting that the couple have a secure base and home life and are committed to caring for MI.  Panel approval has not yet been obtained as further information has been requested, such as a visit to the family&#8217;s new home. </span></p>

There would be monitoring of the placement in Belgium by social workers by regular visits by UK and Belgian social workers at least every three months.  In the care plan, the local authority contemplated contact around twice a week between mother and child (supervised by the Belgian family) should she move to Belgium. </span></p>

However, she was worried that once MI and the mother were alone, her tendency to give in to him would re-emerge.  Visits from a Family Support Worker could only help to a degree.

Although she had planned for the mother&#8217;s contact to continue, the fact that this would be uncertain or even unlikely did not change her plan: MI&#8217;s stability was more important than his relationship with his mother.  Indeed, Ms Handcock was of the view that if the Belgian option (which was not a certainty) did not for any reason work out, it would be better for MI to grow up in long term foster care in England than to have returned to his mother.  She accepted the irony of a situation where the father could have contact, while the mother, if returned to Pakistan, could not. </span></p>

As to MI, the parenting and social work assessments show that, despite over 14 months of professional guidance, she has effected insufficient change to overcome the previous deficits.

He says that a problem of one kind or another arose on 12 occasions (whether the mother allowing MI to lead the play, her giving in to him, her needed prompting, or issues over food or relatively minor safety issues).  He argues that these events are likely to be more frequent if the mother is tired and on her own with full time care.  Her support structure is embryonic.  The consequences for MI of failure are serious.  Though some aspects remain to be clarified, the plan to place in Belgium would best meet his needs.  The local authority would not support the mother being a part of that household, but it did contemplate her having regular contact prior to the receipt of Ms Finch&#8217;s report.</span></p>

She will accept any help and supervision that is proposed.  She points to the difficulties that she previously faced, her insight into what went wrong, and the progress that she has made in the course of a very difficult past year.  She notes that there were no proceedings or intervention at the time in the light of the matters which the local authority now relies upon, which relate not to neglect or deliberate harm but to weak parenting of a demanding child.  She relies on the strong relationship between MI and herself and on her cooperative relationship with social and medical services.  She points to the strenuous but sometimes inconsistent efforts she has made to improve her parenting.  The mother argues that her shortcomings have to be kept in proportion.  She refers to Ms Handcock&#8217;s evidence, in which she accepted several areas of improvement.  She points out that the Belgian plan has disadvantages and uncertainties as well as advantages.</span></p>

Nonetheless, having considered all the available evidence, I have narrowly concluded that there </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">is</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt"> a reasonable possibility that the mother will offer good enough care to MI now and throughout his childhood.  It will undoubtedly be a challenge and the possibility of failure is a real one, but I consider that she has demonstrated the capacity to address and overcome the remaining areas of weakness.  The local authority will, at its request, share parental responsibility under a care order and will be able to monitor and offers support as necessary.</span></p>

The commitment of the great uncle and his family to this child deserves high praise, but the possibility that MI will thereby lose his relationship with his mother is a real difficulty.  There must also be some uncertainty about the successful outcome of this placement, although this would not stand in its way if the mother had been found to be incapable of meeting MI&#8217;s needs herself.  Still, it would be asking a lot of this child to make so many adaptations, welcoming and supportive though the relations undoubtedly are.  I hope that once they have overcome their disappointment at the refusal of the local authority's plan, it will be possible for the mother to receive and to accept some support from them.</span></p>

I also consider that, while the precipitating events in this case were of the utmost gravity, the remaining concerns are not of a nature that would normally lead to the severance of the relationship between parent and child.  They are of a kind that could, and in my view should, continue to be worked on cooperatively in the interests of this family.</span></p>

The fact that my own assessment is at variance with hers is a reflection of the finely balanced nature of the decision.  I also commend the willingness of the local authority to cooperate with the making of an order that does not reflect its own preferred outcome. </span></p>

On that basis, I shall make a care order.  I direct that any future proceedings relating to the removal of MI from the mother's care be referred to me for directions in the first instance if I am available: I do this so that no unnecessary delay occurs in the making of alternative arrangements and so that the mother understands that she has only one further chance of providing MI with the care that she knows he needs.</span></p>
