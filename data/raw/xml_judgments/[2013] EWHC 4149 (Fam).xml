According to the mother for some years the marriage was happy, but from become 2008 it became unhappy with bouts of violence, aggression and abuse by the father towards her on an increasing basis.  Sometimes the children witnessed or overheard the events, and on some occasions the violence over spilled onto the children.  The father&#8217;s behaviour scared the mother, upset the children and she felt lonely and afraid too ashamed to tell anyone.  She says the violence escalated during 2012 and culminated with the father threatening to kill her, the children and himself if she tried to leave.  She says this threat was &#8220;the last straw&#8221;.  She was on her own in America without her family or other support.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard the mother&#8217;s uncle in evidence.  He elaborated on the short statement he had given to the Court.  As the elder brother, the mother&#8217;s own father had died some years  before, he had become &#8216;Head&#8217; of her family and as such within both families&#8217; culture and tradition it befell upon him to facilitate any discussions between the parents, act as mediator, and encourage them to reconcile if possible.  This was the role he assumed, and as such was able to speak directly with the father, and facilitate family meetings, which at times not only included the parents, the maternal grandmother and mother&#8217;s brother, but the paternal grandparents who had flown over to assist the parents.</p>

He said, &#8220;it was my duty to see if they could make their relationship work; it was for them to discuss the detail, where they lived, it was their life.  I was only the facilitator&#8221;.</p>

The uncle put to the father the allegations of violence and threats by the father.  The father admitted them, that he had done wrong, was not sure why, that he had anger issues and promised to seek help in that respect.  The uncle told me that some years earlier he had had a similar telephone conversation with the father, during which he also admitted he had lost his temper, and apologised.</p>

The uncle was anxious to facilitate a meeting between the parents and the two families to see whether a reconciliation could be effected.

I have not investigated or heard detailed evidence in respect of the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father and I am not making findings as to the exact extent and nature of the alleged violence, that matter may be for another court, but his e-mail gives a strong indication and acknowledgement that he has a bad temper and was prone to display it.  He promised &#8220;it&#8221; would never happen again.  I cannot say with precision what &#8220;it&#8221; was.  He begged forgiveness.

I accept there were family discussions concerning a possible reconciliation, and that there was a family culture to avoid divorce if at all possible.  I am not able to say when she formulated her intention to seek advice from solicitors in May.  It may well have been a developing thought over a period as she reflected and settled into her environment with her family.  I do not think it was a long held intention to seek advice before 13 May when she saw the solicitors, but one that had developed over time and formulated itself shortly before that appointment.</p>

However, she did not tell him of her intention or instructions to her solicitor in July.  Her silence may well have misled the father who was anxious and hopeful to effect a reconciliation, but their meeting on 12/13 July was for the children to enjoy themselves and see their father, it was not a meeting for the parents to discuss the mother&#8217;s intention.  Had she told the father on those outings there may have been arguments or recriminations and they would have become far from enjoyable or comfortable for the children.  Her silence while perhaps misleading the father may well have been well intentioned for the sake of the children.</p>

She was under pressure from the &#8216;head&#8217; of her family who was supported by her mother.  She had made a decision contrary to their hopes, efforts and culture.  She may have reached the decision with some misgiving or a heavy heart and if so would have felt the family pressure even more.  I accept the uncle&#8217;s statement that he did not know she had issued her Petition, and that he was surprised by her decision.  In that sense she misled him at the meeting and thereafter in not telling him.</p>

The uncle was expressing his hope that he had persuaded the mother to return, and that if that was to occur the parents would have to make the appropriate arrangements.  As it was the Uncle was unaware of the mother&#8217;s intentions to divorce the father, and as a consequence in any event could not give any assurance on the mother&#8217;s behalf to the father.</p>

The Guardian says she feels they have a &#8216;strong preference&#8217; not to return, rather than a clear objection.  The father also says they have raised a preference, no doubt because they have lived for more than a year in the care of their mother, and no doubt been influenced by her and her family whether deliberately or otherwise.</p>

They feel &#8216;safe&#8217; and/or &#8216;safer&#8217; here.  They have not said they will not return, or do not want to return in such words, and Miss Julian did not sense that was their position.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is often a fine line between an objection and a strong preference or wish.  In this case I share the guardian&#8217;s view it is a strong preference, rather than an objection. However, to require these children to return contrary to their &#8216;strong preference&#8217; to remain and not go back would not in my view be in their interests.  In addition, it would inevitably involve disruption and upheaval.  Additionally, no doubt, there would be further and increased anxieties and uncertainties as I anticipate there will be further litigation as to their welfare and place of residence.</p>

The father has offered various undertakings which are to be found at paragraph 35 of his statement dated 8 October 2013, which include permitting her to live with the children in the family home, and not to communicate with her directly or to threaten or intimidate her or the children.  There are also divorce proceedings pending in America, instituted by the father, and no doubt further protective measures, which if need be, could be obtained urgently by the mother either in those proceedings or other proceedings.  She had previously invoked the court to make protective orders in August 2012 and instructed Attorneys to do so, and is aware of what protection can be sought.</p>

She wishes to remain here with them and, no doubt if she returned to America she would instigate proceedings for leave to remove the children to live with her in this country.  Litigation always brings anxiety and worries which will add to her emotional burden.  She would be without the physical or emotional support of close family members, unless they were able to accompany her, and stay for some time, and that may depend on the United States Immigration rules.</p>

They have friends and a school, a home and environment to which they could return and re-immerse themselves.  It is not an unknown territory.  It may be not what they want, and they may be unwilling to go, and at least initially find it upsetting.  They may also feel some confusion and disruption as they are settled here and want to stay.  No doubt if there were proceedings for leave to return here and they become aware of such litigation, and I anticipate they would, they would pick up the mother&#8217;s anxieties and worries and they may well be interviewed by welfare workers and asked about their wishes and feelings.  All of this would subject them to uncertainties which may prevent them from settling until the outcome is known, but they would be in their mother&#8217;s care, which is what they want, in a familiar environment and away from direct parental conflict, which is something they dread (my words).</p>
