They say that A should go and live with her paternal grandparents under a Special Guardianship Order but with proper and frequent contact between A and her parents. They have put together a transition plan, but accept that, after a short while, contact will be at the discretion of the Special Guardians. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The mother and father have been separately represented, but their case is the same. They both propose A remain in their care and they would agree to any plan or order that would achieve this. If A cannot be in their fulltime care they would suggest a shared care arrangement with the grandparents, but if not, they would agree that A should be placed with the paternal grandparents, with whom she has a loving relationship. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">A is the first child these parents have had together. They both have children from previous relationships who are not in their care. Due to that history, the plan of the Local Authority, when A was born, was for the parents to enter into a residential unit, immediately on discharge from hospital. Sadly no placement was found, but the paternal grandparents, by then, had been assessed as potential carers and agreed to the parents and A moving into their home, to supervise and for assessments to be ongoing at their home. They did have a holiday planned, and A and the parents were able to move for a short period to the maternal family, and then returning to the paternal grandparents when they returned from holiday.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The paternal grandparents were therefore responsible for the supervision of the parents time with A, for allowing assessments to be ongoing and, for the first few months of A&#8217;s life, she stayed overnight in their bedroom, the rest of their care being undertaken with the parents. A remained at their home until 9 March 2024.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">There is no doubt that there was good progress. A was able to move to the parent&#8217;s bedroom in early February, by mid-February she was able to have a few hours a day unsupervised, and then on 9 March it was agreed that they (the parents and A) could move back to their home under the support of Aspire, undertaking a reversed residential assessment which meant constant supervision. That supervision was gradually reduced and by May it was limited to six hours a day. In early June, and after the expert report, full supervision was reinstated.</p>

During those proceedings the mother was found to have used inappropriate force towards that child, on one occasion throwing her on the sofa, rough handling and using abusive and foul language towards her. The Guardian&#8217;s report in those proceedings summarises as follows: </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in">Father&#8217;s two older children were also subject to public law proceedings that resulted in adoption orders being made. In respect of those proceedings, I have the Court&#8217;s findings dated 27 July 2017 which included information that the relationship between the parents was domestically abusive. The father had damaged the door in the home, the parents had argued for hours, and the children were aware and indeed witnessed all of it. There had been a failure to engage with support, and a minimisation of the concerns that those children&#8217;s needs were neglected and their basic needs were not met. The children themselves were dirty and the home conditions were unhygienic. </p>

Whilst at the home of the paternal grandparents, the family practitioner time with this family was 487 hours. Between 8 March and 24 May, the family practitioner time with this family was 1,175.5 hours. From 25 May, up to early June, it would have been six hours a day, and then from early June to date, it would be near constant supervision.

By 8 March, we have the move back to the family home, but with constant supervision. Between March and early May, that supervision was reduced, eventually getting to six hours of observation per day by early June. On the 7 June, the Local Authority took the view that there should be no further reduction in supervision.

They never identified that there were any problems. It would have been a time, on any reading, that this mother was constantly struggling, and it is important to stop and reflect about what the Guardian said about that child, that her care needs had been neglected at the most basic level. Limited interaction, poor stimulation, little emotional warmth. Limited routine, and a lack of reaction when this was happening and observed, physical harm and a constant belittling with abusive names.

It is when the parents become dysregulated, and very quickly dysregulated, A being at the centre of it. It means that, on a day to day basis, A will not know what to expect from her caregiver, whether her care will be very interactive and loving or whether it will have no warmth or interaction and she will have to manage her emotions accordingly. If a parent becomes dysregulated the risk also of physical harm.</p>

As A gets older and more challenging in terms of boundaries then that risk increases, and indeed, she will be pushing all the buttons of the mother and the father will go into retreat. The parents have still to work through their past behaviours and at this time the risks of the repeating the same pattern are high. </p>

She will develop her own coping strategies and those will follow her throughout her life. Second, it is the inability to control anger, which leads to physical harm. The Guardian put it perhaps more vividly when she says that, if a child is dealing with frightening parents they become more compliant because they seek to keep the parent happy, i.e. they seek to meet the needs of the parent, rather than the parent meeting the needs of the child. That leads to sublimation of their sense of self, and it is harmful because it means the child itself does not identify their own identity. It makes them vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and unhealthy and unsafe relationships. </p>

I need to look at all the options available to me, with A&#8217;s welfare being my paramount consideration and asking myself, what option available to me is the best one to meet A&#8217;s needs, staying with her parents, a shared care arrangement or being placed with the grandparents? </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in">I accept that her parents are her primary carers and I accept that separating A from them will be harmful. I accept that care, at the moment, is good enough. I accept that A would want to remain with them and not have change.  At the same time, I accept the evidence of the Expert, the parenting assessor, the team manager and the Guardian that the future risks are real, and the risks, for the reasons I have set out, will only increase as A gets older. I accept that those risks cannot sensibly be ignored and the harm is significant.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in">I accept that harm to A if removed can be mitigated in some way by a transition plan and proper levels of contact, which are clearly on offer. I also accept that the harm of separation can be mitigated because of the grandparents&#8217; very close and loving relationship with A. In my judgment all the evidence tells me that A needs stability and security. She is at a very formative time in her life, and she needs very safe and secure adult responses. </p>

I accept the evidence of the Expert and specifically I accept the risk assessment of the parents. I specifically accept that as A gets older the risks will increase. Sadly in my Judgment this risk is that history for both parents without further intervention will repeat itself. </p>

I accept the care of A to-date as a non-mobile baby has been good enough but when balanced with the future risks t is not enough. In the balance, what I have to do is to balance where she will be best placed and, in my judgment, it is sadly not with these parents. </p>

They are able to meet her global needs and have s strong connection with her. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in">I have considered carefully whether or not today I can make a Special Guardianship Order to the grandparents, as sought. I have considered carefully whether I should adjourn the proceedings and make an Interim Order to test out the placement but I am satisfied by their evidence and also the evidence of the Local Authority and the Guardian that these grandparents have already been tested. They have had the care of A with the parents for the first three months of her life. They know her very well. In my judgment I have a robust evidence based assessment of them. I have a support plan and I know the quality of care they offer. In my judgment they have been fully tested and that is the firm opinion of both the social worker Team Manager and the Guardian. Further that delay will hinder this family moving forward. Accordingly, for A, I am clear that the only option in fact is placement with her grandparents and that option must be under a Special Guardianship Order because they need to make the day-to-day decisions. I am satisfied that in making that order that they will promote proper contact between A and the parents and an order for contact is not necessary. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in"> The Local Authority asked me, if I make a Special Guardianship Order, to also make a Supervision Order. That is not because they have concerns about the grandparents, but they believe that the grandparents need a buffer zone to the parents, and they wish to support the grandparents and A for a period of time, both with contact but also to support and assist the parents in undertaking the work identified. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.38in">I am clear, though, that this is one of those exceptional cases where it is. These grandparents will need a buffer zone. They will need support. There are going to be very difficult steps ahead about negotiating contact, for contact to move hopefully  to unsupervised. For work to continue to assist the parents in continuing to make improvements and for all those reasons I accept the recommendations of the Local Authority and the Guardian and make a Supervision Order as sought for a period of 12 months in what are unusual circumstances. A&#8217;s welfare needs such an order to be made. </p>
