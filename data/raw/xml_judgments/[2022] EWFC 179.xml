Their relationship progressed quickly, with a civil ceremony in March 2016 and an Islamic marriage ceremony in February 2017. Between the two ceremonies the parties did not cohabit and the mother continued to live with her family, who she says were unaware of her civil marriage to the father. At the start of their marriage, following the civil ceremony, the mother made concerning allegations about her relationship with the father to the authorities. She made reports that she had been encouraged to undergo the civil ceremony by friends of the parties. Though she now says she did not allege forced marriage, this is what was recorded by the police at the time in September 2016. In October 2016, it is further recorded by the police that the mother states she did not know where the forced marriage suggestion came from and wanted this investigation to be closed.  During the early stages of their relationship, the mother was pregnant and underwent two terminations. The parties also began receiving anonymous messages, critical of both the parties and their extended families. </p>

The mother alleges that the father became controlling towards her and says she was unhappy during that time. She began self-harming and her family&#8217;s discovery of this resulted in difficulties within the family. The father says that this is when the mother began to go behind his back. During this time, the mother alleged there were problems in her relationship with the father during an appointment with her midwife. The mother suggests she did not use the words &#8216;domestic violence/abuse&#8217;, but that these were the words used and recorded by the midwife. </p>

The parents separated following the Osman warning, though they reconciled in November 2019. The parents eventually separated in April 2020. </p>

In April 2020, the child was made subject to a Children in Need (&#8216;CIN&#8217;) plan and a s47 investigation was directed by the court. This order was made without notice to the parents and was not to be disclosed to either party. The subsequent report, dated 14 May 2020, did not propose the issuing of public law proceedings at that point. However, following an incident on 27 August 2020 whereby the mother was stabbed in a local park in the presence of Z, the local authority issued care proceedings in October 2020. Z was made the subject of an ISO on 11 December 2020. </p>

His C100 Application was issued on 12 October 2019. A hearing was listed on 16 December 2019, but neither parent attended, and the mother informed the court that the parents had reconciled. After the parents separated in April 2020, the father&#8217;s contact was supervised by the then social worker. This coincided with the first pandemic lockdown and contact centres were closed. Contact between the father and Z moved to a contact centre in August 2020 but was suspended after the stabbing incident after only 1 session. The private and public proceedings were consolidated by an order dated 11 December 2020. As a result of the mother&#8217;s application (dated 3 March 2021) to keep her statement made to the court confidential from the father, the case was allocated to the High Court. The first hearing was on 14 April 2021 and there has been judicial continuity since that time.</p>

On 7 March 2022, the Local Authority&#8217;s application for an Interim Care Order was refused and a Child Arrangements Order was made for Z to live with the father and have supervised contact with the mother. The mother sought permission to appeal this decision on 24 March 2022, which was refused.</p>

Both in her reports, and as she clarified in her oral evidence, all of the bruises save for one set were non-specific for non-accidental injury and could well have occurred accidentally in an active toddler such as Z.  The exception were those bruises that were seen at hospital on 1 March of this year.  There were three bruises close together which in the opinion of the Doctor aligned with that of two fingers and a thumb mark, the child having been grabbed.  It was her concluded view that on the balance of probabilities these represented inflicted trauma on the child.</p>

She described how the contact progressed well as other contacts have done and were entirely positive.  There came a time towards the end of the contact session when Z needed to go to the toilet, he was taken by his mother, accompanied by the contact supervisor who stood at the door as the mother assisted Z to take down his trousers and pants.  It was at that point that the mother then said, &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; and produced an article or an item which turned out to be the torn corner of an envelope in which was a bladed item with some fragments of tobacco.  The contact supervisor never saw it on the person of Z and only saw the blade being produced by the mother.  The mother asserted that when she produced the item Z said, &#8220;That&#8217;s mine, I made it&#8221;.  The contact supervisor was quite clear that she did not recall that being said and when asked again in cross examination by Mr Squire on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian she said, &#8220;I did not hear Z say that&#8221;.</p>

He then almost immediately afterwards produced from his other pocket a wrapped item; this was wrapped in paper which when opened revealed two blades.</p>

The mother asserted that she and Z in December had tested positive for COVID-19.  Some short while later the mother asserted to the social worker that once again Z had tested positive for COVID-19.  The social worker was sceptical that that could possibly be the case and having consulted with her managers she collected Z and took him for a PCR test which proved to be negative.  She was of the view that the mother had lied to her about Z having Covid for a second time.</p>

When she arrived to collect him for contact with his father, he was hugely distressed, he was refusing to go, he was lying on the floor, and he was holding onto furniture.  On at least one of these occasions, members of the maternal family who were present, were urging the social worker to cancel the contact.  She told me that she did not do so but that she persevered, on one occasion for upwards of 20 minutes, and engaged the father in speaking to Z either by voice call or a video call.</p>

He was asked whether he was kind and caring towards the mother at that time and he said that yes surely, he was.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother was born outside this jurisdiction and moved during her childhood with her family to this jurisdiction.  She is the only daughter of her mother, and she has a number of brothers.  She is, as she accepted, an independent, intelligent woman.  The father was born in Pakistan.  He came to this jurisdiction in 2011 for the purposes of undertaking an accountancy course and studies.  They met through mutual friends.  It appears plain to me from what they both say that in colloquial terms they both fell head over heels in love.  Within three weeks the father had proposed marriage to the mother and by March of 2016 they underwent a civil marriage ceremony, but they did not then live together, not least because the maternal grandmother and the maternal family did not know that they were married.  They did live together after the Islamic marriage in February 2017.  It may be that that is when the mother says problems arose when they were living full time together for the very first time.  It is plain on any view that they lived or had to live in substandard accommodation having left the paternal brother&#8217;s home.  It is plain that they were living on a limited financial budget.</p>

In those circumstances I did not gain any sense of the father being overly controlling or domestically abusive towards the mother.  I am not persuaded that he financially controlled her and whilst it may well have been his desire that she focus on the marriage, plainly their financial circumstances meant that it was to the benefit of both of them that both the mother worked and the father worked.  I do not condone the fact that the father worked illegally and beyond the terms of his visa.  But I do not consider this has an adverse impact on his credibility as a witness.</p>

That would explain why there was most probably a reluctance on the part of the father to be involved with the maternal family and why he would desire to move to a place which put the two of them at some distance from the maternal family. This is simply part of human nature and it is not, in my judgment, abusive or controlling behaviour.</p>

In his written statement he rather sought to put some distance between them as to when they were effecting a reconciliation, but by the end of his evidence he had accepted that he was living with the mother pretty much full time up until April 2020.  In my judgment, the parents, as their relationship developed, had different goals and different thoughts about how they would lead their lives.  That may have caused unhappiness for both of them, but it is not, in my judgment, domestic abuse.</p>

And a little later it is recorded that she said, &#8220;She has also requested not to disclose any information or her personal account which she has given to the police in relation to this and any of the linked CRIS reports with her husband&#8221;.</p>

She lied to the social worker in her email to him.  She invited the father to lie to the social worker and not to tell him that she had been telling him everything.  She, in terms, lied or deceived her own family, her mother and her brothers, by withholding the fact that she had undergone a civil marriage with the father.  But, in my judgment, the most egregious lie told by the mother was to this court.  In April of last year, the matter was reallocated to me because the mother was applying to withhold her then most recent statement from the father.  Over the course of no less than five months I was being asked to withhold that statement from him and the fact of a police investigation because it was said that the mother feared very greatly what the father would do to her if he knew of what she had said in the statement and the police asserted that they considered the father and/or the author of the anonymous messages, if another person, posed a high risk of harm to the mother.  Indeed, she was moved to a property away from her mother&#8217;s home which had panic alarms and the like installed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the position statement filed by previous leading counsel for the mother on 26 May this year the following is asserted, &#8220;The resulting document maintains the position of the Police as to risk and prejudice to its investigation.  The investigation having progressed little since the last hearing as it relies on information requested from Instagram.  The mother continues to be guided by the police and subject to one matter supports the position of the Police&#8221;.  A little later it is asserted, in relation to messages received by the mother&#8217;s solicitor, &#8220;It is clear that the two are linked and that consequently there is clear evidence demonstrating a very close intimate connection between the author of the message and the father&#8221;.  Just prior to the filing of that position statement the mother had met with the father taking Z with her when she now tells me she was not frightened of the father and neither she nor Z were at any risk from him.  That information was never given to the court by the mother, and she maintained the position that she was in fear of the father for more than five months.  This delayed the court considering the father&#8217;s application for contact.  He had last had direct contact with Z in mid 2020.  After the stabbing episode his contact was restricted to weekly virtual contact by video.  As I have expressed before it is a testament to the devotion of this father, to his love for his son and of his abilities as a father that he was able to engage Z, then aged two, in virtual contact for upwards of an hour.  And all of the reports of this contact were entirely positive.  It was only when the father became aware of the closed material and the closed procedure that he was able to tell the court of the meeting with the mother in May 2021.</p>

I didn&#8217;t speak to the police or make statements against F as that isn&#8217;t what I wanted to do&#8221;.  A little later, &#8220;I was told by F to lie to the court and say we are separated and not in a relationship, but we were living together and had a husband wife relationship.  Lying to the courts didn&#8217;t feel right for me&#8221;.  Nowhere in that email does the mother disclose meeting the father in May 2021.</p>

I accept it was not put to the father that he was the perpetrator or that he had instructed the perpetrators.  I go further.  I am satisfied that he was not involved in any way with that stabbing incident of August 2020.  It strikes me as too coincidental that on the day of the father&#8217;s second direct contact that two strange men should approach the mother in the park and stab her.  I find and I am satisfied that this event was staged by the mother for the purposes of obstructing the father&#8217;s contact.</p>

When in late 2021 I ordered the father should have supervised contact and then thereafter when I ordered that he should have unsupervised contact in the community with Z, just a few days later the mother, once again, received anonymous messages.  Similarly, when after a pause I ordered the father should have overnight contact, once more threatening messages were allegedly received by the mother. I am quite satisfied that the father had nothing whatsoever to do with the sending of those anonymous messages.  The fact that triangulation points to those messages having been sent from somewhere in the road where the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home is, leads me to conclude that those anonymous messages were sent by people close to the mother.  The nature of the details set out in those messages from time to time can only have been known by somebody who was very close to the mother and/or the father.  I am satisfied that they were sent on the instruction of the mother to once again hinder and obstruct the father&#8217;s contact.</p>

If it had been the father who planted the blade on 14 April, he would have put those blades into his son&#8217;s pocket and let him go to contact where he would have had no control over the child at all, putting him at risk of suffering really serious harm particularly because he is so active and boisterous a little boy.  On the other hand, if it was the mother who planted the blades, she would know they were there, she would know that she had control of Z and that she could remove them and/or prevent him from harming himself.  In any event I note that on this occasion those blades were very carefully wrapped in paper with no part of the blades exposed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The same points can be made in relation to the second incident on 22 June.  But there are two crucial differences.  Nobody saw the blade in Z&#8217;s possession or on his person.  The first time they were seen is when the mother said something to the effect of &#8220;look at this&#8221; and was holding the torn part of an envelope with the blade in it in her hand.  She then asserted that Z said, &#8220;That&#8217;s mine, I made it&#8221;.  That, in relation to a torn envelope with a blade in it, makes no sense whatsoever and I am satisfied that after the first incident the contact supervisors would have been hypervigilant of what was said by Z and in particular when he was taken to the toilet.  I regret to conclude that I am entirely satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the mother is lying when she says Z said those words.  I am entirely satisfied and find that the blade was never on Z&#8217;s person on this occasion, that blade was in her possession, and she constructed a scene where it was purported that it was on Z&#8217;s person, and it was presented to the contact supervisors.  This helps inform me about the events of 14 April.  In any event, I reject any suggestion that the father would have placed his son, whom he greatly loves, at such very, very real risk of serious harm and on the basis that both the mother and the father agree it can only be one or other of them, I am satisfied and find that it was the mother who planted the blades on Z on 14 April as well.  I am satisfied that she did so to seek to put blame on the father that it was he who planted them on him in an effort either (a) to secure the removal of Z from his father&#8217;s care; and/or (b) to have an adverse impact on the father having contact with Z were he to be removed from the father&#8217;s care.</p>

It had been the mother&#8217;s habit to very carefully check Z for bruises when he had been on contact with his father.  On this occasion for reasons that she could not explain adequately, she did not.  She said it was the maternal grandmother who looked after Z and bathed him in the evening of 28 February when he returned from nursery and the following day because she was very busy in the morning.  I am quite satisfied that the father did not inflict the bruising on Z.  I accept the evidence of the expert paediatrician and I accept that those bruises seen on 1 March were for the reasons given by her inflicted injuries.  Z would have been cared for by various people within the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home and therefore it would be unwise for me to make a finding against the mother.  What I do find is and I am satisfied is that those bruises were inflicted when Z was in the care of the mother, but I am unable to identify who may have inflicted those injuries on Z.</p>

In her evidence the mother asserted that the father claimed that it was her that planted the blades because he sought to jeopardise her contact with Z and to cut her out of his life.  That is plainly not true at all.  Nothing the father has done has given any real basis for asserting that he wanted to remove Z from his mother&#8217;s care.  He had never made any application to care for Z.  He had never made any threat of that.  It was, as I have already said, the court that asked him to care for Z on 4 March this year.  He has been, as the social worker confirmed in her evidence, consistent in promoting contact between the mother and Z although, understandably, in light of the second blade incident, that has caused him to pause and to reflect on what is in Z&#8217;s welfare best interests.  As a result of that second episode the mother&#8217;s direct contact was suspended and replaced with weekly indirect contact only.</p>

I am satisfied and find the father did not subject the mother to domestic abuse including coercive control.  In relation to the stabbing incident of August 2020 I am satisfied and find that was staged by the mother.  In relation to the anonymous messages, I find that they were not sent by the father, they were not necessarily sent by the mother because she is not fluent in written Urdu, but they were sent by somebody on her behalf and most probably a member of her family or members of her family.  I am satisfied and find that the father did not plant bladed items on Z either in April or June of this year, but I regret to say I find it was the mother on both occasions.  The bruising of 1 March was once again not the father, that it was a non-accidental inflicted injury, and it was sustained when Z was in the care of his mother.</p>

I am satisfied and I accept that during that visit Z told the guardian that it was his mother who had told him to tell people that his father had hurt him.
