	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The parents of the child at the centre these proceedings are of Sudanese origin, but they now hold only Bahraini citizenship. The mother was born in Sudan and moved to Bahrain following her marriage to the father. As a child in Sudan she underwent female genital mutilation [FGM]. She has reported that two of her sisters died as a result of the FGM procedure and that the practice continues in the family with three of her nieces having already been subjected to FGM. The mother was a Sunni Muslim, who converted to Shia before subsequently converting back to Sunni. The parents have five children in all, four are older boys and the youngest, a girl [A], who is now 10 years old, is the subject of this application. </p>

He is now believed to have been detained in a military prison in Bahrain. On 31 August 2012 the mother made her first application for asylum in the UK. She withdrew this in early 2013 and applied for Assisted Voluntary Removal. She later also withdrew that application in January 2014.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 2 September 2015, the mother made a fresh application for asylum on the basis that, if removed to Bahrain, A would be subjected to FGM and the mother would be mistreated as a result of converting from Sunni to Shia Muslim. That application was refused by the Home Office on 16 December 2016. The mother&#8217;s appeal against that decision was dismissed by the First Tier Tribunal [FTT] on 25 July 2017. A number of determinations were made by the FTT, the most crucial of which was: &#8216;in respect of [A] there are not substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of her being subjected to any form of FGM&#8217;.  Permission to appeal was refused by both the FTT and the Upper Tribunal [UT] and on 14 May 2018, Holman J refused the mother&#8217;s application for leave to apply for judicial review of the UT decision. Appeal rights were thereby exhausted, and the mother and children were due to be deported in late September 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The relevant local authority, Suffolk County Council, had been previously involved with the family due to concerns about the risk of FGM. An assessment had been undertaken by Barnardo&#8217;s in 2017 which recommended the making of an FGM protection order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003</ref> if the family returned to Bahrain. There was however considered to be no risk of FGM whilst the family remained in the UK and the local authority therefore closed its file at that stage. </p>

The mother believed they would be deported further from Bahrain to Sudan due to new rules removing citizenship from nationals who had been away from Bahrain for 5 years. Barnardo&#8217;s reiterated their advice that there was a high risk of FGM and therefore the local authority issued an application for an FGM protection order on 27 September 2018. The father was not and has not been served with the application. </p>

The approach to risk is not the same as that taken in a family case. In a family case, establishing risk is a two-stage process. First, the court considers what facts are established on the balance of probabilities; then it proceeds to consider whether those facts give rise to a risk of harm, see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Children)</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/9" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 9" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 9</ref>. In contrast, in an asylum/humanitarian protection claim, the material presented by the claimant is looked at as a whole with a view to determining whether there is a well-founded fear of persecution or substantial grounds for believing that a person would face a real risk of serious harm, a reasonable degree of likelihood of serious harm being what is required. There is no comparable process of searching for facts which are established on the balance of probabilities.&#8221; </p>

They also argue that the family courts must respect any decision of the FTT/UT in respect of the risk of FGM in the country of return and consider that as part of their analysis of all the circumstances in determining whether to make an FGM protection order. This would mean that where the FTT has dismissed the risk of FGM, the family courts are still required to consider any application for an FGM protection order but the starting point must be whether, in light of the FTT decision that the risk does not provide a basis for the person to remain in the UK, there is any scope for an order to provide assistance. Whilst in exceptional circumstances the family courts may take a different view to the immigration tribunals, this should be rare, and the court would need to identify a material basis for that conclusion. No such basis arises in the present case and Mr McKendrick therefore seeks the discharge of the injunctive relief currently directed against the Secretary of State. </p>

The question raised in the present case is whether proceedings in the family jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref> are in a different category such that the court when making an FGM protection order does have power to restrain the Secretary of State from removing a person from the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Monaghan submits that there is indeed a distinction between FGM cases and other family proceedings. The distinction is said to arise from ECHR, Art 3 which, it is accepted by all parties, imposes a positive obligation upon the State to take steps to protect an individual from &#8216;inhuman or degrading treatment&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is, again, common ground that FGM is treatment which is highly likely to amount to a breach of Art 3.

An application for an FGM protection order must therefore be considered through the prism of Art 3. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Despite the ease with which Ms Monaghan is able to establish FGM within the context of Art 3, it is not possible to travel with her to the next stage of her argument which is that, because FGM engages Art 3, the family court has in FGM protection order cases jurisdiction to injunct the Secretary of State in contrast to the court&#8217;s inability to do so in any other family proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Firstly, although by focusing on one specific behaviour which is very likely to engage Art 3, FGM has to be seen in that context, it is the case that many, possibly very many, asylum cases will also involve an alleged risk of behaviour which may also fall within Art 3. There is, however, no suggestion in any of the authoritative judgments on this issue to the effect that there is an exception to the blanket prohibition on the family court granting orders against the Secretary of State where a risk of Art 3 treatment has been established by findings in the family court. On the contrary, the words of Lord Scarman in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>, of Hoffmann LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte T</span> and of Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">R (Anton)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">GD (Ghana)</span> are firmly couched in terms of structure and principle, with no contemplation of any exception. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As Lord Scarman, Hoffmann LJ and Sir James Munby separately make clear, the Secretary of State and the family courts are each operating a different and entirely distinct jurisdiction that has separately been entrusted to them by Parliament. Whilst, as Mr McKendrick submitted, the two jurisdictions may be complementary, they are wholly separate with no potential for any structural crossover. Notwithstanding the probable engagement of Art 3, there is simply no jurisdictional space in the structure that has been created by Parliament in which the family court can reach across and directly interfere in the exercise by the Secretary of State&#8217;s exclusive powers with respect to the control of immigration and asylum. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thirdly, the discharge by a State of its positive obligations under Art 3 is to be contemplated by looking at the operation of the State&#8217;s engagement with the issue as a whole. In this regard, I accept the Secretary of State&#8217;s analysis of the Family Court&#8217;s FGMA jurisdiction being complementary to the separate scheme regulating immigration and asylum operated by the Secretary of State and specialist tribunals. Where a family court has undertaken a risk assessment with respect to FGM relating to a family which is also the subject of immigration control, then the Secretary of State and the tribunals will take account of that assessment when making any relevant determination, or, if the family proceedings have (as here) followed the immigration process, may re-consider the immigration decision under Rule 353.  </p>

To succeed in establishing the need for the family court to have jurisdiction to prevent the Secretary of State from exercising her jurisdiction to remove an individual, it is not sufficient, in my view, to indicate that it might be helpful or desirable for such a jurisdiction to exist; what is required is evidence that, without the family courts having the power to injunct, the State would plainly be in breach of its obligations under Art 3. In short, the jurisdiction for the family court to injunct the Secretary of State in the exercise of her immigration and asylum jurisdiction could only be established as an essential element to meet the State&#8217;s Art 3 obligations if there is clear evidence that this is necessary. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Secretary of State&#8217;s submission is not supported by any authority. In fact, as the helpful observations from Black LJ (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> (see paragraph 32 above) demonstrate, the approach to risk assessment in a family case is a different exercise from that undertaken in the context of immigration and asylum. The family court has a duty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref>, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to &#8216;have regard to all the circumstances&#8217; and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving on to assess the risk and the need for an FGM protection order. Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction. </p>
