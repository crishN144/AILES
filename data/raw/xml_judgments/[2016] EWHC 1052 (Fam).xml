Whilst in her statement of 22 July 2015 the mother alleged that she was forced into this marriage, on her own evidence this is not, in fact, the case.

The mother also stated to social workers that she had been subjected to FGM <span style="font-style:italic">prior</span> to her marriage.  In the witness box the mother&#8217;s story changed substantially and she claimed that she had been subjected to FGM by the father&#8217;s family <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> she got married following a family meeting at which she had <span style="font-style:italic">consented</span> to FGM because she was in love with the father.  </p>

On 17 August 2015 the mother underwent an examination by Dr. Jane Dickson, Consultant in Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare.  A letter from Dr. Dickson dated 18 August 2015 confirms that the mother has been subjected to Type I FGM (which, adopting the World Health Organisation classification, involves partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce, but not the removal of the labia).  The father accepts the mother has been subjected to Type I FGM but asserts that this was not performed by his family and was likely performed on the mother by her own family when she was an infant in accordance with custom.  </p>

The mother further alleges that one of the father&#8217;s three sisters was subjected to FGM.

The family has fostered informally several children, including P, R and B.  These arrangements appear to derive from the family taking in children whose parents cannot care for them and looking after them in return for the children carrying out certain chores and tasks.  Having spoken to the paternal family, Miss Coker was left with the impression that the mother derived significant assistance from the foster children in caring for SE, FE and CE and that, accordingly, P, R and B represent established attachment figures for the children within the context of the father&#8217;s proposals for the children&#8217;s care in Nigeria that I will come to.</p>

Whilst the arrangements may appear unconventional to Western eyes, it is important to remember that this is a different cultural context.

Miss Durrant assesses the mother to be very isolated in the United Kingdom with no support network.  The mother accepts that she is dependent upon subsistence support under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1990 and is not permitted to have recourse to public funds.  </p>

I accept that SE said this to Miss Durrant and have no reason to believe that SE was not telling the truth.  </p>

At the time Miss Durrant was involved she also noted that the children were reserved towards their mother.  Miss Clark points out that this contrasts to the observations made by Miss Opadiran in August 2015 when the children were observed to be comfortable in their mother&#8217;s care and no concerns were expressed with the child/parent relationship.  Whilst this is correct, by the time of Miss Durrant&#8217;s assessment, there is ample evidence to suggest that ahead of that assessment the mother had been speaking to the children inappropriately concerning FGM.  As I shall come to, there is also evidence that the mother was pressuring or coaching the children regarding their responses to professionals.  I am satisfied that these developments explain the apparent discrepancies between the observations of Miss Opadiran and the later observations of Miss Durrant.</p>

The mother&#8217;s housing is also insecure and she has recently been at risk of eviction.  Miss Durrant observed that the mother discouraged educative aspects of the children&#8217;s welfare, discouraging SE&#8217;s interest in reading as causing &#8220;damage to her brain&#8221; and asserting that SE hates reading when in fact SE makes clear that she &#8220;loves&#8221; reading.  Miss Durrant considered the mother not to be supportive of either of the children&#8217;s formal or informal learning.  Miss Durrant further notes that the children are isolated from their peer groups by reason of the mother&#8217;s insistence on a strict curfew.  </p>

As noted, the children have clearly reported entirely inappropriate comments being made by their mother to them regarding the father wanting to take them away for FGM, which comments have resulted in considerable emotional distress for FE and SE and which comments the mother did not deny during the course of her evidence.  At the core group on 17 November 2015 the mother was recorded by Miss Durrant as being unhappy with CE&#8217;s positive representation of her father. This evidence was not challenged.  Miss Durrant is finally concerned, as is the court, with the mother&#8217;s inconsistent narrative and her anger when those inconsistencies are challenged.  </p>

The children had contact with their father on 29 September 2015 and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2015.  When Miss Durrant spoke to the children to introduce the fact they would be having contact with their father after three months the children (whom the mother alleges were regularly beaten by their father and threatened with being killed by him) were observed to be extremely relaxed about seeing their father.  FE and CE were eager to see him. SE smiled, FE smiled broadly and CE began to giggle.  At the first contact CE immediately ran to her father (so fast that the social worker had to prevent her from running into the road) and FE was close behind.  SE was seen to be more reserved, but transformed after 20 minutes and became relaxed, laughing and able to enjoy herself.  Within this context Miss Durrant notes that SE aspires to be an engineer like her father.   There were lots of kisses and cuddles exchanged at the end of contact and all the children said they wanted to see their father again.  CE said she wanted to see him &#8220;all of the time&#8221;.  During contact the father presented as natural in his affection towards the children, who in turn presented as relaxed and able to accept their father&#8217;s demonstrations of affection.   The father was observed by Miss Durrant to be both elated and relieved following the initial contact of 28 September 2015.  </p>

All the children enjoyed the company of their father and none showed any apprehension, although SE did present as preoccupied with adult concerns.  SE also lamented that they would never have a nice house in the United Kingdom within the context of a discussion that occurred with regard to what the father&#8217;s new house in Nigeria was like.</p>

Having plainly enjoyed contact and her father&#8217;s company on 29 September and 3 October, on 12 October SE presented as closed and detached when speaking to Miss Durrant and unwilling to share her wishes and feelings with professionals.  She said that she did not like her father, but was unable to say why, eventually saying she liked him a little bit, but claimed to be afraid of him. Eventually SE said just, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk about it&#8221;.   In light of the comments made by the mother to the children regarding the father and the threat of FGM, Miss Durrant is satisfied that this disjunction between SE&#8217;s presentation with her father in contact and her late presentation when speaking to Miss Durrant is the result of SE being pressured or coached by her mother in respect of the matters with which the court is concerned.  </p>

During the contact on 3 October 2015 FE said she enjoyed living in Nigeria and was sure she would not have a nice house in the United Kingdom. By 6 November 2015 when speaking to Miss Durrant, FE considered Nigeria frightening and unsafe due to robbers and wanted to live in London.  Once again, in light of the comments made by the mother to the children regarding their father and the threat of FGM, Miss Durrant is satisfied that this disjunction between FE&#8217;s presentation with her father in contact on 3 October and her late presentation when speaking to Miss Durrant on 6 November speaks to FE being pressured or coached by her mother.  FE has also told Miss Durrant that her mother is &#8220;comfortable and nice&#8221; and that her father was someone who encouraged her when she is sad and was the first person to pick her up when she is hurt. She also said that she would be happy to live her whole life with her mother and sisters.  </p>

Like Miss Coker, Miss Durrant noted the father&#8217;s commitment to the children&#8217;s education.   The father was keen to hear about the children&#8217;s educational achievements during contact and showed pleasure in them.  In relation to boarding school, the father was confident that SE could manage the transition and said it was expected that a girl of SE&#8217;s age and social background in Nigeria would attend boarding school.  Miss Durrant considered, having spoken to him and observed him in contact with the children, that the father presents as a warm and caring father well able to meet the emotional, physical and educational needs of all three children.</p>

Were the court to reject that recommendation and consider that the children should remain in the care of their mother, given the contents of a s.37 report, the local authority has indicated to the court that it will be holding a legal planning meeting with a view to considering the issue of care proceedings in respect of the children.  If the court&#8217;s decision is in line with the recommendation of the local authority pending the children&#8217;s departure to Nigeria, Miss Durrant recommends that contact between the children and their mother be supervised contact due to the very real risk that the mother will place inappropriate and undue pressure on them.  Miss Durrant is of the view that particular support will need to be given to SE to assist her in understanding the court&#8217;s decision and to avoid a risk of inappropriate responsibility being placed upon her within the context of that decision.</p>

Within this context I note that the aforementioned statistical surveys indicate that Nigeria has the lowest level of FGM performed after the age of 14 years (16 per cent) and that over 90 per cent of Igbo girls on whom FGM is performed have it performed in early infancy (there appears to be no data in respect of the sub-group of Delta Igbo).</p>

However, this is an unusual case in which there was a full-blown contest between the parents as to which should have the responsibility for primary care of the two children at the centre of the storm, namely A and D.  The judge quite rightly recorded that there was really only one possible resolution to the cross-residence order applications, given that both A and D had so completely and so sadly disconnected themselves from their mother.  The judge ultimately had to decide between a mother&#8217;s proposal for a residence order to be implemented in this jurisdiction and a father&#8217;s residence order application to be implemented in another state.  In those circumstances the discipline suggested in paras [40] and [41] of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Payne</span> hardly applies&#8221;.</p>

This is not, I emphasise, a call for an elaboration of the taxonomy. Quite the contrary.  The last thing that this very difficult area of family law requires is a satellite jurisprudence generating an ever-more detailed classification of supposedly different types of relocation case.  Any move in that direction is, in my judgment, to be firmly resisted.  But so too advocates and judges must resist the temptation to try and force the facts of the particular case with which they are concerned within some forensic straightjacket.  Asking whether a case is a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Payne</span> type case&#8217;, or a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> type case&#8217; or a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Re Y</span> type case&#8217;, when in truth it may be none of them, is simply a recipe for unnecessary and inappropriate forensic dispute or worse.

Finally, whilst in no way determinative, I note Miss Coker&#8217;s evidence that the family originate from an area of Nigeria that was one of the first to experience campaigns against FGM and that the practice is now a criminal offence in Nigeria pursuant to the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act 2015.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s claims in this regard are characterised by patent inconsistencies and her story has evolved in the telling.  In her statement dated 22 July 2015 and to social workers the mother claimed she was subjected to FGM just before the marriage and did not want the procedure, but had no choice.  In the witness box the mother&#8217;s story changed to her having been subjected to FGM after she had got married, to which procedure she consented.  The mother&#8217;s description of FGM likewise does not match the outcome of her examination.  In her statement the mother contends that the FGM she suffered was Type II. Examination showed it to be Type I.  Whilst care must be taken with this latter point, given the mother is not an expert in FGM, this apparent inconsistency further illuminates the mother&#8217;s lack of credibility, which lack of credibility is exacerbated by what I am satisfied are further untruths she has told during the course of this matter in respect of forced marriage and domestic violence.  </p>

I am quite satisfied that the mother wholly misrepresented the position to the court when she claims to have been forced into marriage with the father.  I am likewise satisfied that the mother is not telling the truth when she claims that the father subjected her to sexual and physical violence and that he perpetrated violence against the children.  The mother&#8217;s allegations in this regard are entirely un-particularised.  Her assertion that she was &#8220;forced&#8221; to divorce the father is at odds with her characterisation of her marriage to him.  When pressed regarding her allegations in cross-examination, they became ever more outlandish.  As I have noted on a number of occasions during the course of this judgment, whilst the threat of violent gangs cannot be discounted in any jurisdiction, the mother&#8217;s evidence that her reaction to the approach of an armed group aiming to do her grave harm was to take a shower was, frankly, incredible. The mother&#8217;s allegations that the father has beaten and threatened to kill the children on a regular basis for years is entirely at odds with the close, comfortable and loving relationship with their father that the children demonstrated, even after a gap in contact of three months.</p>

Beyond the mother&#8217;s evidence which, for the reasons I have already set out, is substantially lacking in credibility, there is no evidence that the father has made the threats alleged. The police made clear that they have never seen the alleged seventy text messages that the mother claimed the father sent her in relation to FGM and the mother&#8217;s evidence to the court on this issue was wholly unreliable.  The mother has adduced no evidence in support of her assertion that her father was told in a beer parlour in Nigeria about threats allegedly made by the father.  The mother conceded in evidence that the white robes allegedly sent by the father to the children in the United Kingdom are used for ceremonies generally and are not specific to the performance of FGM (it is in any event difficult to see why the robes would have been sent to this country when, as the mother alleges, FGM was to be performed following the kidnap of the children to Nigeria).</p>

Whilst once again noting the need for caution when considering statistics, the statement of the paternal grandmother to Miss Coker that when it was practised, FGM would be carried out on girls when they reached the age of seven months is consistent with data showing Nigeria as having the lowest level of FGM performed after the age of four years (16 per cent) and consistent with the statistic that over 90 per cent of Igbo girls upon whom FGM is performed have it performed in early infancy (again accepting that there appears to be no data in respect of the subgroup of Delta Igbo).</p>

Within this latter context, I reject the mother&#8217;s evidence that the copy of the divorce certificate in the bundle demonstrates that she obtained a divorce from the father in Nigeria on 23 June 2013.  I accept the father&#8217;s evidence that this did not occur in circumstances where I am satisfied that the father and the mother returned together to the United Kingdom on 28 June 2013.

It is not in the children&#8217;s best interests to be exposed to negative comments in respect of one parent by the other.

In particular, as matters stand, I note that such a move would represent a very substantial change in the level of contact the children would be able to have with their mother in whose primary care they have been for the past four years.  Against this, the change of circumstances constituted by a return to the care of their father is a change that will result in a return to surroundings with which the children are familiar (accepting that they would be returning to a different home city to that which they left in 2012) and extended family members with whom they have established relationships.</p>

On the evidence before the court I am satisfied that the mother has sought to scare the children by telling them in detail about the FGM she was subjected to and telling them that their father was seeking to kidnap them in order to subject them to the same procedure resulting in the children suffering considerable emotional distress.   I am further satisfied on the evidence that the mother has sought to undermine the children&#8217;s relationship with their father by this conduct and by dishonestly depicting the children as having been scared of their father and having no bond with him when the opposite was in fact the case.  </p>

I accept the evidence of Miss Durrant and the father that SE told them that she gets up at 3 a.m. to ensure that she and FE and CE are ready for school whilst the mother sleeps in until 8 a.m. I accept that SE was telling the truth when she said this.  I am reinforced in this conclusion by the clear evidence during contact sessions of SE being preoccupied with adult concerns.  </p>

I likewise reject her assertion that Miss Opadiran is lying and that Miss Ibiyode is hard of hearing.  I am satisfied that the mother did tell Miss Opadiran and Miss Ibiyode that she was prostituting herself in order to secure support for the children.  I am further satisfied that by engaging in such conduct (whether so-called &#8220;transactional sex&#8221; or prostitution in the sense it is ordinarily understood) the mother exposed the children to a risk of coming into contact with inappropriate individuals.</p>

In particular, by entering into a sham marriage and making false claims of FGM to support her asylum application (which resulted in the children being taken to the Home Office by the mother) the mother has exposed the children to a risk of instability, uncertainty and ultimately potential deportation.  Further, by overstaying with the children the mother has placed herself in a position whereby she has no means of support, resulting in the children living in conditions of relative deprivation compared to that which would have been available to them and to the mother in Nigeria had the mother complied with the legal requirements of her visa.</p>

The father&#8217;s application is, in my judgment, plainly motivated by his wish to secure his children&#8217;s welfare in the face of significant and, I am satisfied, justified concerns regarding the children&#8217;s welfare in their mother&#8217;s care.  Having heard him give evidence and having regard to the assessments of Miss Coker and Miss Durrant, I am satisfied that were the children placed in his care in Nigeria, he would prioritise the welfare of each of the children and, in particular, their educational needs.   </p>

I am satisfied on all the evidence before the court that the father will ensure that the children are well cared for when he is at work were they to return to Nigeria.  Having considered them carefully, I am satisfied his proposals are well thought through and realistic, particularly where the children will be returning to familiar surroundings and extended family members with whom they have established relationships and to circumstances which substantially, although not completely, reflect their living arrangements prior to their leaving Nigeria in 2012.  For the reasons I have already given, I am satisfied that the return of the children to the care of their father does not carry with it a risk that they will be exposed by him to FGM.  </p>

By her actions I am satisfied that the mother has failed to prioritise the children&#8217;s physical, emotional and educational needs.  I am further satisfied that she has shown very little insight into her conduct and its adverse impact on the children&#8217;s welfare.  Rather than seeking to address the current situation of the children through lawful means and open and honest cooperation with the professionals seeking to assist the family, the mother has instead chosen to seek to deceive the authorities and mislead the professionals to the manifest detriment of the children.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that were the children to remain in the care of their mother, they would continue to be at substantial risk of not having their needs met.  They would, I am satisfied, continue to be isolated and, in particular, isolated from peer groups.  In addition, they will continue to be isolated from extended maternal and paternal families in Nigeria.  Given the narrative pursued by the mother in pursuit of her asylum claim and her continuing willingness to lie in order to get what she wants, I consider that there is also an appreciable risk that the mother would continue to seek to undermine the children&#8217;s relationship with their father.  Within this context and having regard to the matters I have already set out in this judgment, I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s opposition to the father&#8217;s application has not been driven by genuine concern over FGM and the children&#8217;s welfare but rather by her desire to gain immigration status on false pretences.  </p>

In these circumstances I am satisfied that the interference in the mother and children&#8217;s right to respect for family life constituted by an order permitting the father to remove the children permanently from the jurisdiction is proportionate, having regard to the aims it is sought to achieve.</p>

Whilst I have no jurisdiction to dictate to the local authority the actions it should take consequent upon my order, it would be my hope that the local authority will (a) assist in facilitating the handover of the children from the mother to their father; (b) assist the children to understand the reasons why they are moving to the care of their father and returning to Nigeria; and (c) supervise contact between the mother and the children pending the children&#8217;s departure to Nigeria.  </p>
