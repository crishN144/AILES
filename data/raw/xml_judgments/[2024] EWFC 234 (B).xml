It consists of       22 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

The email from F indicated that he had tried without success to move the appointment but produced no proof of that beyond his assertion in the email.  F asked that if the case could not be adjourned, could it be put back to the afternoon instead, ignoring the fact that Ms Jones was only available for 9.30am to 10.30am so moving the case to the afternoon would mean that she was not able to give evidence.  Having considered F&#8217;s application, I refused the application to adjourn, explaining by email sent via Family Admin to him and M&#8217;s solicitor that he was asked if he had any dates to avoid, and specifically if he was available for 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August 2024, and he confirmed that he was available for 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August but not for 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> and 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">st</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August.  I noted that he said he had tried to re-arrange the appointment but provided no evidence of trying to do that.  I also took into account that the appointment in question was an annual review so it was not clear why this appointment had to go ahead and could not be re-arranged, and that it would not be possible to simply move the hearing to the afternoon as F was aware that Ms Jones was only available to give evidence between 9.30am and 10.30am.  He was advised that the hearing would proceed as scheduled at 9.30am on 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August 2024 and that failure to attend may result in the case proceeding in his absence.</span></p>

The only evidence in support of his application that he produced was a screenshot of a video appointment for an annual review at the haematology department.  He did not produce any evidence to support his contention that the annual review was potentially linked to any urgent medical treatment immediately afterwards, and his last email made it clear that he would not produce any further details.  I did not actually have any medical evidence of any kind as envisaged by the relevant caselaw, just a screenshot of potentially a routine appointment.  It was a video appointment so F would not be at the hospital, which also called into question his assertion that he may need immediate treatment afterwards.  He also produced no evidence to show that he was unfit to attend court, and it seemed from his last email that even if he had been granted a short adjournment to produce that proof, he was not willing to do so.  I was also mindful of the fact that this is a case in which I have made serious findings of domestic abuse perpetrated by F against M, including coercive and controlling abuse and psychological and emotional abuse of M, and that this is not the first time that F has sought to adjourn a listed hearing having said initially that he would be available.  Something very similar happened for the fact-finding, whereby he sought to adjourn, albeit for work related reasons, but failed to produce proof in support of that.  I also considered that, as happened with the application to adjourn the fact-finding hearing, F&#8217;s reasons for seeking an adjournment appear to change every time he communicated them.  I was concerned that by seeking to adjourn in this way F was trying to expose M to further domestic abuse by manipulation of the court process and considered that he should have re-arranged the routine medical appointment to prioritise attending this final hearing.</span></p>

The hearing proceeded and he did not renew his application to adjourn.  As planned, Ms Jones gave her oral evidence with the court calling her since both parties had aspects of her evidence that they wished to cross examine her about.  M asked her questions, and then F was given his opportunity to ask his questions.  Initially, albeit with some assistance from me to break longer questions into shorter, more manageable ones, or to help suggest a form of question that was relevant and appropriate, things were proceeding as planned.  I did ask F to move on from repeating questions about why the CAFCASS officer had accepted the findings and not looked for other evidence, because Ms Jones had explained more than once at in answer to his earlier questions that the law required her to consider her assessment in light of the findings and not to go behind them.  F concluded asking his questions, and I started to ask a couple of questions in clarification.  In fairness to F, one of these clarification questions was about an option for supervised contact and whether that might mitigate the risk of domestic abuse because it seemed to me that was something that F had not put to Ms Jones and a litigant in person he might not have realised that and it would assist everyone to hear her evidence about that.  Ms Jones was dealing with this aspect when F became increasingly agitated and started to verbally interrupt the hearing, saying that he thought it was all unfair and he had been prevented from asking his questions.  He then said he would leave.  I offered him an opportunity to take a moment to breathe, think and proceed, reminding him that if he left the case would proceed without him and thus without his evidence, but he became more agitated and refused to either listen or to stop talking over me, saying again that it was all unfair.  I said that he should either stay quietly or leave at this point, but he didn&#8217;t leave the courtroom or remain quiet, so I ended up rising anticipating that security may be required to remove him but before any action could be taken, he left.  This behaviour was obviously upsetting for M, and it seemed to me to be a repetition of some of the behaviours that I found F had subjected to in the past, as well as a stark illustration of the sort of rigid refusal to accept the outcome that Ms Jones&#8217; evidence had identified.</span></p>

A has a need to know about her identity from both sides of her family, and to have a relationship with both of her parents as long as neither parent poses a risk of harm to her.  A has no additional physical or educational needs to those usual for her age.  The section 7 report notes that A has lost the relationship with her father over the past year and that will have been very difficult for her, and she will not be able to process that loss unless she masters the development of her own emotional and social regulation, and she needs to feel safe to do that (page 176).  As the report also notes, it is possible that the impact on A of the domestic abuse that I found to have happened may have caused her some developmental trauma, but the recommendation to engage with a programme designed to address the impact of domestic abuse on children should mitigate this in time.  Ms Jones was also clear in her oral evidence that her enquiries with A&#8217;s nursery showed that A was thriving in the care of her mother and engaging well at nursery.</span></p>

The section 7 report recommends that A should live with her mother and not spend any direct time with F, and that there should only be indirect contact between F and A three times a year by way of letters.  In her oral evidence, Ms Jones expanded this recommendation to make it clear that such indirect contact didn&#8217;t just have to be letters, it could also be photographs of F and his family, and child focused gifts.  For reasons that I will expand on under the risk of harm heading, F has not seen A directly for over a year now.  This is a significant portion of her life because A is only just 4 years old.  Direct contact between A and F would therefore be a change in circumstances for her.  I found that F exposed A to domestic abuse both directly and indirect, and Ms Jones was clear that her professional judgment is that F is at high risk of continuing to expose A to domestic abuse.  The likely effect on A of the change of reintroducing direct contact with F is therefore that it would be disruptive and harmful to A at this point.</span></p>

I have already noted A&#8217;s age.   It is also very clear that A has a rich and diverse dual heritage from each of her parents.  Ms evidence to me showed very clearly that she understands that A would benefit from being able to learn about her paternal heritage from her F, if that was safe for A, and that M&#8217;s strong desire had always been for this to happen.  I noted in my fact-finding judgment at para 30 that M had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:initial">&#8220;produced compelling evidence to show the efforts that she had gone to both during the relationship and afterwards to try to ensure that A spent time with F&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> As I also noted in that same paragraph, M had been willing for A to spend time w F, and for that time to be unsupervised, from the outset of the proceedings.  Her only caveats had been around handovers being safe to protect her and A from the domestic abuse by F that I found had occurred.  The fact that A stopped seeing F in August 2022 was because, despite both M and the court being willing to explore the possibility of A spending some limited time with F to mitigate potential risks of domestic abuse prior to the outcome of the fact-finding, F refused to co-operate with this.  An order permitting limited contact on a Sunday was in fact made by the Magistrates at the First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August 2023.

On 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> October 2024 I continued the 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> August 2023 order and tried to impress on F that it was in A&#8217;s welfare interests for him to spend time with her as set out in that order.  Sadly, by the time of the pre-trial review on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> November 2023, F had still not done that, and told me that he was not prepared to accept any limitations on his time with A (and that was his emphasis since it was more about him and his feelings than A).  As a result, I suspended the order for direct contact and ordered instead only indirect contact by way of letters or cards no more than once a month.   In addition, as set out in the section 7 report at page 180, as recommended by CAFCASS M set up the parenting app, AppClose, as a means of indirect contact between F and A.  F repeatedly told Ms Jones that he did not feel comfortable using the app and that he was not prepared to use an app.  M told me that she sent F both the initial invitation to the app, and then an update via the app, but as far as she can tell F did not accept either.  It seems as if the only indirect contact between F and A since M set up the app is that F sent A a gift for her birthday in June this year.   As detailed by Ms Jones in her report at page 180, the fact that A had not had any other indirect communication with A meant that this gift came out of the blue and was unsettling and upsetting for A.  If F had used the parenting app to remain in regular contact with A, Ms Jones notes quite rightly that his gift would have been unlikely to be so unsettling for her.  I find that the only barrier to F having direct contact with A is the fact that F has subjected M and A to serious and sustained domestic abuse, does not accept this, and is unable at the moment to evidence any changes which would mitigate the risk of A being exposed to further domestic abuse.  I also find that the only reason he has not had regular indirect contact with A is because he has chosen to put his needs above those of A in refusing to accept any limitations on his contact, and this includes refusing to regularly use any form of indirect contact including a parenting app.  He is clearly technically capable of using a parenting app from the voluminous and numerous emails and electronic documents that he has submitted to the court over the course of these proceedings.</span></p>

The findings that I made in this case were of F being physically, psychologically and emotionally abusive towards M, subjecting her to coercive and controlling abuse, made threats to remove A from the jurisdiction, and that F had emotionally abused A and failed to parent A in a way that protected her from harm.  F&#8217;s communications and documents sent to the court since the fact-finding hearing make it abundantly clear that he does not accept the outcome of the fact-finding hearing in any form.  He also made that clear to Ms Jones when interviewed for her section 7 report as that report noted and as Ms Jones confirmed in her evidence to me today.  His comments and cross examination during the first part of this hearing before he left also made it clear that he does not accept the findings.  It is sadly clear to me that F doesn&#8217;t accept that he was abusive to M and A in the way that I found at the conclusion of the fact-finding and, in fact, doesn&#8217;t accept that he has done anything wrong and should have done anything differently.  Nor does he accept, as I found, that he puts his needs above those of A and is not putting her welfare first.    As Ms Jones told me in her evidence, because F doesn&#8217;t accept the findings or that he has done anything wrong, he is at high risk of continuing to expose M and A to similar significant domestic abuse as that which I found had happened before.  Supervised contact, in her professional opinion, would not mitigate this risk to an acceptable level to make direct contact safe for A.  This was because A has been significantly harmed emotionally by the domestic abuse that she has experienced, evidenced by what the nursery have observed about her before the direct contact ceased, and since.  Ms Jones was clear that A now feels safe at home, and this means she also feels safe at nursery, whereas when F was still seeing A and exposing her to domestic abuse, A did not feel safe and home and therefore also didn&#8217;t feel safe anywhere else.  This led to A exhibiting some challenging behaviours, which have now stopped, and the nursery information shows that A is now a settled, happy and thriving little girl.   </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial">Supervised contact, in Ms Jones&#8217; professional opinion, would still be likely to expose A to an unacceptable risk of harm from F&#8217;s domestic abuse.  Ms Jones told me that she has reached this conclusion because F is so rigid in his views that the findings are incorrect and he has done nothing wrong and that it was M who was the abuser and to blame, and that he has so much hostility towards M that A would be exposed to that even at a supervised contact setting.  Ms Jones&#8217; confirmed to me that even with professional supervision there is still a real risk of F saying something about it being M&#8217;s fault that he can only see A in a contact centre if A were to ask why.  She was also clear that having to organise contact at a contact centre would also pull M and A back into a situation where they have to regularly see someone who has abused them, meaning that neither M nor A would get a break from the abuse.  Ms Jones also told me that it was significant that F&#8217;s approach to objecting to direct contact was actually about controlling the situation rather than what was best for A.  She also pointed out that his failure to engage in indirect contact via the parenting app can be seen as a pattern of controlling behaviour too.  I agree with her assessment of this and find that for F it is all about him having control and putting his needs first, before A&#8217;s needs.  I am also mindful of the fact that any supervised contact that needs to be supervised at a contact centre also risks drawing M back into a situation of coercive control by F, because, as Ms Jones told me, M would have to arrange the times and dates in communication with F and would be permanently anxious about whether he would turn up or seek to change the times.  It would also expose M to a risk of financial control, I find, since contact centres come at cost and, although I could order F to pay all of the costs of any contact centre, his track record in the proceedings and in generally doing what is required of him would suggest that he is not likely to comply with that.</span></p>

Ms Jones&#8217; evidence to me about this was very clear, the only issue about F&#8217;s parenting is that he has perpetrated domestic abuse.  He needs to address this by completing an appropriate Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme (DAPP) first, and it would not address this issue for him to simply complete a parenting programme, though any parent can benefit from a parenting programme, and it might be something for him to consider doing in any event.  She also explained that, because of the domestic abuse findings and F&#8217;s extreme resistance to accepting those findings, it would not be appropriate for F to complete the CAFCASS Planning Together for Children course either, since that would again expose M and A to further domestic abuse from him. Ms Jones was also clear in her evidence that F first needs to complete a minimum 26-week RESPECT accredited Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme, not some short online course, and that he will need to wait for a period of time after the conclusion of the proceedings before he could apply for such a course because such courses are deliberately not available during proceedings.  She also noted in her report and her oral evidence that F is unlikely to be accepted onto a DAPP while he fails to accept any of the findings and the need for him to change.</span></p>

An order setting out arrangements for A is clearly necessary given the findings I made, the level of dispute about the arrangements for A, and the CAFCASS recommendation.  Under PD12J para 37A, because I have made findings of domestic abuse, I also have to consider whether an order under section 91(14) is necessary to protect M and A where a further application would constitute or continue domestic abuse.  Para 37A reminds courts specifically that future applications could be part of a pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour or domestic abuse towards a victim.  Ms Jones was very clear in her report that an order was necessary in this case, noting at page 182 para 53 that she was concerned about the impact on A of the potential emotional harm of repeat proceedings.  Ms Jones had also noted in her report at para 17 page 175 that there is some evidence that A may be aware of the difference in her life to her peers because of the number of professionals who have been involved with her, and any further proceedings would also risk having professionals involved with her again.  Ms Jones also told me in her evidence that she was quite concerned about what F had written in his two most recent documents about having the right to make applications about A as and when he chooses, so she thought there was a potential for further proceedings.  M was less sure about this, telling me that she thought F was unlikely to be able to afford fees or to make applications since that would require him to be proactive rather than reactive.  I did point out to her in clarification that, although F has only made two C2 applications to adjourn proceedings in this case, he has sent numerous emails and documents to the court in which he is asking the court to allow him to spend time with A, which could all be taken as his applications for an order that permits that.  Based on my assessment of the evidence at this stage, and having witnessed the extremely volatile and unfortunate behaviour of F during this hearing, I am satisfied that F is very likely to try to apply in relation to A in future and for that to expose M and A to continued domestic abuse by way of coercive control, as well as emotional and psychological abuse, since it would draw them into proceedings again, mean that M would be worried about the outcome and mean that A would have to engage with more professionals.</span></p>

In this case, I am satisfied that such an order is necessary and proportionate to protect M and A from future applications which would be risking exposing them to further domestic abuse in themselves.  I accept the evidence of Ms Jones that F would need to show that he has successfully completed an appropriate DAPP course to be able to apply if a section 91(14) order is made.  Because he does not accept the findings, or that he did anything wrong, and has demonstrated absolutely no capacity to change in the evidence before me, it is not possible for me to fix a timescale on when it is likely that F may have done the necessary work and the risk from him would have reduced.  The order will therefore have to be an indefinite order, to last until F is able to evidence that he has successfully complete a minimum 26-week RESPECT accredited DAPP.  To evidence this, he would need to provide a certificate of completion from an accredited course provider, as well as a report completed by the course provider covering both the midway and end point of the course.  If he is unable to source a RESPECT accredited DAPP but completes a course that he believes is equivalent, he will need to produce independent evidence from the course provider to confirm that the elements of the course are equivalent to the RESPECT accredited course modules and that the course was of a minimum length of 26 weeks or six months.  </span></p>

M also agrees to keeping anything sent in accordance with this order by F for A when she is older, as long as the communications are child focused and appropriate for A.
