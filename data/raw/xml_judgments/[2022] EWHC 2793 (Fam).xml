	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 December 2018 HHJ Backhouse gave judgment on the local authority&#8217;s application for a care order in respect of three children: A, a boy then aged 2 years 9 months; B, a girl then aged 23 months; and C, a boy then aged 11 months. The local authority issued proceedings on 3 May 2018 after C was found to have suffered subdural and retinal haemorrhages (&#8220;SDH/RH&#8221;) which were considered to be likely inflicted injuries. The judgment was given at the conclusion of a nine-day fact finding hearing at which the principal findings sought included:</p>

She rejected the parents&#8217; case that the injuries had been inadvertently caused by bumping C down the stairs of their flat in a buggy or by a toy being thrown by another child. She was unable to determine who had caused the injuries and so both parents were in the pool of possible perpetrators. She did not conclude that either knew what the other had done and was covering up. </p>

The care proceedings concerning the older three children concluded with care and placement orders made by HHJ Backhouse on 12 June 2019. The parents had a further child, D in late 2019. Following her birth, she was placed in a foster to adopt placement. Care proceedings in relation to D commenced that day. All the children are, according to the Guardian, doing well in their placements.</p>

That application was dismissed by HHJ Cove on 3 November 2020 [B140/&#167;5], on the basis that neither the report of Dr Mann nor the Communicourt assessment undertaken at court on 16 November 2018 had recommended that an intermediary was required.  </span></p>

In the event of a change in the outcome, whether that is in relation to the causation of the SDH/RH or, if inflicted, the identity of the perpetrator, that will be relevant to whether the threshold has been reached and the outcome in relation to D, and would also amount to a change of circumstances in relation to the parents&#8217; application for leave to oppose the adoption of the older children.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The mother&#8217;s application based on the absence of an intermediary at the fact-finding and non-compliance with the Ground Rules at the fact-finding hearing is dismissed in so far as it relates to the intermediary element, but is allowed in respect of the non-compliance with the Ground Rules. In respect of the intermediary, HHJ Cove dismissed each of the parents&#8217; applications on 3 November 2020 when it was apparently contended that the report of Sarah Smith of Communicourt justified the reopening of the fact-finding. That was not appealed, and I do not consider it proper to re-take that decision. However, the transcripts of the expert and the mother&#8217;s evidence have subsequently become available, and they establish that there was significant non-compliance with the Ground Rules, particularly around breaks during the expert evidence and the mother&#8217;s evidence, such that I consider that their contents and the arguments based around what the transcript demonstrates justifies the conclusion that the hearing was not overall a fair one. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The mother&#8217;s application based on the argument that there was inadequate consideration of the medical evidence, that the expert evidence that bumping down the stairs was a near impossible explanation for the SDH/RH was unjustified, given expert evidence given in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R v Henderson</span> appeals and in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Sutton v Gray and Others (No 1)</span>. The possibility that the SDH/RH might be a result of rebleeding of earlier birth-related SDH/RH is dismissed. I do not consider that either the material which derives from Dr Anslow&#8217;s opinions or the submissions of counsel on medical matters (including relating to birth-related injuries and the possibilities of re-bleeds) as to the potential relevance of alternative explanations either amount to fresh evidence or that, if they could be so regarded, they provide solid grounds for believing that the conclusion that the SDH/RH was an inflicted injury requires revisiting.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The father&#8217;s application to reopen the findings based on the failure to fully implement the Ground Rules identified on the basis of the evidence as to vulnerability, then before the court and based on the fresh evidence of Dr Radcliffe and Lucy Turner, is allowed. The transcript of the evidence shows the Ground Rules relating to breaks were not sufficiently implemented. Other issues relating to the hearing of the parents&#8217; evidence including their not being present for each other&#8217;s evidence, the absence of consideration of the impact of the father&#8217;s cognitive difficulties on his credibility in the judgment and the significant impact that the judge&#8217;s evaluation of his credibility had on the decision support both the occurrence of a procedural irregularity and an arguably material impact on the fairness of the process. The expert report of Dr Radcliffe and intermediary report of Lucy Turner (not of Communicourt) amount to fresh evidence which was not available, is credible and which, if it had been available to HHJ Backhouse would have been likely to have had an important influence on the conduct of the hearing. Had it been available it is likely that the father (and the mother) would have had the assistance of an intermediary. What the ultimate impact of that would have been is indeterminable and for the purposes of an application to reopen based on fairness of process grounds it is not a requirement to demonstrate solid grounds for believing that the outcome will be different. As it happens it is clear from the judgment that HHJ Backhouse considered that the quality of the father&#8217;s evidence was poor and had deteriorated over the course of the hearing; whether that was because of an absence of credibility of his evidence <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, or whether it was as a result of his vulnerability and the ineffectiveness or absence of appropriate Ground Rules is not determinable now. The mother and father&#8217;s credibility will fall for consideration in a re-hearing at which their participation will be supported by an intermediary and (I hope and expect) the implementation of appropriate participation directions. </p>

I refuse the mother&#8217;s application for the instruction of fresh experts as I do not consider it necessary to enable me to determine these proceedings justly.

For reasons that I have not been able to examine, the time estimate which the application was given when it was listed previously was reduced from three days to two days and thus this judgment has felt the squeeze which that resulted in. However, having had the benefit of extensive oral submissions, extensive reading and subsequently a fair amount of thinking time I am satisfied that the conclusions I have reached are the proper ones but it has not been possible due to the constraints of time to explain in writing in glorious technicolour all of the arguments laid before me, all of the jurisprudence which bears on the application and the full process of reasoning by which I have come to accept or reject the parties respective arguments. I have considered reserving my judgment for a lengthier period of time in order to provide a more detailed judgment, but in reality, given the other commitments I have this term it would not be possible to undertake that process before the Whitsun vacation and I do not consider that the further delay that would result in to be justified given the length of time these children, the parties and others affected (including the proposed adopters) have already been waiting for progress on this front.</p>

The category of cases where re-opening an issue may be allowed is not closed. Although the cases on the subject tend to focus on fresh evidence in the sense of new expert or factual evidence this should not always be required. It is open to the court to permit the re-opening where other circumstances, including poor legal representation or the failure to explore issues properly calls the reliability of the finding or the fairness of the process into question.  The court should not be deterred by a &#8216;flood gates&#8217; argument; if cases occur where the circumstances (broadly construed) justify re-litigating an issue, the fact that publication of that fact may lead to other applications to re-open should be regarded as a positive. </p>

These challenges were not put to the neuroradiologist or the neurosurgeon which ought to have been; this being an area which any counsel familiar with head injury cases would be aware of.

In oral submissions a further break was identified by counsel and on Day 2 there was no break. The process of taking his evidence was deficient including what he was asked in chief. He was robustly cross-examined but no one explored other possible mechanisms with him including the grand-parents evidence about C hitting his head on the stairs. The need for a break with the father is particularly pronounced when one has regard to his desire to get things over; see one of Dr Radcliffe&#8217;s conclusions on the father&#8217;s main area of difficulty. Rather than identifying this and carefully accommodating it, the father at times was rushed through his evidence to the extent that the judge concluded in her judgment that his evidence <span style="font-style:italic">became more and more untruthful as he went on until towards the end, he seemed to be saying, the first thing that came into his head&#8221;. </span>This supports the contention that inadequate Ground Rules or compliance with them undermined his evidence. The local authority relied on their inconsistencies in support of their case and the judge said: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;However, I did not get the sense from their evidence that they both knew what had happened and were seeking to cover up the truth. Rather, they seemed to be flailing around, trying to defend themselves from the criticism they were receiving of all aspects of their parenting and home lives.&#8221;</span>.

Counsel is no substitute. Dr Radcliffe considers that an intermediary should support the father throughout the proceedings, including giving evidence. Ms Turner identifies the need for others to take responsibility for ensuring that measures are implemented and the inadequacy of relying on the father to take responsibility for, for instance, asking for breaks or making clear he has not understood something. The overall impact of the current reports is to call into question the father&#8217;s ability to give full instructions to his legal team in 2018/19 in respect of matters arising from the expert evidence.</p>

It does not follow automatically that a failure to comply with the provisions of Part 3A FPR 2010 will automatically lead to a successful appeal, but rather the court must consider whether they amount to a serious procedural irregularity which renders the decision unjust. In these sorts of cases, a serious procedural irregularity in participation of a party may, without much more, lead to the decision being unjust, although in some cases a flawed assessment of a party&#8217;s evidence may be negated by other supporting evidence, such that the decision should not be interfered with.</p>

Those resulted in some Ground Rules being identified in the order of 16 November 2018, which were to be applied during the fact-finding hearing. In her judgment, HHJ Backhouse states explicitly that those Ground Rules were applied during the hearing. Thus, the court in this case is not confronted with a situation where a hearing had been conducted in ignorance of the possible vulnerability of a party, but rather where a vulnerability has been identified and apparently addressed.</p>

The mother and father approached the application on the basis that the later assessments were of better quality than the earlier assessments and that the asserted deficiencies in those earlier assessments should lead the court to conclude that the hearing was vitiated as a consequence. Given that neither the psychologist&#8217;s report of Dr Radcliffe, or the intermediary assessment of Ms Smith or Ms Turner purported to critique the earlier assessments and given that there was no suggestion that either the experts or the intermediaries should be called so that the court could examine which was the more reliable, it did not seem to me that it was possible to approach the case on the basis that I should now prefer the later assessments and conclude that the arrangements made on the basis of the earlier assessments were thereby demonstrated to be inadequate.  I ultimately reach the conclusion that the later assessments should be regarded as fresh evidence and a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Ladd v Marshall</span>-type approach be adopted where one looks at whether they could have been available earlier, whether they are credible, and whether had they been available they would have been likely to have had an impact not  on the ultimate outcome of the hearing, but on the decision-making in relation to Ground Rules.</p>

That is a policy whose sole purpose, however, is to preserve flexibility to deal with unusual circumstances.

In respect of the three children who are already subject to care and placement orders, finding that the injury was not inflicted or a change in the identification of both parents as being in the pool of perpetrators would fundamentally alter the legal landscape. Absent an inflicted injury the threshold for state intervention might not be met and identification of one parent as the perpetrator might result in the non-perpetrator being in a position to care for all three children; either outcome might require the care and placement orders to be discharged. In respect of D the threshold which is currently based on the contention that each of the parents presents an unquantifiable risk by reason of they being in the pool of perpetrators for having inflicted serious injury on C would either evaporate if the injury was not inflicted or would focus on the perpetrating parent with the non-perpetrating parent being an obvious potential carer. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, the route by which the application has reached me is not in compliance with those routes but that does not detract from the need to address the substance of it. The initial application to re-open the fact finding in respect of the older children appears to have been made by the mother within the proceedings relating to D, and was based upon there having been no intermediary appointed for her within those earlier proceedings, together with an application by the father to reopen the fact finding based on the absence of genetic testing (I'm unsure of the precise nature of this).  These applications were the subject of case management orders on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2020. On 3 November 2020, HHJ Cove further adjourned the father's application to reopen and dismissed the mother's application to reopen apparently on the basis that she had had an intermediary assessment in the earlier proceedings. I was informed by Mr Feehan that this was dealt with in an abbreviated hearing with the mother being represented by her solicitor.  By 6 February 2021, a geneticist&#8217;s report had been obtained, which concluded there was no suggestion of a genetic propensity towards C incurring subdural haematomas or retinal haemorrhages. A final hearing of the care and placement applications in respect of D was due to occur on 28 June 2021 with a time estimate of five days. On 17 June 2021 the mother&#8217;s team filed a skeleton argument drafted by Mr Storey QC and Mr Chippeck in which they submitted that because the mother denied harming C and because the findings of HHJ Backhouse that she was in the pool of perpetrators were neither technically <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata </span>nor a finding that on the balance of probabilities she had harmed a child, the threshold in relation to D would have to be established by the calling of evidence. The skeleton identified the basis of the challenge to the fact finding as being (a) the failure to consider properly the possibility of the injuries having been caused by C being frequently bumped down the stairs in his buggy, (b) having regard to the fact the Court of Appeal and High Court had accepted expert evidence from Dr Anslow (a consultant paediatric radiologist) that a bumpy buggy ride might cause rebleeding from a birth-related subdural haemorrhage in particular when viewed against the expert evidence given that such a cause was near to impossible and (c) that the history of the case generally indicated a lack of proper enquiry. It is of course the case that in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Henderson</span> appeals in which Dr Anslow gave evidence on behalf of the defendant, Mr Butler, that there was a dispute between Dr Anslow and Dr Stoodley. The Court of Appeal decision that the judge erred in considering a submission of no case to answer, was based more upon the ophthalmalogical evidence and they noted that it was open to the jury to reject Dr Anslow's evidence. In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Sutton v Gray and Others</span>, Hogg J does appear to have accepted that a bumpy buggy ride could constitute a sufficient trauma to trigger a re-bleed and that a re-bleed could be caused by lesser force than a bleed <span style="font-style:italic">de novo</span>. </p>

At some point adoption applications were also made in respect of the older children and the parents. Applications for leave to oppose adoption were also listed for consideration at the hearing on 27 October 2021. The basis of the application for leave to oppose appears to be based at least in part, if not wholly, on the contention that the setting aside of the factual findings would amount to a change of circumstances within the Adoption Act 2002. Subsequently the father&#8217;s case developed as the cognitive and intermediary assessments came in and the transcripts were received.

For the purposes of this judgment, it seems to me that it is more helpful to identify the argument separately because there is a distinction in the test to be applied to the medical as opposed to the fair hearing arguments. In relation to the medical arguments the authorities support the full reopening as incorporating an evidential element which causes the court to conclude that there are solid grounds for believing that the result would be different. In relation to &#8216;fair hearing&#8217; arguments the authorities require far less of a demonstrable causal nexus (perhaps not at all if the breach of Article 6 is sufficiently grave) between the failure of process and the outcome of the case.</p>

Alternatively, the emergence in the medical literature of reliable material which place the evidence given in the 2018 proceedings in a different perspective, having regard to subsequent research or developments in medical science might also conceivably provide a sufficient basis for the conclusion that solid grounds for believing that a different result might be reached. However, it seems to me to be hard to say that counsel&#8217;s criticism of the approach taken to the medical evidence during the initial fact finding can amount to a solid ground for believing that the result may be different. During the course of submissions on behalf of the Guardian, Ms Howe submitted that her experience of similar cases was that rebleeding was not consistent with the medical findings in this case.</p>

I do not conclude that the transcripts demonstrate that the approach taken was outside the range of reasonable approaches which might have been taken at the time. Although we have not explored the test, which might govern the court reopening a hearing due to the performance of the lawyers, it does not seem to me that we are anywhere close to the realms at which unfairness due to inadequate legal representation is close to engaged. The references to the possibility of either subdural rebleed or retinal re-bleeds and whether a lesser degree of force might cause such bleeds and whether they were relevant considerations in this case existed. The experts in their reports all identified the issue of birth-related SDH/RH and some referred to the literature on the issue. Although no expert meeting took place, and the issue of re-bleeding was not explicitly referred to with these experts it seems more probable that they did not consider it a viable possibility rather than four experts having each independently over-looked an important possibility which on the parents&#8217; case would have been within the range of opinions that they might have been expected to give.</p>

Ultimately, Dr Anslow is one expert whose opinion in relation to a broadly similar mechanism being capable of causing a rebleeding of a birth-related subdural haemorrhage is simply that. The court in this case had the benefit of evidence from four eminent experts from different disciplines who had applied their expertise to the particular facts of this case. It does not seem to me that the nature of Dr Anslow&#8217;s evidence in another case several years ago constitutes a solid ground for believing the result of a re-hearing would be different. Nor do the submissions of counsel as to their view of the importance of various aspects of medical enquiry amount to solid grounds.  Nor does my reading of the transcripts of the medical evidence itself and the issues which were explored provide any basis for saying that there are solid grounds for believing that the decision as to causation should be re-opened on those grounds. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision of HHJ Cove was fairly and squarely on the issue of whether Ms Smith&#8217;s intermediary report demonstrated the fact-finding hearing was procedurally unfair. No transcript of the decision was available, only the order. It does not appear that that decision was the subject of any appeal, and so the current application is in essence in part an attempt to re-litigate an issue already determined with only limited further material different to that which was considered by HHJ Cove. The heart of the additional argument is that the transcript suggests the mother did not understand aspects of the questioning including the concept of the pool of perpetrators or the local authority case that if it was not the father it was her, that inadequate breaks were implemented in her evidence and during the evidence of others. Although Mr Feehan may be right that technically the court retains an unlimited discretion to reconsider applications which have already been made and determined, the circumstances in which the court will do so are limited and usually involve a material change in circumstances or fresh evidence which calls into question the reliability of the original decision. It is not open to the mother simply to re-argue the application based on the intermediary assessment. However, whether the transcripts create a different situation I shall consider. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The transcript shows that the mother was given a card to hold up in the event that she was tired or confused; that she was taken to the central issue immediately in her evidence in chief and subjects were identified; a break was taken after examination in chief, another after 1 hour of cross-examination [M138] and perhaps 45-60 minutes later [M153]. However, during the afternoon session, it appears to have resumed after the lunchtime adjournment and continued without a break until the mother concluded her evidence. The timings are not recorded on the transcript, but in terms of length it runs for about 50 pages compared to 55 pages for the morning session and no breaks are recorded at all. At the conclusion of questions by the Guardian the mother says in answer to the judge that she is ok to continue but at almost the same time says she just wants to go home, and the judge&#8217;s questions take up about three further pages. So, it seems that the mother gave evidence for about 2 hours without a break in the afternoon. During the afternoon session the judge intervenes on limited occasions when the mother&#8217;s answers are less focussed. During cross examination she was robustly examined and there were some longer and more complex questions which she appears to have had some difficulty in answering, but the overall impression of the evidence is that she managed; the judge occasionally intervened to explain a complex word on a critical issue [M119]. It was submitted that it appeared during evidence that there were some matters which had not been canvassed by the mother with her legal team and that the input of an intermediary in the preparation for the case would have addressed this, but my impression of the transcript is that any new details were not out of the range of what might usually be expected in this sort of case. HHJ Backhouse found her evidence to have been in general coherent. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear then that the afternoon session does not seem to have complied with the breaks Ground Rule and the impression from this session is of the quality of the mother&#8217;s evidence deteriorating over this session to some degree. I have considered whether this apparent failure to comply amounts to a sufficient departure from the Ground Rules on its own to warrant a conclusion that the mother&#8217;s ability to participate fairly and appropriately was compromised to a degree that justifies reaching the conclusion that the non-compliance amounted to a procedural irregularity then lead to an unjust result or in alternative terms whether the non-compliance rendered the hearing of the mother&#8217;s evidence materially unfair. On a fairly fine balance I do not think that this alone did. However together with the concerns over the lack of compliance with the Ground Rules about breaks in relation to the medical evidence, in particular Professor Stivaros and Mr Richards and Mr Morrison (see below) I think the overall combined effect in relation to the mother was that there was non-compliance with the identified Ground Rules which was material,<span style="font-style:italic"/>and which thus affected the overall fairness of the hearing. Thus, I accept that the evidence from the transcript demonstrates sufficient additional evidence which shows that the Ground Rules identified by HHJ Backhouse were not implemented sufficiently in respect of the mother and warrant a conclusion that they alone demonstrate that the hearing was unfair to the mother. It is a relatively fine balance as the breaks alone form only part of the Ground Rules and in other respects, in the use of simple language and questions, the impression from the transcripts is one of in the main compliance. But I am conscious that the mother&#8217;s cognitive assessment showed a lower level of functioning than the father&#8217;s and that the intermediary report of Ms Smith contains a detailed set of recommendations based on her assessment to promote fair participation and having regard to this non-compliance with the Ground Rules clearly creates a real risk of adverse impact. The judgment of HHJ Backhouse identifies the mother as a more credible witness but not one whose evidence is sufficiently reliable to allow the judge to say, on balance, she was probably not a perpetrator. A material change in the mother&#8217;s credibility arising from fuller compliance with Ground Rules clearly might make a significant difference to her. I did not hear submissions on the point that had this application been finally determined by HHJ Cove it would have been open to her as the judge who rejected the application in 2020 to have said the combined effect of the intermediary report and the impact of the transcript was sufficient to meet the test to permit re-opening. It seems to me that the transcripts are sufficient on their own to establish the mother&#8217;s case. The refusal based on the intermediary report alone could have been the subject of an appeal, but it was not.</p>

But the cross-examination about the cause of the injuries takes place, it seems, after the break at 13.09 when F presumably has been giving evidence for over 2 hours and during the usual lunch break. In the afternoon my impression is that some of the questioning becomes longer and more complex, and the questioning about the time he had to blow on C&#8217;s face occurs shortly before the break at 13.43. After the break the father is cross-examined by the mother&#8217;s counsel and the guardian&#8217;s, then no re-examination occurs, and questions are asked by the judge. The transcript runs for 28 pages but is untimed. The page count suggests this was a period of about 1 hour.    </p>

Mr Richards and Mr Morrison gave evidence and there does not appear to have been a break between their evidence which covers 27 pages of transcript &#8211; probably in excess of 1 &#188; hours.

There is some reason to believe that better adherence to Ground Rules, or indeed better Ground Rules might have assisted the parties in giving their evidence and might have affected the views that the judge took of them. How this might eventually play out of course cannot be known. Either the mother or father might emerge as a more or less credible witness at a rehearing and a clear perpetrator might be identified (if the cause of the injury remains inflicted injury) or both parents might remain in a pool of perpetrators with or without failure to protect findings in tandem.</p>

Of course, it is not open to the mother to raise arguments about the comparison between the report of Dr Mann and Dr Radcliffe in respect of her because she has not undergone a further cognitive assessment by a court-appointed expert. Ultimately, I do not consider one can seek to draw comparisons between the evidence before the court on 2018 and now and to prefer one rather than the other.

The fact that the later assessment of the mother was also conducted by Communicourt (the same legal entity and the courts&#8217; primary provider of intermediary assessments and services) and reached what appear to be significantly different conclusions concerns me. The fact that the intermediary assessment of the father conducted by an independent intermediary also reaches conclusions which appear to be significantly different to those reached by Communicourt in November 2018, supports the conclusion that the current reports are credible. In the absence of any evidence as to the earlier assessment it is impossible to know, and I decline to speculate, why the outcomes are different. The fact is that those reports are materially different.</p>
