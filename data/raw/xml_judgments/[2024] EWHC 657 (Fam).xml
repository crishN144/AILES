Were it not for that dominant factor, I would have concluded that the Respondent himself should not be allowed to avail himself of the protection of anonymity which is commonly ascribed to parties in judgments published from the Family Court and Family Division of the High Court.  The Respondent is injuncted separately from publishing details of this case, breach of which would occasion separate punishment; should he make any attempt at publication of information in the public domain arising from these proceedings, his conduct should be capable of being countered promptly by the facts recorded here.  The anonymity which I have afforded the Respondent in this case at this stage is therefore capable of review should circumstances change.</span></p>
