However this is an exceptional application and requires unique facts for me to approve it. The issues are of vital importance to these two twins, who are 5 months old and for the person who is not here and has no knowledge of these proceedings,  namely the mother&#8217;s husband, &#8220;Mr L.&#8221; or as I shall refer to him &#8220;H&#8221;,  who lives in Poland. Hence it is necessary for me to go into some detail in scrutinising the application and considering whether I should grant it or not. The application has been made under Part 19 of the family procedure Rules 2010 and FPR 14.21, it is by the local authority, who seeks an order dispensing with the need to notify and seek the consent of the husband of the twins&#8217; mother, to their adoption, together with a family in England.   </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s husband (&#8216;H&#8217;) did not even know that his wife was pregnant leading up to her arrival back in England earlier this year and the day the twins were delivered by caesarean section on 15 June 2020. Mr L&#8217;s name does not appear of the twins&#8217; birth certificates.

	    <p>I would like to inform you that regrettably, we are unable to be present at the hearing today due to multiple commitments however I would like to take  this opportunity to express our interest in the case and despite our absence today we would like to assure you of our readiness to assist the Court and the Parties should this be considered as helpful. As such please do not hesitate to contact our department on 07825610587/02078228973 if required. I would also be very grateful if at your earliest convenience you could update us of the outcome and share a relevant court order with our office subject to court permission. </p>
	    <p>In the view of the mother&#8217;s wishes we would like to bring to your attention that as the children are Polish nationals adoption in Poland is also available therefore it may be in the children&#8217;s best interest to conduct parallel search for adopters in Poland (intercountry adoption)  - I attach relevant guidance herewith.   </p>
	    <p>In line with  the provisions of the art 8 and art 20 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child we would welcome if all efforts are made for the adopters to be of Polish heritage so that the children are able to preserve their heritage. Should this be impossible, as per our previous email, please note that in case of the adopters not being Polish nationals, a child can retain its Polish citizenship, however it takes place upon request of the parental responsibility holders &#8211; guidance attached in the previous email.  </p>

Respect is also due to the position of the unsuspecting relatives.  Some may have been a fleeting presence in the mother's life, but others may be more significant figures who have been kept in the dark and would be astonished to find that a baby (their child, sibling or grandchild) had been born and adopted without their knowledge, particularly if they were in a position to put themselves forward as carers.  Most of all, the notification decision has life-changing implications for the baby.  It may influence whether adoption happens at all and, even if it does, a sound adoption has its foundations in the integrity of the process by which it is achieved. </p>

In fairness to those other individuals, the account that is given by the person seeking confidentiality cannot be taken at face value. All information that can be discovered without compromising confidentiality should therefore be gathered and a first-hand account from the person seeking confidentiality will normally be sought.

The conception and concealed pregnancy may give rise to particular difficulties in some cultural and religious contexts. These may enhance the risks of notification, but they may also mean that the possibility of maintaining the birth tie through a family placement is of particular importance for the child. (7) The availability and durability of the confidential information. Notification can only take place if there is someone to notify. In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.</p>

M initially claimed that F, who was the father of her two elder children and had PR for the eldest, was also the father of the subject child. M subsequently told the social worker that F was not the child&#8217;s father, but rather had been conceived as a result of a one-night stand with a stranger. The LA sought a declaration that it need not take any further steps to identify/locate the child&#8217;s father/paternal family, however also sought an order for DNA testing to establish paternity. M&#8217;s position was that she and F were no longer together, she feared F&#8217;s response, and that she was certain that he was not the father. M suggested sibling DNA testing; the judge refused and directed M to provide F&#8217;s contact details.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.05in">In a case where a mother wishes a child to be placed for adoption without notifying the father, but where there is uncertainty about the identity of the father, the issues of notification of the birth of the child and paternity testing are interlinked. The approach identified in Re A, B and C at para [89] contemplates an individual being a putative father, although in one of the two cases where the issue concerned notification of a father, paternity had not been confirmed. A putative father is a person thought to be the father, although paternity has not been formally confirmed. The present case concerns a possible father, someone who may or may not be the father. Such uncertainty about paternity is to be regarded as one of the other relevant matters referred to at subpara 6(9) of the summary at para [89] in Re A, B and C. If the court, on all the available information, considers that there is a substantial possibility that a person may be the child's father, that will be a factor to be taken into account alongside other factors bearing on the decision concerning notification. The weaker the possibility, the less likely the court will be to direct an investigation of paternity that compromises the mother's wish for privacy.&#8221; </p>

The LA sought directions as to whether the husband should be notified of the child&#8217;s existence and the care proceedings in relation to her. The CoA upheld the trial judge&#8217;s decision that M&#8217;s evidence was wholly unreliable and that the balance was decisively in favour of notifying the husband. The Court also held that the responsibilities of a public authority, the rights of the child, the rights of the husband and the rights of the mother&#8217;s other children could not be minimised or suppressed. The Court would be exceptionally slow to grant a relaxation of the rules of service in any circumstances except the most extreme. Thus, Thorpe LJ commented at [3]: "</span>it is clear that the court has a general discretion to grant exception from the requirements of the rules but that power is on the authorities only to be exercised in highly exceptional circumstances<span style="font-style:normal">." </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.05in;text-indent:0.24in">In exercising that broad discretion, I would suggest that the following be borne in mind.  There will be cases (if, for instance, there is a history of domestic or family abuse) where it would be unsafe to the child or the parent for the wider family to be involved in the life of the child, or even made aware of the existence of the child.  There will be cases where cultural or religious considerations may materially impact on the issue of disclosure.  There will be further cases where the mental health or wellbeing of the parent or parents may be imperilled if disclosure were to be ordered, and this may weigh heavy in the evaluation.  But in exercising judgment &#8211; whether that be by the local authority, adoption agency or court &#8211; I am clear that the wider family should not simply be ignored on the say-so of a parent.  Generally, the ability and/or willingness of the wider family to provide the child with a secure environment in which to grow (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>(f)(ii) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> ) should be carefully scrutinised, and the option itself should be "fully explored" (see [28]).  The approach taken by Sumner J in the Birmingham case more than a decade ago, to the effect that "cogent and compelling" grounds should exist before the court could endorse an arrangement for the despatch of public law proceedings while the wider family remained ignorant of the existence of the child (see [29] above), remains, in my judgment, sound.  This approach is in keeping with the key principles of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> that children are generally best looked after within their own family, save where that outcome is not consistent with their welfare, and that a care order on a plan for adoption is appropriate only where no other course is possible in the child's interests (see Re B (A child) and Re B-S). </p>

While there is a risk that he may feel abandoned or let down by a family unable or unwilling to claim him, I am of the view that it is better for H if he is adopted that he knows they were aware of his situation and considered it than they lived in ignorance of him. In my judgment the worst outcome for H is that he would learn, many years down the line, that his father was too awkward or ashamed or embarrassed to reveal his existence to his family, and that the court &#8211; without cogent or compelling reason &#8211; condoned arrangements to keep his birth a secret from those who would have had an interest in him and might actually have claimed him. </p>

In those cases, the local authority, adoption agency and the court seek to maintain the co-operation of the parent in making consensual arrangements for the child (a key feature of the decision in Z County Council v R (Holman J)) which is greatly to the child's advantage." </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.27in">&#8220;The Local Authority is of the view that there are no other alternative care options for the L twins through which to establish permanency save for adoption. The local authority considers that, given the circumstances surrounding their conception and the implications for her family life with her husband and children in Poland, the mother&#8217;s clearly expressed wish to place the twins for adoption should be respected. The local authority is satisfied that, based upon the account provided by the mother, there is no realistic prospect of identifying the biological father of the twins and, in any event, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/19" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19</ref> of the Adoption and Children Act 2020, his consent is not required. The complicating factor is the mother&#8217;s marriage and the fact that her husband is the legal, though not biological, father of the children. His consent must therefore be given if the adoption is to proceed, unless the court declares that notification and consent are not necessary in the particular circumstances of this case. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.27in">The local authority is sympathetic to the mother&#8217;s fears regarding the breakdown of her relationship with her husband and the potential loss of her relationships and contact with her children. The local authority considers that these are realistically foreseeable consequences of the mother&#8217;s husband discovering her infidelity and the existence of the twins and that it is reasonable for the mother to hold these fears. If the husband had to be informed of the twins&#8217; birth the consequences for the mother could be catastrophic and lifelong. Furthermore, the local authority does not envisage that informing the husband would be of any benefit to the twins as it would seem highly unlikely that he will want to claim them and bring them up as his own children. On the contrary, it would seem likely that the husband would concur with the mother&#8217;s wish that they should be placed for adoption. &#8220; </p>

This means that he does not have parental responsibility for the twins.  Bearing in mind all the circumstances of the case and the statute and case law that has been presented to me, I find that the exceptionality criterion is satisfied in an individual fact (lack of biological paternity) and &#8216;holistic&#8217; sense. I have decided therefore that the local authority&#8217;s application can and should be granted.  </span></p>
