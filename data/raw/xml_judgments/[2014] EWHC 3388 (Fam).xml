	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with the future of ED, born on 27 June 2012, and who is therefore aged two and a quarter.  If any case illustrates the momentous and very difficult nature of the decisions that have to be made in the Family Division it is this one.  My decision will determine whether ED grows up in the Czech Republic, where full respect will be paid to his Czech Roma ethnicity and where it is likely that the parental link will be maintained, or whether he grows up in the United Kingdom as an English boy to become, in adulthood, an Englishman.  On this latter footing, being realistic, his Czech Roma heritage will either be extinguished or reduced to insignificance.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This challenging dilemma with which I am faced is reflected by the choices I am presented with which are as follows.  First, the case of the Local Authority supported by the children&#8217;s guardian is that I should make a care order and a placement for adoption order.  This is what the care plan says.  The care plan, as written, does not contemplate placement with the current foster parents where ED has been living for about two years, for almost all of his life.  The relevant part of the care plan is found in section D at page 26 at paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 which read in part as follows: </p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;It is proposed that ED is placed for adoption in the UK.  Every attempt would be made for the placement to reflect and promote ED&#8217;s Czech Roma heritage.  ED is currently placed in a foster home that meets his needs.  As soon as a placement order is made a search would start for an adoptive home.  This would be time limited in terms of an exact cultural match.  The Local Authority has placed a time limit of three months in order to prevent delay.  If no exact match has been found within that time then the search would be widened to include families who are not an exact cultural match but would be willing actively to promote his Czech Roma heritage in every possible way.  If, after a further three months, no family has been identified ED would remain with his current carers.&#8221;  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It can therefore be seen that, according to the care plan, for ED to remain with his current carers would be only the default position if no suitable other adopters could be found.  If other suitable adopters could be found it is realistic to assume that they would not be in a position to promote his Czech Roma ethnicity.  Indeed a document that I have seen demonstrates that in the whole of England and Wales on the adoption register there is one single Czech couple offering to stand as adopters.  Some mention has been made during the case of the possibility of adoption by an English family, I think, who have previously adopted a Roma boy but scarcely any details of that were given to me and I believe that this again was confined to one single couple.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the other extreme it is the parents&#8217; proposal that the care proceedings be dismissed and ED be returned to them to live with them in the Czech Republic in the town of Novy Ji&#265;in with ED&#8217;s full sister, LD, (born 13 September 2013).  This plan is supported by the Social Services department in Novy Ji&#265;in and by the family&#8217;s psychotherapist there Leona Hozova.  The social worker from Novy Ji&#265;in, Pavla Polakova, and the psychotherapist, Leona Hozova, are confident that with formal supervision any risks to ED, and for that matter to baby LD, can be averted.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In between these two poles are two further choices which I outline as follows.  First, in the report of the guardian it is stated that the current foster parents, who are aged 55 and 59, would, notwithstanding their previous significations, be very happy to take on the permanent care of ED.  Unsettlingly, at least from my perspective, these foster parents have been described as elderly.  It was thought that they had decided to retire from fostering, they having seen many children successfully through to adulthood, some of whom they have adopted and in respect of some of whom they have stood as special guardians.  However, in the guardian&#8217;s report at E52, paragraph 4 it says this: </p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;The placement is very stable and can be ongoing.  The carers wish to continue to care for ED and are willing to offer him permanent care if he is to remain separate from his parents and is able to stay in the UK.   This is a change from last year when I saw ED with them but clearly they have become very attached to him.&#8221;</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_6">
	    <num>6.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Special guardianship of course endows the guardian with super-parental responsibility but does not formally extinguish the parental responsibility of the parents which lies fallow in a sort of symbolic state.  It does allow an application to be made by the parents for contact, as indeed does an adoption order, although an order for contact post-adoption is a rare creature indeed.  The foster parents here are well aware of what special guardianship entails.  The advantage of a special guardianship order in favour of the foster parents is the continuity of the placement in circumstances where, as I have just said, for almost all of his life ED has been with them and he loves them and they love him and where it is an accepted tenet of psychology that within the first two years of a child&#8217;s life most of his or her vital attachments are formed. And so there is a great advantage in the perpetuation of the status quo.  There is also the fact that under a special guardianship order the parental link and the connection to ED&#8217;s ethnicity would not be broken.  The mother has had contact in the current placement and I see no reason, if this choice were adopted, why that should not continue and indeed if it were to continue that contact could expand to involve baby LD also, so that ED can be aware of and, to a limited extent, forge a relationship with his full sibling.  It is noteworthy, in my judgment, that a comparable arrangement was made and approved by the guardian and formalised and approved by me in relation to ED&#8217;s half-siblings, B and K.</p>

	    <num>7.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second intermediate choice is that ED is placed in foster care in the Czech Republic.  This has only lately come to the fore.  In a letter dated 23 October 2013 which is at section F, page 35, the Office for International Legal Protection of Children in Brno in the Czech Republic, which is the central authority for the Czech Republic, stated at paragraph 3(b) as follows: </p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;The immediate care arrangements would depend on the court decision.  The preferable way would be to place ED to foster care but according to a low number of the foster here in the Czech Republic it is expectable that ED would be placed to the institutional care.  The contact arrangements of the minor with his parents would depend on the consideration of the court.&#8221;  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, the independent social worker, Eva Gregory, got the idea, which seems to have gained some traction, that a placement with foster parents in the Czech Republic is achievable only with parental consent.  In her report at section E, page 48, at paragraph 5.8 she said this: </p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;It is difficult to see how ED can be placed in a setting away from his parents in the Czech Republic unless this is done with parental consent and knowing the particular circumstances it is unlikely that such a step will be achieved with the parental agreement.  The mother mentions that she would be willing for ED to be fostered in the Czech Republic but in practice it is difficult to achieve and maintain this.  ED clearly needs a placement where his security is promoted and where he feels he can belong on a permanent basis.  In view of the parents&#8217; wish that ED live with them as part of a family any other substitute will not meet their wishes and aspirations.&#8221;  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is now plain that both of these assertions, namely the assertion by the central authority, and the belief of Eva Gregory are wrong.  I have been told, and this has not been challenged, by the two Czech witnesses, the social worker, Pavla Polakova and the psychotherapist, Leona Hozova, that there are, in the Czech Republic, plenty of foster parents available who are Slavic couples with the experience of bringing up Roma children.  Further, it has been stated to me that a placement in with foster parents is not subject to any kind parental consent or veto.  That has been confirmed to me by a Czech judge, Magistrate&#160;Kanova, a magistrate who sits in Novy Ji&#265;in, as a correct statement of Czech law, she having sat in on the evidence given by video link from Brno which I will elaborate on later.  I will also deal later with the necessary legal mechanics if I go down this route.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background this case is to be found in my fact finding judgment of 30 November 2012 to be found in section A at page 53.  I do not repeat it here.  Suffice to say that I found the father, Stefan D, to be guilty of truly bestial conduct.  I recorded his conviction in the year 2000 in the Czech Republic of offences of the utmost seriousness involving the gross abuse and exploitation of women and girls.  I found how, after his arrival in the UK, he meted out appalling domestic violence to his wife, Daniella D.  I found how he engaged in serious criminal activity, largely centred around illegal drugs.  I described how I was satisfied that he had seduced his 16 year old stepdaughter by plying her with drugs; how he had had unprotected sex with her; and how she became pregnant by September 2011 when she was only 17 years of age.  I recorded how this sexual congress took place in the family home to the knowledge of the other minor children there, B and K.  I recorded how he was even having sexual intercourse in the same time-frame with his wife as he was with his stepdaughter.  I found that the statutory threshold in section 31 of the Children Act had been comprehensively crossed, both in respect of past harm and the risk of future harm.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The later developments in the story are recounted in my second judgment dated 18 December 2013 which is at section A, page 150.  I recounted how, by Christmas 2012, so that is very shortly after my first judgment, the mother had rekindled her relationship with the father, if it had ever ended; became pregnant by him again; and as a result baby LD was born, as I have said, on 13 September 2013.   Since Christmas 2012 mainly and since the birth of baby LD fully the mother and father have lived together in Novy Ji&#265;in.  When pregnant with baby LD the mother was in England from time to time for contact and no doubt in order to meet with her solicitors.  It emerged in the present hearing that in about April 2013, whilst the mother was in England, the father cheated on her, as she put it in her oral evidence.  It subsequently emerged from the father when he gave evidence by video link that he had been consorting with a 19 year old prostitute.  To say that this cast doubt on his assertions of reformation, repentance and rehabilitation would be an understatement.  His own explanation for this conduct was merely, &#8220;She was away and I am a man.&#8221;  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason I am conducting this hearing today in September 2014 is because I have been ordered to do so by the Court of Appeal.  My decision of 18 December 2013 was that a Czech court would be better placed to hear this case and in consequence of that decision I issued a formal request under Article 15 of Brussels II Revised Council Regulation No 2201/2003.  That formal request sought the agreement of the Czech court to hear this case to its conclusion.  My decision of 18 December 2013 was overturned by the Court of Appeal on 21 February 2014 and that is to be found in section A, page 167.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is necessary for me to make reference to aspects of the judgments of the Court of Appeal, if only to clarify matters.  The Court of Appeal decided that my decision was flawed as I had allowed the consideration of ED&#8217;s Czech nationality to dominate my thinking to the exclusion of any proper consideration of the second and third questions formulated in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v JLB </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 FLR 517" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 FLR 517</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>(see paragraph 45 of Lord Justice Ryder&#8217;s judgment).  It was said by him at paragraph 31 of his judgment that the practical considerations which I had identified at paragraph 40 of my judgment of 18 December 2013 were equally matched by the merit of judicial continuity.  Notwithstanding that equal balance which I had ultimately decided in favour of a transfer request, Lord Justice Ryder held at paragraph 46 that the issue should have been decided in favour of a continuance of the case here.  In his judgment Lord&#160;Justice Lewison suggested that in making my decision I had given expression to some kind of secret agenda or inherent hostility to the making of a care order with an adoption plan.  </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">    If in fact I gave too much weight to the matter of nationality as a connecting factor under the first question it cannot be disputed that it certainly had to be given some weight.  However, the Court of Appeal decision affords this factor no weight at all.  Instead it merely balances the factor of judicial continuity with the practical considerations and, notwithstanding that they were found to be evenly balanced, my decision to seek a transfer was overturned.  This is very hard to follow.  </p>

No material from the fact finding hearing has featured in this case other than my judgment.  My judgment has been treated as the alpha to omega of the past proceedings.  Unquestionably another judge could have conducted this hearing in exactly the same way that I did.  I did not reach for any unwritten nuances or impressions as referred to by Lord Justice Ryder at paragraph 27.  In my previous judgment I stated that the advantage of me conducting the hearing would be marginal.  With the benefit of actual experience I would say that I have had no such advantage.  By contrast, even though Lord Justice Ryder thought in his final sentence of paragraph 31 that, &#8220;In a world where the use of information technology is a commonplace the physical location of a professional witness is rarely likely to be decisive&#8221; the experience of this case showed that this too was a misplaced view.  </p>

I lost the chance in this case in respect of the three crucial witnesses from the Czech Republic to assess their demeanour.  All the vital evidence from the Czech Republic had to be professionally translated.  The translator gave a heroic performance but the exercise was completely unsatisfactory leaving me again unable, because of translation, to judge these important witnesses&#8217; demeanour.  The father also gave his evidence by video link or for much of the time only by audio link, again translated.  It was very difficult for me to judge him in the way that I am required to do so.  </p>

The first witness was Janet Kavanagh, senior social worker employed by the Local Authority.  She had made a number of statements, four statements, which I have read carefully and she gave oral evidence.  In her oral evidence she pointed out, correctly in my judgment, that within the professional involvement with the family, particularly with the father, by the professionals in the Czech Republic there had been little, if any, recognition of past conduct as found by me or a willingness to address it.  She felt that the investigations and assessments made by her Czech counterparts were superficial and very much based on the here and now.  In fact she told me that if it were not for the concerns of Nottingham City Council it is hard to see, in her judgment, how her counterparts in the Czech Republic would have held any concerns at all concerning the upbringing of baby LD in Novy Ji&#265;in.  She accepted that she had no concerns in respect of the mother&#8217;s parenting.  It was within the dynamic of her relationship with the father, who is 20 years older than mother, that her concerns arose.  She accepted that there was no evidence of domestic violence or other dysfunction and that by all standard measurements baby LD was thriving.  </p>

I agree with the observation made by Mrs Moss who gave evidence on behalf of the guardian that she presented in a flat and almost depressed way.  She had the hallmarks of a damaged person which is hardly surprising given the circumstances of the formation of her relationship with the father and the consequences of it, being the loss or near loss of almost all her vital relationships, namely with her mother, her half-siblings, B and K, and her son, ED.  She spoke of her commitment to work with the Czech social worker and the psychotherapist.  She accepted the shameful circumstances of the formation of her relationship with the father.  She revealed without prompting during her evidence in chief his infidelity - but she did not reveal that it was with a prostitute - and said that if that if that recurred she would leave him, just as she would if he harmed her or baby LD.  She acknowledged, but only up to a point, my findings of domestic violence meted out to her mother although she did not accept the scale or the frequency of the violence as found by me.  For example she rejected my findings in paragraphs 15 and 16 of my fact finding judgment about the abduction of Daniella to the woods and the shearing of her hair.</p>

She was a highly intelligent and articulate witness but was hampered by her limited contact with the mother and her total absence of contact with the father.  She produced three reports which I read carefully.  Her principal theme in her evidence was that there should have been more collaborative communication between the two sets of Social Services.  In her judgment far more could have been revealed by direct communication and I would say parenthetically that this was reinforced by Mr Hradilek, the chef de mission of the Czech Embassy, who has attended this hearing throughout, in his remarks to me at the conclusion of the hearing.  Eva Gregory concluded that there was no evidence that whilst this couple had been living in the Czech Republic and since the birth of baby LD things had gone wrong, although in this regard she overlooked the father&#8217;s liaison with the 19 year old prostitute.  She was sure that some things had changed and that some had improved and she believed that if ED was returned to the Czech Republic the Czech authorities would be there to take action to protect him.  She returned to the witness box after Leona Hozova had given evidence and she accepted under cross-examination that the father had a long way to go in recognising and addressing his past. </p>

He told her that he rejects my findings of domestic violence meted out to his wife, Daniella D, although, in contrast to what he told me at the fact finding hearing, he accepted that he was actually and properly guilty of the criminal offences in respect of which he was sentenced in the Czech Republic in the year 2000.

Subsequently the mother of minors Ms M returned back to the Czech Republic, where she gave birth to minor LD on 13.09.2013.

The Authority for Social and Legal Child Protection does not have any objections to his care.  The father is looking after the daughter together with her mother, at the times when the mother of minors is in England to take care of matter of minor ED, he looks after the daughter on his own.  By questioning the police, the Authority for Social and Legal Protection verified that there is no criminal conviction against the father of the minors, we do not have any official knowledge about the father leading dishonest life.

However, I did agree with her when she said that if it were to be suggested that identity was as important as safety then she would not agree.  She said in relation to ED that he is very securely attached to his current foster parents but she asserted that for children of that age they can easily transfer their attachments to another carer.  Again I am not sure that that conforms with current thinking or indeed classic psychological thinking, if my memory of the pronouncements of Freud is anything to go by.  She stated that a special guardianship order certainly had benefits but there would be with that arrangement a constant risk of the placement being undermined.</p>

First, I reject the proposal by the mother that these proceedings be dismissed and ED be returned to her and the father in the Czech Republic.  That is manifestly not in his interests.  Such a placement back with his parents would be replete with far too many risks in circumstances where the father categorically rejects the majority of the previous findings made in this case.  He plainly cannot confront his demons until he has identified his demons.  The same is true to a lesser extent in relation to the mother.  If these parents were living here it is inconceivable that ED would be returned to them.  That they are in the Czech Republic surely makes no difference.   If a corollary of this finding by me is that I must conclude that baby LD should not be with her parents while deep professional work is done the first base of which is a full acceptance of the wrongdoing the father has done both to Daniella and to the mother, then I do not shrink from expressing that corollary.  </p>

One might ask: why are we so out of step with the rest of Europe?  One might have thought if it was obvious that forced adoption was the gold standard the rest of Europe would have hastened to have adopted it.  The relevance of this aspect of the case is surely obvious.  This case, as I have demonstrated, could very easily have been tried in the Czech Republic.  It was a fortuity that it was not.  Had it been so tried there the orders sought by the Local Authority could not have been made.  I accept, of course, that I must apply the law of England exclusively but in so doing the unique irrevocability of the orders sought has to play a prominent part in my judgment.</p>

If I were to do this it could not be under a care order.  It is trite law confirmed by a decision of the House of Lords that once a care order is made all subsequent decisions concerning placement of the child are delegated to the Local Authority without interference from the court.  The only role the court has thereafter is in relation to contact.  Therefore if I were to go down this route it would have to be outside the care proceedings; those proceedings would have to come to an end and wardship proceedings would have to be commenced.  The order placing ED with Czech foster parents would be a judgment made in wardship proceedings and such a judgment would be enforceable under Articles 21 and 23 of Brussels II Revised and under Article 23 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  However, the judgment could only be enforced in the Czech Republic provided that Article 56 had been complied with (see Article 23(g) of Brussels II Revised).  </p>

However, once such foster carer is found in the register of the authorities of the Czech Republic and is found suitable for the particular child the Office will inform the British court about this situation.  Then the British court, if satisfied, will announce to the Office that it is going to issue the order in respect of the foster care.  Consequently the office will provide its consent that is necessary for the proceedings under Article 56 of the Regulation.  Finally, the British court will order the foster care in its decision in respect of the particular foster carer.  The British court has to announce in its order to what particular foster carer the child is placed to the foster care and provide all details.  Then the foster carer can pick up the child and travel with him on the basis of the order and will travel with the child to the Czech Republic where the child will later on be habitually resident.&#8221;  </p>

I reject the argument made for the Local Authority by Mrs Rowley, and by Mr Veitch for the guardian, that this solution is replete with risks because the Czech court might return ED to his parents.  If I might respectfully say so it is a highly chauvinistic, almost neo-colonial sentiment.  If the Czech court does return ED to his parents it will be after a full hearing with the child represented by a guardian.  Plainly there can be no serious suggestion made that the Czech court would not, in any hearing, properly promote the interests of ED.
