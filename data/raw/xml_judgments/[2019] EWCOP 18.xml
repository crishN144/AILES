	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In this matter I am concerned with a decision of the utmost gravity in relation to P. Namely, whether this court should declare that P lacks capacity to make decisions regarding clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (hereafter CANH).  In circumstances where the court concludes that P lacks capacity to decide for herself whether or not to continue to receive CANH, the applicant invites the court to consent on P&#8217;s behalf to the withdrawal of that treatment, a step that will result in her death.  In considering these applications, at all times P remains at the centre of the court&#8217;s decision making process (see <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree University Hospitals NHS Trust v James</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 591" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 591</ref> per Baroness Hale). </p>

The applicant is responded to by the Official Solicitor acting as litigation friend for P and by TD, P&#8217;s eldest daughter.  Both the Official solicitor and TD support the application.  Given the <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> limited geographical area covered by the CCG in this case, it is my intention to anonymise the identity of the CCG, and of the treating doctors in this case in order to avoid &#8216;jigsaw&#8217; identification of P and her family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In this case, as I have recounted, there is no dispute between applicant, the Official Solicitor and the family about the correct course of action. However, given certain contrary views expressed by the dedicated staff who now care for P and the neutral position taken by her treating clinicians in this case, the applicant made the decision to bring this matter before the court.  Within this context, and whilst this application proceeds unopposed by all parties to it, I consider it appropriate to deliver a fully reasoned judgment given the particular circumstances of this case and the profound significance of the decision this court is now charged with taking.  </p>

Within this context, and in circumstances where (a) the best interests test contains a strong element of substituted judgment that accepts that the preferences of the person concerned are an important component in deciding where her best interests lie, (b) both P&#8217;s past and present wishes and feelings, and the beliefs and values (not limited to religious beliefs but also what was important to her, how that affected her view of the world) that would be likely to influence her decision are relevant and (c) the court must also look beyond those beliefs and values by considering any other factors that would have been likely to have influenced her in making the decision about whether to continue to receive CANH, it is important to consider the background in some detail.   </p>

She also loved talking to people and her family describe her, affectionately, as a person who was outgoing and enjoyed being the centre of attention.  Within this context, her family describe her as someone who was the &#8216;life and soul&#8217; of any party or family gathering.

In 2001 P and NG moved abroad, returning to this jurisdiction in 2003. They separated in December 2003.  Following the separation NG states that their relationship was reasonable, although not always so, and they remained in contact.  Following their separation, P and NG shared care of TD, with her spending weekends with NG and weeks with P.  This arrangement changed in 2009, when TD went to live permanently with NG following P moving to a different town. </p>

The evidence before the court indicates that P commenced a relationship with a man who had overcome intravenous drug use. Tragically, he was seriously injured, suffering a traumatic brain injury that required him to be placed on life support.  P was involved in the decision to terminate his life support.  Her family consider that she found this upsetting.  This sad event has taken on renewed significance in the context of these proceedings.  At a best interests meeting concerning P held on 5 June 2014, her own mother, in commenting that P would not want to live in the circumstances that by then pertained also for her, provided details:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following this difficult period, P entered another relationship, which association her family describe as &#8220;toxic&#8221;, her then partner being a heavy drinker.  He died of a methadone overdose in 2011 or 2012.  During the course of that relationship, P had another daughter, S. P was described by her family of being incredibly proud of S and of idolising her youngest daughter.  Following this difficult period, P moved once again, to be close to her own mother, HS. During this period she had contact with TD approximately three times per week.  TD describes her and her mother as talking to each other more like friends than mother and daughter.  TD considers that this period was the beginning of her mother&#8217;s descent into drug and alcohol use.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The evidence before the court suggests that P began drinking to excess and taking illicit drugs in or around 2013.  On 1 April 2014 P took an overdose of heroin. She was 42 years old. TD was 19 years old and S was 5 years old.  As a result of her drug overdose, P suffered cardiorespiratory arrest and, in turn, a severe hypoxic brain injury.   Initially, the diagnosis made by Dr H, a Consultant in Neurological Rehabilitation Medicine, on 23 May 2014 was one of a vegetative state.  At best interests meetings held on 5 June 2014 and 16 June 2014, the clinical team concluded that it was too early to be sure whether P&#8217;s condition would improve, although the prospects were considered to be very poor. Within this context, with respect to best interests decision making, during the course of this initial period following P&#8217;s hypoxic brain injury, clinicians considered that it was premature to arrive at a longterm determination about her best interests in terms of continuing or withdrawing CANH.  Having regard to the analysis this court is required now to undertake, and as I noted above, very early on P&#8217;s own mother, HS, indicated at a best interests meeting on 5 June 2014 that P would not want to live in the circumstances in which she then found herself. </p>

The home endeavours to improve the quality of life for all its residents, each of whom have very severe neurological disabilities.  It is clear from the evidence before this court that the ethos of the Unit is about making the most of the lives of each individual labouring under neurological disability and endeavouring to maximise their potential.  Within this context, a number of the staff at the Unit have made clear within the context of these proceedings that they have a strong &#8216;pro-life&#8217; (their term) ethos.</p>

As I have noted, initially, the diagnosis made by Dr H on 23 May 2014 was one of a vegetative state.   However, in December 2014, P was noted to display clear evidence of responses at greater than reflex level incompatible with a diagnosis of vegetative state, so the diagnosis was revised to that of minimally conscious state (hereafter MCS).  Within the foregoing context, as Mr Horne QC for the Official Solicitor rightly submits, this court must recognise and engage with the fact that, over this period, there has been at times a difference of opinion as to P&#8217;s level of awareness. </p>

First, because the staff at the Unit considered that P felt pain, laughed, grimaced, and reacted, despite her all-encompassing dependence.  Second, staff felt that any decision to discontinue CANH in relation to P could apply equally to all patients at the Unit.  More generally, Ms PL (Clinical Lead at the Unit) told Dr Pinder that in stating that both she and her staff would not want CANH withdrawn, she stated that this was not particularly because they felt it was against the best interests, but because &#8220;&#8230; they are all &#8216;pro-life&#8217; in general and do not agree with actively doing anything that is likely to shorten someone&#8217;s life.&#8221;  Amongst the staff more widely, opposition to any withdrawal of CANH from P tended to involve general objections in principle to withdrawing CANH from a patient like P, a desire to continue caring for her and reluctance to be involved personally in the withdrawal, but also included opposition on the basis of the quality of P&#8217;s life.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Official Solicitor has also explored further the family&#8217;s views regarding the continuation of life sustaining treatment for P.  As I have noted, P&#8217;s mother, HS, made some clear statements to staff prior to her own death in 2017, including that &#8220;this isn&#8217;t P &#8211; P wouldn&#8217;t want this.&#8221;  Staff at the Unit have suggested that HS&#8217;s views may have changed over time, PL reporting that:  </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;HS seemed glad treatment had not in fact been withdrawn.  She made comments about this on several occasions.  [Staff] had many in-depth conversations with HS during the last 18 months of life and she appeared to remain of the view that P&#8217;s care and treatment should continue&#8221;. </p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">However, whilst agreeing that HS became more accepting of treatment, other staff were not sure that she had actually changed her mind about its withdrawal.  Both TD and LD consider that HS did not change her mind.  TD stated that during the last year of her life HS would say things like &#8220;I saw your mum it is awful to see [her] like that&#8221;.  LD goes further, telling Mr Beck that it is her belief that if HS had known that she was going to die so soon, she would have taken P with her in a mercy killing.  This information is also verified by TD in her statement.  Both suggest that the Unit were aware of this and implemented a safety plan that ensured that HS was alone with P for the last year of her life.  There is no independent corroboration of this assertion before the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The evidence before the court, including the account of the investigations undertaken by the Official Solicitor, indicates that TD has been entirely consistent in her view that her mother is not the person she was and that P herself would not want to live in her current condition through the continuation of life sustaining treatment.  TD has placed consistent reliance upon P&#8217;s actions and reaction to the withdrawal of treatment from her former partner as evidence of what P herself would have wanted. I also note, within the context of the evidence before the court that P was extremely conscious of her appearance during her lifetime, that Ms CR reports that TD was initially unhappy to find that the Unit took her mother out as she did not like people seeing her mother in the condition she was, TD explaining that:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Within this context, it was clear from the brief submission that she made to the court that TD now sees an unbridgeable gulf lying between the mother she knew prior to April 2014 and the situation she now sees when she visits P.  TD told me that her mother is &#8220;not a person anymore&#8221; and that &#8220;I know she would not have wanted this&#8221;.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">LD has likewise not wavered in her belief that P herself would want CANH withdrawn. LD now cares for P&#8217;s younger daughter, S.  A clear factor in LD&#8217;s thinking is the belief that P would not have wanted the current situation to be impacting upon S in the way it is.  LD reports that S appears to have found visits to her mother increasingly upsetting and an ordeal.  Within this context, LD reports that, for the last two years, S has not wanted to go as it makes her sad.  Within this context, LD states that: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;&#8230; as things are she doesn't feel that S is able to properly enjoy life. S seems to feel she's betraying P by showing affection and love to others. She refers to LD's husband has her "dad" and will refer to LD as her "mum" but at times she appears to feel guilty about calling LD her mum and will say that P is her mother. LD feels that the current situation is stopping S from moving on with her life. She described it as not a normal situation. S is going to high school in September and LD feel she needs a fresh start&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">LD considers that P would not have wanted S to experience these emotions.  Given her age, S has not been asked her views.  It is apparent from the evidence before me that that she keeps saying that she wants her mum back to cuddle, to take her to the park, to tell her things; she wants her old mum back. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The evidence before this court indicated that once CANH is withdrawn from P it is likely that a period of a few days will pass before P dies.  Within this context, P&#8217;s death would be managed with the aim of seeking to ensure her end is dignified, in an environment where she could be given appropriate palliative care with the aim of preventing any discomfort during the process.  Dr Pinder&#8217;s report makes clear however, that it is impossible to exclude the chance that, notwithstanding such measures, P could suffer some discomfort. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, it is unfortunate that the applicant has not provided the Official Solicitor and the court with an end of life care plan outlining in detail the steps that will occur if the Court authorises the withdrawal of CANH.  This situation arises within the context of the staff at the Unit not wishing to engage in a planning process until the outcome of this hearing is known and they have had a chance to consider whether they would be prepared to offer end of life care to P in the event the court authorised withdrawal of treatment.  In the circumstances, if permission is granted for that course of action to be taken, P will need to be moved from the Unit (although it would appear that there are some staff who consider that if CANH is to be removed they would wish to care for P in her final days).  Given P&#8217;s limited awareness of her surroundings, the move to new surroundings is unlikely to be a significant detriment to her.  Within this context, no end of life care plan has yet been compiled and the court is accordingly invited by the parties to make an &#8216;in principle&#8217; decision with permission to the parties to apply in the event of any disagreement over the care plan arrived at. </p>

It is likewise important that the evidence of care staff as to the existence of behaviours should be given due consideration in circumstances where they, ordinarily, spend more time with a patient than do family members.  Against this however, the question for the court is not whether those behaviours are displayed, but rather whether any such behaviours denote a level of awareness or are merely reflex in nature.

Within this context, Dr Pinder considers that there is no response from P that could be interpreted consistently as being above the level of reflex and, having regard to her responses, P&#8217;s awareness of the world around her will be very limited with long periods where she has no awareness at all.  Dr Pinder is clear that P&#8217;s sensory input will be disordered, that she has no significant functional movement and that it is not possible to determine experience of pleasure or pain.   There is nothing in the evidence with respect to Dr H&#8217;s views that calls these conclusions into question.  Whilst I have borne in mind the observations of the staff at the Unit, having regard to the nature and extent of his assessment, and to the other evidence before the court, I am satisfied that Dr Pinder&#8217;s assessment of P should be accepted by the court and I do so.

Second, the RCP&#8217;s 2013 PDOC Guidelines state that formal structural assessments should be undertaken three to five years after the onset of brain injury.  Third, in this case, the last of the twenty-four WHIM assessments undertaken by the Community Brain Injury </p>

Against this however, the Official Solicitor submits that Dr Pinder is clear in his opinion that a further longitudinal functional assessment is not likely to give any further information that would lead to an alternative diagnosis, or as to P&#8217;s current level of awareness, enjoyment of life or whether she experiences pain or discomfort.  In addition, the Official Solicitor points to the fact that the detailed notes from the Unit do not suggest any improvement of significance in the last two years.  In this context, I note that at the best interests meeting of 11 October 2017, Dr H concluded that P&#8217;s &#8220;condition is not going to improve; she is vulnerable to fits, chest infections and potential future health complications and cognitively won&#8217;t get any better.&#8221;  Further, when Dr Pinder undertook his own WHIM assessment on 12 October 2018, P displayed only five behaviours, the most advanced of which was looking at a person briefly.  That score is considerably below the score of twenty-six on various occasions in 2015 and 2016. Finally, when pressed by the Official Solicitor to provide an estimate of the &#8216;best realistic case&#8217; for P, in his letter of 30 April 2019 Dr Pinder describes the prospects of any significant improvement as &#8220;negligible&#8221;.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is not necessary for the court to order further longitudinal assessment before determining this matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within the foregoing context, Dr Pinder and Dr H, consider that P has an &#8220;impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> MCA.  The Official Solicitor accepts that evidence and there is no evidence before the court that contradicts this conclusion.  Further, both Dr H and Dr Pinder agree that in her MCS P is &#8220;unable&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss.2</ref> and 3  of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> to decide whether to continue receiving CANH.

Dr Pinder likewise considers that the overriding factor in the best interests assessment is her previously expressed wish that she would not want to live in her current condition.  I agree for the following reasons. </p>

However, having regard to the matters set out above, I am satisfied that when speaking of the termination of her former partner&#8217;s life support P did make clear that she would not want to be left in such a condition if anything happened to her and that she commented that &#8220;if it ever happened to me I would not want to be a cabbage.&#8221; I am also satisfied that P told TD that &#8220;she wouldn't leave someone like that and she wouldn't do that to a dog&#8221;. As well as repeating this view to LD, in speaking to LD and her other cousins, I accept that P participated in a conversation in which they all agreed that it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to leave someone living &#8220;like that.&#8221; The evidence about P&#8217;s statements when confronted with the stark consequences of her former partner&#8217;s catastrophic brain injury is broadly consistent as between TD and LD. No one seeks to gainsay the evidence of TD or LD on this point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In terms of strength with which P&#8217;s views were expressed, I have further had regard to the fact that, within the context of HS and TD being told whilst P was still an inpatient that there was a 99% chance that she would either die without improving, stay the way she was or improve slightly to a state which was one step up from a vegetative state, P&#8217;s previously stated views were relayed to treating clinicians very soon after April 2014.  As I have noted, HS raised P&#8217;s views as early as the first best interests meeting on 5 June 2014, and those views have been repeated outside of formal meetings to staff members.  In this respect, I have also had regard to the fact that these statements were made by P in the face of a similar situation that had befallen a loved one. P&#8217;s wishes in this regard were expressed in circumstances where she was said to have been involved in making a decision about whether her former partner should be allowed to die or live in a situation similar (although not identical) to that in which she now finds herself.   </p>

As I have noted above, P is described as having been &#8216;life and soul&#8217; of every family event and conscious of her appearance and presentation. Whilst raised in the Catholic faith she did not practice that religion as an adult.  These matters further reinforce my conclusions as to the nature and strength of P&#8217;s expressed views regarding being kept alive in a moribund state. I am further satisfied within this context that the court can properly infer that the loss of the ability to communicate, to socialise, to sing and dance, or to return to her active vivacious self, would all have had a profound negative impact upon P and would have informed her decision making on the issue now before the court. </p>

Permitting S to move on with her life rather than to experience the upset of repeated visits over the next three to five years would, I am satisfied, have been an important additional factor in any decision P made about continuing CANH. With respect to P&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">present </span>wishes and feelings, I accept the submission of Mr Horne that no reliable inference can be drawn from what may be signs of pleasure or pain as to whether P has any present wishes about the continuation of CANH, let alone the nature of her views. </p>

I am satisfied that those expressed views, as summarised above, are consistent with, and reinforced by what they each knew and understood of the wishes expressed by P in this context.  It is also significant in this regard that the views of HS (when alive), TD and LD are, I am satisfied, unanimous in their conclusion that CANH should not be continued in circumstances where I am equally satisfied that the motivation for their views is overwhelmingly that which P herself expressed as wanting in this situation.  A further strong theme in the family&#8217;s own views on this application is that because of her character and values, P herself would have rejected the continuation of CANH. I am satisfied that this is reflective of their understanding of what P believed and who she was before she lost capacity. </p>

They have the advantage of regular contact with P and are in a position to develop a detailed picture of her current presentation.  Against this, they have not had the benefit that the family have had of knowing P when she was capacitous and of seeing and experiencing all of the many varied facets of her character, what she thought, what was dear to her, what she wished for the future and, importantly, what she believed about the situation in which she now finds herself.  Whilst the &#8216;pro-life&#8217; approach (as they themselves describe it) taken by a number of the members of staff in the current situation is a valid point of view, in the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that it is contrary to the clearly expressed view of P before she lost capacity. </p>
