The application was issued on 8 May 2012 by their father (&#8220;F&#8221;) and alleges that the children were wrongfully retained in this country from 23 April 2012 by their mother (&#8220;M&#8221;), she having agreed in writing on 5 April 2012 that they would be returned to France &#8220;during the week-end of 21 and 22 April&#8221; following a two week holiday here.</p>

Judgment was reserved. On 12 April 2012 a reasoned written judgment was provided which awarded residence to F and which provided for contact to M. A certificate pursuant to Annex II of Council Regulation No. 2201/2003 (&#8220;B2R&#8221;) was signed and sealed by the Tribunal on 7 May 2012. </p>

Thus at the time that the application was made to the tribunal it was the court first seised under Art 16. Under Art 10 the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal endures irrespective of even a prolonged period of wrongful removal or retention. And the Order of 12 April 2012 is entitled to recognition and enforcement throughout the EU under Chapter III (Arts 21 &#8211; 36), subject to very limited exceptions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a wealth of authority both from the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Justice that emphasise that it will only be in the most exceptional circumstances that the policy of B2R could be subverted by a refusal to recognise and enforce a parental responsibility order from a fellow member state. Mr Williams has accepted that the only realistic arguments that might be mounted by M on any appeal would be (1) that the brevity of both of the proceedings in, and the judgment of, the Tribunal is contrary to our public policy, and (2) these small children were not &#8220;heard&#8221; by the Tribunal either directly or through a welfare officer. I sensed that he was realistic enough to accept that there was, to say the least, only a very slim chance of either argument succeeding. I am convinced that any appeal would have been disposed of, on argument alone, in no more than two hours.</p>

Pursuant to these orders a Cafcass report was directed, and Mr John Power travelled to Leeds, at considerable expense, and produced a full report. The burdens on Cafcass at this time hardly need to be spelt out. Arrangements were made for M to give evidence by video-link as she is pregnant by her new partner and cannot travel to London. Both parties have been represented by experienced junior counsel on legal aid. The cost to the tax-payer must be very high, and of course two days of precious court time has been allotted to deal with it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If M were to succeed on her defences there would be nothing to stop F the very next day mounting an application to register and enforce the French order, which would, as I have explained above be highly likely to succeed, thus overreaching M&#8217;s successful Hague defence. Indeed, F could alternatively seek a subsequent order from the French court requiring return notwithstanding M&#8217;s success here under Art 11(8) and, if granted, that would be automatically enforceable here without having to invoke the registration/appeal procedure mentioned above (see Arts 40(1)(b) and 42).  So, an adjudication at great expense, and over a considerable period of time, of these Hague defences is shown to be utterly pointless. </p>

Time and again I have been confronted with a similar state of affairs where Hague proceedings have instead been taken. The cost to the tax payer and the demands on court time is heavy indeed. And, as I have sought to explain, the time and money is likely completely wasted. </p>
