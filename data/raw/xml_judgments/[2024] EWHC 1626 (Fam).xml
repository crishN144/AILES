The children&#8217;s parents, who married in 2010, are both American citizens. The mother also has Bahamian nationality. The family home has always been in America and, until their mother unilaterally brought the boys to England on 4 August 2022, none of the family members had any connection with the UK whatsoever.</p>

An agreement was made for joint legal custody, with physical custody being granted to the mother and partial physical custody granted to the father. The divorce was granted in 2018. Thereafter, in 2019 and 2020 there were some difficulties over the contact arrangements. In July 2020 the father applied to modify the custody order. A temporary custody order was made essentially maintaining the previous arrangements. In March 2021 Child and Youth Services [&#8216;the CYS&#8217;] investigated an allegation of abuse by father regarding the eldest boy, but determined that the allegation was &#8220;unfounded&#8221;.</p>

On 6 July 2022 the mother's allegations of sexual abuse against the father, and the father's application relating to the custody arrangements were heard at a one day hearing before Judge Love in the Court of Common Pleas Delaware County, Pennsylvania. During the hearing the judge considered the available evidence, heard oral evidence from each parent, and conducted a process in which she heard evidence from each of the two boys in the presence of the lawyers, but in the absence of their parents.  The children had been tendered by the mother as witnesses. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This court has a full transcript of the hearing before Judge Love. The judgment makes plain that the burden of proof with respect to the sexual abuse allegations was upon the mother &#8220;pursuant to the PFA statute&#8221; [&#8216;Protection from Abuse&#8217;].   Judge Love considered whether the allegations made by the mother &#8220;can be proven with clear and convincing evidence&#8221;.  The case advanced on behalf of the mother and accepted by the First-tier Tribunal (&#8220;FtT&#8221;) in her appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse the claims for international protection was that the standard applied was an intermediate standard which was higher than &#8216;a reasonable degree of likelihood&#8217; and &#8216;a balance of probabilities&#8217;.  For the purposes of these proceedings, the parties have instructed a joint expert, Mr Patrick Scanlon, who has provided an opinion based on his education and experience over several years practice in criminal law, both as a prosecutor and defence attorney in the USA.  In an email he has confirmed the standard of proof for proving abuse in a PFA claim in Delaware County as in the rest of Pennsylvania is the &#8220;preponderance of the evidence&#8221;.  That is, &#8216;more likely than not&#8217;.  Judge Love said:</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;So the court really looked very carefully and very closely, as it is required to do, to determine, one, on the PFA whether petitioners burden of proof has been met pursuant to the PFA statute, and on the custody, what's in the best interests of the children. &#8230;</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">So this court had to make credibility determinations and determine for the PFA whether or not, ma&#8217;am, you have sustained your burden of proof for the entry of a final protection order. And I'm finding that, based upon all of the evidence presented, that you have not sustained that burden of proof. Therefore, I'm vacating the temporary order and dismissing the PFA.&#8221;</p>

On that very same day the mother launched a further allegation of child sexual abuse by the father with respect to both boys, apparently based upon exactly the same evidence, with the CYS. The CYS wrote on 5 August confirming that their investigation was complete and that, once again, the allegations were determined to be &#8220;unfounded&#8221;. However, the previous day, 4th August, the mother had travelled to England with the children. The father had no communication from the mother and had no idea where in the world she had gone, there being no reason to suspect that she might choose the UK as her destination.</p>

Investigations reported in mid-January 2023 that the mother had flown to Heathrow the previous August and, on 17 March 2023, the father issued his application for summary return in this jurisdiction under the 1980 Hague Convention. By mid-April the mother had been located and she made her first appearance before this court on 25 April 2023.</p>

We will turn in due course to give a short procedural account of the various reasons for delay and make observations that are intended to lead to the swifter dispatch of all similar applications in future cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although no precise date has been given, the mother issued an appeal from the Home Office decision to the FtT sometime shortly prior to the father&#8217;s Hague application. Her appeal to the FtT was supported by expert reports from a psychotherapist, an independent social worker and an expert in American family law. The hearing before the FtT took place over the course of two days and the decision of the two judges was promulgated on 25 March 2024. In the course of a judgment which runs to 20 pages, the FtT undertook a careful and detailed analysis of the allegations of domestic abuse to the mother (which were accepted), and sexual abuse to the two boys said to have been perpetrated by the father. While the burden of proving matters was upon the applicant mother, the standard of proof applied by the FtT was lower than the balance of probabilities and lower than that applied by Judge Love in America. The FtT commenced by making their findings on &#8220;the lower standard of a reasonable degree of likelihood&#8221;.</p>

The mother's subsequent applications to the FtT and UTIAC for permission to appeal have been refused. She has therefore exhausted her domestic remedies with respect to gaining lawful permission to remain in this jurisdiction. She is liable to removal to the USA by the Home Office. In his submissions before us, Mr Jarman submitted, initially, that it may be open to the mother to make a further claim for asylum, but on reflection, he submitted it would be open to her to make an application for leave to remain on human rights grounds, outside the immigration rules, inviting the Secretary of State to exercise discretion in favour of the mother and children to regularise their stay in the UK in the event that we decline to make a return order.  </p>

He submitted that the effect of that would be that the current &#8216;unlawful presence&#8217; of the mother and children could be regularised with a grant of leave to remain.   The approach that we have taken to that submission is that an application under the 1980 Hague Convention must be determined on its own merits without the temptation to infer that some future application made to the Secretary of State on some unknown basis might result in the Secretary of State exercising his or her discretion to permit a parent and child who otherwise has no lawful basis to be in the UK, to remain.  As with any claim for international protection, the Secretary of State for the Home Department has sole responsibility for immigration control and the Family Court should not in any way seek to trespass upon or influence matters that fall within the exclusive powers of the Secretary of State.  </p>

They have been represented by CAFCASS Legal and counsel, who have taken their instructions from Ms Baker, the children&#8217;s guardian. At the start of the hearing, an application was made on behalf of their mother for the proceedings to be adjourned so that the children might meet an independent solicitor and, if assessed to be of sufficient competence to give direct instructions, for that solicitor to act on their behalf. In presenting the mother&#8217;s application, Mr Jarman submitted, in circumstances where the children are clearly objecting to any return to the USA, but where their guardian and lawyers would be arguing in favour of a return, that the voice of the children would not be effectively heard in the court process. In addition, Mr Jarman questioned how the children&#8217;s current solicitor could be in a position to assess the children&#8217;s capacity to give direct instructions when that solicitor had never met them and where the guardian had only conducted one in-depth discussion with the boys over a year ago. Finally, Mr Jarman predicted that, if the court were to order the return of the children then the children may instruct their own solicitor to apply to set aside the return order.</p>

Further, in circumstances where the allegations of past abuse have been firmly rejected by the court in the US and by the FtT in this jurisdiction, and yet the children firmly hold to their belief that they have indeed been abused by their father, it was suggested that they may be harmed by being drawn further into this court process and that the children might be less capable of having a separate voice.</p>

Thus, whilst serious complaints are made on behalf of the mother over the procedure and approach adopted by Judge Love in determining that the allegations of sexual abuse were not made out, the mother&#8217;s case before this court is not being prosecuted on the basis that the evidence establishes a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to the children as a result of alleged abusive behaviour by their father, and the court was not taken to any of the detailed material with respect to the allegations.</p>

Where, in a Hague case, there are disputed issues of fact in relation to Art 13(b), the conventional approach is that described by Baroness Hale at paragraph [36] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal) </span>[2011] UKSC 27, so that the court will consider whether, if the allegations were true, they would establish a grave risk under Art 13(b).

Whilst Mr Jarman raised what the mother considers to be substantial criticism as to the soundness of the process conducted by Judge Love, her findings are the findings of the relevant US court and there has been no appeal. This court is in no manner an appeal court from Judge Love, and issues of comity strongly suggest that the findings, and process, of the US court are to be respected in this jurisdiction. We do not, however, approach the issue on the basis of concepts of issue estoppel or strict comity. There is no need to do so for, in addition to Judge Love&#8217;s clear determination, the mother&#8217;s allegations have been held to be &#8216;unfounded&#8217; on a number of occasions by the child protection agency, the CYS, in the US and by the FtT in this jurisdiction adopting a process that is not criticised in any way.</p>

It matters not whether the mother&#8217;s anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response, Mr Richard Harrison KC, for the father, invited the court to keep sight of the bigger picture in this case which includes a father, who has not caused any harm to the children, has had a good relationship with them in earlier times and who had an order for joint custody, by consent, with two overnight stays each week. The current situation has only arisen because of the mother&#8217;s false claims of abuse and her subsequent extreme reaction to the US court and authorities&#8217; rejection of those claims. He submitted that the mother has perpetrated a very serious form of psychological harm on these two boys, which was to be measured at the top end of the scale. Her act of abduction and arrival in a totally foreign country will have been completely bewildering to the children and will have magnified the harm. Mr Harrison drew attention to the evidence of Ms Baker, the children&#8217;s guardian, that serious long-term consequences would ensue for the children if this harm is not addressed. It is the father&#8217;s case that if the children remain in the UK, the harm will simply be perpetuated. There will be delay in accessing therapy that has any prospect of succeeding during a time when the children will, in effect, be left entirely under the influence of their mother, estranged from their father, under a false narrative.  In those circumstances, Mr Harrison submitted that &#8216;it would be almost topsy turvy&#8217; to say that it is &#8216;intolerable&#8217; to remove the children from this source of continuing harm and place them with their father, to whom no blame in terms of harm attaches.</p>

They are at risk of harm whether they stay here or are returned, but a return to the US is the less intolerable option. There would be short term upset, but with the prospect of resolution. </p>

So far the mother has not put forward any alternative plan. However, if the current working plan, namely that the children may have to go into foster care for a time, is the reality then the guardian does not consider that that establishes an intolerable situation. Ms Tyler pointed out, without contradiction, that in the event of a return order the mother could apply to the Home Office for additional financial assistance of up to &#163;3,000 to cover immediate resettlement costs.</p>

It is right to record that this issue of law only opened up and developed during the course of the oral hearing, and was not trailed in the parties&#8217; skeleton arguments. It is also of note that neither side was able to draw attention to any previous authority on the point. Both of these aspects of the debate should lead a court to be cautious about deciding the point. In a field of law which has been so heavily tilled by lawyers and judges over the past 40 years, it is striking that, if the point is well made, there is no extant authority.</p>

Mr Harrison therefore gets no support for his submission from the wording of the Convention, and Mr Jarman is right to stress that, in the course of his summary in <span style="font-style:italic">Re IG</span>, Baker LJ, at (2) was clear that &#8216;the issue is the risk to the child in the event of his or her return&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it is well established that, in determining whether an exception under Art 13(b) is established, the court is not undertaking a welfare evaluation. If the assessment of the intolerability of a child&#8217;s situation on return was expanded to include a comparison with the situation were they not to return, the court would inevitably be drawn towards reaching a welfare determination, being required to balance the pros and cons, in welfare terms, between the two options, in a way which is wholly contrary to approach to be taken under the Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, Mr Harrison&#8217;s submissions were founded on the basis that it is established that these two boys are suffering very serious harm &#8216;at the top end of the spectrum&#8217;. A court hearing an application under the 1980 Hague Convention should be cautious and clear over what is, and what is not, established within convention proceedings. It is one thing to hold, as we have done, that the mother in this case has failed to establish a grave risk of harm to the children under Art 13(b), but it does not follow, as night follows day, that the court has therefore found that the children must have suffered, be suffering and be likely to suffer harm as a result of the actions of their mother. Although part of the reasoning of the FtT includes a conclusion that the mother has pursued her theory of abuse in a manner which has been damaging to the children, it was no part of the FtT&#8217;s role to make a finding of abuse by her. The FtT judgment, like that of Judge Love, evaluated the mother&#8217;s case to determine whether her allegations against the father are made out on the evidence, which included the evidence of the mother, tested in cross-examination. Whilst, in the context of the children&#8217;s objections, this court will have to consider exercising its discretion to order a return to the USA, and that will necessarily involve a comparison between staying in the UK or going back to the home state, for the court to hold, as the father&#8217;s case on this point requires, that remaining here is more intolerable than going to the States, would require a positive finding against the mother which the court in Hague proceedings is not in a position to make.</p>

We accept that it is probable that she will be arrested on arrival. We understand that this is likely to involve officers boarding the plane and removing her prior to the other passengers disembarking, and that the children will then be taken into the care of social workers. We do not accept that it is likely that the children will be passed into the care of their father at that stage. Given their response to the guardian when they, erroneously, thought that he might be in the UK, they are likely to display extreme reluctance to see him, let alone be placed in his care. We accept that he intends to suspend the current custody order in his favour, and that he will make it clear to the CYS and other authorities that he does not seek the interim care of the children, but we will require him to do so before any return order takes effect. We join with the guardian in expecting the children&#8217;s mother to identify a friend or other trusted member of the community in Pennsylvania who can take on the short-term care of the children on their arrival in the US, but we have decided this issue on the basis that the default position, namely short-term foster care will be provided for them.</p>

We do, however, accept the assertion made on behalf of the guardian that the mother is entitled to apply to the UK Home Office for provision of a resettlement grant to her to provide the wherewithal for her to rent short term accommodation. As a failed asylum seeker, on voluntary return, provision of help with reintegration costs  with support from &#163;1500, depending on individual circumstances is in the experience of UTJ Mandalia, available to support an assisted departure by an application to the Voluntary Returns Service. We accept that the criminal process will be likely to run its course in the US and that there is a likelihood that the mother will receive a short term of imprisonment, however this may be mitigated by the father making it clear, as he has committed to do, that he does not want the mother to be imprisoned, nor would he initiate any criminal proceedings against the mother in respect of the abduction.</p>

This will be acutely so on the day of return itself and is likely to remain so, to a lesser degree, for some weeks before medium to long term arrangements can be made. To a degree, there will be upset and even trauma involved in the repatriation of any children who have been abducted and kept away from their home country by a parent who resists a return order. The extent of upset and trauma here is greater because of the likelihood that their mother will be arrested and kept in custody on arrival, with the children moving to foster care, but such circumstances are not without precedent. </p>

On return, the traumatic experience for the children on the day of arrival, with their mother being arrested and their placement in foster care, are likely to be compounded by the lack of any provision for the mother and children to establish a home back in America as the father&#8217;s evidence to this court is completely silent on any proposals for her support.

In addition to those matters relating to potential harm arising from their mother&#8217;s care and her adherence to the accounts of abuse, Mr Harrison pointed out that, now that their asylum claims have been dismissed and there is no further appeal, the mother and children are at risk of removal by the Home Office back to the US. It would be, he submitted, better for the children to go back in a more ordered process following an order of this court, than waiting for the Home Office to enforce their repatriation at some uncertain point. Mr Harrison stressed the importance to be attached to the policy of the Convention and the fact that these children are American and have no ties with the UK. It was, he argued, only by going back to the US that the children had any prospect of restoring their relationship with their father. Mr Harrison submits there has been no acknowledgement by the mother of the harm that she has already caused to these children and that the evidence of the children&#8217;s guardian is clear that there is a risk of the harm being perpetuated in the UK.  It is, he submits, completely unrealistic to conclude that any therapy and help offered to the children has a prospect of success whilst the children remain in the care of their mother, separated from their father.</p>

As the Court of Appeal stated at para 123 "the court has been properly sensitive to the fact that decision-making functions have been assigned to particular primary decision-makers by Parliament or under powers emanating from Parliament; and has been clear that the court has no power to review or otherwise interfere with the decision-making of that body except on a statutory appeal or on conventional judicial review grounds". The Court of Appeal also stated at para 124 that "all decisions relating to asylum applications (including decisions to withdraw or revoke asylum status) fall within the exclusive powers of the Secretary of State, no court or tribunal has any power to intervene outside the statutory appeal process set out in the 2002 Act ". </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">However, the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings are separate from the asylum process. Frequently, the same factual background forms the basis for both (i) an application for asylum by a child and (ii) a "defence" to an application for a return order under article 13(b) (grave risk to the child). In determining an application for a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention, the court does not impinge in any way upon the Secretary of State's exclusive function in determining refugee status. Rather, information in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and the court's decision may inform the determination by the Secretary of State of a person's asylum claim or as to whether the Secretary of State revokes refugee status. Similarly, information available to the Secretary of State such as country background information (though in this case that information is publicly available) and the decision of the Secretary of State may inform the court's decision in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. </p>

Though the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">AB</span> is not binding on me, it is highly persuasive, emanating as it does from the Lady Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The analysis of immigration law in <span style="font-style:italic">AB</span> is also likely to be on all fours with that in England and Wales which adds to the importance of that decision. Though I have not heard detailed argument on the point, <span style="font-style:italic">AB</span> is authority for the proposition that, as appears from the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R (AAA)</span>, the Procedures Directive is no longer part of retained EU law in this jurisdiction. Thus, the reliance by Lord Stephens on article 7 of that Directive may no longer be sustainable as a matter of statute. Further, the amendments to section 77 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which came into effect from 28 June 2022 and the amended paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules operate together to rescind the positive obligations flowing from article 7 of the Procedures Directive which played so significant a role in Lord Stephen&#8217;s decision. The interlocking effect of these developments appears to confine safeguards in the immigration process to that process alone so that, as <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span> (2002) held, those safeguards do not fetter a judge considering an application under the Hague Convention. Thus, the dicta from <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span> (2002) cited in paragraph 113 of <span style="font-style:italic">G v G</span> appear to have been given new life by developments since <span style="font-style:italic">G v G </span>was decided.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although we recognise the force in what is said by Mrs Justice Knowles and in the submissions made by Mr Harrison, and by Ms Tyler on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian in this respect, we have heard no submissions from the Secretary of State as to whether the statutory framework post-Brexit has an impact upon the protection from refoulement whilst a claim for asylum remains outstanding before the Secretary of State and on appeal to the Tribunals. There is no need to decide the issue in the present case, and we do not do so.  It is, however, in our judgment, a matter that warrants full argument in an appropriate case.</p>
