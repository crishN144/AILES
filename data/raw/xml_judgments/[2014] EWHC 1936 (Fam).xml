	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 02.00 on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2013, a telephone call was made to the emergency services by the father of a 6 week old baby boy who was said to be having breathing difficulties. An ambulance arrived just seven minutes later to find the infant in cardiac arrest, not breathing and without a pulse. The father told the paramedics that whilst he had been feeding the baby, he had struggled to breathe, then became limp and floppy.</p>

He was conveyed to hospital, assessed and treated in the paediatric intensive care unit. He was found to have suffered acute, widespread and life-threatening head injuries. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The outlook for him, very sadly, is bleak. He is severely disabled; and his life expectancy is reduced. He has severe developmental delay, cerebral palsy and possible spastic quadriplegia. He cannot feed normally; currently he has a naso-gastric tube because of difficulties with swallowing. There is a strong likelihood that he will display some form of neurological and / or neuro developmental impairment including seizures and visual loss. All the signs are that he will remain dependent upon others to satisfy his physical care needs for the remainder of his life.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing has been to establish the facts. Two distinct possibilities are put forward. The local authority claims that the child&#8217;s injuries were inflicted and thus non accidental &#8211; they resulted from an undisclosed shaking with impact mechanism. The father&#8217;s assertion is straightforward &#8211; that there was an accident when he lost his balance at the top of the stairs which caused the baby to fall down to the bottom.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father does not have to prove anything. The burden of proof remains with the local authority. It is my task to consider what is alleged, a wealth of information from a variety of sources including, of course, the oral evidence and then to come to an overall conclusion as to what, in fact, occurred. The standard of proof in finding the facts necessary to establish any factual issue in the case is the simple balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should also remind myself that there are many reasons why a person, in proceedings such as these, might lie. The mere fact that a potential perpetrator lies is not in itself evidence of guilt. People try to deceive for a whole host of motives. Not necessarily because they are culpable but, for example, out of shame or because they are fearful or in an attempt to bolster up a just cause or so as to conceal dishonourable behaviour from their families. The mere fact that a potential perpetrator lies is not in itself evidence of guilt. In this situation, it would almost never be sufficient evidence of culpability to establish that someone had lied. It is an altogether more subtle and delicate process than that.</p>

He said he had been fine about getting up to do the feed. He was neither tired nor stressed. The baby had woken him up &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">normally, screaming, his normal cry</span>.&#8221; The mother had nudged him and asked if he would do the feed.

He did not turn on the bedroom light; there had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a little bit of moonlight between the curtains</span>.&#8221; It took &#8220;seconds to mix the feed.&#8221; He had then &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">proceeded to pick T up from his Moses basket &#8230;</span>&#8221; He had picked up the feeding bottle after the baby and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">held it in the fingertips of (his) right arm</span>.&#8221; He had been intending to take T downstairs to feed him so as not to disturb the mother.</p>

Whereas she had made clear that, in part at least, she wanted to believe there was an &#8216;accident&#8217; not least for the sake of F and her potential future relationship with her father, having heard his evidence the mother, according to Miss Grocott QC, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">can no longer invest in an accidental mechanism</span>.&#8221; She found his account of the fall, his reasoning for telling the &#8216;fall story&#8217; and his description of having fed T wholly lacking in credibility. She left court at the end of the father&#8217;s evidence, Miss Grocott reports, deeply distressed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the father, Mr MacDonald QC and Mr Baker produced written submissions which, to my mind, could not have been improved upon. At their conclusion, they state that the accident which the father contends caused the injuries was heard by the mother, relying upon what she said to the police and in evidence. It is also suggested that T&#8217;s injuries are, on the evidence of the medical experts, consistent with the fall as described by the father. In that context, it is submitted that those matters which have cast suspicion upon the father are not necessarily probative of his having injured T deliberately. Thus, on the father&#8217;s behalf, I am asked to find that the local authority has not established, on the balance of probabilities, that he inflicted the injuries, it being more likely that they resulted from the accident described by the father.</p>

He suggests that the history and the versions of events leading up to T&#8217;s hospital admission will be crucial and the parents&#8217; credibility might well be decisive. He drew my attention to a number of matters which, he submits, are unusual or at odds with some of the evidence. Mr Hayer submits it is inexplicable that an innocent accident was not reported at the time to the mother, the medical staff and initially to the police. He suggests it is all the more bizarre when one considers that it was the father who raised &#8216;shaking&#8217; within his own police interview.</p>

The medical framework has been, as it almost always would be in a dispute of this kind, of considerable importance. Not just in differentiating between consistent and inconsistent accounts but also in enabling me to understand those aspects of T&#8217;s case which have a particular clinical significance. Examining and analysing the history, particularly events at the time of and in the days that followed 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October has been immensely important. So, too, the oral evidence of the parties not just about what happened on the night and thereafter but also more generally.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of matters merit explicit mention because they form part of the wider background. First, that the father has no history of having inflicted physical violence upon anyone. There was nothing, reports the mother, which would have suggested he was likely to deliberately hurt either child. She had no anxiety about him doing the night time feeds for T. He had been &#8216;heavy handed,&#8217; the mother told the police, on only a few occasions in all probability because of inexperience. She also said he is ordinarily a gentle person, a &#8216;Mummy&#8217;s boy&#8217; and an immature young man prone to &#8216;childish strops&#8217; nothing more worrying than that. Of his response to problems the mother said he would either ignore them or cover them up.</p>

The information about them was not revealed to the paternal grandparents because, as the father said in evidence, he did not believe his parents would be happy that he and the mother were having a baby and then a second with only a short gap between the two. He was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">scared about what (his) Mum and Dad would say</span>.&#8221; Later, the father added that his own father, the paternal grandfather &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">can fly off the handle and then calm down. He is hard to predict</span>.&#8221; There is also information, strongly denied by the father, suggestive that he felt differently about T to the way in which he felt about F to which I shall return in due time.</p>

Dr Cartlidge did not know if a 3 week old would be more vulnerable than a six month old. Both, he said, have a high chance of injury if they fall from a height of about a metre.

If he were shaken or tumbled down the stairs then there would be a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mildly &#8211; and (he did) stress mildly &#8211; increased vulnerability</span>.&#8221;</p>

He said he had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">heard T falling down, heard the thud noises &#8230; (The father) heard nothing from T. He went quiet after the first thud</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whatever happened between the father and T that night was unquestionably violent. There was an impact when T&#8217;s head came into contact with either a hard surface or an object so that he sustained a skull fracture. The mother had been, as she said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">only mildly aware; half asleep; half awake-ish</span>.&#8221; She had been trying to get back to sleep. Her initial reaction on hearing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the thud, thud, thud down the stairs had been that it was the bottle falling.</span>&#8221; In answer to Miss Heaton, the mother confirmed she had not heard the sound of an adult stumbling on the landing, nor the sound of anyone stubbing his foot, nor any rattle of the stair-gate as it was banged against, nor the father running down the stairs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Maybe, as the mother initially thought, a full feeding bottle did fall down the stairs. When she had asked the father at the hospital what the noise she&#8217;d heard was, he told her the bottle had slipped out of his hand and down the stairs. Maybe T was making a lot of noise at the time coincidental with the bottle&#8217;s descent. Unquestionably, there came a time when T was silent and made no further sound. By then, almost certainly, he had been severely injured and was, if not unconscious, then close to losing consciousness.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The content of and the way in which the father gave his evidence is of obvious importance in the fact finding exercise. Clearly he was nervous in the extreme; he spoke very, very quietly and gave most of his evidence in a flat, impassive manner. Seldom did he demonstrate much emotional response about anything. One of the only times when he became animated was in response to Miss Heaton&#8217;s suggestion that the fall had not happened. The father said, with some emphasis, that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the fall did happen</span>&#8221;; and as he did so he seemed to me to be really quite angry. He was definitely red in the face.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His account of what had happened of the night of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October had many of the hallmarks of a rehearsed account, one he had gone over and over in his own mind and there was a certain associated artificiality. He told me again and again how he had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">proceeded</span>&#8221; to do certain things. He seemed to me to be both strikingly immature and self absorbed. When he said it had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">too devastating</span>&#8221; to look down the stairs after T&#8217;s supposed fall and was asked for whom it had been devastating, the father replied, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">for me</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I am in no doubt at all, the father has told a whole succession of lies. His credibility has been in serious issue right from the start. His lie about having fed T an ounce of milk after he&#8217;d sustained catastrophic brain injuries alerted the doctors more or less at once to the improbability of his delayed and spurious account.</p>

The father admitted in evidence that he had no explanation for having told the police he had been carrying T down the stairs in his Moses basket. He did not know &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">why (he) had said it</span>.&#8221; He was similarly &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unsure</span>&#8221; as to why he had said in police interview that the feeding bottle had been swapped from one hand to the other.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason why the father has lied over and over again, almost without question, is that he is worried about the consequences for himself of the truth being known. He does not have the courage to admit to what happened. The consequences for the mother &#8211; who has to be viewed as blameless for what happened that night &#8211; have been beyond comprehension.</p>

The mother said that after T was born, the father became &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a lot more distant&#8230;. (She had) asked him if he had a male version of post natal depression. He went quiet and tensed his body &#8230;. He had done hardly anything for the baby. He was more heavy handed than he should have been and would &#8216;go off on one</span>&#8217;&#8221; when she tackled him.</p>

When T was removed from the ventilator, the father admits he only stayed in the room with the mother and T for 10 minutes because he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">found it very hard</span>&#8221; to be there. Seemingly, he had no care for the mother&#8217;s obvious sorrow and extreme distress.</p>

He was &#8216;matter of fact&#8217; throughout and even though his son, very obviously, was in a very poor way. The father&#8217;s tone, his speech delivery, signified no emotional arousal at all. He was exceptionally calm as he described how T was struggling to breathe whilst the mother could be heard crying in the background. The father did not appear to be in the least bit distressed as he said, &#8220;He&#8217;s still warm.&#8221; His delivery was flat calm as he said, &#8220;He&#8217;s stopped breathing.&#8221; The mother could be heard gulping in distress in the background.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his final submissions, Mr MacDonald suggests that those matters which have cast suspicion on the father are not necessarily probative of his having injured T &#8220;deliberately.&#8221; To do something &#8220;deliberately&#8221; means to do it on purpose, intentionally or on a basis that has been fully considered. I should make clear that I cannot conceive of circumstances in which the father set about injuring T either deliberately or intentionally. What happened that night, in all probability, might best be described as a sudden, frenzied loss of control with catastrophic consequences. The father, in all likelihood, became very angry and frustrated indeed as the result of something in the early hours of that morning.  T&#8217;s injuries were the enormously sad result.</p>
