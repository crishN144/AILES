Mr Crabtree agrees, although as will become apparent he sees the distinction rather differently from Mr O&#8217;Brien. I also agree. As Mr O&#8217;Brien points out, at the interim stage the evidence as to incapacity and best interests may not be complete and the court may be lacking evidence of the less restrictive alternatives which may be available. And there is also the reality that final hearings are in the experience of the Official Solicitor, which accords entirely with my own experience, not usually scheduled to take place within 20 weeks of the first case management conference, and all too often not even then.</p>

But, he says, the deprivation of a person&#8217;s liberty must take precedence over concerns about resource allocation. I agree, though that is not to say that the financial implications are simply to be ignored. As Mr Crabtree points out, local authorities have to operate within the resources allocated to them, and from which they have to meet a number of sometimes competing statutory duties and obligations. The court, as he points out, has to recognise that the world is one of finite resources, though he rightly acknowledges that where deprivation of liberty is at issue resource considerations will be towards the end of a long list of considerations. </p>

And the facts and circumstances of the particular case must always be taken into account when determining the proper form and frequency of reviews. What follows is no more than a guide, tailored in the final analysis to the specific circumstances of BJ&#8217;s case. It is indicative rather than definitive, descriptive rather than prescriptive. It must not be read as some rigid template to be applied in every case. Each case is different, often involving very different forensic and family dynamics.

The incapacitated adult should be a party to the proceedings and except where urgency precludes his participation the litigation friend should be involved. Usually it is the Official Solicitor who acts as litigation friend in these cases &#8211; not least because the local authority which is typically the claimant often finds itself in dispute with the very people who might otherwise act in that role &#8211; but it has to be borne in mind that the Official Solicitor is a litigation friend of last resort and that he cannot be compelled to act.

I agree. As he points out, such a hearing will often be a necessity because of the lack, or inadequacy, of evidence at the first hearing (though see what I said on this point in <span style="font-style:italic">Re PS</span> at para [23]). But the need for a review hearing within four weeks is not, in my judgment, confined to such cases. It is, I think, desirable as a matter of general practice. I should add that in what I would hope is the rare case where an order authorising the deprivation  of liberty has been made without the participation of the Official Solicitor or other litigation friend, the initial review by the court must be sooner &#8211; much sooner &#8211; than the four weeks which would otherwise be appropriate.</p>

I agree with Mr Crabtree that, in the final analysis, the decision must always be one for the judge who has made the first order authorising the deprivation of liberty and must always be taken having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. That said, and recognising on the other hand that there may be cases where an earlier review is required, it still seems to me that, as a general practice, and always accepting that a different order may be appropriate in some cases, the first review hearing should follow no later than four weeks after the initial order.</p>

Usually, no doubt, these reviews will coincide with the further directions hearings or pre trial reviews fixed by the judge. The circumstances of the particular case may, however, require further reviews at other times. As Mr Crabtree submits, it is vital that the Official Solicitor or other litigation friend participates fully in all such hearings. And as he also submits, amongst the important matters to be considered at the pre trial review as part of the general review of where the case has got to and where it is going, is the question of whether or not the interim declaratory relief should be continued.</p>

Mr O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s submissions assume that following the final hearing the litigation will have concluded and with it the role of the Official Solicitor as litigation friend, and that thereafter the Official Solicitor&#8217;s role will be very limited. Now that might be so if there was merely a liberty to apply which might never be exercised. But if the final order builds in, as in my judgment it must if Article 5(4) is to be complied with, provision for further regular reviews, even if only at annual intervals, then the litigation has not concluded, albeit that it may be dormant for up to a year at a time, nor, it would seem to me, has the continuing role of the litigation friend. </p>

Accordingly, he says, the court must be supplied with up to date reports from the independent psychiatrist on the issues of capacity and (where appropriate) best interests and from the independent social worker on the issue of best interests.

I am inclined to think that normally it would be appropriate for there to be an oral hearing at the first annual review but that if the position at that stage seems to have stabilised and the circumstances are such that change is unlikely within the next year the next and subsequent reviews can probably take place without an oral hearing. This must always, of course, be subject to the right of any party, or, indeed, of the judge (who has an important role to play in this respect), to require that there should in fact be an oral hearing if it appears, for example, that the evidence requires further investigation or scrutiny (whether by cross-examination or by directing further investigations or assessments) or that there are matters on which the court would be assisted by argument.</p>

So long as possible and so far as reasonably practicable, every case where a final order has been made authorising a person&#8217;s deprivation of liberty should be reserved to the judge who made that order, and the fact that the case is so reserved should be recorded in the order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien and Mr Crabtree helpfully highlight a number of points which although matters of detail are nonetheless important. With the assistance of their submissions I would formulate these as follows: </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The preceding order must lay down a clear timetable for what is to be done in the run-up to the review hearing, in particular with a view to ensuring that both the Official Solicitor and the court receive the up-dating material sufficiently in advance of the date fixed for the review (whether in court or on paper) to enable a proper decision to be made as to whether an oral hearing will be required and, even if it is not, to enable all the parties, the Official Solicitor in particular, to prepare for the review. Mr O&#8217;Brien suggests a minimum period of 21 days for this purpose. I agree, though suspecting that 28 days will provide a more adequate margin of safety.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Following a suggestion put forward by Mr Crabtree I think that approximately four weeks prior to the next court review there ought to be a multi-disciplinary meeting between the local authority workers, the mental health team, other appropriate professionals and the Official Solicitor to determine if an agreed case summary can be arrived at. If it can, this should be sent to the judge to consider whether an oral hearing or any other directions are required. In the event that a case summary cannot be agreed (or if there differences of opinion as to the way forward), a factual summary should be agreed and this together with position statements from those still active in the proceedings should be sent to the judge, who will then determine on the papers submitted whether an oral hearing is required and/or what other directions ought to be made. In either case, suggested draft directions should accompany the case summary or (as the case may be) the position statements.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Every order must contain a liberty to apply, if need be on short notice. In the event of such an application being contemplated, it is vital that the Official Solicitor is given the earliest possible notification and supplied at the earliest possible opportunity with copies of all the up to date assessments, reports, records and other relevant material. I repeat in this context the point already made in paragraph [32] above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between these reviews by the court there must be regular internal reviews. In practice &#8211; and this is a practice which the Official Solicitor supports and which I commend &#8211; these are usually held once every eight to ten weeks. Mr Crabtree suggests that quarterly reviews may suffice. Particularly in the early months and years I would incline to agree with Mr O&#8217;Brien, but I would also agree with Mr Crabtree that one cannot be too prescriptive. As he rightly says, the review structure must always be specifically tailored to the needs of the individual to whom it applies. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, and as both Mr O&#8217;Brien and Mr Crabtree observe, and again I agree, the fact that a review is planned, for example, for a specified date each month, does not obviate the need for an earlier review if, for example, there is reason to believe that the person is no longer incapacitated or that it is not in his best interests to be deprived of his liberty or that some less restrictive option may be available. As Mr Crabtree put it, no matter what internal review structure is put in place, evidence of any significant change must of itself prompt speedy consideration of the need for calling an early internal review. He adds, and I agree, that where an important change in circumstances arises, it is incumbent on the local authority to inform the Official Solicitor promptly and if either the local authority or the Official Solicitor feels it is of sufficient magnitude, bring the matter to the immediate attention of the judge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At each internal review the local authority must consider the issues both of capacity and of best interests. Mr O&#8217;Brien suggests that at each internal review there will be a need to have regard to any relevant reports from the independent psychiatrist on the issues of capacity and (where appropriate) best interests and from the independent social worker on the issue of best interests. But he submits that internal reviews need not involve further full assessments from the independent experts unless there is reason to believe that there has been a change either in the person&#8217;s capacity or in what his best interests require. Mr Crabtree takes essentially the same position. I agree. What is needed at any particular review in any particular case will very much depend upon the past and present circumstances of the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien observes that it is not clear in BJ&#8217;s case who would carry out that role and that the local IMCA may well confirm that this role is not presently within its capabilities and remit. He suggests, however, that the local authority may well be able to identify a suitable person locally, perhaps, given the nature and complexity of the issues in this particular case, an independent social worker or other suitable expert. Mr Crabtree is not so sanguine. Indeed, and consistently with his submissions as to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s ongoing role in relation to reviews by the court, he submits that at least until the Schedule A1 mechanisms are in place it is the Official Solicitor who should adopt the role of BJ&#8217;s &#8220;representative&#8221; at each internal review. I agree. In my judgment, so long as he remains the patient&#8217;s litigation friend in a case such as this, the Official Solicitor, unless in the particular case he can find some other appropriate person to act in this role, must be as involved in the regular internal reviews as in the less frequent reviews by the court.</p>

He and Mr O&#8217;Brien agree that it is essential &#8211; I agree and wish to emphasise the point &#8211; that proper minutes are kept of both the discussions and the conclusions reached at each internal review and that all the reports and other material received at each internal review are retained.</p>

Delays which would no longer be tolerated in care cases involving children are still all too frequent in cases involving adults. Whilst appreciating that the forensic analogies must not be pressed too far, I cannot help thinking that the principles of judicial continuity and pro-active judicial case management which are now a recognised part of practice in care cases involving children have an equally part to play in the context of the adult jurisdiction.</p>
