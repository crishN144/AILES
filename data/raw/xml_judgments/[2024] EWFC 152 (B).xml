	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I am dealing with a child called L, who was born on 13 August 2023. He is presently aged about six months. He appears through the Children&#8217;s Guardian and is represented by Miss Schofield. The local authority are represented by Miss Johnson. They have applied for Care and Placement Orders in respect of L.  The mother is M. She is presently incarcerated in HMP X. She was sentenced to seven years&#8217; immediate custody in January 2024 and will serve at least three and a half years. She is, therefore, in custody until at least July 2027.  She has been in custody throughout these proceedings.  The father is F.   He does not have parental responsibility as he is not named on the child&#8217;s birth certificate. I am satisfied that he was given notice of the proceedings in September 2023.  He said as much. He was also provided with a list of solicitors. He has also been subject to an online parenting assessment by the local authority. He has also been seen by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. Despite being reminded of his ability post-September to take part in the proceedings I am satisfied that he has chosen not to do so. He has had plenty of time to instruct a solicitor, even taking into account that he is presently incarcerated and not due for release until later in March. Nevertheless, I arranged for a link to be set up on the second day to at least give him the opportunity to be heard by the court at this final hearing. He took that opportunity.  He has remained unrepresented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has an extensive history relating to drug misuse and the supply of drugs. She has previously served two lengthy sentences, one in 2017 for possession with intent to supply Crack cocaine and heroin and one in 2020, possession with intention to supply class A drugs. Whilst on licence the mother was arrested on 23 February 2023 for possession of three bags of heroin which she attempted to conceal by swallowing even though she was 13 weeks&#8217; pregnant with L. The father also has an extensive criminal background with over 20 convictions spanning 15 years including offences against the person, theft, drug offences, firearms, offensive weapons and offences against property. He has never met L and his engagement with the local authority has at best been sporadic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 August 2023 the court granted an interim Care Order in respect of L and sanctioned the local authority&#8217;s plan for removal into foster care. The mother did not oppose the making of an interim Care Order but did oppose separation. The mother made a C2 application seeking for L to be returned to her care in a mother and baby unit at the prison. However, when the application was eventually heard by the court it was known that the mother was facing a four day trial before the Crown court in January 2024 and it was known that, if she was convicted, she would receive a significant sentence of imprisonment. In those circumstances I ruled that the application was premature and that the results of the trial should be ascertained before considering the application further. In light of her conviction and sentence the application was not pursued further.</p>

All of those assessments concluded that L should not be placed in their care and the paternal grandfather withdrew from the assessment process. Apart from Ms M none of the other people who were assessed has asked either to be heard or to challenge the assessment. The court received a handwritten note from Miss M asking for a re-assessment. </p>

In respect of contact to the mother, currently at three times per week, if a Placement Order is made contact will reduce to monthly until an adoptive placement is identified. In respect of the father the local authority&#8217;s plan is to arrange some contact. That will take place at a frequency of once per month until an adoptive placement is identified.</p>

L has been subject to child protection in pre-proceedings as an unborn child. The father did not seek to be involved in any intervention and has confirmed this to the social worker.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother gave some brief evidence before me. She did not wish to challenge the evidence of the social worker or the Children&#8217;s Guardian in cross-examination. She confirmed her statement at C69 and her statement at C173 and also two letters, one written to me and one written to L to which I will refer later in this Judgment. She agreed that she had not had the best childhood. She had difficulties with her mother. There was drug misuse in her house and there were difficulties with criminality and lifestyle choices. She could understand why the local authority were concerned about L.  She said that everything changed on 13 August because she became a mother and she had a reason to change. She said that L was not planned but she chose to keep him. She started to turn her life around. He gives her something to be responsible for. She described how L has dark brown hair with a tinge of ginger in the light. He rolls from his back onto his front. He pushes himself up. He giggles. He is very nosy. He enjoys contact and the mother said she tries to give him different kinds of food at the contact, although he clearly does not like carrot puree because he spits it out over her. He is well behaved. She said that L means everything to her, &#8220;he means the world&#8221; and, indeed, I noted that her faced lit up when she spoke about him.  She said that if L cannot be placed in the care of her friend, M, then she would like him to be placed in long term foster care which would give her the opportunity to prove herself and get him back. If, however, the court made a Placement Order she will carry on making better decisions and carry on fighting for him anyway. She will always love him. She wanted him to be proud of her. She had not taken any drugs recently due to having L and breast feeding. Even though there are loads of drugs in gaol she has not taken any. She referred to the letter that she has written. She wants him to have a breakdown of where he comes from and his family, who love him. She said that she had started work on a beautician course in prison and she produced a letter from the beauty tutor, SH. That letter tells me that the mother started on a level 2 beauty course on 14 September 2023 and she has completed it to a high standard sand gone on to level 2 nail enhancement. She has worked hard and earned her new position as a key worker for the salon supporting her peers with theory work and practical treatments.  She attends all sessions scheduled and is always punctual. She has demonstrated real aptitude for her subject and is respectful and professional at all times when working with staff and clients in the salon environment.  She said that she is doing this course to be able to support L better so that she has a better job and does not engage in criminality. She would like to be placed in long term foster care to enable her to show that she can care for him.  She thought that long term foster care was best for him so he could keep a bond with her and reach his milestones and keep his family ties and not feel that he is on his own.  She asked for a chance to prove that she has changed and was willing to maintain the change for L.</p>

M has engaged with courses and support in prison in relation to her substance misuse and intends to engage with a relationship course, which is positive. M has taken the opportunity to further develop her skills as a hair dresser and beautician and has undertaken NVQs whilst in prison and she hopes that she will be able to earn a living from this and support herself and l.&#8221;.</p>

I understand the reasons why we are before you today for L&#8217;s wellbeing and safety. I am a first time mother to L and when I found out I was pregnant I reduced off drugs and got clean and staying that way. I cannot change my past bad choices in life but I can change and keep change in the future for me and L.  L deserves the best version of me so I can give him the best upbringing and help him grow into a bright young man, giving him guidance to the right path and show him he is capable of anything he puts his mind to. I understand that the past five plus months of L&#8217;s life isn&#8217;t what I would have wanted but it is what he needs until I am home and proved that I  have changed.  As each day goes by I will keep bettering myself because L is what has changed me and give me something to better myself for. I will carry on to make my son proud to have me as his mother, just like I am proud of him with every milestone he overcomes. The fact is no child asks to be born. I made that choice and it has changed my whole life for the better. I am working to give L the best version of me. I have not always made the right choices in life but having L is the best and always will be. Please, I just need this one chance to be a mother to my son. In the end I will get there with the little bit of hope I have left that sits in your hands today. Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you grant me this chance I will not fail&#8221;, and that is signed by the mother.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;To my darling son, L. I am writing this to  prepare for if the worst outcome happens in court. Please understand that I never gave up fighting for the right to be your mother and when I made the choice to have you as you weren&#8217;t planned I reduced off drug and have been drugfree for just under a year. I have made some bad choices in my life but since I made the best choice to have you I&#8217;ve changed my whole lifestyle so I could be the best mother to you. You&#8217;re my only reason I had to change because wanted you to be proud to have me as your mother. Let me tell you a little bit about me and your dad. Your dad, F, dob redacted born and lives in W. He is height redacted and redacted, lovely man, but, like me, made some bad choices in life. He loves you dearly.  Me, your mum, is M, dob redacted, height redacted, brown hair, born and lives in W, and I love you more than anything in the whole world. You are my everything, my reason for living. I just hope that one day you will find me and we can reform our bond we have. I&#8217;m going to miss you for the rest of my life and I&#8217;m going to miss every milestone you make in life, but I am and always will be proud of the man you become. Just know I am so sorry I couldn&#8217;t win the fight for you. You come into the world on redacted, weight: redacted at 20:30pm, two weeks before your due date. We spent four days together in hospital and they was the best days of my life. I loved every second of it, even your first nappy change when you pee&#8217;d on me. I didn&#8217;t see it at first, I just wondered why my leg was getting warm and the shock I had when I seen where the warmth was coming from, but as you have gotten older it becomes a little game for you&#8221; (laughing emoji). </p>

The letter to me demonstrates an understandable desire to try to have a chance to have L in her care in the future, but it is the letter to L that really deserves my admiration and praise. The bravery and the strength of character demonstrated by the mother in being able to prepare this hugely insightful and child focused letter will, I am sure, be of huge benefit to her son in the future. She really did express herself in a most moving way and I commend her for it.</p>

The major thrust of what he said was to give the mother a chance to care for L and if that was not the outcome chosen by the court then he could not understand why the paternal grandmother could not care for L, particularly as she works in schools. Her viability assessment concluded that she as already heavily burdened with caring responsibilities and did not have the capacity to provide good enough care for L as well. I have been sent an email today in which the grandmother says that she does not wish to challenge the assessment.  When F was asked what the court should do with L for at least three and a half years whilst the mother is still incarcerated he did not really have an answer. Whilst clearly he was exercised by the prospect of his son being placed for adoption, the impression I formed is that there was a reluctant acknowledgment by him that the court really had little alternative. He made what was at best a passing reference to the possibility that he might care for L but, again, was realistic, in my judgment, about his own personal circumstances and his present incarceration. </p>

He cannot wait for what in effect would be years for his parents to make and sustain the changes necessary. Even if his parents were to be released tomorrow there is a wealth of work that would need to be undertaken in addition to being able to demonstrate that they are drugfree within the community and have suitable accommodation. It is my understanding that neither had his or her own accommodation prior to their current periods of incarceration.</p>

Adoption can only be approved where it is in the child&#8217;s lifelong best interests and where the severe interference with the right to respect for family life is necessary and proportionate. The court must, therefore, evaluate the family placement and assess the nature and likelihood of the harm that the child would be likely to suffer in it, the consequences of the harm arising and the possibilities for reducing the risk of harm or for mitigating its effects. It must then compare the advantages and disadvantages for the child of that placement with the advantages and disadvantages of adoption and of any other realistic placement outcome short of adoption. The comparison will inevitably include a consideration of any harm that the child would suffer in the family placement and any harm arising from separation from parents, siblings and other relations. It is only through this process of evaluation and comparison that the court can validly conclude that adoption is the only outcome that can provide for the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare, in other words that it is necessary and proportionate.&#8221;</p>

Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights any interference with the exercise of the right to respect for family life should be proportionate to its legitimate aim. There can be no greater interference than the permanent removal of a child. Consequently, the relationship between parents and children can be severed only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child&#8217;s welfare, in short where nothing else will do (per Baroness Hale of Richmond in <span style="font-style:italic">Re: B (Care proceedings; appeal</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> [2013] </span>UKSC  33.</p>

The contact position can of course be regulated by alternative orders under section 34 but the situation still contrasts markedly with that of an adopted child. There are open adoptions where the child sees his or her natural parents but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the Adoption Order has been made the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact;</p>

On adoption the cessation of membership of the original family is total and intended to be so for all time. The original parents&#8217; parental responsibility is extinguished and there is a complete severing of all legal ties with the family. The cut-off from his family of origin may have a potentially damaging impact on his sense of identity and L&#8217;s emotional wellbeing. Becoming an adopted person provides for the child a permanent substitute family where the adopters are legally responsible and, therefore, fully committed to fulfilling their parental responsibilities. In focusing upon the likely effect on L of these changes I have considered the degree of interference with his Article 8 rights to family life and those of other family members that would be consequent upon an adoption.

The other two children are not believed to know about L&#8217;s birth and there is no current relationship between them. The local authority would propose indirect contact if their parents are in agreement with the same.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I fully accept that both the mother and the father love L dearly. I also accept that the mother is desperate to care for L. The parents, and particularly the mother, have fought to have their son returned to their care. They have not given up, they have not rejected their son, they have not abandoned him; it is not L&#8217;s fault. However, unfortunately in this case neither of them is able to provide good enough, safe enough care for him within his time frame. There are no friends, family or other connected alternatives suitably positively assessed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Long term foster care would enable L to have ongoing contact with his parents with the potential that one of them could reach the stage one day where he or she could provide good enough, safe enough care and he could be returned to that parent. However, there are a number of negatives with long term foster care. There is the intrusion by the State in the child&#8217;s life and the stigma of being a Looked After Child. Being a Looked After Child is likely to feel very different to life as an adopted child as a member of a permanent family rather than just being looked after by professional carers. The risk of breakdown is higher with long term foster care. It is unlikely to provide the child with a sense of permanence and stability that he needs to form good, wholesome attachments with his primary carers. The placement could also be subject to applications by the parents to discharge the Care Order which, again, could provide instability, particularly if the applications lack merit. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Adoption would likely mean that ties with his birth family would be broken. He would not enjoy the benefits of an ongoing relationship with his mother and any relationship that he manages to form with his father. Adoption provides a permanent family where L could feel as though he truly belonged. The carers would be committed to him for his life rather than just his childhood or a period of his childhood. Whilst there would be an interference with his Article 8 rights to private and family life, he would enjoy the benefits of family life in his adoptive placement. He would form the familial relationships in a new family. State intrusion would also come to an end and he would enjoy a normal family life without the stigma of being a Looked After Child and the freedom to engage in activities such as holidays without local authority consent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, this is a case where only adoption will do. It is in the best interests of L and is necessary and proportionate. It follows, therefore, that I dispense with the consent of the parents on the grounds that his welfare requires that I do so. I also follows that the court should make a Care Order and I do so. I approve the permanence provisions of the care plan including the contact reduction plan as L will need to be prepared for the move into an adoptive placement. I also direct that a transcript of this Judgment be prepared at the local authority&#8217;s expense in accordance with the direction of Peter Jackson LJ. That concludes this Judgment.</p>
