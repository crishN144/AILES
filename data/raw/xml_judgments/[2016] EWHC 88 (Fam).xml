The respondent is English.  They married in 2005 and separated in 2012.  During their marriage, two children were born.  They are now 9 and 5 years old.  The applicant obtained a divorce in the Amtsgericht (District Court) Walsrode and, in the course of those matrimonial proceedings, the court made an order for maintenance for the two children.  That order was made on 7 August 2014 (&#8220;the German order&#8221;).</span></p>

Their father, the respondent, lives and works in England.  At the present time he is refusing to pay maintenance under the terms of the German order because he alleges that the applicant is obstructing his contact with the children.  By her current application, issued on 7 August 2014, she seeks to enforce the German order under the provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) Maintenance Regulation 4/2009 (&#8220;the Maintenance Regulation&#8221;).  On 28 April 2015, the Family Court sitting in Lincoln transferred her application to the High Court and directed that the matter should be listed before me in July 2015.</span></p>

Maintenance was included within the scope of that Convention and was absorbed within Brussels I when that Regulation came into force in 2003.  Brussels I was primarily concerned with civil and commercial judgments and, in April 2004, the European Commission was presented with a Green Paper on Maintenance Obligations.  Its object was to open a debate about how courts should deal with the problems encountered as between individual maintenance creditors and individual Member States.  A key objective was identified in these terms:</span></p>

Although subparagraph (1) states, as I have set out, that it refers to a maintenance decision which falls to be enforced under section 1 of Chapter IV, and therefore under the route of direct enforcement, subparagraph (2) (to which subparagraph (1) is subject) expresses in a contradictory way that the application is to be transmitted to the Magistrates&#8217; Court by the Lord Chancellor.  It would only be apt for the Lord Chancellor to transmit an application to the Magistrates&#8217; Court should he had received an application for delegated enforcement under Chapter VII.  It is impossible to conceive how or why he would be transmitting an application for enforcement where an applicant has elected to adopt the route of direct enforcement under Chapter IV.</span></p>

I say this in order to reconcile subparagraphs (1) and (2) and also to give effect to the unfettered right of an applicant who elects the course of direct enforcement to have that enforcement done under Article 41 &#8220;under the same conditions as a decision given in that Member State of enforcement&#8221;.  If an applicant with the benefit of a foreign order is made to go to the Magistrates&#8217; Court, then they do not enjoy the same conditions as a decision given in the Member State of enforcement, in this case England and Wales.  This is because a domestic order, if made in the County Court, may only be enforced in the County Court.  A domestic order, if made in the High Court, may be enforced in the High Court.</span></p>

Whilst the amended FPR do now provide for enforcement through the Family Court, in practice the procedure by which enforcement through the vehicle of REMO is put into effect in the Family Court remains what Mr Scott has referred to as &#8220;a second class system&#8221; and certainly in the circumstances in which this applicant finds herself.  Thus, he submits, Mostyn J&#8217;s primary point is not affected.  The judge was correct in his analysis that the Maintenance Regulation confers rights in the alternative.  On his case, there is nothing in the Regulation to support the hybrid route which REMO now purports to require, namely that an applicant who chooses not to use the Central Authority in his or her state of origin should nevertheless have to route the application via the Central Authority in the requested state.</span></p>

In that case, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Article 3(b) must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which establishes a centralisation of judicial jurisdiction in matters relating to cross-border maintenance obligations in favour of a first instance court which has jurisdiction for the seat of the appeal court.  The only exception occurs in circumstances where that rule assists to achieve the objective of a proper administration of justice and protects the interests of maintenance creditors whilst, at the same time, promoting the effective recovery of such claims.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">it is important, too, that a maintenance creditor should have easy access in a Member State to a decision which will be automatically enforceable in another Member State without further formalities;</span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <num style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">(vi)</num>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is now over a year since the mother secured her order in this case.  At that stage, there were arrears up to the beginning of this year of a sum in excess of &#8364;6,000.  Those arrears are likely to be significantly greater now.  The arrears are directly referable to the financial support of two young children.  In my view, there are ample grounds in this case to request the European Court to consider an expedited hearing under its powers and pursuant to the procedure set out in r 105 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The emotional toll of these ongoing proceedings will be taking their toll not only on the parties but on the children whose interests will inevitably have been harmed by their parents&#8217; ongoing disputes. </span></p>
