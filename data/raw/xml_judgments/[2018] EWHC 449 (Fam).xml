LMP acted for LS in the context of financial claims arising as a result of divorce proceedings between LS and her former husband, RS.  The litigation between these former spouses has been ongoing in the Family Division since 2011; it has been bitterly contested, highly acrimonious, and extremely expensive.

Pursuant to this agreed variation in terms, she contends that no interest is payable to her former solicitors.  She also relies on the terms of a final order which I made in the financial remedy proceedings whereby she secured from RS a partial (but significant) indemnity in respect what was then agreed to be the balance of her outstanding costs due to LMP.  Because by that stage there was very little liquidity in the case, that indemnity and the balance of the costs order was deferred and payable by RS out of his share of the net proceeds of sale from a property in Moscow (&#8216;Property R&#8217;) which was to be sold as part of the distribution exercise which flowed from my final order.  </span></p>

There is an issue between LS and RS as to who has been at fault in terms of lengthy delays in the marketing of that property, an issue which has been compounded by the apparent collapse of the Moscow housing market and the lack of interest from potential purchasers.  The practical consequence of the ongoing and unforeseen delay in releasing equity from Property R is that the obligation on RS to discharge the balance of LS&#8217;s legal fees has not yet crystallised.  In the meantime, and on the case advanced by LMP, contractual interest continues to run on the unpaid balance which is due to it.  Because the stipulated interest rate is 1.5% compound every 30 days, there is now a very substantial sum due in respect of interest.  The expectation of LS at the time of the final costs order in May 2015 was that she would be responsible for discharging a small balance of some &#163;5,000 odd due to LMP, that sum falling outside the indemnity which RS was to meet from his share of the equity in Property R.   That liability is, of course, now dwarfed by the default judgment in the sum of &#163;107,361.07, a liability which potentially continues to attract interest at the judgment debt rate of 8%.</span></p>

Whilst the firm&#8217;s position is informally secured to some extent by the provision in my order requiring RS to pay the majority of his former wife&#8217;s outstanding costs from the financial remedy proceedings (and I have made provision for the direct payment of this sum to LMP by those responsible for the conveyancing), there is no requirement on RS to pay any element of outstanding interest.  </span></p>

The expectation was that LS and at least two of the three children would continue to make their home in Property F, the former matrimonial home in Maidenhead.  The expectation was that once Property R in Moscow had been sold and the proceeds distributed, the title to that English property would be transferred into the name of LS who would then take over the mortgage repayments.  RS would use the balance of his share of the net proceeds from Property R to buy a modest home for himself and his new partner and child.  RS is now retired and relies upon a modest pension to support his future income needs.  LS was awarded Property A, an un-mortgaged apartment in Moscow which is let to tenants,  in order to provide her with a capital asset which would secure her income needs into the future through the rental stream it would continue to generate.  </span></p>

The majority of that costs order was intended to enable LS to repay a substantial commercial litigation loan which was itself attracting a compound interest rate of 18%.  That loan was duly discharged by RS from the remaining liquid capital held in one of his bank accounts.  I allowed him to defer payment of the balance of some &#163;70,000 odd until the sale of Property R because I found that he did not have the reserves available to pay the balance whilst continuing to pay his rent and meet his and his family&#8217;s outgoings in the interim.</span></p>

Both thereafter dis-instructed their respective legal teams:  there were by then insufficient resources for either to continue to pay for professional representation.  There was thus a significant delay in the court receiving a draft order.  In the meantime, RS had issued the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Barrell </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">application to which I have referred above.  Contrary to the common expectation of RS and the court at the time of the hearing in November 2014 that LS and the children would live in Property F in England, she had in fact moved to Moscow shortly after the hearing.  Her case is that (i) she had told LMP about her intentions at the time of the final hearing; and (ii) she made the move to secure a tax advantage which would have been for the benefit of both herself and RS.  LS has dual Russian/British nationality..  Whilst RS is British, they had lived in Moscow for a significant period during the marriage.  By returning to Property A for a tax year in 2015/2016, LS contends that she had hoped to achieve some tax saving in relation to the sale of Property R.</span></p>

Two days later, he sent an email to Mr Roberts asking him to confirm receipt of the documents which he did later the same day.

That pack would have included pro forma documents explaining how to acknowledge service and/or defend the claim.  During the hearing before me on 29 November 2017, she handed in the clip of documents which she contended were the original documents which were served on 12 January 2016.  The clip which was handed to me contained the original claim form clearly endorsed with an original red seal of the court, a copy of the Particulars of Claim, and various documents referred to in the Particulars set out in appendices A to D.

LS told me that she had been completely unaware prior to 1 June 2017, a week before, that LMP had secured a judgment in default.  That was the date upon which she had been sent the application by LMP for joinder in the financial remedy proceedings.  She sought my permission to make an application to set aside that judgment debt notwithstanding that she was outside the prescribed time limits for making such an application.   I treated her application as deemed in the face of the court and recorded in my order the warning which I gave her about the potential costs consequences were she to fail in her set aside application.   Thereafter, I consolidated the two sets of proceedings and gave directions in relation to the filing of evidence.  LS was to file a statement dealing with both the delay in filing a defence to the claim and details of her substantive defence to the claim.

It is her case that, as confirmed in a letter written to her by LMP on 3 March 2014, she agreed to re-instruct the firm for the purposes of representing her at the final hearing listed in July 2014 on the basis of (i) a specific fixed fee arrangement going forward; (ii) a waiver of the interest clause in the original retainer; and (iii) deferment of LMP&#8217;s entitlement to recover the outstanding element of its costs until a sale of Property R and payment out of the proceeds of his share to RS for the purposes of meeting that liability  She was also proceeding from the basis of an assumption that VAT would not be payable..  In this respect she relies on the contents of my judgments and orders, transcripts of which she has produced for the purposes of this hearing.  In the event I were to find against her in relation to the alleged change in her contract with LMP in relation to the interest element of the claim, she seeks orders that any interest element due to LMP is met by RS or, alternatively, that I should review the rate of interest charged and substitute one which is fair and reasonable.

It is LS&#8217;s case that they are silent for a reason.  She relies on an express or implied offer from Mr Ribet (which she says she accepted) to waive all future interest charges as part of the fixed fee arrangement.  Mr Ribet denies that there was any such offer.  In relation to the payment of interest, he relies on the terms of his firm&#8217;s original May 2013 retainer which he says were left undisturbed by the imposition on those arrangements of a separate fixed fee agreement.  That subsequent agreement was designed to cap the sums which LMP was able to charge between 4 March 2014 and the conclusion of the final hearing some months later.  In his witness statement Mr Ribet states that one of his professional colleagues, Mr Myles, reviewed his manuscript notes of the discussions to which LS has referred.  These were sent to LS who contends that the document she was shown does not accurately reflect the totality of what was said.</span></p>

Moreover, she relies on a specific assurance from Mr Ribet that interest would be waived on the outstanding balance of her fees.  She told me during the course of making her submissions that she had raised the issue of interest again with her legal team at the conclusion of the distribution hearing in July 2014.  She is, at least, consistent in that allegation since it mirrors the representations she made subsequently to the Legal Ombudsman.  (The repetition does not, of course, mean that the statement is true.)  She says that she asked one of her legal team to make a manuscript note to the effect that any balance due would not attract interest.  She maintains that this was the common understanding of everyone in court and, were that not the case, it was for LMP to raise the issue and correct the position.  In this context she relies on a passage in the court transcript of proceedings on 25 July 2014.

On 20 December 2014 she sent an email to the court, care of my clerk.  That email is not in the bundle which was prepared for today&#8217;s hearing but to the best of my knowledge it was included in the bundles for previous hearings which related to the perfection of the final order in the financial remedy proceedings.  In that email she asked me to order RS to extend the mortgage over Property F so as to release a further sum of &#163;70,000 from the equity.  That sum, she contended, should be applied to discharge his liability to pay the balance of her outstanding costs on an accelerated basis and prior to the sale of Property R in Moscow.  She had been refused a bank loan to settle the debt herself and had by then received the letter before action which DWF sent on 29 October 2015.   She described the demand in that letter for payment of c. &#163;81,000 to be a &#8220;misleading presentation&#8221; insofar as it purported to include an element of interest and relied on the submissions made by her counsel, Mr Ewins, in the July 2014 hearing (see above).  The fact that the court had no jurisdiction at that stage to require RS to further charge the former matrimonial home was something with which I dealt both in an email response from my clerk and at a subsequent hearing attended by LS and RS in person.  The point is that, by December 2014, LS had taken steps to do what she could (a) to alert the court to the fact that she was being pursued for a debt which included an element of interest which she did not accept to be due to LMP; and (b) she was seeking to address the issue of the payment of the principal sum due to her former solicitors by asking the court to require RS to accelerate his contribution to her costs by further reducing the equity in Property F, the title to which was then in his sole name.</span></p>

Therefore whilst your professional clients did not have any actual security, they had a clear expectation that, should they need to enforce in due course, there would be an asset against which steps could be taken if that was necessary. But contractual arrangements which are made between a lay client and a firm of solicitors who accept instructions are a matter of contract between those two parties.  In deciding whether or not to take on a case, the solicitors are going to have to accept an exposure to risk, if indeed they are exposed, and do not take funds up front, as it were.  In this case, they were not in a position to do that.  What they did instead was to secure their position and indeed your client&#8217;s position by not one but I think two successful applications for legal services orders.</span></p>

Its purpose is to avoid an injustice.  It is now established law that a failure to serve a response pack with particulars of claim may, in appropriate circumstances, constitute &#8220;some other good reason&#8221; for the court to exercise its discretion and set aside a judgment obtained in default of an acknowledgement of service.  The need to act promptly following service of a claim and the merits of the proposed defence must also be factored into the court&#8217;s approach.  Subject only to any assessment as to whether LS was properly served with the debt recovery proceedings on 12 January 2016, the judgment which LMP has obtained against LS is not per se an irregular judgment which engages in the court a mandatory obligation to set it aside: the conditions in CPR r 12.3(1) are satisfied and those in r.12.3(3) do not feature in this case.</span></p>

LS contends no such pack accompanied the documents which Mr Roberts, the trainee solicitor, served on her outside court on 12 January 2016.  She relies on his omission as significant because of her status as a litigant in person who was vulnerable because of her health and the ongoing stress of these proceedings.  She returned to Moscow within three days of service.  Her return flight to Moscow was pre-booked and she had no English solicitors then on record as acting for her.  She has shown me the clip of documents which she received on that date.  With the passage of time Mr Jordan cannot now be sure what he served on 12 January 2016.  The contemporaneous documentation which he prepared on the day of service (which is likely to be more reliable evidence) suggests that there was no response pack included with the claim form and the Particulars of Claim.  When completing the formal Certificate of Service later the same day, Mr Roberts certified as true that those were the two documents he had served and no more.  I appreciate that Mr Seeber recalls having included a response pack with the documents which were sent down to London some four days earlier by special delivery.  Mr Roberts does not recall removing anything from the clip before effecting service.   However, Mr Seeber&#8217;s recollection is qualified.  He makes it plain in his witness statement that this is his best recollection and not his clear recollection.  From a distance of over eighteen months and in the context of what was probably a busy commercial practice, I do not criticise Mr Seeber at all for not having an independent recollection of what he placed in the envelope or package on that particular day.  No doubt, the despatch of those documents was one small aspect of a full day&#8217;s work attending to many similar cases.</span></p>

During the currency of this long-running litigation there have been adverse findings against each of LS and RS in relation to their past dealings with various matrimonial assets.  I remind myself now, as I did then, that people may inadvertently fail to recollect accurately an event or series of events; they may deliberately mislead in order to bolster a case which they seek to advance; they may have a genuine subjective belief in the representations they make to a court regardless of the effect of the passage of time on memory.  In this instance, I am prepared to believe LS.  I accept that the clip of documents she produced consisting of the claim form and the Particulars of Claim with its various appendices was all she was handed by Mr Roberts on 12 January 2016.  That finding is not an end to the matter because the absence of a response pack merely opens the door to the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion.

When she was served in the precincts of the court on 12 January 2016, she was attending a hearing before me at which both she and RS were litigants in person.  That hearing related to applications for enforcement of the order for sale in relation to Property R in Moscow amongst other issues.  As both parties will doubtless recall, the hearing (which I believe had been listed for two days) was ineffective because of her pending appeal which in the early stages had been held up by the absence of a proper appeal bundle.  I seem to recall LS telling me on that occasion that she was lodging an appeal bundle that very day.  In any event, I had made it clear to both parties that, with an application for permission to appeal pending, I could not deal with an application for enforcement of the order which was the subject of the appeal.</span></p>

I accept that she did not enter a formal acknowledgement of service or file a defence to the claim but there is no doubt that throughout 2015, LMP was aware of what her case was because they were fully engaged in responding to the professional complaint which was being processed by the Legal Ombudsman.

As its title suggests, this was litigation concerning two substantial corporate entities involving a commercial claim in excess of US$10 million. The claimant secured an order permitting it to serve its Claim Form outside the jurisdiction on Saudi Arabia.  The claim form, without a response pack, was served locally in Saudi Arabia on one of the company&#8217;s representatives.  No acknowledgement of service was received.  In July 2013, the judge at first instance made an order retrospectively validating service in this manner under CPR r 6.15(2).  He ordered that judgment in default be entered although the defendant was not aware that this step had been taken until a year later in July 2014.</span></p>

The defendant relied principally on the failure by the claimant to effect valid service of the claim form outside the jurisdiction.  The judge found that there had been valid service pursuant to r 6.15 and that, in these circumstances, the default judgment was not irregular.  Further, the defendant had no arguable defence to the claim.  He therefore refused to set aside the default judgment although he reduced the sum owed.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The issue at the heart of the current dispute is the proper construction and legal efficacy of the &#8216;new contractual arrangements&#8217; which were put in place in March 2014 to govern the future professional relationship between LS and LMP.  There is no doubt that the original contractual terms were modified with the parties agreeing to move forward on the basis of a fixed fee agreement or arrangement.  That much is agreed.  The issue is the extent to which LMP&#8217;s entitlement to charge interest pursuant to its May 2013 retainer was carried across into, or incorporated within, the new retainer agreed in March 2014.   The point is not academic.  A very significant element of the six figure sum now claimed pursuant to the default judgment is interest.  LS relies on a specific or express waiver of the interest clause.  She bases that defence on representations made or assurances given to her by the firm both at the beginning of 2014 whilst she was in ongoing discussions with LMP and in July 2014 at the conclusion of the substantive distribution hearing.  Those representations have not, as yet, been set out in any formally pleaded case and thus LMP has not yet had an opportunity to respond.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The impact, financially and otherwise, of denying LS the opportunity to challenge the claim for interest advanced by LMP is potentially serious.  Enforcement of a judgment debt of a sum in excess of &#163;100,000 would have far reaching consequences in terms of her future financial security.  If the debt is found to be properly due and owing, then those consequences will have to be absorbed by LS to the extent that LMP chooses to enforce its debt inclusive of interest.  However, if the court were to find that the new contractual arrangements agreed in March 2014 did </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">provide for interest and/or that the terms of the original retainer in respect of interest had been modified or waived, LS could potentially suffer a serious injustice if the judgment is allowed to stand.  If LS can persuade the court that there were indeed specific discussions in or around January to March 2014 about a waiver of the interest provisions in the original retainer, she may well succeed in resisting the claim in relation to interest.  It will all depend upon the court&#8217;s assessment of the evidence which is presented.  In this context, it may well be said that she has at least a realistic prospect of satisfying the &#8216;real prospects of success&#8217; test for the purposes of setting aside at least part of the default judgment.  That is not to anticipate or prejudge the weight which a court will attach to her evidence or the evidence relied on by LMP.  I make it clear that I have not yet heard specific evidence on the point.  Because of the manner in which LS&#8217;s case has developed in its presentation whilst she has been conducting these proceedings in person, LMP has not yet had a proper opportunity to respond to the case which she seeks to advance by way of a formal Defence to the claim.  She, in turn, must realise that, should she fail in that defence, there may well be further cost consequences which will follow.</span></p>

This case has a long, complex and protracted history.  Whilst I have considered the issue of delay, on balance I do not consider that a sufficient basis for denying LS the relief which she seeks, at least in part.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Having considered matters carefully, I have reached a clear conclusion that the default judgment in the sum of &#163;107,361.07 should be set aside for the purposes of enabling LS to defend the claim in relation to the interest element of the debt.  It seems to me, however, that she has no arguable defence to the principal sum of &#163;69,906 which was the sum outstanding in respect of her costs at the conclusion of the distribution hearing.  Whilst she is entitled to look to RS for an indemnity in respect of that sum, my costs order does not, and cannot, displace the contractual liability which she has to pay that sum to LMP in respect of the professional services they provided.  Subject to the enforcement of that debt, LS herself has accepted that liability (see paragraph 26 of my judgment).  Mr Ilyas confirmed his instructions that LMP will not seek to enforce any judgment in that sum until the conclusion of the three day hearing in March next year (2018).  That was a generous concession, albeit a realistic one.</span></p>

The three day hearing in March next year will be absorbed almost entirely, I suspect, by issues relating to enforcement as between the former spouses and arrangements for the sale of Property R.  In addition, LS has an extant application in relation to ongoing financial provision for the children.  I am going to invite Mr Ilyas to give further consideration with his professional client to a draft order for further directions and the filing of any additional pleadings or evidence which may be necessary for disposing of the debt recovery proceedings.  LMP is, of course, a party to the matrimonial proceedings for the limited purposes of the recovery of its debt.  If matters cannot be resolved in the interim, then a listing will be needed for a separate hearing unless the court is able to accommodate an extension of the time which has been allocated to the existing hearing in March 2018.  I shall give permission for a copy of my judgment and any order which flows from it to be served on RS and any legal advisers he instructs.  Clearly, in the event that the hearing in March 2018 can be extended for these purposes, there will be no need for him to participate in the issue which has arisen as between LS and LMP in relation to the interest charges.</span></p>
