They each concluded they could not and each, in their own way, cautioned the court against straining the timescales for the rib fractures and the subdural injuries. It is clear that there is a considerable gap between the window for the infliction of the rib fractures, now postulated by Dr Chapman, to whom the other medical experts defer on this issue, and the window for the infliction of the subdural injuries preferred by all three medical experts. The date of these subdural injuries is further narrowed by the totality of the evidence which demonstrates that whereas L was normal but vomited in the late evening of 23 November, he was most certainly not normal by, at the latest, the late afternoon of 24 November when the father returned to the unit. There was a step change in L&#8217;s presentation. </p>

A non-perpetrator, however, would not notice anything out of the ordinary save that the child might seem out of sorts but it would be difficult to discern that anything was wrong with the child. </p>

All of them have considerable experience of caring for young babies and children, either in their personal lives and/or in their professional lives. There is not even the slightest suggestion that any one of them has acted inappropriately towards let alone injured a child in their care. </p>

This criticism could only be material if I concluded that VT, Ms. W and TH had entered into a conspiracy to conceal a time when L had been harmed. The prospect of this being the case is so risible that I can instantly and completely reject the same.

Such a description does not appear in the daily log, in their respective police statements nor in their statements produced in these proceedings. I express no view on whether VT and/or Mr. TH recalled these features only at a later date or referred to the same after having undergone training on the issue of brain damage in young children &#8211; when no doubt the significance of these signs was raised. What I do take from this evidence, especially that of Mrs. VT, is that when she held and fed L at about 10am on 24 November, he was simply not the same baby that she had fed and looked after on the morning of 20 November. The essence of their evidence is that L was not his normal self: hence the visit to the GP later that morning. In light of the expert medical evidence I am not at all surprised that a doctor, unfamiliar with the child, noticed nothing of great significance. I place a considerable degree of weight on the views and opinions of those staff members who, by then, knew L very well. </p>

To have so acted appears to be contrary to what I know of this father but it was cowardly, and worse, callous. </p>
