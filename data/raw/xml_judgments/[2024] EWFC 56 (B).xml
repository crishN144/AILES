An initial case conference was convened in December 2022 following the mother telling the local authority that her home is not safe for the children. In January 2023 the mother was arrested for assault and on suspicion of child neglect and causing unnecessary suffering to a child and whilst not charged for those offences she was charged for offences relating to her conduct against the police.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s acceptance that she cannot currently care for either child, again, is to be respected as a wholly child centred and focused decision and one that must be difficult for the mother to make. The fact is that the mother has an enormous amount of work to do in order to rehabilitate herself to a stage where it will be possible to sustain an alcohol free life, thus making it impossible for it to be considered to be in the children&#8217;s interests to be returned to the care of their mother.

All support and services to be provided to the SG and to the child by the local authority or other organisations should be set out in the SGSP which should be attached as an appendix to the order.

In making this observation, I do not consider that he was intending to depart from what this court had said in Re S, which was not referred to in Re P-S, and introduce any particular permanence threshold for the making of a special guardianship order. He was contrasting adoption and special guardianship; the above comment follows him saying that: "whatever the degree of permanence a special guardianship order provides for a child, the order does not have the same characteristics as an adoption order". Simply stated, the order is intended to provide greater permanence than a child arrangements order. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my view, rather than becoming unduly focused on what might be meant by the word "permanence", what is important is that the court should analyse and explain why the child's welfare interests justify the making of this order rather than a child arrangements order. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[72] </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(my emphasis).</span></p>

This generality, however, is not conclusive. The generality of an obligation regarding children in a local authority's area is not of itself inconsistent with the obligation being a duty in relation to the needs of individual children in the area. An obligation in respect of the general may include an obligation in respect of the particular.

In the meantime, and perhaps for years (possibly until she is 18), the local authority has identified a level of support that it concedes will be needed to support placement with the grandmother. The support is set out in the Special Guardianship support plan in the bundle. The table is in template form.

Drawing from the contents of the plan it is fair to say that the local authority acceptance of responsibility for meeting any of X&#8217;s needs and attributes is limited. This is not a criticism. It is a reflection of the role of the special guardian who must be regarded by a child as her carer primarily responsible for her needs. The responsibility placed on the grandmother is stated specifically to include schooling, GP and universal services. The local authority says that it will hold a Child in Need meeting every 4 to 6 weeks. The issue of contact with her mother is left entirely to the grandmother to support by way of supervision. Regarding contact with her father, the local authority says it will supervise this while X remains subject to a Child in Need plan. There is no suggestion that this will be a responsibility resulting only in the event a supervision order is made.</span></p>

A child arrangements order carries little sense of permanency; an application can be made to vary at any time. The process of applying to vary a child arrangement order would immediately involve X. As soon as an application was made to court, Cafcass would be required to carry out welfare checks and to provide the court with a safeguarding letter. Because of X&#8217;s age it would be untenable to expect Cafcass to provide this information without speaking to X. On the other hand, an application for leave to discharge a special guardianship order would not automatically lead to the involvement of a child subject to such order, as the procedural requirement for Cafcass to prepare the safeguarding letter does not apply to such applications. The application for leave would be considered by the court without X having any knowledge of the application progressing which would have the advantage of not disturbing X&#8217;s sense of security, unnecessarily.</span></p>

Children generally appreciate rules and boundaries. They need to know where they stand. This means they need to know who sets the rules and enforces of the boundaries. This is an essential element of parenting. Children who do not have rules or have conflicting or unclear boundaries struggle to progress to become functioning adults. As X grows, she will, as all children do, break rules and push against boundaries; this is a normal and essential part of growing up. Where a child is brought up by two parents, unless those parents are entirely consistent in how they set and enforce rules and boundaries, the child will learn how to manipulate and gain advantage from the inconsistency. The advantage of a special guardianship order being made, as opposed to a child arrangements order is that there will be one person making the rules and enforcing the boundaries which again will only add to the child&#8217;s sense of security. A child arrangements order would afford more flexibility and more opportunity for the mother to become involved in key decisions for X. </span></p>

Having listened to the local authority the court is entirely satisfied that the social worker is doing everything she can to promote contact and to support the carers in their duty to do so. The local authority has suggested mediation between FY and the carers which it would support.</span></p>

As Miss Mallon submitted, making an order for contact on the making of a care order is extremely rare, but in the circumstances she feels she has no alternative but to ask for a contact order. The difficulty that is perceived is that following the making of the care order the social work team will change and without a robust provision being incorporated into the final order further delay would ensue, leading to Y being deprived of forming an attachment to her father at this very early stage of her development.</span></p>
