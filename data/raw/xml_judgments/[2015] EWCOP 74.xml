The object of surgery would be to remove two very large ovarian growths or masses. All the medical experts and all the parties, including the Official Solicitor who represents CD, are agreed that it would be in her interests to have this operation. CD herself, who I met at the mental hospital where she is held, strongly expressed the wish to me to have the operation.</p>

Her behaviour since that time has been bizarre and violent. She has displayed extreme violence to members of staff and has had to be controlled with a taser.

The initial diagnosis of uterine fibroids but the diagnosis was later revised to ovarian fibrothecomas (i.e. muscular tumours, usually benign). Surgery was discussed with CD in July 2013 but she declined.</p>

Since mid 2014, CD has expressed delusional beliefs about the cause of the masses and delusional beliefs as to the consequences of surgery. She understood that she had a mass in her abdomen but she has variously described it as being a baby; that it has been caused by Clozapine; that the mass can disappear at times, that it is a &#8220;spiritual lump&#8221;; that it has been caused by an injection; and that there are spirits in her abdomen that will be crushed if the mass grows further.</p>

CD will lack capacity in relation to the treatment of her ovarian masses if she is unable to make a decision for herself in relation to that matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance (which may be permanent or temporary) in the functioning of her mind or brain. The issue of capacity is to be decided on the balance of probabilities.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment CD manifestly lacks capacity to make a decision about the treatment of her ovarian masses. CD&#8217;s diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and its effect on her thought processes constitutes an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain for the purposes of section 2 MCA. The evidence shows that CD&#8217;s delusional beliefs impair her ability to weigh up the benefits and disadvantages of treatment and to use that information to arrive at a decision for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> MCA.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2014 CD complained that the lump in her abdomen was getting bigger. An MRI scan confirmed this to be the case. Whilst ovarian fibrothecomas can be asymptomatic and left untreated, the large and increasing size of the masses in CD&#8217;s case were thought likely to cause pain, pressure on the back and pressure on the kidneys. A multidisciplinary clinical meeting was held on 19 October 2014 when it was decided that the most appropriate treatment was a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies (i.e. removal of the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries). This was considered the best course because (a) the tumours had grown significantly, and (b) malignancy could not be ruled out. Ms PA, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist discussed surgery with CD and, on this occasion, she said that she was keen to have surgery as quickly as possible. CD appeared to understand that surgery would result in the removal of her womb.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2014 a CT scan revealed that the masses had grown: the right one had increased to 22 x 15 x 12.6 cm and the left one had increased to 6.9 x 5.2 cm. Ms PA explained that the masses were equivalent in size to a 32 week pregnancy. Tests showed that the ovarian tumour marker was slightly raised which indicated that it might be a slow growing malignant tumour. If the mass were left untreated (and turned out to be malignant) there was an obvious risk to life. In the more likely scenario of the mass being benign, it was thought that the masses would gradually interfere with kidney function. An MRI scan in 2013 suggested that the masses were putting pressure on the left ureter. There was also fullness of the right kidney which can be an indicator of hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney usually caused by obstruction) or hydroureters (distention of the ureters due to blockage). If left untreated these conditions can lead to renal damage and failure. Ms PA did not feel that simply doing nothing was a sensible course of action because the masses were increasing in size.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The original intention was that surgery would be carried out by Ms PA under general anaesthetic with spinal diamorphine. A large incision would be made down the middle of the abdomen. The uterus, fallopian tubes, both ovaries and the masses would be surgically removed. Biopsies would be taken from the omentum and peritoneum. The operation would take about two hours. The wound would be closed and clips applied. In CD&#8217;s case, bandages would be applied to stop her from interfering with the wound. She would need to stay in hospital for about four or five days. A urinary catheter would need to be inserted during surgery and would need to stay in place for about 24 hours. A pelvic drain might also be required for a similar period.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A consultant nephrologist Dr SB, was asked to give his views as to the risks of leaving the masses untreated. In his first report, received on 4 June 2015, he noted that the masses were increasing in size and, in particular, that the right sided mass had increased by 30% in diameter. He considered that the presence of hydronephrosis (i.e. distention of the urinary draining system) could indicate ureteric obstruction, but he felt that the obstruction was only partial in CD&#8217;s case at that stage. The risks of ureteric obstruction are damage to the kidney consequent upon increased pressure within the kidney. Complete obstruction would lead to complete loss of kidney function which is irreversible. A further risk was that of infection consequent on urinary stasis behind the obstruction. Dr SB said that the time frame for permanent loss of kidney function was difficult to predict but that &#8220;&#8230;complete kidney failure could occur quite quickly&#8221;. If renal failure occurred then CD would require treatment with dialysis and long-term follow-up. Dr SB said that the mild hydronephrosis is likely to require a stent to protect the kidney. If that were not possible, a nephrostomy would need to be performed (i.e. passing a needle through the back and into the kidney, threading in a stent) with a stent requiring placement every six to 12 months.</p>

He said: &#8220;These show normal renal function with no change over that time period. Although this does not definitively rule out L sided partial obstruction, it is reassuring&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr SB provided answers to a series of questions on 29 July 2015 and made a further witness statement in which he explains that the risk of obstruction remain &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; if nothing is done to remove the masses but that, if they continue to grow, kidney obstruction would lead to increasing damage, possible complete loss of kidney function and a heightened risk of urinary tract infection. He says: &#8220;At this time it is not possible to meaningfully predict at what point these complications will manifest or become irreversible&#8221; but that not removing the masses will probably lead to these complications.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A joint nephrology/psychiatric report was prepared by Dr FH and Dr SB. Dr FH is of the view that CD will comply with kidney function monitoring to an extent (only blood tests). She does not think CD will comply with ultrasound monitoring. Dr SB explains that blood testing is useful but would only detect significant obstruction and at a later stage than ultrasound imaging would. Earlier detection would lower the risks of surgery because it would minimise the risk of pre-operative renal injury. For example, a degree of damage might occur to one kidney before there was any marked change in the blood tests. Whilst having only one properly functioning kidney does not constitute an immediate threat to life, there is a risk of renal damage caused by surgery to remove the ovarian masses. The risks of operating on a patient with two properly functioning kidneys are therefore lower. Dr SB&#8217;s view is that, if surgery is inevitable at some point anyway, then it is better to do it sooner rather than later in view of CD&#8217;s partial compliance with monitoring. Dr FH explains that, if CD developed bilateral kidney failure, she would not be able to comply with life-sustaining treatment (eg, dialysis).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Murdoch says that, although the ovarian tumours might be malignant, they are more likely to be benign. He thinks that the estimated risk of malignancy (low grade with low propensity for metastasis) at 20 &#8211; 25% is reasonable. With the evidence to hand at the date of his first report (30 September 2015), Mr Murdoch expressed the view that the tumours would continue to grow and cause serious complications within two to five years. However, Mr Murdoch was later sent a report of a CT scan dated 5 October 2015 (the scan was performed on 30 September 2015). These indicated a much slower rate of growth, possibly because the tumours were outgrowing their blood supply and/or because previous measurements had been inaccurate. This &#8220;extends the potential interval before severe compromise of the patient occurs&#8221; and Mr Murdoch now estimates that CD will &#8220;run into trouble&#8221; in about six to seven years.</p>

He draws attention to the fact that, as a gynaecological cancer surgeon, his experience of seeing neglected cases of curable cancer means that he is generally in favour of early treatment for suspected cases. However, he thinks it is inevitable that without surgery that CD will die. It is assumed that, in the light of his revised opinion as to rate of growth this will be in six to seven years when CD is aged 49 &#8211; 50. In the meantime CD&#8217;s condition will only deteriorate over time thereby increasing the risks of surgery. On that basis, Mr Murdoch thinks that it is in CD&#8217;s best interests to have surgery &#8220;soon&#8221;.</p>

If the masses continue to grow, Dr Newstead sets out the risks to CD&#8217;s health (distension, urinary frequency, bowel function disturbance, decreased exercise tolerance, leg swelling and DVT). He says there is a future risk of obstruction of one ureter which would not result in renal failure. However, Dr Newstead thinks that: &#8220;The longer surgery is delayed the larger the masses will grow, the more extensive the surgery will be and the longer the patient is exposed to the risk of complications&#8230;&#8221;. If surgery is to take place, Dr Newstead makes a number of recommendations as to the planning and recovery stages.</p>

Where, as here, there is no doubt about incapacity then the wishes and feelings of the protected person cannot alter that fact even if they happen to align exactly with a rational, "capacitous", decision. CD cannot make such a decision. It has to be made for her.

It isn't, he says, so she is ineligible and so the necessary orders have to be made under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. The problem with this interpretation is that it gives rise to a result directly contrary to the intention of the statute and to the express terms of the Code of Practice, as I explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> at paras 10 &#8211; 14 (accepting the submissions not only of Ms Butler-Cole but also of Ms Dolan, on that occasion instructed by the Official Solicitor). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My first conclusion, based on the evidence principally of Dr FH, is that CD lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings and to make her own decisions about whether to consent to the medical treatment as set out in the Care Plan, including surgery to remove large ovarian growths.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My second conclusion, based on the totality of the medical evidence, and on CD's wishes and feelings, is that it is in CD's best interests that the operation must take place and an ancillary authorisation of deprivation of liberty must be made. My decision would be the same if CD was resistant; and if she does change her mind the operation must proceed nonetheless, and for this purpose restraints may be used. However, based on my meeting with CD, I am pretty confident that this scenario will not eventuate. The stark medical fact that overarches everything is that if the operation does not happen CD is likely to die within six to seven years, and much sooner if the masses are cancerous. </p>
