It was specifically directed at PX&#8217;s parents. For reasons that will become obvious, it was important for me to explain to them the decision I had made, and to make it clear that nothing I said, and nothing any of the other participants in this case have said, should in any way be interpreted as criticism of them. On the contrary, everyone, myself included, admire their love and devotion to their son and the difficult decisions they have made over his care and residence, which have placed his interests at their centre.</p>

There were no child protection concerns at the time- indeed, PX was never on a child protection plan- hence a care order could not be made in this case because the threshold is plainly not met. As the documentation makes clear- he submits, and I agree- PX was accommodated because he as a child in need and not because there were child protection concerns. </p>

That is because his parents decided that PX needed a care regime that the local authority could provide. If they had kept PX in their control and had reached the point where they could no longer care for him and keep him safe and were not willing to ensure others provided that care, then he would have been at risk of significant harm as a result of being out of parental control. </p>

Many cases of the sort considered above, and this case, involve difficulties experienced by parents struggling to manage the issues raised by their children&#8217;s condition. Sometimes there is a disagreement or dispute between the parents and the authorities precipitating the involvement of the State. However, in this case, there is no dispute. The parents recognised the need for their son to be cared for by a professional team of carers in a setting dedicated to his needs. At that point they called upon the local authority to provide that care and to meet his needs. That is what has happened, and PX is now doing well.</p>

I am reminded of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Leicester City Council v AB</span> [2018] EWHC 1960 (Fam), where a mother developed an illness that prevented her from providing care for her child. As Keehan, J. said the threshold was not met where she had done &#8220;what any reasonable parent would do&#8221; and arranged for the local authority to care for the child. Although the factual scenario is different in this case, I cannot help but describe what these parents have done as what any reasonable parent would do.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am further fortified in my view by the actual reason care proceedings were commenced. I am satisfied that proceedings were brought because the local authority believed it was unlawful for the child to be accommodated pursuant to s. 20 of the Act for the long term. That is not only an improper reason for bringing care proceedings, but also an inaccurate interpretation of the law. As Ms Harvey for the local authority accepted, there is no time limit for the use of s. 20, and there was no need for care proceedings to be issued in this case in any event: see Baroness Hale in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Williams v Hackney LBC</span> [2019] FLR 210.</p>

It seems clear to me that where a child is being accommodated under s. 20 in agreement with the parents, the parents have a child focused approach to the care plan and work well with the local authority there is no need for an order at all. It certainly is not in the child&#8217;s welfare interests for there to be one.</p>

Or, to put it another way, to place such a terrible responsibility on the shoulders of parents. I was encouraged in that position by Baroness Hale in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span>. She emphasised the reason for Article 5 protection: to avoid arbitrary action, abuse or at the very least acting to restrict a child in a way that does not serve his best interests. Without the Article 5 safeguards there is &#8220;no way of ensuring that those with parental responsibility exercise it in the best interests of the child&#8230;.&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having reflected on this, and in the absence (I thought) of a properly considered High Court judgment dealing with the issue of under 16-year-olds post <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span>, I was minded to follow the clear logic of Baroness Hale. I had no hesitation in deciding that the restrictions imposed on PX should attract full Article 5 protections, which means a Court review, even though he is only 15 and his parents would consent to them on his behalf if they could. These are considerable restrictions, and they go far beyond what any parent should be called upon to approve or authorise. In my view, there is always a danger that good and devoted parents such as PX&#8217;s might simply follow the advice given to them by clinicians and social workers who are, after all, agents of the State.</p>

As I understand it, Article 5 is not engaged unless and until the matter is referred to a Court. At that stage if, and only if the Court then concludes that it has to override the parent&#8217;s decision because it is not in the child&#8217;s best interests, is Article 5 engaged. That is because it is the Court that is authorising the State detention of the child rather than the parents, and the subjective limb in Article 5 is present.</p>
