I agreed to allow M to travel with the respondent to England in June 2016 and stay there for a month with the understanding that the respondent would register her in a school.  The agreement was that M would return to Pakistan, then M and I would travel to England together so that we could start a life together as a family.  Our daughter had never had this opportunity.

A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case.  What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.  It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever.&#8221;</span></p>

This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection.  What is his 'home' country?  Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this.&#8221;</span></p>

Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests.  A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.  But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer time future is decided than it would be to return.&#8221;</span></p>
