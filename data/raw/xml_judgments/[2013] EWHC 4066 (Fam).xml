Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent improbabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.....It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable. Someone looking after the child must have done it. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied.&#8221;</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in">&#8220;The trial of a preliminary issue is the first, but essential, stage in a complex process of child protection through the medium of judicial proceedings.&#160;It is for the purpose of satisfying that threshold that the local authority seeks to prove specific facts against the parent or parents. Only if it succeeds in that task can its application for a care or supervision order proceed. Thus the preliminary issue of fact constitutes the gateway to a judicial discretion as to what steps should be taken to protect the child and to promote his welfare. In those circumstances we must robustly reject Mr&#160;Cobb&#8217;s submission that the local authority should refrain from proceedings or discontinue proceedings in any case where there is a substantial disagreement amongst the medical experts. For the judge invariably surveys a wide canvas, including a detailed history of the parents&#8217; lives, their relationship and their interaction with professionals. There will be many contributions to this context, family members, neighbours, health records, as well as the observation of professionals such as social workers, health visitors and children&#8217;s guardian.&#160;In the end the judge must make clear findings on the issues of fact before the court, resting on the evidence led by the parties and such additional evidence as the judge may had required in the exercise of his quasi-inquisitorial function. All this is the prelude to a further and fuller investigation of a range of choices in search of the protection and welfare of children. A positive finding against a parent or both parents does not in itself preclude the possibility of rehabilitation. All depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.&#8221;</p>

Explanations given by carers and the credibility of those involved with the child concerned are of great significance. All the evidence, both medical and non-medical, has to be considered in assessing whether the pieces of the jigsaw form into a clear convincing picture of what happened. In the current case, it is correct that the evidence upon which the local authority relies is circumstantial evidence. No one saw the mother do anything suspicious and numerous nurses and other witnesses have testified that nothing the mother did put them on enquiry. The mother has made no admissions of any kind and has always denied harming her child. The cogency of the circumstantial evidence depends on its quality. It can range from the peripheral and unhelpful to compelling and cogent, and therefore it is necessary to test the various elements.&#8221;</p>

It is used to alert a fact-finding tribunal, that is a jury in a criminal trial, to the fact that a lie told by a defendant does not of itself necessarily indicate guilt because the defendant may have some other reason for lying; that is, he may lie for innocent reasons.  A witness may lie because she lacks credibility, or because she has an innocent motive for lying. If she lies about the key fact in issue, that is one thing; if she lies about collateral facts, that may be quite another.  A judge of fact may not be able to separate out every fine distinction, but may nevertheless conclude that an allegation is proved, despite the fact that the witness has lied about other matters.</p>

He told me that the vast majority of arteriovenous malformations bleed into the substance of the brain. No bleeding was found on post mortem examination in the substance of S&#8217; brain. Accordingly one had to consider a dural arteriovenous malformation. These are incredibly rare and in 31 years of experience as a neurosurgeon he had never seen the spontaneous rupture of a dural arteriovenous malformation in a child. He added that an arteriovenous malformation was an extremely rare event, it was an extremely rare event for an arteriovenous malformation to rupture spontaneously and extremely rare for the evidence of the existence of an arteriovenous malformation to disappear. </p>

The antenatal clinic had made a referral to social services after the mother had attended there for her first appointment when 35 weeks pregnant and when the nursing staff detected the smell of alcohol on the mother&#8217;s breath. In response to a question from the social worker whether she had been drinking before that antenatal appointment the mother asserts that she confirmed she had had a drink that night. The social worker is adamant the mother denied having had anything to drink. The social worker accepted she had made minimal notes during her meeting with the mother. She was clear, however, that rather than closing the referral, as she did, she would have contacted her manager and progressed the matter to a core assessment if the mother had admitted drinking. In my judgment that is compelling evidence. I prefer the evidence of the social worker and I conclude the mother is lying in her account.</p>

At the early stage of her evidence she told me she heard a few groans from S over the monitor. A little later she told me there was nothing from S and that she had not got up to S that night. Under cross examination by Mr Samuels QC she said that S first woke at 23:50 but she did not remember if she got up to give S some juice. She said that at 3am she thought she heard him call &#8216;mum&#8217;. Then she said she could not remember whether she or the father gave S juice in the night.

On the basis of the medical evidence and the severity of the eye injuries, if S had suffered his injuries before the father attended to him that morning he would not have been remotely normal. The father&#8217;s explanation that S was normally drowsy when he first woke up will not do. This was a devoted and dedicated carer. I cannot believe he would not have been aware for some 20-30 minutes that this child was seriously unwell. I remind myself that the father says he washed and dressed S.

As I have found the parents have each been untruthful about the events of 20 April and 21 April. I do not know what happened in that house from the late evening of 20 April to the time of the arrival of the ambulance at 9:32 am on 21 April. I do not know why the father left the family home after 10pm on the Saturday night. I do not know what was said in the 5 texts they sent to each other between 22:18 and 22:25 that night. I do not know clearly who did what in terms of childcare throughout that night. </p>

I simply do not accept they have forgotten such significant events the night before and morning of the day that a much loved and cherished child suffered severe and fatal injuries. </p>

As the evidence stands, however, I cannot reach a clear finding on the degree and nature of that collusion and it would be unwise for me to speculate about the same. </p>
