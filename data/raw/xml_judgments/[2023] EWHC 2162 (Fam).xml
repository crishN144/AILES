They met in Amsterdam in 2015 and married in September 2016. B was born in August 2017. They divorced in June 2022. At the same time a Dutch Court made an order that B has his main residence with the respondent and should reside with the applicant from Friday to Monday. The Dutch court noted it had jurisdiction over B&#8217;s welfare. In May 2022 the respondent left B in his father&#8217;s full time care. She left The Netherlands. On 6 August 2022 the applicant took B from his home in The Netherlands to the respondent&#8217;s parents&#8217; home in England where she was living. The applicant says this was for the purpose of a three week holiday. The respondent says it was for B to come to England to live permanently. Since then, B has not returned to The Netherlands. The applicant objected to B remaining in England in written correspondence in August 2022. In March 2022 he contacted the Dutch Central Authority. On 9 June 2023 the applicant&#8217;s application for the summary return of B was sealed.  </span></p>

He submits none of the exceptions are made out and B should be returned. Mr Basi submits the applicant did not consent to the August 2022 relocation and the facts demonstrate he has not acquiesced since. He also submits the case on intolerability is not made out and even if it were to be, there are sufficient protective measures. I am asked to return B and reminded that the Dutch court (which made clear it exercised jurisdiction in respect of B) made a custody order as recently as June 2022, only two months before the removal to England, and an order that B must be returned to his country of habitual residence for the Dutch courts to resolve matters between the applicant and respondent.  </span></p>

Mr Jarman submits that since 27 August 2023, the applicant  has acquiesced. He points to the limited steps taken by the applicant between August 2023 and June 2023. Further, he submits it would be intolerable for B to return to The Netherlands, given the mother&#8217;s likely position if she returned and there are not sufficient protective measures.

Therefore, the return of the wrongfully removed or retained child to his or her State of habitual residence not only restores the status quo ante, but it allows for the resolution of any issues related to the custody of, or access to, the child, including the possible relocation of the child to another State, by the court that is best placed to assess effectively the child&#8217;s best interests.

In doing so, rights of custody existing in the State of habitual residence are respected in the other Contracting Parties. In dealing with the prompt return of children, the Convention does not deal with the merits of custody and access, which are reserved for the authorities of the State of habitual residence (see para. 15 above).&#8221; </span></p>

The Convention does not provide that, when an order for return to the child's homeland is made, the child should stay there indefinitely. All the Convention provides is that the child should be returned for the specific purpose and limited period to enable the court of her homeland to decide on her long-term future. That is all it decides.</span></p>

I endeavour to summarise their summary.  Consent must be proven on the balance of probabilities by the party alleging consent was obtained. Consent is an exception to the principle of return. Consent refers to consent given before the act of removal or retention.  Consent need not be proved by evidence in writing or other documentary material as parents may not have reduced their agreed position in respect of their children to a written document. It is appropriate to consider the parents&#8217; conduct in the context of all the evidence before the court. Consent is not however a purely private &#8216;state of mind&#8217; which need not be communicated. Consent must be seen in the context of family life, not the rules of contract law.  Consent can be withdrawn at any time before the actual removal. Consent must be real. The task of the court is to find as a fact whether the parent subjectively intended to and did give unconditional consent to the removal. Had the parent clearly and unequivocally consented to the removal?</span></p>

As to that, there are compelling reasons why the removing parent must be aware of whether or not consent exists. The first is that as a matter of ordinary language the word 'consent' denotes the giving of permission to another person to do something. For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb ("avait consenti/had consented"): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children&#8217;.</span></p>

An international Convention, expressed in different languages and intended to apply to a wide range of differing legal systems, cannot be construed differently in different jurisdictions. The Convention must have the same meaning and effect under the laws of all contracting states. I would therefore reject any construction of article 13 which reflects purely English law rules as to the meaning of the word "acquiescence." I would also deplore attempts to introduce special rules of law applicable in England alone (such as the distinction between active and passive acquiescence) which are not to be found in the Convention itself or in the general law of all developed nations. </span></p>

When the &#8216;consent&#8217; is checked by reference to the applicant&#8217;s email of 12 August 2022, in which he is clear that he has only agreed to a holiday, I do not find support for the respondent&#8217;s case that the &#8216;consent&#8217; conversation (on some unknown date) took place.

I do not find it likely that the applicant &#8211; who had always resisted B residing in England - would have made plans for him to attend a Dutch School in late July, then changed his mind in a matter of days and agreed for him to reside in England and then in a matter of a few further days changed his mind back.

However, I note that the Dutch court made a custody order providing for B to spend weekends and many holidays with his father in June 2022, long after the allegations were raised. I also note the Dutch court dismissed the mother&#8217;s proceedings which raised domestic abuse. It is also the case the mother placed B in her father&#8217;s sole care for several months up to August 2022. She also stayed with B at the applicant&#8217;s home in May 2023, albeit briefly and in the presence of the father&#8217;s new partner. </span></p>

The court cannot confidently discount all risks. Taking the respondent&#8217;s case at its highest, and without making any findings of fact of domestic abuse, there is a risk of the mother being placed in a situation of having communication and co-parenting with the applicant until the Dutch courts can resolve the long term issues. This may plainly impact on B and place him in an intolerable situation. </span></p>

I am not entirely clear as to her employment status since August 2022. The applicant asserts she has some self-employment. She lives with her parents. The father&#8217;s unchallenged evidence is that her parents support her financially. Her own evidence about the high cost of apartments in The Netherlands was not altogether persuasive, particularly if only short term arrangements are required. Again, however, the court cannot confidently discount all risks and again without making findings of fact and taking the respondent&#8217;s case at its highest, I proceed on the basis that the combination of these factors could place B in an intolerable situation. The respondent&#8217;s mental health was also raised but there is no up to date medical information before me and I cannot simply assume a relocation to The Netherlands to permit the Dutch courts to consider matters would impact her mental health to the extent that it would be intolerable for B in the future.

In such circumstances you were wrong not to find a return of the child would be intolerable.&#8221;</span></p>

The applicant seeks a summary return of B to The Netherlands on 2 September 2023, in the light of the impending Dutch school term beginning.  He submitted that: &#8220;The father is concerned in respect of the child commencing a new term of school, which coincides with the timing of a new term in the Netherlands. Further, the respondent mother is also bound by a Netherlands Family Court order which is being breached due to the passage of time, in that the father is not having contact as per the order as a result of the retention.&#8221;</span></p>

First, I did attach weight to both the passage of time from September 2022 until issue of the application in June 2023 and the applicant&#8217;s limited indications of seeking B&#8217;s return post September 2022. At paragraph 72 above, I noted: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I accept he took minimal outward steps to communicate to the respondent that B should be returned</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; and at paragraph 79 I returned to that theme in respect of the May 2023 visit to The Netherlands. I also noted it would be unfair to penalise the applicant for the March to June 2023 delay, which I understand was caused by legal aid matters. </span></p>

I attached appropriate weight as the trial judge having heard the oral evidence and having read the written evidence. In assessing all the factors, I placed greater weight on the 12 August 2022, 13 August 2022 and 2 September 2022 communications in writing, which would have left the respondent in no doubt that the applicant had not acquiesced in her plan to retain B in England, contrary to the Dutch order. That position was never withdrawn. The respondent candidly admitted in oral evidence that she did not take the email of 12 August 2022 seriously. She should have. </span></p>

I have sufficiently considered the practical circumstances for B on his return and the risks to him. He is six. He will likely be at school. He has supportive grandparents in the Netherlands. His mother will have access to &#163; 600 or so per month from the applicant alone for three months. This may not provide for the type of accommodation she would want. However, I am satisfied, for the short period I am concerned with, that it would not place B at risk of being put in an intolerable situation. I also think it likely, as I explained above, the respondent&#8217;s parents will assist her and therefore B. In an ideal world the court would have had greater evidence of resources of the applicant, the respondent and the costs of a range of accommodations in various appropriate towns in the Netherlands. However this is a summary jurisdiction and a prompt resolution of the issue means the court must do the best it can on the evidence available. Therefore, I do not consider it is arguable that I have made an error of approach or approached the issue of protective measures in a manner that is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">plainly</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> wrong.</span></p>

I was acutely conscious of the impact on B of his return to school. Time is now very limited. That being said, justice requires that the respondent should be able to properly instruct her legal team to prepare an appeal. It is important I also note that comity between the Dutch and English and Welsh judicial authorities counts against unnecessary delay, given the on-going breach of the Dutch order. </span></p>
