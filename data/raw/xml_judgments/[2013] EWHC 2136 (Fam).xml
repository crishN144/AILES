When making the adoption order at a hearing that lasted some three days, the District Judge declined an application made by the Applicant for the setting aside of a placement order.  He further did not make any order for direct contact after adoption.  It is against those decisions that this appeal is now brought.</span></p>

Further, when considering arguments about the manner in which the trial judge approached matters, the question that the appeal court must ask itself is whether the judge was wrong.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In this case it is not suggested by any of the parties that the District Judge approached the task before him on the basis of a wrong understanding of the law.  Although it is right to say he did not explicitly mention the relevant Convention rights, the overall effect of his judgment clearly shows that he well understood the significance of the relationships involved and dealt with them respectively and with appropriate seriousness.  It might have been better had he attached a label, but nothing turns on that at this point.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">What is said on behalf of the Applicant is that the District Judge weighed the evidence wrongly in reaching the conclusion that an adoption order should be made.  Although the Applicant is still a young adult there is a long and difficult history stretching back into her own childhood.  In June 2008, S, her first child, was removed from her care.  At that time she faced multiple difficulties arising from her personal background, her use of drugs, a relationship with S&#8217;s father, who was entirely unsuitable to be a partner or a parent: her life was, on any view, chaotic.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">S was made the subject of a care and a placement order in December 2009, and was eventually adopted in May 2011.  The Applicant then began a relationship with the father of T; again, somebody unsuited to that role, and the relationship caused the Applicant the very greatest of difficulties.  It continued until March 2012 and during it she was the subject of considerable domestic abuse.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">T was born, as I have said, in December 2010.  Against this background it was rightly considered that the Applicant needed help and support and that T needed a degree of protection.  The Local Authority, having taken care proceedings, arranged for the Applicant and baby to be placed in a foster home together, so when T was aged only a week old she went to live with Mr and Mrs G.  As matters turned out, T has remained with that family ever since.</span></p>

The test, which appears at Rule 30.3(7) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 is that an applicant must show &#8216;a real prospect of success.&#8217;  I would simply record that so far as I am concerned no further elaboration of those words is necessary or helpful.  I would not, with respect to Mr Justice Mostyn, follow him in regarding it as a term of art or in focusing on the word &#8216;fanciful&#8217; derived from a previous Court of Appeal authority as an antonym to the word &#8216;real&#8217; in the rule; or of finding synonyms to that antonym, particularly the synonyms &#8216;capricious, whimsical or absurd.&#8217;</span></p>
