	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns the second Respondent who I shall refer to as D. He was born in 1962 and is therefore now 49 years old.  It is common ground, and I have previously declared, that he lacks capacity to litigate and to make decisions as to where he should live and the basis upon which he should have contact with members of his family and others.  The present proceedings raised issues as to where he should live, contact and whether D is being, or would be, deprived of his liberty.  At an earlier stage in the proceedings D's mother, the first respondent, was asserting that he should return to live with her.  On the advice of counsel, D's mother no longer pursues that argument.  It is however clear from her oral evidence that she still wishes D to live with her.  That oral evidence also made it clear that she does not accept, or is not prepared to accept or acknowledge, the existence of a number of points that support the conclusion that it is not in D&#8217;s best interests for him to return to live with her.  Those points are clearly established by the evidence or are common ground. Emotionally this is understandable but it places significant difficulties in the way of any such return and is relevant to the issues that arise relating to the long term purpose of contact. This is because it means that she does not, or is not prepared to, recognise a number of the problems and difficulties that would have to be addressed by her, with the help of others, if D was to return home. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At an earlier hearing I gave a number of directions.  These resulted in the preparation of a schedule setting out (a) allegations which the applicant local authority was seeking to prove to support the removal of D from his mother&#8217;s home and its position that it was not in his best interests for him to return to live there, and (b) the responses of D's mother to them.  In my judgment, it was correctly common ground that it is now not necessary for me to hear oral evidence directed to the disputed allegations to properly inform my decision on D's residence or his contact with his mother.  I shall return to this.</p>

His father died in 1997. It is clear that his mother made promises to him that she would look after D and that this is what she wanted to do, and did do for a number of years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout his life D has suffered from significant learning difficulties and behavioural problems.  These are the source of his lack of capacity and they placed considerable burdens on his parents in caring for him.  In the latter part of the 1990s he demonstrated agoraphobia and since 2004, at the latest, he has had significant difficulties with his eyesight and was diagnosed with advanced glaucoma in 2005.  The present position is that, notwithstanding recent laser surgery to relieve pressure, he is effectively blind and his prognosis is that he will not regain any sight.  He has also suffered significant problems with his teeth.  All his upper teeth have now been removed, as have a number of his lower teeth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the death of his father in 1997, D's mother was primarily responsible for his day-to-day care until September 2008 when D was removed from her care.  Over that period D had some respite care and the reports from those who provided that care are to the effect that D's mother was generally cooperative with them.  One of the places at which D had respite care was at B Rd.  I mention this because, as appears later, D still mentions this placement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from the records, which form part of the evidence, that over the period culminating in D&#8217;s removal from his mother's care there were a number of issues raised between the local authority and D's mother concerning her care of D, her co-operation with social services and the help provided by social services.  These included issues concerning hygiene and safety.  The latter include issues concerning the mother&#8217;s drinking.  D's mother does not accept that many of the points made against her are true and she gives explanations as to others.  Her overall position on the written evidence is that the criticisms made of her are not warranted and certainly did not warrant that the removal of D from her care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the following account of the immediate circumstances that triggered the removal of D from his mother's care is effectively indisputable.  They are that on the evening of 24 September 2008 the mother was arrested at around 10 pm and detained in custody overnight.  The incident leading to her arrest involved alleged violence between her and her then boyfriend and third-party observers at the time have recorded, and there is no reason to believe that they have not correctly recorded, that the mother was or clearly appeared to be drunk.  As I understand it, the incident leading to her arrest took place at, or in the vicinity of, the mother's home. The next morning the police visited her home and the door was answered by D whose appearance and behaviour alerted the police to the fact that he was a person suffering from disabilities and who was unable to fend for himself.  The police therefore made contact with the local authority and social workers went round to the house straightaway to check on D's welfare.  These social workers could not gain entry and sought the assistance of the police.  This was given and entry to the house was made by forcing the back door.  D was found in his bedroom and was taken to one of the respite homes he had stayed at before and where he was well known.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the months leading up to this removal, the records show that there were live issues relating to the state of the home, and that the relationship between D's mother and social services had deteriorated to such an extent that she was refusing to allow the relevant social worker access to D at her home and to attend meetings to discuss his care.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mediation has taken place between the parties and this has been one of the reasons why the case has not been determined earlier.  In February 2009, a move to B Rd was attempted but this failed after a short period of time and D was returned to the respite placement.  In March 2010, D moved to his present placement and in June 2010 regular supported weekly visits by D to his mother at home commenced.  These were increased to twice-weekly in June 2011.  It is clear and common ground that D enjoys these visits.  An open door policy and practice has been applied to contact between D and his mother at his present placement with the result that, by prior arrangement, the mother can visit D there when she wants to. The manageress of the care home told me (and I accept) that D enjoys such visits and if they clash with, for example, an outing he prefers the visit.  D&#8217;s mother and the care home have been able to avoid many such clashes. More such contact would be available to D&#8217;s mother, for example, by her taking part in activities or outings.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The view of Mr Sinclair, an independent social worker instructed by the Official Solicitor, the local authority and the Official Solicitor is that D&#8217;s present placement is an exceptional one.  In large measure this flows from the expertise, work and approach of the staff and management at that placement.  I have had the benefit of hearing evidence on two occasions from the manageress of that placement and the content of her evidence, and the manner in which she gave it, confirms that view of the quality of the placement.  As Mr Sinclair pointed out, and I recognise, the ownership and management of placements can change.  I have not forgotten this, but there is no indication that this is likely to happen in the near future.  It is also to be remembered that however good the care provided in such a placement those who provide it cannot provide the love and familial support that is given by family members who themselves have Article 8 rights.</p>

Mr Sinclair in his oral evidence indicated that if he was now starting with a blank piece of paper he might well not recommend overnight contact.  But he said that, given where we now are, he supported it being tested on a human basis just in case it showed that D would be missing out on something he might &#8220;fantastically enjoy&#8221; if it was not tried.  He was unable to identify how it would be ascertained that D so enjoyed such contact over and above day time contact.

The first plan (Plan A) that it put before the court envisaged that the first overnight contact would be in December this year.  As a result of exchanges in court concerning the change to unsupported contact, over the adjournment of the hearing it helpfully prepared a second plan (Plan B) which provides a much longer timeframe and the introduction and trial of unsupported daytime contact as a first step.</p>

There may be problems encountered in those stages but it was not suggested that the risks that they might destabilise D&#8217;s present regime and its consequences for him could not be successfully managed and taken into account in deciding what further unsupported contact should take place.  If successful that stage of Plan B will lead to unsupported daytime contact that should enhance the normality of D&#8217;s life and his contact with his mother who loves him and looked after him until he was in his late forties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.43in">To my mind, an important feature of the assessment of the risk that unsupported overnight contact will be destabilising and so damaging to D is the present attitude of his mother that I have described earlier.  As I have said in my view it is likely that the mother will co-operate with Plan B but whether, as is hoped and planned, this leads to a better understanding by her of the views and successful work of others and/or of the advantages to D flowing from the stability and regime introduced into his life at his present placement, is in my view very uncertain.  It will require a significant change from her position and understanding demonstrated in the witness box.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.43in">In my view, that oral evidence of the mother provides the basis for an argument that overnight contact should be ruled out now.  This is because it showed that the prospects of significant changes in the mother&#8217;s position and understanding were unlikely and although she has and will co-operate, absent change, her position and lack of understanding are most likely to have a destabilising effect when her unsupported contact with D increases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.43in">Further, my present view, is that, absent significant change in the mother&#8217;s position and understanding, the risk of that destabilisation occurring as a result of unsupported overnight contact is not worth taking because of the significant risk that (absent that change) it will have damaging knock on effects both to D and his mother, which include damage to the contact they both now enjoy.</p>

Secondly, and in any event, I have concluded that she should have that opportunity (or it cannot be ruled out) because contact generally, and in particular changes that introduce unsupported daytime contact and an assessment of their impact, create a dynamic situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.43in">It would be a significant step over and above unsupported daytime contact and it carries greater risks than daytime contact both in respect of the mother&#8217;s perception and the practicality of providing help if there are problems during the night.  In my view it should not be attempted until there has been a successful trial of unsupported daytime contact over a period of at least 6 months to a year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.43in">Given the mother&#8217;s age, D&#8217;s abilities and care needs, the way in which infrequent overnight contact connected to special events might be explained to him and the greater likelihood of him being confused and destabilised by more regular overnight contact, I am of the present view that it is unlikely that more regular overnight contact (and/or a regime of shared care or a return home) will ever best promote his interests.  It follows that I agree with the Official Solicitor and the local authority that Plan B should be implemented on the basis that it is not aimed at a change of residence or a shared care regime.  But, the dynamic situation it will create and the point that it is yet to be determined whether unsupported overnight contact should be trialled mean that in my view a limit on any overnight contact to infrequent and special occasions should not be set now.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">At present, it seems to me that in the exercise of the welfare jurisdiction and approach under the MCA the most important issue is whether consent or authorisation should be given to a care regime on behalf of a person who does not have the capacity to give consent himself.  That question is not determined by whether or not the person is being deprived of his liberty but by an assessment of whether the care regime is in his best interests.  This will necessarily include a determination of whether a less restrictive regime would promote P&#8217;s best interests and when reviews should take place.  </p>

But the approach of s. 4A (3) and (4) which refer to &#8220;giving effect to an order made under s. 16(2)(a)&#8221; recognises that the crucial issue is the best interests issue and not the question whether there is, or is not, a deprivation of liberty.</p>
