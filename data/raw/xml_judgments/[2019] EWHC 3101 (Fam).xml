	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application is supported by a draft order which Mr. Simon Calhaem of counsel has drafted on behalf of his client, the claimant, and it is split essentially into three blocks.   He seeks interim payments at the rate of &#163;8,511.78 a month, backdated to 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 and payable thereafter on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of every month until further order.    He seeks that the respondents pay or cause to be paid to the claimant an interim payment of &#163;20,000 in order to repay funds loaned to her by Scott Saunders.   He seeks an interim payment of &#163;55,578 for the purposes of meeting the claimant&#8217;s legal fees up to and including the FDR hearing.  I should say that the FDR has not yet been listed and if there is a court-led FDR, I think we are all agreed that it is unlikely to happen until the early part of, or even the spring of, next year. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application was listed today for two hours.   I should say, so that counsel are aware, that in most of these cases where the time estimate is obviously hopeless, it is very likely that they will be sent out without having been heard, however urgent the case may be, unless of course it is urgent in the sense of relating to the welfare of, or danger to, a child.   However, we have been lucky today in that one of the cases that was listed was not effective.   Nevertheless, we have effectively taken the whole of today to hear this case and if I fail in the course of this necessarily ex tempore judgment to set out every argument that has been put before me, it is only because I have not had time to deal with each and every point.  It does not mean to say that I </p>

	  <subparagraph>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">have not had them all very much in mind. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The starting point in relation to this case, having set out the provision which is sought by the claimant, is to express concern, if not astonishment, at the level of costs in relation to today&#8217;s application.   The claimant&#8217;s costs - and this is just for today and not the claim overall &#8211; are just over &#163;18,000.   The costs of the third and fourth defendants, who are two of the children of the deceased, are &#163;37,880.  Remarkably, I am told that the executors of the estate do not even know what their costs of today are, and I should say that if any of the lawyers in this court appear in front of me again not knowing what their costs are for the application in front of me, I will have a lot more to say about it than I have done today; but, if I take the executors&#8217; costs as being the same as the claimant&#8217;s (and I note that the claimant has instructed &#8211; I hope I can say this without any disrespect &#8211; much less expensive solicitors than the third and fourth defendants), then that means that the overall costs of today are in the order of &#163;74,000.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">That is to be set in the context of the total amount claimed today by the claimant of &#163;75,000 in terms of the lump sum plus the &#163;8,511 a month to which I have referred.  It cannot be proportionate for so much money to be spent on this issue and it is very sad indeed that the parties have been unable to settle today&#8217;s application. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It would be wholly wrong for me today to criticise anyone in particular because, first of all, this is an interim hearing and I have made no findings of fact; and, secondly, I dare say that a great deal more has gone on behind the scenes than I am privy to, because of course I understand how these things work; but I hope, if nothing else, that the parties who are in court today will reflect upon the fact that if this were a commercial deal rather than a family row, they would not have spent this amount of money on this litigation because it would not be commercially sensible to do so, and the only way they are going to settle this litigation - whether it be next week or some time next year - rather than fight the case, the only way they are going to do so is by standing back and taking a commercial view, on advice.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I understand that these Inheritance Act claims are often very distressing.   It is all the more distressing in this case because I have been told, and I accept, that the claimant, Mrs. Weisz, and the children of her late husband&#8217;s marriage and therefore her step children, all got on perfectly well before her late husband died, and it is therefore especially tragic that they are now locked into emotional and expensive litigation. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have already said during the course of discussion in court today, and repeat, that there are many forms of dispute resolution available, which are very well known to all the lawyers in this case, and I would hope that a private FDR or mediation would effectively settle this case: because somebody sitting as, whether it is a mediator or a judge or a chair of the meeting, would be able to express a very frank view, having heard not only what I have heard, which is the parties&#8217; open positions, but having got behind the detail and looked at their &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; positions.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">That is the beauty of that process.  The person who chairs those meetings really knows what people are thinking rather than seeing on paper what their positioning or posturing is, and when I say &#8220;posturing&#8221; I do not mean that there is anything dishonest about it but we all know in litigation there is the open position, which is one thing, and the &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; position, which of course I shall not and cannot know, which is something completely different in most cases. </p>

That is something that will be gone into, I daresay, at the final hearing if that has to take place; but, it is fair to say that although this was not the longest of marriages, it was long enough that the claimant plainly has a legitimate and would have had a legitimate claim to make on divorce for at least an element of sharing, albeit that it would have been possibly viewed more in the context of a needs case.  That is, of course, not the territory we are in.   The reality is that this has become a claim under the Inheritance Act.      </p>

The claimant was also provided with a car which was under a lease from the deceased&#8217;s company.   In circumstances which it is not necessary for me to go into today, the car lease was terminated and the car removed from the claimant.   Whether that was spiteful, legitimate, commercial or not, it is not for me to postulate for the purposes of this judgment because I have heard no evidence, but I can well understand that, when you are already trying to come to terms with bereavement, that to find that your car is taken away from you with or without notice, because there is an issue about that for which again I cannot conclude, it is not going to speed this litigation towards a happy conclusion.  It may be that on reflection people think that they could have dealt with things a little bit differently, but now is not the time for looking back.   What I have to do is to look forward. </p>

Mr. Richardson says to me, correctly, that it would not have gone on forever.  I accept that; but, what I have been trying to look at is the history of what was being spent and there is a debate about that, but plainly what was being spent in recent years was not only the available net income but also the draw downs against the director&#8217;s loan account.    </p>

They will of course stop on the date when the case settles because then, if it settles, what I am ordering will be replaced by whatever the parties may agree; but, if there is an FDR which fails, the FDR judge cannot deal with a renewed application for interim provision because he or she is expressly prohibited from having anything further to do with the case, except to make consensual directions.   The reason for that is obvious: the judge will have got into the detail of the &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; negotiations in the case and the judge cannot thereafter make orders other than by consent.   That is a very well established principle in the Family Division and we are hearing this application under the Inheritance Act in the Family Division, but I am quite sure that the FDR process in the Chancery Division would apply that same basic and obvious rule. </p>

It may be, if that happens, that it would be sensible for that application to be made to me if I am available and if I have not done the FDR, because then it would be a rather shorter hearing as I have some familiarity with the case.       </p>

I am against him on this.   Mr. Calhaem tells me, and I accept, that his client has borrowed an old Peugeot 106 with a leaky roof.   I do not think that the late Mr. Weisz would have wanted his wife to be driving around in an old Peugeot 106 with a leaky roof when there is an estate of over &#163;4 million, and I am afraid I find the estate&#8217;s attitude in relation to this heading a little unsatisfactory.   </p>

If, on cross-examination at the final hearing, it is found that &#163;1,300 on petrol or diesel was far too much, then the parties can pay their lawyers three times as much as they will save to argue over that heading.   Good luck to them if they seek to do that, but I hope that common-sense will prevail. </p>

Unfortunately Mrs. Weisz has not identified in her statement any ongoing dental treatment or eye treatment, happily; but, it sounds to me as if, for example, optician is including at least one good pair of glasses which I should hope she could avoid having to buy for the phase of this litigation, and I do not know, as I say, whether there is ongoing dental treatment or not, but the amount claimed is &#163;2,600.   I am going to allow &#163;1,000 for that amount, which means I am taking &#163;1,600 in relation to this block. </p>

I am sure that this has been a hideous phase of her life and I hope that those who are on the other side of this litigation will recognise that, just as they have suffered from bereavement as well; but the idea that there is no money under this seems to me to be plainly wrong.   On the other hand, to claim &#163;20,000 for holidays for the course of the next year or so, I do not I am afraid find that it is possible to reconcile &#163;20,000 on holidays with the phrase &#8220;immediate need&#8221;.    Again, doing the best that I can, I am going to allow under this heading &#163;8,000 instead of &#163;31,400, which means that I am taking &#163;21,850 off this item. </p>

Well, I do not know and I do not want to know what charities they are, but of all the items for the estate to query, this is not a meritorious one, a requested expenditure of only &#163;1,000 per year would seem to be de minimis. I recognise, of course, that charitable donation is entirely a matter for the individual, but given that the amount that Mrs. Weisz seeks to give each year to charities is about one hour plus VAT of the defendants&#8217; solicitor&#8217;s time, that rather puts it all into context.    </p>

What I have done, therefore, is that I have taken &#163;40,730 off the budget which reduces the budget to &#163;61,411, which is &#163;5,200 a month.   The amount offered by the estate was &#163;4,000 a month.   I am going to order that &#163;5,200 a month be paid, backdated to 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, with credit being given for payments received since that date.

There is nothing to prevent Mrs. Weisz bringing a further claim of course under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> if she wants to.   I do not encourage her to and if she has evidence that proves this, well then she can produce it.   I very much expect that this debt will be taken into account by the Judge, if it has to be determined by a Judge at the final hearing and that money will be given to Mrs. Weisz to repay that what seems to be an entirely legitimate debt; but there is no evidence before me which categorises it as an immediate need and therefore I reject the claim in relation to that amount. </p>

Perhaps he should be careful what he wishes for, because if he ends up losing this litigation there could of course be an enhancement of the fees that Mrs. Weisz would have to pay, but in those circumstances the estate themselves might be ordered to pay.   It seems to me that it is not necessary when Mrs. Weisz has found, I daresay in very uncomfortable and emotional circumstances, a firm of solicitors that she is happy with and counsel that she is happy with, why should she have to go and change horses and spend time and possibly money looking around for a lawyer who may take this case on a CFA basis?   I do not think that it is her duty to do that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr. Richardson has not advanced the argument that she should go out into the market and borrow from one of the well known litigation funders.   My experience in family law litigation is that firms such as Novatas typically charge 18% compound interest.  They provide a necessary and invaluable service in the right case.  However, my attitude if it is a divorce situation where the paying party makes the financially less secure party go and borrow money at 18%, is that I make the paying party pay that interest back to them when the case is over, because I think it is totally wrong to make, in some cases your spouse, but in this case the claimant, go and borrow money at an expensive rate like that when there is money in the estate or in the matrimonial estate as the case may be, to make provision for that funding. </p>

The third and fourth defendants are entirely entitled to choose the solicitors that they want and they have gone, I note, to a firm with particular expertise in tax issues, and so it may very well be that there is some saving in that regard; but, given what I have said, I therefore allow the claim in the full amount claimed for costs in the sum of &#163;55,578 for the purpose of meeting her legal fees up  to a concluded FDR hearing.   That would be on the basis that the sum paid in relation to costs will be paid to the claimant&#8217;s solicitors and will be held by them in respect of the costs that are incurred up to and including the end of that FDR.   They will return to the estate any monies which are not utilised and will obviously account in the normal and proper way for all the sums that they have drawn down in relation to that amount. </p>
