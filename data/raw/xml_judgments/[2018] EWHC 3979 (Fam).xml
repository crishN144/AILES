	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0in">I have throughout borne in mind the extreme complexities of this situation for the parties. In the first place there are very significant language problems for the parents. They have been assisted by their own interpreters and the Court Interpreter deserves a mention and the Court&#8217;s thanks for his assistance which I found to be exemplary. However, the parents have struggled at times and the quality of the interpreting support they have received at various stages in this case has not been consistent. Their preferred language is Arabic but both of them can manage with French. They do have some English but it is not very competent. The mother uses predictive text and the father uses Google translate. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">They speak to the children in both Arabic, French and sometimes in English. The children themselves are highly articulate and bright individuals.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0in">There is a further aspect to this case which has been of note: the dichotomy between the family circumstances outside the Court room and what has been happening inside the Court room. The evidence within a fact-finding hearing is set and must be limited but in this case all present have been very conscious of things unfolding outside the parameters of this exercise. Both parents have felt unwell. There has been chit-chat between the children. DQ has been trying to communicate with his mother.  </p>

He has chosen not to take part in this case nor has any evidence been filed on his behalf. It is therefore a complicated task to form a fair impression of events to which he is connected.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0in">Finally, there is the cultural aspect of this case. There are huge pitfalls associated with making cultural assumptions and applying stereotyping to a family whose cultural origins and heritage are North African, but where they have lived in the UK throughout the lives of all the children.  I have been alive to these pitfalls throughout. I have been cautious when considering the more generalised information and guidance provided by Kim Baines from the Forced Marriage Unit at the FCO, approaching this case as I must on its own facts.  </p>

In 2008 there were reports of uncontrolled behaviour by DQ and the Chronology contained in the first statement of the Social Worker Mr Bell sets out the difficulties and concerns between then and 2015.  In that year, BQ, who is believed to have some degree of learning difficulty, came to the attention of the local authority in the context of her mentioning at school a concern related to forced marriage at the end of that year, and again in June and July 2016.  It was suspected that she might travel to Syria, and DQ was reported as showing interest in Syria. The family was therefore &#8220;on the radar&#8221; for culture-specific issues. </p>

As a result there was a reference to the integrated team for families. Due to lack of cooperation and language difficulties little was achieved at that juncture.  </p>

DQ reports being taken out a lot by his uncle to places after this time. There is something of a lack of evidence as regards what the situation really looked like from the children&#8217;s point of view between April and June when they returned. </p>

On 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May DI Richards who was in charge of the case received an email which appeared to have been written by the mother on the family email account which is in DQ&#8217;s name. It essentially asked him to leave her and the children alone and refused to &#8220;give him&#8221; her children. She states she did not write this. The next day the father was arrested and interviewed. He asserted that he had not understood the interpreter on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, and refused to answer questions about arrangements for the return of the children and his reasons for refusing to sign the authority. He denied telling DQ&#8217;s school that the children would not be returning and denied knowing their address. He was therefore charged with breaching the FMPO by failing to immediately provide written authority and make any travelling arrangements for the children to return from the country in North Africa.  </p>

From meeting her and reading the papers, she seems to me to have had a lot of very burdensome worries, and still to have a lot of vulnerabilities, but at the same time is wanting to get on and lead a normal life and make the most of her education.  </p>

None of what has happened this year has essentially been their fault no matter what they have done, and they are not to feel guilty or responsible for the things which have gone on. Their parents have put them in this situation. They do need to put things behind them and try to start afresh. They need to settle into a normal and healthy life where they are not troubled any longer by these events, and to get any professional help they need to do well. They are not to blame for what happened in the country in North Africa and they are not to feel responsible for the troubles within their family. </p>

DQ had had significant issues for some time, including issues about his identity, and his behaviour at school had been extremely troubling. CQ was bunking off college where she was taking her GCSEs with significant frequency and appears to have almost disengaged from education. She now says that she was in a sexual relationship which she was concealing from her parents and had had a number of pregnancy scares. On her account her boyfriend is an unidentified criminal who has now been incarcerated for seven years.  </p>

She was not going to be told what to do.  Her objective was at the very least to impose conformity on CQ and DQ and force them to realise the error of their ways, but also to get away from the UK.  </p>

She has had to bear the burden of these intrigues in which she has become inevitably embroiled, which is a sad situation, and her confusion is clear. It is lucky that she has been able to speak about matters to her counsellor and friends. It is axiomatic that she has been pressured one way or the other either to lie or to retract and the impact on her childhood of her family members&#8217; extreme actions, which have played themselves out in her school setting, is a matter which will concern me. She is clearly adored but she has not been protected from the troubles of this year.  ix)<span style="font-family:Arial"/>The events of this year, and these proceedings, have been destabilising and hugely difficult for the whole family. There is a great contrast between the mother and the father. She assumed the role of disciplinarian and has treated CQ and DQ in an inappropriate and authoritarian way. The father is not perceived by the children in the same light as they see the mother. He has a more benign approach, but acquiesced to her actions to the detriment of the children. The parents&#8217; understanding of the significance of these matters is not as clear as I would have expected, given the quality of their legal advice, and there are clearly cultural differences at play which will continue to require understanding. </p>

Also key is the difficulty in getting to the truth of matters such as this where lies have been told and where motives are strong. The ages and background of the children are also factors, as are the cultural imperatives and outlooks which cannot be simply taken for granted. It has not been difficult to expose lies and discrepancies and indeed, some of those lies have been accepted. The difficulty lies more directly in the individual motives for lying and the smoke created which obscures some important underlying aspects of the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">I cannot follow her retraction as reliable. My assessment of CQ is that she has decided that she wants everything to go back to normal and the easiest way to do that is to wipe what happened out by categorising it as a lie. That suits her aim of reuniting the family and relieves her of the responsibility of having made such serious allegations. The burden on her has been compounded because of the fact that she appears to have been running a clandestine relationship which she was having to conceal from her parents at the time she was in the country in North Africa. However, her reason for wanting to come back because she had a boyfriend here is only part of the picture behind her decision to try to get back, in my judgment. I have viewed her initial interview with the police, which is broadly consistent with that of DQ and EQ and is probative. I have also considered the fact that she has obviously embellished her accounts at times: it was not true that her passport was taken, for example, nor that she had been very </p>

I have doubts whether a knife was used to threaten DQ &#8211; neither he nor EQ can confirm this. These matters were things she had told her friend, rather than the police.  Other matters remain unresolvable. Embellishment of her original account is understandable as she was so keen to get away and clearly scared. However, it does not negate the underlying account.

However, in relation to her attitude towards her children, she was very keen to be believed. It may be that in the aftermath of these events she has reflected and adopted a more liberal outlook towards DQ and CQ, but I am not satisfied that, at the time, things were as light and untroubled as she has tried to make me believe.

It serves little purpose to unpick them all, save to say that it means that he is not wholly reliable. I find that he tended to give whatever answer suited him to the police at the time for the non-return of the children such as the fact that there was unrest in the country in North Africa or that his wife would divorce him if he was proactive, which renders his accounts unconvincing. He was disconnected from the detail of the evidence possibly because of language and cultural matters but also somewhat wilfully in my judgment. My impression is that he was at times nebulous and at times evasive and reluctant to give a straight answer. His lies to the school have not assisted his credibility as they clearly demonstrate a lack of regard for the truth, no matter what his intention. His response to the court orders also demonstrated a lack of regard for the orders of a powerful and authoritative court concerned primarily with the welfare of children.  </p>

The reason I found the initial interviews so compelling is that they were well conducted but there is an internal consistency in what was being recounted by each child that goes against the proposition that they had fabricated most of their accounts.  Had these been largely fabricated accounts in my judgment there would not be such consistency in relation to some of the key allegations.  </p>

However, in reality their lives were rooted in the UK. The prospect of not being allowed to return was clearly very real and upsetting for them. The text messages between DQ and CQ are also helpful as a window onto their feelings about their mother&#8217;s behaviour. They were even pleased that EQ might go into care on return because <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she wouldn&#8217;t have to do the madness we did&#8221;.</span> They agreed about the mother: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;She has ruined our lives&#8221;.</span> In my judgment, even for teenagers, that infers a great deal more than just drama and annoyance at missing out.

They were aggrieved at missing out on things back in the UK, as EQ indicated. However, it is likely that their motivation for seeking assistance was far more substantial than teenage rebellion or misbehaviour. </p>

This is ironic given the obvious value they place on a good education and the opportunities it offers.  The summer term is a critical time for exams and moving on smoothly to the next academic year. In DQ&#8217;s case, there was clearly a significant need for him to get back and be supported in his education which had been suffering seriously. In CQ&#8217;s case, she had failed to engage in her education at college. She missed vital exams for her future progress. EQ missed out on months of education. The continuity all the children required was lost. Where there are set curricula, missing such periods is very detrimental and all the children will have had to catch up.

That meant that they would have been automatically under pressure to lie to the school on their return if they were asked about their health.

I find she was acquiescent towards Uncle M when he is said to have hit DQ, and her support of him punishing him.

I have no evidence that there was any order in place in the country in North Africa preventing the children&#8217;s return. I have no explanation from the mother or father as to why this is. They were ordered to produce the evidence that they had about it. There is repeated reference to it by them, to the High Court in the country in North Africa, to a judge and to orders, at the very least suggestive that there was some form of official intervention. The mother refers to having launched a case against the British Embassy for retaining the children and the father believed that they had been kidnapped by the British Embassy. She appears to have initially believed that they had been picked up when they were out by the British Authorities, but that is clearly not the case. There are possibilities: either there was no such action taken, or there was, and either there is no documentation, which is highly unlikely, or there is, </p>

I was struck by the parents&#8217; rather defiant evidence on this point. The mother said that the local authority could get the evidence if they wanted it, and there were treaties about it. The father echoes this. I am not satisfied that there was any obstacle created by the legal system of the country in North Africa to the immediate return of the children. If I am subsequently proved wrong about this, it is difficult to understand why the children eventually returned seemingly without any difficulty from the country in North Africa&#8217;s authorities. The identifiable obstacle was the father&#8217;s contempt of this court by refusing to sign his permission for the children to return. I find that he refused and procrastinated at the mother&#8217;s behest. I note the evidence of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March, where he stated that if he signed the authority his wife would divorce him. I find that he said that, despite his attempt to gloss over it. He was indicating that his wife was in control and that he was not prepared to go against her decision to remain </p>

It is axiomatic that her education was neglected. It is also likely that she suffered significant emotional distress, sufficient to drive her to take extraordinary measures to get back to the UK. Seeking refuge at the embassy was not just wilful or impulsive. The whole experience must have been disruptive and frightening. There is no evidence that she suffered physical or sexual harm, though sexual and cultural issues are likely be tied up with the emotional load upon her. Her mother&#8217;s actions do in my judgment amount to emotional neglect in that she was punitive towards her. I am careful to identify that one set of behaviours and values which may prevail in the setting of a North African country do not necessarily prevail in the UK. CQ was brought up entirely in the UK, and has lived a life with usual freedoms including the ability to choose a boyfriend for herself. Therefore, the mother&#8217;s behaviour towards her in the country in North Africa must have had a significant impact. There is no previous history of her parents treating her in such a harmful way before now. </p>

She appears to be living a normal life with her father, with plenty of freedom, and she is going to college to get her education back on track, but there are clearly issues with her mother. In my judgment there is a risk to her of pressure from her family, whether it be pressure to conform which may put her at risk of living a double life, or to threats of punishment, or pressure to keep silent, or to lie.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">It is difficult to predict future risks in this case. There is a lot to be resolved in terms of parenting and creating an understanding and acceptance in the parents of what is safe and appropriate. In my judgment both of them appear to have been operating at a distance from the needs and the realities of their youngest three children. In BQ&#8217;s case, because she does not present any particular challenges, the poor and harmful parenting which has occurred has not been so evident, but with the younger three, the parents&#8217; evident difficulties to act in a child-focussed way, honestly and protectively during this family crisis has been fully exposed, and the family will need support to begin to reverse and address some of the damage done. </p>
