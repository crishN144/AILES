K and L have been in a relationship for several years and married in 2023. They do not have children. They live and work in the United Arab Emirates (&#8220;UAE&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">The Local Authority has concluded negative assessments of F and G and of H (supported by J). It would not support D being placed with either couple nor with F alone. The Guardian agrees. The Local Authority proposes placement with K and L in the UAE. Again, the Guardian supports that proposal as does the Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO). E does not have capacity to conduct this litigation and is represented through the Official Solicitor who does not oppose the placement of D with K and L. The Local Authority invites the Court to make a Special Guardianship Order (&#8220;SGO&#8221;) in favour of K and L but accepts that such an order cannot be made at the current hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">The circumstances are unusual. There are no other family members in the country where K and L live. Due to various reasons discussed in this judgment, it is extremely unlikely that E, F or G could visit D in the UAE. Any SGO that the Court might make could not be enforced in the UAE and were D to move to live there then this Court&#8217;s powers to enforce contact or protect D&#8217;s welfare in any other way would effectively be lost. There has been virtually no period in which to test K and L&#8217;s care of D. Practical issues and the desire to avoid delay mean that when K and L next visit this jurisdiction, in early December 2024, then if an SGO is to be made in their favour it ought to be made then so that they would return to the UAE with D without further delay in these proceedings. </p>

It is surprising, in the light of that evidence, that there could have been any confidence that E might be able to care for D as her parent. E was said by Dr Swart to have &#8220;extreme difficulties with communication.&#8221; She is quick to become distressed when under what to others would be regarded as mild stress or pressure.

They have discussed their personal issues and I commend them for their openness. When giving his evidence, F was precise and showed that he had thought through for himself, and with G, the concerns of the Local Authority and Guardian about the prospect of them caring for D, or F caring for her alone. He told the Court that he would fully support D having contact with E, with H and J, and with K and L and other members of the wider family. He told me that he would have support from his sister and friends. I found F to be honest although anxious to put the most positive gloss on the issues that have caused concern about his ability to care for D either with G or alone.

Until the end of April 2024 contact was at E&#8217;s home but an incident on that day, caused the Local Authority to move contact to the contact centre. The contact officer who was covering for the usual officer who was on leave, arrived with D almost one hour late. E could not manage her emotions and said she would not allow D to be returned to her foster placement. E was not responding to cues from D and would not take advice or guidance. Part way through the contact session, H left. It is fair to say that E calmed down and that H had previously been advised to try to step back to allow E to develop her own parenting without too much prompting. However, the Local Authority has suggested that H&#8217;s departure was surprising given the very difficult circumstances at the time.

They reported her having called them &#8220;thick&#8221;, &#8220;stupid&#8221; and telling them to &#8220;fuck off and die&#8221;. On being told of these reports, H &#8220;because quite upset at this and was sitting forward, shaking her head and &#8216;scoffing&#8217;.&#8221; As a result of what her sons had reported in their references, H accepted that on one occasion she had thought her husband had been cheating on her and she slapped him. He pushed her aside and the police had been called. She had not referred to this incident previously during the assessment. One of her son&#8217;s had reported that H had chased her husband with a knife but H denied this saying that there had been an incident when her husband had chased a man out of their house with a knife.  H denied ever having left the children without notice, as they had alleged. H accused her ex-husband of having poisoned their sons and having made up lies about her. However at a later session with the assessor, H did then speak of an incident where she had left the home for a few days because of difficulties in the marriage and had relied on the boys&#8217; father to tell them. </p>

H became quite frustrated and raised that she does not understand why the information was relevant as it was &#8220;20 years ago&#8221; and &#8220;not true&#8221;. H told me that it was not relevant a number of times during this discussion to which I advised it was and that it gave us an understanding of her parenting and the relationship and lived experiences of her children, however, H denied this was true and therefore did not feel it was relevant. J was more balanced with this and advised it would &#8220;not matter if it was 20 years ago or 5 minutes&#8221; and that it would cause concern for professionals if the information was being reported. </p>

Their relationship is mutually supportive, but it is relatively recent, having begun about a year ago. G has many needs and heavily relies on F for care and support. One of his requirements is a quiet settled environment in the early evenings. This is designed to prevent him suffering seizures at that time of the day. He needs structured routines for toileting and eating. He has had very significant mental health challenges in the not too distant past. F himself has suffered mental health difficulties including at the time of the breakdown of his relatively short-lived relationship with E. Of course, he knew that she was pregnant at that time and so the end of the relationship would have been difficult for him. He was unable to work at that time and has not since returned to work. F and G have found much to gain from each other but their relationship and their own health would be jeopardised by the introduction of D into their family.

His alternative plan would leave G, the person he loves, homeless and without F&#8217;s day to day care which has been so beneficial to him. F could not stand by and see G suffer, as would almost inevitably be the case. D would effectively be the cause of the end of what appears to be the most positive relationship F and G have each ever experienced, which would give rise to all sorts of potentially harmful emotional dynamics in which D would be embroiled as she grew up.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">In fact, having regard to all the evidence, it is clear to me that whatever qualities H may have, she is impetuous, she is very defensive and prone to confrontational, angry outbursts when she feels she is being disapproved of or that others do not share her convictions. H does not readily take responsibility for her own actions and behaviour:  she finds it difficult to face uncomfortable truths and becomes evasive and sometimes dishonest in order to gloss over her own mistakes. At times in the past she has dealt with difficult situations by walking away. Her sons say they experienced this to their detriment. She showed the same tendency again in July this year when she reported that her relationship with J had ended. She was absent when D and E needed her when the Local Authority was considering removing D from E on the first day of D&#8217;s life. She left E during a family time session at home when E was clearly heightened and acting in a way that was potentially harmful to D and caused the Local Authority to move contact to a contact centre. She walked away from difficulties in her relationships with her middle and youngest sons during the course of these proceedings cutting communications with them rather than dealing with emotionally difficult issues.</p>

In fact, she moved out of the house in which they had been living together. She took the trouble to call a social worker to announce that the relationship had ended. Six days after she had moved out, she was still reporting to the Local Authority that the relationship had ended, and when T visited on 16 July, she was given the clear impression that whilst H and J were prepared to work on their relationship, they had not yet reconciled. H had moved her furniture out of J&#8217;s house. It has not yet been moved back. The pattern of their relationship changed. I am sorry to conclude that H has sought to gloss over what was clearly an event in the relationship of more significance that she is prepared to admit. </p>

When the references were introduced in discussion with her and she was told that her sons&#8217; accounts of their childhood were different from her own, she said, &#8220;they would be.&#8221; In her later text exchange with her younger son she was scornful of him, writing that he knew &#8220;fuck all as usual&#8221;. The evidence points to longstanding tensions in the relationships H has had with her sons, of which she was very well aware, but which she sought to dismiss or minimise.  She has exhibited considerable anger against her sons during these proceedings which is consistent with their claims about her parenting. She shouted at the social worker who raised their references with her and, T reported, she slammed the door on her. In oral evidence H said that she pushed the door hard and did not slam it. She did however write to apologise to T for her &#8220;rude and offensive language&#8221;. Later, she verbally lashed out at her sons by text, as discussed. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">H had agreed to support E during her labour and she did so even though she had been up in the early hours of the morning because of a health crisis affecting J&#8217;s father. She was very tired after the birth and went home. Very soon hospital staff were sufficiently disturbed by E&#8217;s handling of D that they contacted the Local Authority and they then made contact with H. At that point H knew that there were significant concerns and a risk that D might be removed from E&#8217;s care. Arrangements were made for her to attend a meeting in the afternoon of the first day of D&#8217;s life. I need not repeat the detailed evidence but in short H missed that meeting and D was removed from E. The Local Authority&#8217;s position is that even though H must have been very tired she did not prioritise D by ensuring she was present at the hospital when very important decisions were being made about D&#8217;s care. On this issue, H has given what I regard as inconsistent evidence. For example, she has said she feared she might have Covid and did not want to risk infecting staff at the hospital but has given different evidence about taking a Covid test. During cross-examination, when it became apparent that she would have known from taking a test that she did not have Covid, she said that the lines on the test kit were faint and so she thought the test was equivocal. She had never said anything of the kind in her witness statements or in discussions with social workers. She appeared to be making up her evidence on the spot. I found her evidence on the issue to be evasive and not credible. As with her evidence about the difficulty in her relationship with J that arose in July 2024, it is the lack of credibility of H&#8217;s account that is as troubling, or even more troubling, than the substantive event itself. She gave the Court the clear impression that she was glossing over or covering up the truth because it was uncomfortable to her or because she thought it would cast her in a bad light and harm her case.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">Not long before the hearing, J asked to be considered as sole carer for D. This was a surprising application because he and H have told the Local Authority and the Court that they remain as a couple. In his evidence, J accepted that it had been a mistake and he would only be a support for H. However, when giving her own oral evidence earlier at the hearing, H said if J became D&#8217;s carer, then he would stay at home and she, H, would go out to work (reversing the current position) and that she would support him as D&#8217;s main carer. This was not credible. I conclude that H was anxious to say what she thought would prevent D from being placed abroad rather than to be frank and realistic. J has only met D on two occasions despite ample opportunity to become more involved during the proceedings. J was honest with the Court that he was not proposing to be the sole or main carer for D. H was not so honest.</p>

It is right to note, as was accepted by the Local Authority&#8217;s witnesses, that during family time with E and D, H has prompted E in various ways to help her to learn how to meet D&#8217;s needs. Their concerns were said to be wider. In the future, would H be able to regulate E&#8217;s time with D. Would she keep D safe even when E wanted to look after D alone? Would her focus be in protecting E? It became abundantly clear to me, from the written and oral evidence, that the primary reason why H is so vehemently opposed to D being placed with K and L, is the effect on E, not the consequences for D. That is understandable &#8211; she is E&#8217;s mother and E is a vulnerable person &#8211; but it does underline the Local Authority&#8217;s position that E rather than D is H&#8217;s priority. H considered that E&#8217;s pregnancy and then motherhood would be &#8220;the making of her&#8221;. Given E&#8217;s conditions, the capacity assessment, and her behaviour since D was born, H&#8217;s optimism appears to have been very misplaced. It reflects her focus of motherhood on E rather than the likely consequences for the baby, D.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">It is of significance that the three of H&#8217;s children who have capacity do not support her as D&#8217;s Special Guardian. I make no findings about specific allegations but I cannot ignore the content of their references as reported by T, nor H&#8217;s response to those references. I acknowledge that H has not seen the references and cannot conduct a forensic exercise in response to them, but she told me that some of the claims they made are wholly untrue and that she regards them as motivated by the desire to support K and L as Special Guardians for D. None of the evidence in this case suggests that K  and his brothers would together concoct serious allegations against their mother for that purpose. Nor does any of the family history suggest that they would lie so callously in order to hurt their sister. H had already had a negative viability assessment before K and L put themselves forward to care for D and they appear genuinely to want to keep her within the family. Sadly, H&#8217;s responses to the references, show that she cannot see beyond her own narrow perspective. She has allowed what is an admittedly very difficult and sensitive situation to drive a wedge between her and her sons. Her texts to them, her conduct when her younger son was due to see D for the first time, and her response to seeing K on 9 July, show that she cannot manage her emotions when it comes to this dispute within the family.</p>

However, she appears to have expected that they would give a different account of their childhood than her own which shows, at the very least, that this was not the first time she had become aware of their feelings about her parenting. The text exchanges give the same impression. H also told me that she had a &#8220;very difficult&#8221; relationship with K: that comment tends to show a longer history which is not linked to his desire to become D&#8217;s Special Guardian.</p>

I hope I do not do him a disservice by summarising very briefly that once D travelled to the state in question and resided there, the Court&#8217;s orders in this jurisdiction would have little to no effect. Furthermore, the courts and authorities in that state would then govern any disputes about D&#8217;s upbringing. It would be possible to invite the courts in the UAE formally to record an agreement or consent order &#8211; in effect a private law order. It appears to me that any such agreement or consent order would not exactly mirror an SGO but could record agreement as to contact, for example, and record the parties&#8217; acceptance of parental responsibility. However, E does not have capacity to enter into any such agreement or to give her consent and I do not know if F, G, or H would be willing to do so. Thus, if the SGO is made in favour of K and L, and D travelled to the UAE to live with them there then, in reality, this Court would lose control over D&#8217;s welfare and any contingency planning would be unenforceable.</p>

They will also ensure D has contact with other maternal uncles and her maternal grandfather. I am confident that they will provide good parental care to D within a stable and loving family. They will meet her needs during her development. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">I agree with the negative assessment of F and G as potential carers for D and regard it as unrealistic for F to propose that he cares for D alone. F and G have their own needs and vulnerabilities that make them unsuitable as carers for D. The introduction of her into their family would risk creating instability making her long term care in that setting unsustainable. In any event there would be a serious risk that she would suffer harm as a result of the need for F and G to care for each other rather than focusing on her welfare. I acknowledge their emotional commitment to D and am not at all critical of their approach in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">H, supported by J, could certainly give practical care to D. At present she is emotionally warm to D and she has an established relationship with her. Placement with H under an SGO would allow for more family time with her parents than D would have were she to move to the UAE. There are therefore important factors in favour of placing D with her maternal grandmother. Nevertheless, the Local Authority has concluded that these are outweighed by negative factors. H&#8217;s relationship with her sons is very troubling. Were D to have an experience of childhood similar to those which H&#8217;s sons now report, then it would be a harmful experience. H&#8217;s response to the references of her sons and to K and L putting themselves forward to care for D, only underlines the concerns about her impetuosity, her quickness to anger, and her lack of insight into her own conduct and its consequences for others. There is no evidence of a recognition of her sons&#8217; experiences of her parenting nor any indication of a desire to change her parenting or conduct. D has had a history of relationships since the end of her long marriage to M, which have adversely impacted E when she was a child. There is evidence of a tendency to avoid difficulties by running away from them. D could not afford for her to do that in the future. It is also clear that she puts E first and, despite her protestations, would be likely to continue to do so. E now has a degree of independence but remains close to H and emotionally demanding, in particular in relation to D. Even in the context of communicating with her youngest son about D&#8217;s future, H wrote that E is her &#8220;main priority and always will be&#8221;. Whilst H has had the opportunity openly to confront these issues and engage with them, she has chosen instead not to be frank with the Local Authority and the Court in some important respects. That leaves the Court unable to accept the broad reassurances she gives about prioritising D and maintaining family ties with F and G, and with K, his brothers, and the wider family. There would be a significant risk that in her care D would lose contact with other family members. I also conclude that there would be a significant risk that D would suffer emotional harm in H&#8217;s care.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">Mr Howard, Counsel for H, pointed to various supportive and protective measures which he says the Local Authority has failed to consider to assist a placement with H. These might include therapy to help H with her anger problems. But H does not believe she has any problem with anger. Other measures might include unannounced visits but that would, in my judgement, afford little real protection to D. The claims by her sons do raise the possibility of a risk of physical harm to D in H&#8217;s care, but unannounced visits would not effectively guard against that relatively low level of harm and in any event the greater risk is of emotional harm which visits would not protect against at all.</p>

D is in foster care and that is not a long term option for her. Delay will be detrimental to her best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">I accept the recommendation of the Local Authority, supported by the IRO and the Guardian. I have concluded that the option that best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to D&#8217;s welfare throughout her upbringing is to  make an SGO in favour of K and L. It is not a perfect solution because it will cause D to be removed from this jurisdiction and from frequent contact with her mother, father and maternal grandmother, but it will meet her needs to be placed in a stable, loving family with a couple who will able and committed to supporting her needs during her upbringing. It is the best option available. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">At the conclusion of the hearing I announced my decision so that the further work needed to be done prior to the making of an SGO in favour of K and L, could begin. I said that I would give full reasons for my decision in a written judgment. An SGO could not be made at the conclusion of the hearing because K and L were about to return to the UAE but to return in early December 2024. I have given directions for further evidence from the Local Authority as to what support they can give, from a distance, to K and L as Special Guardians, and any contingency planning. I have asked to be provided with any draft consent order that might be reached and which could be entered into a form of order in the UAE, even without E being able to give her consent. There is also an outstanding DBS check on K and L to be completed. I have listed the case for a further, final hearing at which I intend to make the SGO in favour of K and L whilst they are in the country and able to attend at Court. The plan will be for D to spend time with them and to return with them to the UAE. The expert legal advice is that she will be permitted to travel there and stay with them and that, with the assistance of their employers, she should swiftly receive permission to reside with them. As recommended by the Guardian there will be no reduction in family time with E, F and G, and H in the meantime but the plan does mean that D will leave this jurisdiction only three weeks before her first Christmas. She will therefore be able to spend it with K and L, her new carers, and that will be important for her but she will not be able to spend it with her parents or H. I recognise the sadness that that will cause but it is in D&#8217;s best interests for the Court&#8217;s decision to be acted upon without delay. Were she not to return with K and L in December, it could be several weeks before they could travel back here again. At her age, and given all the circumstances, a protracted departure would not be in her best interests.</p>

The desire of family members to care of her is a positive feature of this case for D&#8217;s future, but it has made for an emotionally difficult process for all concerned. I thank them all for their active engagement and I wish D and all her family the best for the future.</p>
