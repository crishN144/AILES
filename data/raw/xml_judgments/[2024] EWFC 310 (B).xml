That consent order provided for A to spend time with F including on alternate weekends from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon.  In July 2023 M and F agreed to vary those arrangements so that A would see F at weekends during the day only, not overnight.  Overnight stays were reintroduced in February 2024.  In early February 2024 B was born, though F does not have parental responsibility for her and F has had negligible contact with her.

As I pointed out at the outset of this hearing, the term &#8216;disclosure&#8217; is one that is not encouraged and there is clear and recent case law deprecating its use because it implies that what is alleged is true.  The preferred term, prior to any finding of fact, is therefore &#8216;allegation&#8217;.  For the purposes of this judgment I have therefore amended the detail of the allegations made by M to use to the correct, preferred term.  Mindful also of the long-term impact on A of the publication of this judgment, and the June 2024 President&#8217;s guidance about publication of judgments, I have also sought to refer to the gist of the inappropriate touching allegations rather than the full detail.</span></p>

The fact that allegations of abuse may be found not to be true is also not necessarily sufficient to prove alienating behaviours since there can be a multitude of reasons why a court may not find allegations of abuse to be proved.</span></p>

She was asked about the gaps in her written evidence by Ms Miller on behalf of F and told me that she had provided everything to her solicitors, and it was not her fault that they had not included everything.  As Ms Miller submitted in closing, this explanation was lacking credibility when I consider that she was represented by competent and very experienced Family solicitors.  It also did not explain her failure to provide some of the key details in her written witness statement or schedule of allegations, details that she freely admitted in her evidence to me were important and meant that there were gaps in her written evidence.</span></p>

Whilst I appreciate that she was no doubt struggling to juggle her various responsibilities, and was living in temporary accommodation whilst looking after two young children, this did not explain her apparently better recall of very specific details when giving me her evidence during this hearing, compared to her written evidence or what she is reported as saying to professionals.  It was also striking during her evidence to me how often she sought to portray F in a negative light despite this not being what she was asked about.  She blamed him for her parenting two children alone, though it is not clear to me why she expected anything else given that, on her own account, B was conceived after separation and in circumstances where F&#8217;s involvement in A&#8217;s life was limited as a result of the arrangements agreed under the order made in November 2020.  She sought to emphasise that F was &#8220;one of the most majorly emotionally unavailable people on the planet&#8221;, called him a &#8220;crap parent&#8221; and that she had &#8220;held him in contempt for five years&#8221;.  Yet she refused to accept that her message to him exhibited at C30 of the bundle was &#8216;vicious&#8221;, when it is hard to describe it as anything else.   She in fact completely avoided answering the questions about this at first, more interested in telling me that, &#8220;despite all [her] efforts, [F] is getting easy parenting&#8221; and focused instead on her concerns about how long F allowed A to use a tablet.</span></p>

M&#8217;s assertion that she could hide her feelings about F was at odds with her description of how she reacted when A allegedly said what he did in the car and is also at odds with her strong emotional reactions during this hearing when asked perfectly proper questions.  At one point I had to stop her from aggressively challenging Ms Miller about appropriate cross examination, explaining to M that Ms Miller had to put F&#8217;s case to her, and it was important that she try to answer the questions she was asked so I could hear what her answers were.  I appreciate that the allegations in this case are bound to provoke strong reactions, however M&#8217;s reactions seemed out of proportion to the questions being asked and seemed to me to be prompted more by Ms Miller attempting to ask about apparent inconsistencies and discrepancies in M&#8217;s evidence.

In her oral evidence, she also added a further detail of A asking her if he &#8220;did the right thing&#8221; telling her before they parked up, and that she then asked him to show her what happened when they parked.  Her schedule of allegations at A12 mentioned an additional detail of A describing F using two fingers, which is not in her written statement, and is not a detail that A himself repeated to any professional in the written evidence before me and is certainly not recorded by the school safeguarding lead in her note of what A told her and showed her on 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial"> March 2024 at E11.

M was also very inconsistent in the terms she had used to describe A&#8217;s description of where he said F had touched him.

She also added that she was clear that A had seen something he should not have seen.  None of this detail is in any of her prior written evidence, nor even in her reports to professionals at the time.

She herself said that she was &#8220;really bad at remembering things&#8221;, that the details &#8220;didn&#8217;t touch&#8221; for her, and that the wording he used didn&#8217;t matter beyond telling her what happened and that she &#8220;didn&#8217;t see the importance of the details of what he told her&#8221;, beyond he was being told not to tell her which was a &#8220;massive red flag for her&#8221;.   She accepted that none of this was in her statement, explaining that she had so many things going on whilst trying to cover things to the best of her ability and, as a result, she &#8220;missed things&#8221;.  This is such a fundamental omission, though, because it is allegedly the first time that A mentioned he was told not to tell her about it and the words &#8220;special little game&#8221; appear.  It is hard to accept that even a busy mother, juggling looking after two young children and in the context of an ongoing police and social services investigation into possible sexual abuse would have completely failed to mention this conversation and its circumstances to anyone.

However, as F&#8217;s evidence also made clear, when the allegation expanded to include him telling A not to tell anyone and that it was &#8220;his special little game&#8221;, he then knew that this was not a misunderstanding of some innocent and accidental brush whilst sitting with A watching tv, and that he was certain he had not touched A inappropriately as alleged.

The record of that assessment is at F12 in the bundle and notes that A told those present he had no worries about F and there was nothing he didn&#8217;t like about him, that he couldn&#8217;t recall what he had said to the safeguarding lead the day before, and that he felt safe when he was with F and would tell M if he didn&#8217;t.

The police record notes that not only was nothing of concern said by A, but there was also no context provided in relation to what A had said the day before.

She alleged that this was why A had not said anything.  It was put to her by Ms Miller that A knew the school safeguarding lead, having spoken to her the day before, but M was adamant that A did not know her or feel comfortable with her.  Yet A apparently felt comfortable enough to say to her what is recorded at E11, so M&#8217;s evidence that A would not say anything to people he did not know is not consistent with what A actually did.

A is noted to have presented as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">&#8220;a confident, articulate and well-presented 5 yo&#8221; (F12).</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">  Nothing in the record shows any concern that A is withholding information or upset by the assessment, so this is not a picture of a child who feels inhibited and unable to tell people what is concerning him and is in direct contradiction to M&#8217;s claims that this was why A said nothing to the police or social services at that point.</span></p>

After social services closed the case, F contacted the school seeking information about A as a parent with parental responsibility is entitled to do.  This seems to have led to the school safeguarding lead contacting M to tell her that F had been in touch and was entitled to the information.  It is noted that M </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">&#8220;became quite upset&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">, made comments about F taking her to court, and then asked, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">&#8220;have you spoken to A as he has stuff to tell you?&#8221; (E8)</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">.

She was very vague about what A had said to her during these conversations, though, and accepted she had not put this in her earlier evidence or told anyone in the police or social services.  Her explanation for not telling the police or social services was that A was not telling her any new information and was &#8220;just sharing his feelings with me&#8221;.  It was really difficult to work out her logic in this explanation, because she accepted that she told the safeguarding lead that A did have &#8216;stuff&#8217; to tell her, which implies it was new information, but at the same time she was saying to me that this was not new information and it was just A&#8217;s expression of his feelings.</span></p>

M denied that she had discussed court proceedings with A, but went on to tell me that A must have heard about the court case from &#8220;members of her family talking about it in front of him&#8221;, and gave a very convoluted and hard to follow account of him knowing about winning and losing in court cases from a car accident that she had which apparently involved a court case.  She was adamant that she had been careful not to discuss things in his presence and that she had not coached him to say things.  She also said when questioned by Ms Miller about why A would say that M told him to tell people things, that this was A&#8217;s interpretation of what she meant by telling him to be brave and tell the truth.  However, she also told me that A was quite a literal child, and that it was hard to get children to say what you wanted them to say.  It is concerning that A does also seem to have been aware of adult concepts such as risk to his baby sister and adults &#8216;winning&#8217; or &#8216;losing&#8217; a court case about him and his having to see F as a possible outcome if M &#8216;loses&#8217; and F &#8216;wins&#8217;.

When I look at all the evidence, including the concerns of professionals that M was leading A to make further allegations, and the numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in M&#8217;s evidence, I am not satisfied that A made any allegations without input from M.

As was noted by Ms Miller in her position statement, which effectively stood as a written opening for this hearing, this is in direct contrast to what A expressed to professionals in March.  It is not disputed that A did not see his father after 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial"> March 2024, so it cannot be due to anything that F did during this period that A changed his views.

I have already noted earlier that I am satisfied M did lead A into saying what he did to professionals.  F told me he did not believe that M had negatively influenced A, and he acknowledged that there were parts of the ISW&#8217;s two reports in section D which did show M trying to encourage A to engage in the supervised contact w F, including using </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">&#8220;assuring language&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial"> to him (D26&#8221;).  M also agreed to the ISW having a one-to-one session with A to try to build up a rapport and to enable A to attend supervised contact with F.

M was adamant with the ISW that this would not happen and seems to have linked it to her objections to the time that F allowed A to spend on a device when A was with him in her initial evidence to me.  She went on to then say that her objection was about it being a device she would not afford to replace, and that it was not portable.  She did not explain which version of the games console A had, but my understanding of most of them since about 2017 is that they can either be used as a docked home console or as a portable device.  M also said that A asked for this because he knew it would not happen, though it was difficult to follow exactly what she was saying about this since she seemed to be alleging at one point that a child of this age was sophisticated enough to ask for something that he knew would not happen as a means to prevent contact happening, though her evidence did then change to say that she was actually concerned about what this meant in terms of boundaries for A in future.  Overall, she was not a compelling witness about this, and I find that she was rigidly opposed to any suggestion of the console being used as a means to help A engage with contact, and that this rigidity was not reasonable nor supportive of A having contact with F.  It seems more likely than not that this was driven by a combination of her constant criticisms of the time that A spent on devices when with F, though it is not clear to me that A did spend inappropriate amounts of time on his own on a device when with F, and it may have simply been that M has taken something A has said out of context and does not see the potential positives for A of being able to bond with F over shared use of a device.  Regardless, it was a simple step that, as the ISW noted at D30 could have made A feel better.  It is also concerning that the ISW noted that M </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">&#8220;did not introduce or allow opportunity for A and ISW to be introduced&#8221; (D30).  </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">It seems as if the ISW was still able to build a rapport with A despite this, but it is concerning given what the ISW was instructed to do in this case, and I am given no explanation by M as to why this happened.  </span></p>

Ms Roberts did properly point out that the previous court order was by consent in 2020.  However, I have M&#8217;s own evidence that she found the previous court proceedings very difficult and can take judicial notice of the fact that they took from 2018 to 2020 to resolve as indicative that they were protracted and did not always proceed by consent.

This would have been particularly problematic during the numerous and frequent conversations that she told me she had with A about the allegations.  Even encouraging him to be brave and tell the truth, as she says that she did, and &#8220;through the whole process giving him a chance to recant, or if he was not sure he could tell [M] and [M] would make sure everyone knows&#8221; as she startlingly revealed during her oral evidence to me, is concerning in that it is encouraging him to say things.  It also gave A the message that he has something to be brave about.  Encouraging A to know that he did not have to continue with his allegations or could tell people if he wasn&#8217;t sure was also not something that M mentioned when Ms Miller had earlier asked her repeatedly about the numerous conversations she said she had had with A.   M told me that she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t remember every single word&#8221; she had said to A, only that she had &#8220;done everything [she] could to promote contact, to push him to be open and honest&#8221;.  M used the word &#8216;push&#8217; without any prompting by Ms Miller in her question.  I was left with the distinct impression that this was a slip by M whilst trying to explain why she had not mentioned a key detail earlier, and that M has in fact &#8216;pushed&#8217; A not just to be open and honest, but to make further allegations, particularly to professionals.  Coupled with the evidence I have noted above which includes professionals being concerned that M continued to &#8216;probe&#8217; matters with A, I am satisfied that M actively encouraged A to make allegations against F to professionals, and that she has discouraged him from seeing time with F as safe as a result of doing that and as a result of exposing him to her strong emotions and negative views of F.  I am also satisfied that she has failed to protect him from knowledge about these proceedings.</span></p>

The issue that the court will need to consider in the welfare stage of this case is whether M is able to move on from the unfounded allegations she made, accept the findings that I have made about her behaviour, and really support A in having a meaningful relationship with F.  As Ms Miller put to her, that means M is going to have to give A emotional permission for that to happen, which includes making sure that her own strong feelings and views about F do not affect A or B, even inadvertently.  </span></p>
