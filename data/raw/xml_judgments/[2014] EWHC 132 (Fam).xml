During the course of her pregnancy, she has been able to comply with the antenatal care offered to her.  She asserts, and I accept, that she welcomed that pregnancy and her compliance with antenatal care seems to me to be evidence of it.

She has, historically, been admitted to an establishment in Swindon following a mental health assessment in 2011.  It is clear that AA, like so many who suffer from this sad and debilitating condition, has only limited insight into it and to its consequences, and so she has from time to time intermittently discontinued her medication when the medication makes her feel well.  She has further to progress in the understanding of her condition and of the importance of a strict medication regimen.  That will be particularly important when she is a mother.</span></p>

During the course of the application today, I heard from a number of witnesses, about whom I will say more shortly, but I note that AA's father, who has been with her throughout on this long journey of mental ill-health, has described her present condition as the worst he has seen.  He has described her to me as very agitated, "violent" was a word he used, and "exhausted by lack of sleep."</span></p>

At the initial assessment at around 8.30 pm, it was noted that her membranes had ruptured.  Quite when they had ruptured it was difficult to tell, but it seemed likely that that was not very long before her presentation at the hospital.  She was admitted to the labour suite and there she remains, although she has not as yet gone into labour.  At 7 am the following morning, on 27 January 2014, she was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  She remains highly agitated and is largely uncooperative with almost every aspect of her obstetric care.  Her father in his evidence confirmed that position.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ContinCol" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Because AA is pregnant, it has not been possible to administer the full range or indeed the requisite dose of medication, including the antipsychotic medication, that her present florid condition would otherwise require.  The dilemma for the treating clinicians, and the reason why this application comes before me today, is that rupture of the membranes gives rise to a significantly increased risk of both maternal and foetal infection until delivery.  In such circumstances, the management plan would ordinarily and almost automatically move to induction of labour by the administration intravenously of Syntocinon.  Such administration requires continuous CTG monitoring, both of the mother and of the foetus.  The treating team is entirely clear that AA would be unable to co-operate with this type of management.  Indeed, AA's father told me that she has already removed intravenous lines on more than one occasion.</span></p>

He took over AA's care first thing this morning, although he has not hitherto had any dealings with her.  Yesterday evening at about 9.30 pm, the Trust made an emergency application to the out-of-hours judge, who last night was Moor J.  At that stage, Mr David Griffiths was the consultant obstetrician and gynecologist on duty,  Moor J heard oral evidence from Mr Griffiths over the telephone.  As AA had not yet entered into labour, the judge did not think it was appropriate to grant the declaratory relief that the Trust sought on a telephone application.  The position could be held over, he considered, until this morning when the matter was to be listed before me.  However, had AA gone into labour or begun to show signs of infection, Moor J then gave the Trust the declaratory authority it sought.</span></p>

Firstly, the hospital could attempt to induce labour medically via the administration of intravenous Syntocinon.  That would result in a natural labour.  However, the research, as Mr Jones told me in evidence, confirming the observation of Dr Anita Sinha, the consultant gynecologist and obstetrician who prepared a statement in this application and who is part of the gynecological team, establishes that between one third and a quarter of patients who require medical inducement (particularly, Dr Jones said, in the case of a first child) require an emergency cesarean.  That, he considered, would be particularly dangerous in this case.  It could lead to infection and sepsis, the consequence of which for the foetus could be brain damage or death and with an increased risk of shock or haemorrhage to the mother.  Given it requires the  administration of intravenous medication, in the mother's present condition, it is plainly an unsuitable course.</span></p>

AA has to date permitted only one episode of electronic foetal monitoring during her admission, and she is simply unable to appreciate that such monitoring is part and parcel of a safe delivery for her baby.  Indeed, she appears unable to comprehend any aspect of her treatment.</span></p>

Also, whilst still fully conscious, she is at the moment unlikely to remain still or calm enough to comply.</span></p>

She will receive ongoing treatment to include continuous observation by midwifery and mental health nurses and will also be reviewed regularly by a psychiatric team.  It may be necessary to restrain her prior to the general anaesthetic, and indeed after delivery, if she becomes agitated.  I am told in Dr Sinha's statement that she will remain, throughout her recovery from the caesarean section, in the delivery suite or the maternity unit prior to onward transfer to the mother and baby unit.  She will require regular blood tests, ECG and monitoring of maternal observations, temperature checks and monitoring of any vaginal bleeding.  </span></p>

I have listened carefully to what the family has said, particularly what AA's partner, BB, has said.  He was not always consistent or indeed logical.  If I may say so, at such a stage in his life in these difficult circumstances I would hardly expect him to be so.  He communicates to me that AA is extremely anxious, extremely distressed, but he also says she is tired and he believes in some way she now wants to get on with the delivery.  I believe that he was telling me that if AA were not florid, if she were not suffering this profound psychotic episode, and if she were in a position to reason her situation objectively, she would follow the recommendation of the doctors.</span></p>

That assessment took place in two parts as AA needed a break in the process.  As part of Dr Best's assessment, he had discussions with AA, her partner, her parents, her treating team on the labour suite, which included consultant obstetrician and gynecologists and midwives and anaesthetists.  He reminds me that bipolar disorder is to be regarded as an impairment of disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, and therefore satisfies the diagnostic test under the Mental Capacity Act.  In AA's case, that disturbance or impairment means that she is unable to make decisions regarding the safe delivery of her baby.  He states in his report that AA simply does not believe that she has in fact begun the labour process.  She is under the delusion that she can only give birth on or after her due date, which is on or around 9 February 2014.  This was amplified by Dr Jones, who told me that she believes that the baby can only be born on her own birthday which falls around that time.  Dr Best describes that belief as strong and fixated.  Subsequently, AA cannot comprehend the concerns that are being expressed to her by the variety of health care professionals or by her family.  Much of this is due to the high and intense level of agitation.</span></p>

These issues he considered ought to be resolved in the clinical situation at the hospital.  How, he asked politely and genuinely, could a judge be better placed than a doctor to take these decisions?  I hope that in analysing my reasoning in the way that I have, I have already to some extent answered that question.  But I would add this: the decision to restrain and compel medical procedures on those who do not have the capacity to take them themselves is an onerous one.  The declaratory relief is sought for two purposes: firstly, the legal purpose, which is to cloak the Trust with the legal authority to carry out the procedure and to provide them with a defence to any allegation of criminal or tortious liability for trespass to the person (see </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re W (a minor) (Medical treatment: Court's jurisdiction)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 64</ref>); secondly, the clinical purpose, which stems from the fact that in many instances the co-operation of a patient, or at least a patient's confidence in the efficacy of a treatment, is a major factor contributing to the treatment's success.  Failure to obtain the consent of a patient not only deprives the patient but the medical staff of this advantage.  The court has the jurisdiction over the legal purpose; it does not have jurisdiction over the clinical one, and its approval helps to ameliorate that disadvantage.</span></p>
