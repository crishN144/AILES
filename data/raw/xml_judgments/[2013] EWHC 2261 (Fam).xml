It was not until March 2013 that she managed, after much official intervention, to return to England.  The situation she alleges is that of a &#8216;stranded spouse&#8217;.</p>

The children are represented by a CAFCASS Guardian, who has not played any part in the fact-finding hearing.  The children&#8217;s care is currently shared between the paternal family and the mother.  A decision about the future will be made in September.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The father, who is aged 27, is settled in the United Kingdom.  He holds Dutch and British nationality.  His family moved from Pakistan to Holland about 40 years ago and he and his siblings were brought up there.  His parents (the paternal grandparents) now live in England, but have spent substantial periods of time in Pakistan in recent years.  The father&#8217;s three siblings are an older brother, who died in 2012, an older sister (the paternal aunt) and a younger brother (the paternal uncle).  Both surviving siblings are married and the entire family lives in a single home from which the father, the aunt and the uncle run a family business.</p>

Her spousal visa had expired in 2007 but had not been renewed.</p>

She entered into an arranged marriage with the father in October 2008 and she travelled to England in March 2009 on a six month visa that was in due course extended to a five year spousal visa.  Her parents (the maternal grandparents) and her older brother (the maternal uncle) live in Pakistan.  Their home is about half an hour&#8217;s drive from the paternal family&#8217;s village.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In August 2011, the maternal uncle came to England on a student visa.  He was employed by the father until November, and alleges that the father assaulted him on three occasions during that period.  In December 2011 he returned to Pakistan.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In late 2011, the entire family was in Pakistan for the paternal uncle&#8217;s wedding.  The mother and children, accompanied by the paternal grandparents, arrived on 23 October, while the father was there from 9 to 13 November and from 29 November to 4 December, returning to the United Kingdom with the mother and children.  The grandparents remained in Pakistan.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">At the wedding reception on 11 November, there was an altercation between the maternal grandfather and the father; the grandfather was aggrieved at the way the maternal uncle had been treated in England.  This was a significant moment: relations between the two families worsened and have not recovered. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">It is also significant that in the two months they were in Pakistan, the mother and children spent only two nights with her own nearby family.  This meant that the children did not benefit from getting to know their maternal grandparents and the mother did not have her parents&#8217; company and support for any length of time.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The mother says that the paternal family&#8217;s treatment of her worsened on return to England and that on 25 January 2012 the father assaulted her for the first time.  She says that he punched her while she was holding the older child, who accidentally received a cut to her cheek.  The father resumed his assault on her but was restrained by the paternal uncle.  The paternal aunt was aware of what had happened.</p>

The mother says that she believed the trip was to Holland and only learned where the father was after his departure.  The father made no contact with the maternal family on this trip to Pakistan.  He returned to England on 28 August with the child and the paternal grandfather.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">On 17 September, the grandparents asked to speak to the mother.  They say that they encouraged her to improve her conduct for the sake of the marriage and the children.  They say that the mother hardly spoke, but when she did it was to say that she wanted to go to Pakistan and that the paternal family could look after the children in her absence.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The mother says that during this conversation the grandparents told her that her own mother was seriously ill and that she should go back to see her, but she also felt that the trip provided her with the opportunity to talk to her parents about her future. The grandparents deny referring to the maternal grandmother&#8217;s health.  Their evidence, and that of the aunt who was also present, is that they expected the mother to go for a week or a few weeks.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">At all events, the father played no part in the conversation.  The grandparents spoke to him later and prevailed upon him to accompany the mother to her family.  He bought tickets on 19 September for departure on 20 September: a single ticket for the mother and a return ticket for 22 September for himself.  The mother says that she was unaware that she had only a single ticket, or that the father had an immediate return flight &#8211; this is contested. </p>

They were driven by an airport hotel taxi straight to the home of the mother&#8217;s family (who were surprised by her arrival).   The father and mother parted wordlessly.  The father then went to visit his brother&#8217;s grave and to spend the night at the hotel.  While he was in Pakistan, he spoke by telephone to the maternal grandfather in a conversation that left both men feeling offended.  </p>

Unfortunately, even in the face of my assessment of the paternal family, there are aspects of her narrative that I am unable to accept.  Although I cannot be sure, I believe that the most likely explanation for these untruths is that she has attempted to embellish an essentially correct account of events with a number of ultimately unconvincing additions.  This is unfortunate as it has made it harder for me to reach my overall assessment and, because the embellishments and inventions have enabled the paternal family to express understandable indignation, deflected attention from other issues.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The treatment of the mother by the paternal family after her arrival in this country was what would be expected of that family, but will have come as a surprise to the mother.  She was used to having some personal independence and a degree of respect in her profession.  What she found was an environment in which she was required to subordinate herself to the group, and to do whatever housework and childcare was necessary.  She was at a disadvantage in being an individual who was not by birth a member of the team and who spoke neither English nor Dutch.  Nor was she asked to participate in the family business.  The paternal family showed no real interest in helping her to gain any independence by going out or making friends of her own, or by giving her any form of financial allowance: what was in it for them to do this?  As a result, the opportunities for the mother to go out on her own or with the children were limited and she would almost always be accompanied by the aunt.  Likewise, even before the breakdown in relations at the end of 2011, communication between the mother and her family in Pakistan was at best tolerated; it was never encouraged.  When the family was in Pakistan for the wedding, the paternal family strongly discouraged the mother and children from going to stay with the maternal family because it was, in their view, less comfortable there for the children: that view naturally prevailed. </p>

From the paternal family&#8217;s point of view, the way that the mother was treated was perfectly normal.  The lack of respect for the mother&#8217;s individual feelings recalls the similar way in which they treated Ms F.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I do not accept that the mother was physically locked up by means of alarms or keys.  It was not necessary for the paternal family to confine the mother when, in truth, she had nowhere to go.  In relation to the specific allegations that the aunt and uncle locked the mother in a bathroom and in the kitchen, I reject this evidence, having regard to the layout of the rooms and the absence of locks.  I also reject the mother&#8217;s most striking allegation, which is that on an occasion in August 2012 she was tied to a chair by the uncle and aunt for half an hour while they went out.  This most unusual accusation appears only in passing in a statement made by the mother&#8217;s solicitor, and is not repeated in the mother&#8217;s own statements or even in the schedule of allegations prepared for this hearing.  This was not remedied by the mother&#8217;s own evidence on the subject, which I found entirely unconvincing.  Likewise, while there may have been conflict of some kind between the aunt and the mother about mobile phones, the mother&#8217;s evidence did not persuade me that the aunt made her strip naked on 25 August to show that she did not have a concealed phone.  </p>

The older child, who was in her arms, accidentally suffered a slight injury.  The mother is clear that there was no physical violence offered to her before this occasion.  I find that there was a second assault by the father that night and that the paternal aunt and uncle were aware of what was going on, and intervened.  I reach this conclusion notwithstanding the inconsistent first description given by the mother, which has the father&#8217;s elder brother present (he was in hospital at the time).  </p>

What is, to my mind, interesting is that the father decided to go abroad to see his parents, taking the older child, at exactly the time of the younger child&#8217;s first birthday.  There is no doubt that the mother was left in the care of the paternal aunt and uncle in his absence; put another way, she was left under their control.    </p>

This conversation took place entirely on the paternal family&#8217;s terms and the mother was by now worn down and defeated.  She said very little and the grandparents took no trouble to consult her feelings.</p>

The mother, even on her own account, made no enquiry of them or of her own family about what might be wrong with her mother, who is in good health.  I am afraid that the mother has added this detail to cover her embarrassment at having agreed to go at all.  Her own evidence was that the visit also offered her the opportunity to talk to her parents about the poor state of her marriage.  I believe that this was what the mother wanted and needed.  Her situation in the paternal home &#8211; it was never in truth her home &#8211; had become impossible and she needed support.  I therefore do not accept that the paternal family tricked the mother into leaving.  They had no need to do so as they had achieved her departure by other means.</p>

Their concern was to retain control of the situation and their position was that if she was coming back, it was going to be on their terms.  I find that the mother did not know that the father was due to return straight away.  I also find that the father kept her passport.  I prefer the mother&#8217;s evidence on this point and I reject the suggestion that she applied for a new passport without a visa when she had a valid passport with one.  I find that the father&#8217;s letter to the UKBA dated 20 September was probably written on that date (i.e. before departure) and I reject his evidence that it was wrongly dated through &#8220;human error&#8221;.  I am also confident that the father was lying when he said that he had not kept a copy of that important letter, parts of which were replicated in his chasing letter in December, which refers to the previous letter by date.  These letters, aptly described by Ms Kirby as &#8220;the smoking gun&#8221;, are ones that the father has had in his possession all along but chose not to produce amid the plethora of other documentation he exhibits.</p>

The truth, as the father knows, is that she was desperate to be reunited with the children, but was prevented by his decision to punish her for her insubordination.  </p>

Had the mother not acted decisively, her separation from the children could have been a very much longer one.   </p>
