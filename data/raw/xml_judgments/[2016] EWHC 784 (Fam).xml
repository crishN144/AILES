At a hearing on is notice on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March, I made a further interim order to that effect.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As this judgment will be published, albeit anonymously, I propose to recite little of the factual background. Suffice it to say that Z is a girl in her early teens who has developed a very serious eating disorder. She received treatment at a number of hospitals in Ireland but by early 2016 it became clear that she required special treatment, incorporating nutrition, hydration and psychiatric treatment, which would include, if necessary, the use of restraint, and which could not be provided in her home country. Her doctors therefore made arrangements for her to be admitted and treated in a specialist unit in an English hospital which is able to provide the treatment required. Her parents supported this proposal although Z herself did not agree. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016, the Health Service Executive for Ireland ("the HSE&#8221;) filed an application in the Irish High Court seeking an order authorising the treatment in the English hospital. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March, the application came before the President. At the hearing, Z was represented by her parents as litigation friends. Evidence was given by her treating physician who reported that Z&#8217;s condition was so serious that she required admission to a specialist eating disorder unit which provide specialist psychotherapeutic support and treatment to adolescents with severe eating disorders and nasogastric feeding to ensure weight restoration. The doctor also reported that Z did not agree to being treated in the English hospital. At the conclusion of the hearing, the President made an order (1) authorising and permitting the HSE to transfer Z to the English hospital and to take all reasonable and proportionate measures to ensure her safety transfer, (2) authorising the English hospital to take all necessary measures to provide Z with such hydration, sustenance, medication and treatment as may be clinically indicated, (3) authorising the English hospital to use reasonable force and/or restraint in the cause of those medical procedures to the extent which may be necessary and in Z&#8217;s best interests, and (4) authorising the English hospital to take all reasonable and proportionate measures to prevent Z absconding from the hospital. The court listed the matter for a review hearing on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April. An independent guardian was appointed to represent Z at that hearing.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The plan was to transfer Z to the English hospital on Monday 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. An urgent application was therefore made to me ex parte by the HSE late on the afternoon of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>  March. In the course of that telephone hearing, I raised the question as to the jurisdiction under which the court could recognise and enforce the Irish order, and, in particular, whether the case fell under Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003, ("Brussels IIA&#8221;). I therefore adjourned the matter to the following morning to allow those representing the HSE, Henry Setright QC and Victoria Butler-Cole, to take instructions on that point and a number of other issues. At the resumed hearing, I was shown a number of documents including an email from the NHS trust responsible for the English hospital agreeing to the application. Mr Setright explained that the HSE&#8217;s preliminary position was that the case did not fall under Brussels IIA. My provisional view was that it did. In view of the urgency of the matter, however, I decided to make an interim order under the inherent jurisdiction that the Irish court order of 2 March should stand as an order of this court, thereby permitting the English hospital to admit and detain Z and provide her with such treatment as it considered appropriate in the absence of her consent. The order recorded inter alia that the urgency of the case warranted invoking the inherent jurisdiction to supplement the provisions of Brussels IIA; that recognition of the Irish court order would not be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child; that Z was a party to the Irish proceedings, acting through her parents as litigation friends; and that her wishes and feelings about the proposed order had been put before the Irish court. In view of the ongoing issue as to jurisdiction, however, I decided to list the matter for a further hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March to consider inter alia the applicability of Brussels IIA, the relevance of Article 56 of that regulation, the use of the inherent jurisdiction, and the continuation of the order. I invited Cafcass Legal to attend the next hearing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March was attended by counsel on behalf of HSE, and also by David Williams QC on the half of the parents, and by Melanie Carew on behalf of Cafcass Legal. All parties were united in support of the continuation of the order, but there was some disagreement as to the basis on which the order should be made. By this point, the HSE had concluded, on further reflection, that the case did fall within Brussels IIA and therefore invited the court only to extend the order for a limited time to enable an application to be made under the provisions of Part 31 of the Family Procedure Rules to facilitate the recognition and enforcement of the Irish order under the regulation. On behalf of the parents, Mr Williams, whilst stressing that his clients&#8217; focus was on the substance of the order rather than its form, submitted that the case fell outside Brussels IIA.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Brussels IIA is directly applicable in UK law. Its provisions have also been incorporated into the statutory rules governing jurisdiction in certain categories of case involving children in Part I of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. The regulation contained rules as to jurisdiction in Chapter 1, in particular, so far as parental responsibility for children is concerned, in Articles 8 to 15. The principal basis for jurisdiction under Article 8 is that the courts of a member state shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that member state at the time the court is seised. The regulation also contains rules as to the recognition and enforcement of orders in Chapter III, Articles 21 et seq.</p>

In her helpful submissions, Ms Carew informed the court that Cafcass was of the view that the court was making a decision in relation to parental responsibility, not to supplant the parental responsibility of the parents but, rather, to support it in circumstances where the hospital needs authority over and above the parents&#8217; consent to provide treatment for their child against her wishes.

To my mind, the matter is determined by a straightforward interpretation of the wording of the Article. As Mr Setright observes, it is clear that the Article applies to placements involving foster families and to care orders facilitating placements in a secure institution providing therapeutic and educational care: </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">HSE v SC and AC</span><span style="color:#000000">, supra. Mr Setright submits that it is difficult to envisage the term &#8220;placement in institutional care&#8221; applying to the temporary admission to hospital of a child who needs treatment for a physical disorder. The term connotes the provision of care for a child as a whole, not for a transient or treatable disorder or disability. It connotes a setting in which the responsibility for the child&#8217;s welfare, as a whole, is placed in the hands of persons other than the child&#8217;s family. Mr Setright therefore submits that, in all the circumstances, it is difficult to apply the terms of Article 56 to the factual circumstances of this case. The parents have not delegated their parental responsibility to any other institution or person, and they retain control of the decision that has been made to place the child in hospital in this country. Further, the effect of the Irish order is not to &#8220;place&#8221; the child in the care of the hospital, but to authorise her treatment there by way of implementation of the parental decision.</span></p>

To my mind, that confirms that the provision does not extend to cases where a child is transferred to a hospital for treatment in another member state since, manifestly, public authority intervention is not required for domestic cases in such circumstances, except where the parents do not consent to the treatment. Save in those circumstances, arranging a child&#8217;s admission to a hospital in another member state does not amount to the placement of a child in institutional care within the meaning of Article 56.</span></p>

The order cannot be recognised if it was given without the child having had such an opportunity, except in cases of urgency. Part 31 of FPR does not provide for the automatic joinder of a child as a party to an application for registration, but rule 31.6 gives the court power to give such directions as it considers appropriate, thereby permitting the joinder of the child as a party in appropriate circumstances. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Whether or not a child should be joined will depend on all the circumstances. Where a child has been a party to and represented before the foreign court, it will generally not be necessary for him or her to be a party before the court on an application for recognition and enforcement of the foreign court order, given the limited scope of the enquiry required of the court considering the application for recognition and enforcement. In this respect, the position is similar to cases involving orders in respect of adults under Schedule 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> &#8211; see </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Re PD</span><span style="color:#000000"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/48" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 48" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 48</ref>, paragraphs 31 to 35.

Although the FPR do not provide the same range of procedural options, the processes of the Family Division and the Family Court do provide a degree of flexibility, in particular by the availability of advice and assistance through Cafcass and Cafcass Legal. </span></p>

The court asked to recognise a foreign order should work with the grain of that order, rather than raise procedural hurdles which may delay or impede the implementation of the order in a way that may cause harm to the interests of the individual. If the court to which the application for recognition is made has concerns as to whether the adult was properly heard before the court of origin, it should as a first step raise those concerns promptly with the court of origin, rather than simply refuse recognition.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I asked Cafcass Legal to attend the hearing. Miss Carew duly attended and produced a most helpful position statement. She informed me that a discussion had taken place within the Cafcass High Court team as to whether there was a need for Z to be represented. She is now 15 years old and the court making decisions about treatment should hear from her, even if only indirectly. She is, however, represented in the Irish proceedings, where an independent guardian has now been appointed. In those circumstances, Miss Carew submits that it is not clear that appointing another person to represent Z in the proceedings in this court would assist her or the court. Having discussed the matter with a member of the High Court team, she added that it was inconceivable that a guardian appointed in the proceedings before this court would recommend anything other than enforcement of the treatment order. Furthermore, the order of the Irish High Court provides for regular reviews and this, coupled with the appointment of the independent guardian in those proceedings, provides oversight of the treatment and continued assessment of Z&#8217;s best interests. In those circumstances, Miss Carew did not press for Z to be represented before me. </p>

As set out above, it was Mr Williams&#8217; submission on behalf of the parents that the case did indeed fall outside Brussels IIA. He invited the court to make use of the jurisdiction, well established in cases of international child abduction, for the making of mirror orders, as first analysed by Singer J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P (A Child: Mirror Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 435" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 435</ref> and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W (Jurisdiction: Mirror Orders)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/703" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 703" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 703</ref>. On behalf of the HSE, Mr Setright, whilst adopting the position at the hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March that the case fell within Brussels IIA, argued in the alternative that, if the court concluded that it did not so that the provisions of Part 31 of FPR were not available, the mirror order mechanism could be used.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, the hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March took place with some limitations of time because the matter came on before me while sitting as the urgent applications judge. In the circumstances, there was insufficient time for counsel to develop these submissions. The jurisdiction to make mirror orders, whilst well established and in common use in cases of child abduction, has not hitherto been used as a means of recognising foreign orders in respect of medical treatment and in my judgment the ramifications of using it in this context requires careful consideration. Having concluded that this case does fall within Brussels IIA, I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to say anything further about the use of mirror orders as a freestanding remedy for the recognition and enforcement of foreign orders falling outside the regulation. I agree that, in urgent cases, a mirror order can be used &#8211; as in this case &#8211; for the short term recognition and enforcement of an order pending registration under Part 31, but the question whether such orders could be made to provide for indefinite or long term recognition and enforcement of foreign orders falling outside Brussels IIA is an issue to be considered on another occasion.</p>

At that latter hearing, I extended the order, but only until such time as an application could be lodged under Part 31 and considered by the relevant court. The need for this order arose because of delays in considering applications under Part 31. Plainly, there is a need for a process where under urgent applications can be considered immediately. Changes in the arrangements of the Principal Registry, and the introduction of the Central Family Court, may have led to difficulties in this respect which I shall draw to the attention of the President of the Family Division.</p>
