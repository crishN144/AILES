The receiving jurisdiction will therefore return the children promptly to the jurisdiction from which they came (for that jurisdiction to deal with issues about their upbringing and welfare) unless if certain carefully defined defences can be made out by the parent who has removed the children.  That is briefly the philosophy behind the Convention.</span></p>

The mother has represented herself, with the support in court of her current husband.  She politely complained about the lack of a level playing-field, in that their household is just above the limits for public funding but they do not have the resources to pay for legal representation.  I am very sympathetic to that dilemma and have tried to assist her throughout the hearing.  In fact, she put across her case with courtesy and effectiveness, cross-examining the father with skill and making cogent written and oral presentations.  I have read a bundle of documents and have heard each of the parties give evidence in the witness box, essentially on the issues of consent and acquiescence.  I have considered a report of Mr John Power of the CAFCASS High Court Team dated 15 October 2014 into the question of the children&#8217;s maturity and objections and have heard him briefly give evidence.</span></p>

They were married in Hungary in 2001 and lived throughout in Hungary until the mother&#8217;s move to this jurisdiction with the two children earlier this year.  Both children were born in Hungary and are Hungarian nationals.  They too lived all their lives in Hungary until earlier this year.  Following the breakdown of the marriage, the parties were divorced in 2006 and the father moved out.  Agreed arrangements were approved by the Hungarian court for the children to remain in the mother&#8217;s custody, with fortnightly weekend contact to the father and with his having contact for parts of school holidays.  These contact arrangements, however, were not without their difficulties.  There were a number of allegations and cross allegations which led to applications to the Hungarian Child Protection Office for amendments to be made to the arrangements.  The details are unimportant.  By the beginning of 2014 the contact regime was that the father had the children for fortnightly weekends, one day in the week and parts of school holidays.  </span></p>

In 2010, the mother gave birth to their son E who is now aged 4.  The mother&#8217;s family thus became comprised of herself, T, A, B and E.  Her case is that, unhappily, life in Hungary was difficult.  T was unable to find work there and her modest income as a teacher was insufficient to meet the family&#8217;s outgoings.  Debts started to run up, which she told me are now around about &#163;10,000.</span></p>

This was because of the family&#8217;s &#8220;&#8230;. extremely critical economic situation&#8221;.  It was said that they had decided to travel to this country &#8220;&#8230; for a maximum of one year&#8221; (the significance of which will appear below) and that the standard of living here would be &#8220;&#8230; significantly better than here at home (Hungary)&#8221;.

Various draft agreements were prepared, an example of which appears at B21.  These attempts to negotiate agreed arrangements continued into June 2014.  Ultimately, for reasons which do not matter, they came to nothing and the children did not see the father over the summer.  In fact they have not seen him, except by Skype, between the last contact occasion in February/March 2014 and yesterday, when he had contact, a period of some 6 months.  Who bore more responsibility for this is not the issue; but I suppose either parent could have made it happen.  </span></p>

On 12 June 2014, he made a formal submission to the Hungarian Central Authority.  On 5 August 2014 his English solicitors were instructed by the English International Child Abduction &amp; Contact Unit.  The case has proceeded on conventional lines from then on until final hearing before me this Tuesday and Wednesday (today being Friday).</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">If the matter rested there, it would be straightforward.  It would be clear that the father would have had rights of custody, particularly because of Article 5&#8217;s reference to &#8216;determining the residence&#8217; of the child.  However, the matter does not rest there, as the Head of Department at the Ministry of Justice in Hungary has expanded on this by way of amplification.  He refers first to the separated parent having &#8220;&#8230; the right to keep contact with his children as per the Order &#8230;&#8221;.  Then, citing Opinion No 284 of the Civil Law Board of the Hungarian Supreme Court, he goes on to say that &#8220;&#8230; if the parent travels abroad with the child placed with him/her for a period of time shorter than one year, the removal of the child is not wrongful &#8230;&#8221;.  I here omit some text and the citation continues &#8220;&#8230; if on the other hand the parent with whom the child has been placed intends to keep the child abroad for more than one year, the consent thereto of the parent remained [remaining] in Hungary or a court decision &#8230; shall be required.  Thus, in the latter case, it will be unlawful to keep the child abroad without the parent&#8217;s consent thereto or the court&#8217;s decision&#8221;.  The Head of Department continues by stating that it is not necessary for the removal abroad actually to exceed one year.  It is sufficient if the parent takes the child abroad with the intention that it would do so.  The court seized with the request for return therefore has to &#8220;&#8230; assess all the circumstances of the particular case so as to find out the abducting parent&#8217;s intentions&#8221;.</span></p>

What is the correlation between the obligation on the parties under S72B (even where joint parental custody is lacking) to exercise their rights jointly as regards determining the residence and schooling of the children, if the mother was entitled to bring the children to England without the father&#8217;s consent for e.g. 11 months and 3 weeks?  If the mother can do that and put the children into English schools without the father being able to exercise his joint right in this respect, then is not that statutory right to contribute to decisions on education negatived?  That is, incidentally, exactly what has happened in this case.  </span></p>

Be that as it may, the question for this court is not essentially to interpret still less apply Hungarian domestic law as to the issue of rights of custody/wrongful removal.

That seems to me to be the purposive and effective interpretation of the Convention.  Quite apart from anything else, one of the &#8216;fundamental issues&#8217; concerning the children in respect of which the father was entitled by S72B to exercise rights jointly with the mother was (as I have said) &#8220;&#8230; in determining the school and career of the child&#8221;.  In Convention terms, the mother&#8217;s removal of the children to this jurisdiction and placing them in schools of her choice without even telling the father was a breach of those rights, unless she had the father&#8217;s consent (which I address below).  </span></p>

However, in case my interpretation is wrong and since the mother is in person and believes very strongly that she was acting quite within her rights by reason of the &#8216;up to one year&#8217; provision as per Ruling 284, I will proceed to make findings in that respect.  The mother relies particularly on a recent Memo from her Hungarian solicitor dated 18 September 2014, which states by reference to the &#8216;one year&#8217; ruling that  &#8220;&#8230; you have not broken the law&#8221;.  This begs the question about the mother&#8217;s intention, which I need to deal with.  Her case is that she was clearly intending to come here for only one year.

He says that the removal to this country bears from the outset all the hallmarks of a permanent removal.  He relies on the father&#8217;s evidence that he was not consulted at all and that the first he (the father) learnt of the children&#8217;s removal was when he received the mother&#8217;s solicitors letter of 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2014 shortly afterwards.

The father&#8217;s evidence has been consistent that he was not told and he maintained this position under challenge by the mother before me.  He spoke through an interpreter but appeared perfectly credible.  The mother&#8217;s evidence on the same point lacks the detail and sense of conviction which one would expect if there had been any real consultation and discussion during which the father had given an unambiguous consent to the children&#8217;s removal.  In her statement, having in fact first made the point that she did not need the father&#8217;s consent to relocate, she continued by saying &#8220;&#8230; I feel this application is an abuse of process, because this is not an abduction.  The children are here legally and with the father&#8217;s knowledge.  In any event, he was aware of the relocation and did not do anything that would lead me to believe that he objected to the children coming to England or sought their return to Hungary.&#8221;  That is not put in direct terms of the husband having consented.

She accepted that she could not give any dates for this and that it was not shortly prior to the move in March 2014.  She accepted that she did not tell the father of any actual planned date for a move.  </span></p>

The mother accepts that she has not told the children&#8217;s English schools that they will only be staying at school for one year.  She accepts that when her husband, T, took on permanent employment with his current employers in England, he did not tell them that he would only be staying for one year.  Mr Jarman points out that the mother and T have made their home in England in the area T comes from and have placed the children into schools there, where they are settling and doing very well.  I have read their school reports which confirm this.  He relied on the fact that the mother is now saying that she is going to take advice from her Hungarian solicitors as to what might achievable in Hungary, the implication being that she intends if possible and hopes to be able to stay beyond the end of this year, in effect permanently.  So Mr Jarman submits that this removal to England has all the hallmarks of permanence.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The question under Hungarian law, as relied on by the mother, is as to her intentions in March 2014.  I accept there were contemporaneous references to her removal being for only up to one year.  Mr Jarman describes this as &#8216;lip-service&#8217;.  Having done my best to assess the mother, I conclude that she was not truly and deep-down intending that this move should only be for one year.  It is a huge commitment to remove children from one jurisdiction to another in this way, putting them into a new and different educational system and entirely predictably (as has happened) causing them to make a new circle of friends.  Their move was stated by the mother&#8217;s Hungarian solicitor to be on the basis that their standard of living would be better here.  It was to get the family away from the &#8220;&#8230;extremely critical economic situation&#8221; in Hungary (per the mother&#8217;s solicitors letter) with T unable to work and the mother&#8217;s salary insufficient.  They came here hoping to be able to clear their debts. Mr Jarman points out that it would take more than one year on the husband&#8217;s likely salary here to do so.  It is counter-intuitive to think this mother, who obviously cares deeply for her children, would have brought them here with the real intention of uprooting them and the rest of the family after only one year and after, as she expected, having established a much better standard of living.  So I cannot accept the mother&#8217;s case in this respect.  Even if I am wrong, there must have been a sub-agenda to the effect that &#8220;if the one year goes well, then we plan to stay on&#8221;.  That alone would, in my view, take this out of Ruling 284.</span></p>

In my view, even taking account of Rule 284, this converts the situation into one of unlawful retention, since any original intention to stay here for only one year (which I have in fact ruled against) has changed to a different intention.</span></p>

The fact relied on by the mother that the father&#8217;s parents have said that they thought he was willing to sign up to an agreement adds nothing.  The father does not dispute these facts, but says that he did not regard these discussions as his consenting to the children&#8217;s removal.  Throughout most of the time, he says he was unaware that he had potential rights under the Hague Convention.  He was just trying to organise contact in the summer and was not addressing his mind to anything more than that.

I agree with Mr Power that, in Convention terms, they do not demonstrate any or any cogent objection to a return to Hungary as such, but rather an understandable preference to remain in this country and thus not be at what they see a as risk of separation from their mother, T and E.  There is clearly much which attracts them to Hungary, including particularly A&#8217;s very best friend, both sets of grandparents, who are important to them, and their pets.

In the result, I am not satisfied on hearing the evidence of Mr Power and reading about A and B that the childrens&#8217; objection defence has been made out.</span></p>

The children must therefore be returned to Hungary.  If I were wrong in any respect, there is still an inherent power &#8216;&#8230; to order the return of the child at any time&#8217;: Article 18.  This is discussed by Baroness Hale in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">Re KL</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> 2014 1FLR 772 at paragraph 28.  It does not require &#8220;&#8230; a full blown welfare based enquiry into where the children should live&#8221;.  These are Hungarian children who, until March 2014 had been brought up all their lives in Hungary, with their grandparents and other relatives there, their schooling, their circle of friends, their sports, their music, their pets and so forth.  They were brought here as found unilaterally, without the father&#8217;s consent.  Granted they have settled in very well at school and are enjoying their activities and new friends here.  But they are disabled from regular fortnightly (and one day a week) contact with their father and from regular contact with their grandparents, who are important to them.  Their present family arrangements here are only of 7 months&#8217; duration.  Notwithstanding the short term disruption and disappointment, I am of the view that quite apart from the Hague Convention it would be in their better interests to be returned to Hungary with their mother accompanying them.  It would then fall to the court in that jurisdiction (where the court and Child Protection Office have been dealing with the case for years) to consider the mother&#8217;s intended application to relocate back to this country.</span></p>
