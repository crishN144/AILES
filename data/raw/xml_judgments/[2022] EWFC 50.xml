	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have before me three linked cases, all concerning children whose biological father is James MacDougall (&#8216;JM&#8217;) who acted as sperm donor in the conception of the children. In the first two cases (&#8216;SW&#8217; and &#8216;EG&#8217;) JM has applied for parental responsibility orders and child arrangements orders (&#8216;CAO&#8217;) for him to spend time with the children concerned. In the third case, the mother (&#8216;KE&#8217;) has applied to vary an existing CAO and for a non-molestation order, and JM has applied for enforcement of the existing CAO.  I decided to adjourn the latter case, although varying the existing CAO. KE&#8217;s case has a number of features quite distinct from that of SW and EG, in particular that the child (&#8216;B&#8217;) has had contact with JM over a period, recognises him as his father, and that there are court orders in place granting JM contact. Most importantly, B has recently presented with unexplained bruises on three occasions, and I have ordered a s.37 report to be drawn up by Sheffield CC. For those reasons I adjourned proceedings concerning B. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the last four years JM has acted as a sperm donor through private arrangements in a large number of cases. He told the court that he was the father of 15 children, all aged between nearly four and a few months old. Four of those children are concerned in the proceedings before me. At the end of the hearing Ms Robertson produced for the Court and for the Guardian a list of the children of whom JM was the biological father. The most recent was born in February 2022.</p>

He suffers from Fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning difficulties and cognitive impairment. Fragile X is an inheritable condition. JM placed an advert as a potential sperm donor on a social media page for lesbian women seeking sperm donors, which is how he made contact with the mothers in this case. He says that he first acted as a sperm donor to help a friend. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SW and her then partner EG were keen to have a baby and made contact with JM via the social media page. When JM and SW agreed for him to act as a sperm donor, SW, EG and JM signed a written agreement given to them by JM. This agreement was provided to JM by a friend, who he says is a lawyer.  The agreement is a closely spaced three page document in highly legalistic language which is difficult to read even for a lawyer. It does state clearly on page one that JM will have no rights over the child and no right to contact with the child.  </p>

SW said that she has difficulty reading, which was clear from her oral evidence. She said that she did not read that far into the agreement and therefore did not read the part about Fragile X. EG said that she did read more of the agreement but either did not see or did not appreciate the significance of the reference to Fragile X Syndrome. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R was born in October 2018. About two weeks after the birth, SW contacted JM and asked if he would like to see the baby, which he then did. By about February 2019 SW and EG&#8217;s relationship was in difficulty and SW again contacted JM to ask if he wanted to see R. There is a dispute over how often JM saw R over the next 16 months and the terms of that contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SW said she suggested contact to JM because she wanted him to agree that EG would have full parental rights and she thought if JM had contact he was more likely to agree to that. It appeared from both her and EG&#8217;s evidence that they had an extremely confused understanding about the law on parental rights over a child in this situation and believed that somehow JM could &#8220;give&#8221; EG his rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whatever the confused legal understanding, in my view, although this might have been part of the motivation for initiating contact, the dates of that contact, which continue past the date SW and EG had unequivocally split up, indicate that SW was also suggesting contact for her own reasons. I will return to this issue below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">JM says he saw R regularly, initially about once a month and then by summer 2019 about once a week. He says that he would either see her with SW or EG, or he would take her round to his parents&#8217; house where he lived. His mother, Mrs M, who gave evidence, said that R came round regularly through this period. By October, R was staying overnight with JM at his parents&#8217; house. I have seen a series of text messages which show that R stayed overnight with JM on at least seven occasions, for a total of about 10 nights. </p>

SW accepted in cross examination that JM had given her some money but denied it was anything like &#163;7000 and said she had repaid some of the money. </p>

The status conferred by parental responsibility is an important legal recognition of the delicate balance between rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that are the components of family and private life. It is integral to the concept of parental responsibility. It is not, however, a separate 'stand alone' factor, let alone a presumptive factor to be weighed alongside other Re S factors in the welfare consideration of whether a parental responsibility order should be made. The status of parental responsibility underlies the authorities and the guidance that was applied by the judge in this case. It would no doubt have been helpful to articulate the importance of parental responsibility as a status question i.e. the reason why the Re S factors have been identified as being relevant to the welfare question, but that would not have altered the evidence the judge accepted nor the evaluative judgment on the Re S factors to which he came. For my part, I have come to the clear conclusion that the judge did not err in law nor was there any error in his approach or his evaluation."</span></p>

He will grow up in the family of CV and S and to him that will be unremarkable. However, he will go to school and it will not surely be long before he has questions about a father. The present proposal (reasonable in itself) is that he will be told of the kind man who enabled mummy to have him. He will hopefully grow up knowing his extended family on both sides. He will accordingly know TJ as one of his uncles. The rest of the family (on both sides) knows of course that TJ is more than that as BA will inevitably discover. To avoid this information coming out in an unplanned way, Dr.S wisely advises that BA learns early of the facts of life and of the means by which he came to be. Will it help him, I ask myself, to know also that this uncle is more to him than that? I am sure that it will. The experience of adoption, which surely we must not neglect in other less conventional forms of parenting, is that children often develop a real interest in their natural parents. This is hardly surprising since that person, however small their involvement in the life of the child, has contributed 50% of his genetic make-up. The other powerful lesson from adoption is the need for truth and the avoidance of deceit from the earliest days. Young children rarely have trouble with the truth, however strange it may seem, although the adults around them may do so. However, the discovery in adolescence that they have been duped or misled (as they may choose to see it) may have serious ramifications for family relationships.</span></p>

As a bald statement that is not really controversial. Moreover both Dr. S and, more cautiously, the guardian saw such a role particularly where the court has concluded that TJ is genuine in motivation even if clumsily heavy-handed in style.&#8221;</span></p>

Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.

He quickly becomes agitated, aggressive and loses control when not getting his way.  I thought Ms Vine&#8217;s assessment was very accurate. I suspect that JM can provide appropriate care for one child when he is calm and all is going well. However, I can also fully accept that when he becomes agitated he cannot control his emotions. He became upset when I gave my interim ruling and became angry and found it very difficult to control himself. There is copious evidence of him ringing or contacting people on multiple occasions if they do not do what he wants, and he simply will not take no for an answer. He had no insight into the impact this behaviour has on other people, particularly someone as vulnerable and emotional as SW. He had accepted that he did at times become frustrated and aggressive, but he said he never did this in front of children. However, I do not consider that JM has any self-control over his feelings of anger and frustration. </p>

She said in the statement that he had only spent about 20 minutes with R on one occasion and this was plainly untrue. The texts and photos were clear that there had been something like seven occasions when JM had overnight contact with R, and one of those was for three nights.

Firstly, it seems inherently unlikely that SW would have dragged JM into the house. She is much smaller than JM and would just physically have found it difficult to pull him in. Also, one must ask why she would have done that given that she undoubtedly wanted him to go away, not least because there were young children in the house. The account that she went out to tell him to leave because he was upsetting the children is much more likely. Secondly, there is photographic evidence of bruising to SW&#8217;s neck which accords with her version of events. Thirdly, the other adults in the house all gave statements to the police which generally supported SW&#8217;s version. Fourthly, JM&#8217;s general demeanour as someone who gets very frustrated and loses control when he does not get what he wants accords with SW&#8217;s version of at least the start of the incident. Fifthly, it seems from JM&#8217;s own account that he could have left when SW came out of the house, but he chose not to do so because he &#8220;wanted to get his stuff&#8221;. That suggests to me that he was at least to some degree the protagonist. </p>

She referred to having gone to a lawyer for advice, but neither she nor EG were at all clear about what the advice was. It is possible that SW was trying to persuade JM to give assistance to EG gaining a PRO, but there is no evidence she actually suggested this to JM. It seems more likely in my view that at least part of her motivation for proposing contact was that she wanted to get money from JM, both for R and herself. There are texts from SW asking to borrow money. I note that JM seems to have been generous in giving SW money, although it is not possible or necessary to try to establish how much money he actually gave her or the terms of whether or not it would be repaid.

However, the position now is that SW is very strongly opposed to him having such a role. I accept that there was some attachment between JM and R, and there is no reason to believe that the contact he was having with her before March 2020 was not positive for her. However, that contact was relatively limited and ended almost two years ago.

I think he does have affection for her, but also enjoys the idea of being her father. However, he appears to have no insight into the impact of these applications on SW, or the other mothers, and the knock-on impacts on the children. In my view, a large part of his motivation for making these applications is to control SW and EG and have control over their lives. It may be that he is particularly fixated on SW and is merely using the application against EG as a means of &#8220;getting at&#8221; or punishing SW.  If he has parental responsibility then I think he will use that as a mechanism against SW to gain information and control. The fact that JM has so little insight into the impact of his behaviour, and appears to lack self-control, makes my concerns about his motivations particularly worrying. </p>

I conclude that if JM had parental responsibility or contact with R, then the impact on SW would be extremely detrimental and that would then lead to a very negative effect on R&#8217;s welfare. I do take into consideration the relatively positive relationship JM had with R whilst he was having contact, and the fact that Mr Donohue considered contact with B was positive.

EG (in respect of N) says she asked JM to provide a written agreement and he found various reasons not to do so. I am not sure that SW understood the benefits of a written agreement and in practice was probably little concerned about whether she had one or not. Therefore, on balance I conclude that the original agreement was that JM would not have contact with P, but the position is sufficiently unclear that I put little weight on that original position. </p>

Therefore I will make an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for three years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be an unusual step in a judgment such as this to name one of the parents. The usual approach is to anonymise the parents so as to protect the identity of the children. However, it is clear from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Tickle v Griffiths</span> that there are cases where the public interest in the naming of the parents is sufficiently great as to outweigh the risk of identification of the children and their Article 8 right to privacy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are strong grounds for naming JM. All three mothers and the Guardian support naming.  Although JM told the Court that he had ceased to act as a sperm donor, a social media message from February 2022 suggested that he was still offering his services at that date. In the light of JM&#8217;s lack of honesty to his own mother, Mrs M, and his belief that he has done nothing wrong, he said he would be a sperm donor for any of the existing mothers so the children would have a &#8220;sibling connection&#8221;, I have no confidence that he will not act as a sperm donor in the future. I equally have no confidence in him fully explaining to any woman the true implications of his Fragile X Syndrome. There is therefore a very specific benefit in him being named in the hope that women will look him up on the internet and see this judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the Guardian suggests, there is a wider public benefit in the risks of private sperm donors being more widely known and considered. Publishing this judgment without anonymising JM raises the prospects of wider dissemination of the huge impact using JM as a sperm donor has had on these mothers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If JM is named there is some risk that the children will be identified. However, R, P and N do not bear his surname, although B does.  In any event, they are too young to be conscious of any internet comment. It is possible that they may become aware in the future of the facts set out, but it would be a sensible course for the mothers to explain the position to the children in an age appropriate way at some future date in any event.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Robertson raises the negative impacts upon JM of his being named and identified as a sperm donor. I accept that there may be some negative impacts. However, JM chose to be a sperm donor despite knowing that he would not be permitted to go through a clinic. He also chose to make these applications despite the strong opposition of the mothers. There is no suggestion that JM does not have capacity in respect of these decisions. In those circumstances, the fact that JM will be identified is a consequence of the decisions he has made. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a wider point about transparency in this regard. The usual approach of anonymity in the Family Courts should not be used as a way for parents to behave in an unacceptable manner and then hide behind the cloak of anonymity. The provisions and practice in respect of anonymity in family law are there to protect the children and not the parents. </p>
