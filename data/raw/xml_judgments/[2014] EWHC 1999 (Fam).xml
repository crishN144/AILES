First, there is the intersection between the conflicting rights and interests of X and of the children. Secondly, there is the intersection between the conflicting rights and interests of X and of the public authorities responsible for his arrest and prosecution. Thirdly, there is the consequential intersection between the family justice system and the criminal justice system. And, fourthly, there is, as we shall see, the intersection between Part II and Part V of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60" uk:canonical="1984 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</ref> as amended (PACE).

Unless he is himself a child, the father cannot be compelled to provide a DNA sample: see section 21(1). The only remedy for such a refusal is provided by section 23(1), which enables the court to &#8220;draw such inferences, if any, from that fact as appear proper in the circumstances.&#8221; It is X&#8217;s refusal to give his consent in accordance with section 21(1) that has given rise to the present application.</p>

Rather the policy derived from the undoubted fact that, at common law, the process of taking a blood sample without consent involves an attack on the integrity of the individual&#8217;s body &#8211; an assault &#8211; and the view of the Law Commission in its 1968 Report on <span style="font-style:italic">Blood Tests and the Proof of Paternity in Civil Proceedings</span> that it would not be acceptable to public opinion in general or to the medical profession in particular to exert physical compulsion in order to obtain blood samples. </p>

In the course of his attack he wounded her. Evidence at X&#8217;s criminal trial referred to the mother&#8217;s wound as &#8220;bleeding&#8221;. There was also evidence that X had cut his wrists, which were also bleeding, with a knife. Various samples of blood were taken from the crime scene and submitted for analysis. A sample of blood from the knife was also analysed. A sample of the mother&#8217;s blood was obtained during the post mortem examination of her body and analysed. A comparison of the various samples showed that two of the samples taken from the crime scene matched the mother&#8217;s DNA profile. The remaining samples from the crime scene did not match the mother&#8217;s DNA profile and were therefore each from a person other than the mother.</p>

As I observed during the course of argument, if he was seeking relief from a civil court in proceedings where the just and fair determination of the proceedings required him to submit to a medical examination, the court would have no power to compel him to do so. But it would have the power to stay his claim &#8211; to decline to hear his claim &#8211; until such time as he agreed to the examination: see <span style="font-style:italic">Edmeades v Thames Board Mills Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1969] 2 QB 67" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1969">[1969] 2 QB 67</ref>. Could a family court adopt the same approach? Could a family court, for example, say, &#8216;it is accepted that you are the children&#8217;s psychological father, and you can make your application on that basis &#8211; though if you wish to you will need first to obtain leave in accordance with section 10 &#8211; but if you wish to apply on the basis that you are the children&#8217;s biological father you can do so only if you have first submitted to DNA testing&#8217;. I pose the question without answering it, while observing that the application of such indirect pressure might be thought to be in the interests of the children if, all other avenues having been exhausted, there appeared to be no other way of obtaining the necessary sample.</p>

So far as concerns the post mortem samples, they were not taken under any power conferred by Part V of PACE, they were not taken with the mother&#8217;s consent &#8211; no such consent was required &#8211; and they were in fact not taken from a &#8220;person&#8221; within the meaning of that word as it is used in the relevant provisions in Part V, because, as Mr McCarthy points out, the normal and ordinary meaning of the word &#8220;person&#8221; is a living person: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Newham London Borough Council ex p Dada </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] QB 507" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] QB 507</ref>.</p>

DNA, she says, only becomes significant for identification purposes once compared with that of a known person.

A paternity issue arises and the guardian seeks <span style="font-style:italic">the DNA profile from the crime scene relating to the convicted man</span>. The only way, she says, the police can identify his DNA profile from the other 14 is by matching it to the Part V sample.

If those unidentified DNA profiles identify two persons as being parents of the children, then that will, without more, establish X&#8217;s paternity. If those unidentified DNA profiles identify one person as being a parent of the children, then it will be necessary to compare the relevant profile with that obtained from the mother&#8217;s post mortem sample to establish whether it is hers or, by elimination, X&#8217;s. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with the obvious and compelling point that DNA, and the information derived from it, demands a high degree of protection and that any use of it without the subject&#8217;s consent requires the imposition of robust and effective safeguards. The decision of the Grand Chamber in <span style="font-style:italic">Marper </span>is eloquent on the point, and not just in the passages to which I have drawn specific attention. And I readily accept the point made by Ms Cook and Ms Broadfoot of how important it is that public confidence in the system for taking, storing and using DNA samples and profiles is maintained.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, she says that disclosure here would undermine the integrity of the national DNA database. There is, for the reasons I have already explained, no question of any damage to the integrity of the information on the database. Her concern is with the potential loss of confidence if the public came to believe that samples provided for one purpose could be used for wholly different purpose, thus seriously undermining the ability to detect crime. Individuals might no longer be prepared to come forward. Part of the response to public concerns about the database is to ensure that it is kept confidential and seen to operate in the least invasive manner possible. This entails, she says, that the data is retained securely and that there are strictly observed limits as to who may use the data and for what purposes.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Finally, she makes a &#8216;floodgates&#8217; point, suggesting that success in this application would pave the way for &#8220;many&#8221; such further orders in a &#8220;range&#8221; of cases. She points to what she says is the &#8220;breadth&#8221; of the guardian&#8217;s submissions and suggests that it is very difficult to articulate a coherent set of principles which would govern the circumstances in which discretion should be exercised so that it is confined to a very limited pool of cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I see the force of all this, but these concerns have to be seen in context. The fact is that nothing which is here proposed offends any statutory prohibition and in that situation the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Marcel </span>is significant. The fact is that I am not being asked to do anything with material provided voluntarily by anyone. The fact is that the order which Mr McCarthy seeks is very narrowly drawn and includes very clear limitations and safeguards. The fact is that granting the order in this very unusual case &#8211; unusual not because of the horrific circumstances of the mother&#8217;s murder but because no recourse of any kind is needed or sought to any Part V material &#8211; is not of itself going to open the floodgates. As Mr McCarthy says, it is almost impossible to see how anything more than a very small number of cases could result from an order of the kind sought in the circumstances of this case. The reality, as it seems to me, is that the floodgates argument here is an argument against ever making an order in any case, even where statute is not determinative.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, there are powerful countervailing arguments. In the first place there are the interests of the children, to which both the guardian and the local authority draw attention and which, they say, should be preferred in the circumstances. In addition to all the usual arguments based on a child&#8217;s right to know their paternity, one cannot ignore the enormous implications for these children of what happened to their mother. Their futures will be indelibly marked by it. They need to know if the man who murdered their mother, the man who they believe to be their father, is in truth their father. As Mr Matthew Stott on behalf of the local authority points out, because X is not named on their birth certificates, the local authority has at present sole parental responsibility for the children. Moreover, as he also points out, Hogg J has already, in making orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1969</ref>, determined that it is in the interests of the children that the truth, whatever it may be, should out. I agree with Mr Stott that the material being sought is vitally important for the ongoing care planning for the children. I agree with him that in light of the circumstances of their mother&#8217;s death it is fundamentally important for the children to have the opportunity to understand their family history and ascertain their familial identity. It will, as he says, have an enormous impact on their emotional welfare, now and into the future. As Mr McCarthy asks rhetorically, how can the children&#8217;s life story work start, how can therapy or counselling be arranged, how is the children&#8217;s psychological integrity to be preserved, if the paternity issue is not resolved?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances the balance, in my judgment, comes down in favour of the children. The criminal justice policy arguments are weighty, though in the circumstances of this case significantly less weighty than Ms Broadfoot would have me accept. The interests of the children are compelling. There are likely to be few other cases in which an order can sensibly be sought without having recourse &#8211; prohibited &#8211; to Part V material or material the use of which is prohibited by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Tissue Act 2004</ref>. The order I propose to make will be subject to stringent limitations and safeguards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise that my decision is confined to the forensically unusual circumstances of this particular case. Every case where an application is made for access to DNA samples or profiles requires the most anxious scrutiny and an intense focus on the specific facts and circumstances of the particular case. Even if there is no statutory prohibition of what is sought, an order is never to be had just for the asking. There will be cases where the policy arguments put forward by Ms Broadfoot will be found to weigh heavier in the balance than I have found in this case &#8211; a case which is not merely forensically unusual as requiring no recourse to Part V material but one where the children&#8217;s claims are unusually compelling. </p>
