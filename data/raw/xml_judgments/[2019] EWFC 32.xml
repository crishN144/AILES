The proper course is to re-allocate the case for hearing in the family court by a &#8220;judge of High Court level&#8221; or, if appropriate, a judge of the Family Division. It is, for example, virtually impossible to conceive of a divorce or financial remedy case which needs to be transferred from the family court to the High Court&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.01in">In my opinion rule 33.4(3) is potentially misleading and should be revoked.  It is comparable to CPR 83.19(2) which allows a judgment creditor to apply to the County Court for a certificate of judgment and on the grant of the certificate takes effect as an order for transfer. That process does require some act, albeit minimal, on the part of the court. In contrast, on a literal reading of rule 33.4(3) any application, however abusive or nonsensical, actually effects a transfer of the case to the High Court.  This cannot have been intended, nor can it have been intended that the very important, stringent terms of rule 29.17(3) and (4) should not apply to an application to transfer a judgment to the High Court for enforcement.  The notes in the White Book to CPR 83.19(2) reveal, interestingly, that the Senior Master issued a practice note on 21 March 2016 in which it was stated that the High Court would not accept form N293A for transfer to the High Court for enforcement of a possession order of the County Court other than in respect of possession orders against trespassers. This is a good example of the court taking a firm line against what on a literal meaning of the rule would devolve a general transfer power to  litigants.  </p>
