She was served with the application but did not attend the hearing on 16 October 2023 and did not apply to be a party at that stage. On 18 October 2023 I received an application for her to be joined as a party which I granted on the same date, although this order was not received by the parties.  Mrs MH did not know she was joined as a party until the morning of 23 October 2023. I adjourned the start of the hearing for around an hour to permit her to read some of the evidence filed and asked that the solicitors identify the salient evidence for her. I considered, although no application was made, whether to adjourn the hearing to allow Mrs MH more time. I considered the over-riding objective found in the COP Rules and the need for justice having regard to the principles of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  I was concerned the application had been adjourned once already and that an urgent decision was required to be made for Ms H. I was re-assured that the Official Solicitor wished to test the evidence and that Ms Richards was prepared to cross-examine the Trusts&#8217; witnesses. On balance, I considered a further adjournment was not necessary and that it was not unjust to proceed. Mrs MH had been involved in the decision making process and had attended a best interest meeting. She was able to question all witnesses and make articulate submissions. </p>

I was also persuaded, balancing Articles 8 and 10 ECHR, that it was necessary to prohibit the identification of the treating clinicians. Termination of pregnancy arises strong feelings in some. There is (currently) no public interest in the naming of the particular clinicians. They are entitled to protection to carry out their clinical functions without fearing being named. I made clear this was a determination which could be revisited and made the order until the conclusion of the proceedings. I amended the reporting restriction order at the outset of the hearing on 23 October 2023 to prohibit the identification of several more clinicians. </p>

I endeavoured to follow this guidance. I consulted with the parties regarding the purpose of the meeting and the practicalities. I agreed to meet with Ms H by way of Microsoft Teams with her solicitor, Ms O&#8217;Connell, present. Ms O&#8217;Connell took a note of our meeting which I approved the following day which was then circulated to all parties. When I met with Ms H she was in a room at the hospital where she is detained. She was initially present with her two support workers and Ms G (the family liaison officer). As she is a witness, I asked Ms G to leave, which she agreed to. I spoke with Ms H for around ten minutes in the presence of her two support workers. She was agitated. She told me she was wanted a termination and when I asked her whether she would want a medical or surgical termination she clearly chose a medical termination.</p>

He does not have a regular role in Ms H&#8217;s care but was asked to provide his opinion. He met her on 9 October 2023 in the company of a ward sister. The meeting took place a few days after a meeting with midwives and a scan which confirmed the foetus is alive and growing in utero. His evidence was that Ms H&#8217;s consultant obstetrician has concluded that Ms H lacks the capacity to make a decision whether to have a termination and his &#8220;own conclusion from meeting [Ms H] would support that assessment&#8221;. </p>

She continues to refer to twins and that certain anti-psychotic medications were connected with her being gang raped. She stated that she wanted to have a termination as the foetus is a result of rape, she also said she was not ready to have child.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In answer to questions put to him by Mr Hallin he gave evidence that Ms H had been clear in her meeting with him that she wanted a termination. Her psychotic state however affected her ability to weigh up the &#8216;pros and cons&#8217; to make a decision. Her thinking was delusional, evidenced by the fact she variously thought she was the &#8216;on the throne of India&#8217;, had a successful singing career, was raped and had carried twins. His evidence did not go into detail in respect of her decision-making ability in respect of medical verses surgical termination. Dr K told me he had not seen Dr D&#8217;s witness statement for the purposes of these proceedings. He said it was difficult to predict with any certainty whether Ms H would take the necessary medication for a medical termination, but as a judgement call he thought it more likely she would, however, he was concerned that it was difficult to predict her behaviour given her mental health, in circumstances where she would be on a labour ward with a considerable amount of blood and pain brought on by the termination. He described this as &#8220;difficult&#8221; particularly given the necessary window of 24-48 hours for the treatment. He said it was possible she could withstand it and could be given sedation to help. His evidence was that vaginal examinations were a risk and she was likely to be distressed because of her belief she had been raped. The birth of a live foetus, if that took place, would be distressing and could make her psychiatric condition worse. He said that it was &#8216;logical&#8217; that a surgical termination would be short, with less pain and it seemed to him to be &#8216;less traumatic&#8217;. He said that, on balance, it would be better as it would expose Ms H to less pain, less bleeding, and avoid the risk of her seeing the foetus with signs of life. He pointed out however that she might wonder what had happened during the procedure because she would be unconscious. He told me he had not expressed his views on the less risky surgical termination before. He told me there were multiple risks of continuing the pregnancy which included: the damage to her mental health from continuing an unwanted pregnancy, post-natal psychosis and post-natal depression both of which were significantly higher given her mania and psychosis. When asked by me directly whether the termination or continuing the pregnancy presented higher risks he said: &#8220;I have thought about this for some time. It is very difficult. The risks are almost equal in both directions&#8221;. It is my impression that Ms Scott was surprised by this evidence and in re-examination sought clarification. Dr K agreed that a growing abdomen and lactating would be distressing for Ms H but Dr K was less clear that Ms H had provided a consistently negative view of her pregnancy. </p>

The procedure would need to be abandoned and her wishes about a termination would need to be revisited once she was back on [A] Ward. We could only wait up to 24 hours to see if [Ms H] would carry on with the next dose.</p>

She did not (at first) identify which of the section 1 1967 Act sub-tests were met or the grounds upon which she and her obstetric colleagues agreed the tests was met such that a lawful termination could take place. In answer to my question she then said the sub-section 1 (1) (a) test was met because of the psychiatric harm that would be caused if the pregnancy continued. When I raised with her the view of Dr K of the termination and pregnancy being finely balanced, she said she could not give evidence of psychiatric risks but raised her concern in respect of the risks of raised blood pressure. She made reference to another psychiatrist who had spoken in a meeting, but could not recall the name of the psychiatrist or identify notes from that meeting. She then said both mental health and physical health risks were higher if the pregnancy continued. She gave evidence that her unit did not carry out surgical terminations and the only provider that did have the ability to provide a termination was in London but it was &#8220;too far&#8221;. She clarified in her evidence that misoprostol would require five doses orally or vaginally and that there would likely need to be vaginal examination over the 24-48 hour period. She told me that Ms H had not had a vaginal examination. She explained that it was accepted that restraint could not be used to administer the oral or vaginal medication or carry out the vaginal examinations, in the event that Ms H was non-compliant. If she was resistant they would need to abandon the medical termination. She accepted there was a risk of sepsis and of heavy bleeding.</p>

Ms H&#8217;s mother says that Ms H &#8220;told her that she would not want to have a baby to look after at this stage in her life because she could only just look after herself and would not cope looking after a baby as well.&#8221; Ms H has said that she :does want to be a mother in the future&#8221; but was still too young for motherhood now. Ms G reports that Ms H&#8217;s mother&#8217;s view is that Ms H&#8217;s true wish would be for the termination. It is reported by Ms G that Ms H&#8217;s mother was able to reflect on Ms H&#8217;s views in respect of a termination it is said took place when she was seventeen. Ms H&#8217;s mother, Mrs MH, indicates Ms H was in a relationship with a man for 2 &#189; months between April and July 2023. She had never met him. It is said the relationship end was a catalyst for Ms H to take cocaine. Ms H&#8217;s mother is very concerned the pregnancy has run this far and the &#8220;last thing she wants for&#8221; Ms H is for her to give birth to a baby. She was of the view a surgical termination was preferable over a medical termination. Ms G says that at a Zoom call between her and Ms H and her mother, Ms H said she definitely wanted termination of the &#8220;rape baby&#8221;. The only time she contradicted this view was that she would have the baby if it was &#8220;Z&#8217;s&#8221;. It is not clear who Z is. </p>

She would be at risk of failing to take her medication and there would be &#8220;an escalation in her risks both for and the child&#8221;. Ms H would be at risk of self-harm. Her aggressive behaviours would be very difficult to manage when pregnant and the likelihood of restraint would place her and the unborn baby at risk. There is an increased risk of post-natal depression. There are risks of physical harm to Ms H as she has tried to &#8220;pass&#8221; the foetus. There is a risk that full term delivery would put her at risk of &#8220;psychiatric deterioration&#8221;.  Dr A concludes as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Helpfully Dr A also discussed with Dr D, Ms H&#8217;s obstetric needs. He has reviewed the care plan. He opines that a medical termination is likely to have the least impact on her mental health. Dr A also believes that Ms H is likely to be &#8220;compliant both with the termination medication and any associated pain relief&#8221;. He states that he would be opposed to the use of restraint should Ms H be non-compliant during the medical termination, other than in the context of a medical emergency and sudden deterioration. Dr A discussed Ms H&#8217;s case with Professor R at a hospital 130 miles away. Prof R explains that Ms H would likely require to lie on a couch in the lithotomy position (flat on her back with her calves in stirrups) awake for around six hours. Dr A considered this could be traumatising for Ms H. Dr A warns of a significant escalation in risks to Ms H of surgical termination. Dr A states: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Due to the nature of the delusions around how she became pregnant (sexually assaulted by eight men), it is my opinion that a procedure as described above (i.e. the insertion of instruments into her vagina when she is awake) at this point in time will only make things worse for her.</span>&#8221; Dr A also raises concerns about the termination taking place under a general anaesthetic and whether this might feed further delusions on Ms H&#8217;s part.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dr A gave clear and focused oral evidence. He told me that Ms H had been &#8216;very&#8217; consistent in wanting a termination. She had sought out his assistance and contacted him in LinkedIn and he sought consent to become involved in assisting her with the issues before the court, which was granted. He said that whilst she was pregnant he could not optimise the treatment of her Schizoaffective disorder and that Clozapine could not be administered whilst she was pregnant. He said a clear benefit of medical termination was that she could be supported locally by staff who knew her. He volunteered to be available to oversee support and assist a medical termination if this took place in Greater Manchester. He said she wants the pregnancy over &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; and that she is tired of having conversations about her pregnancy. &#8220;She wants it to end&#8221;. She told him there would be no need for restraint if she were to have a medical termination. When asked if he had misunderstood how long she would need to be in &#8220;stirrups&#8221; to have a surgical termination (six hours versus a short period of time to have the dilatory rods inserted) he said that was not a material matter. He was concerned that a surgical termination could perpetuate her delusions about what medical professionals had done to her. His evidence was that she does not &#8220;fully grasp&#8221; what a surgical termination involves. He said that she had been given covert medication &#8220;fairly successfully&#8221;. She understood a medical termination would involve around 5 tablets, not just one. He asked her about this only yesterday and she &#8220;understood it&#8221;. He told the court that she informed him that she had broken her ribs and understood what pain is and wanted &#8220;to get it [the termination] done&#8221;. He accepted in answer to a question from Ms Richards that in the context that Ms H might have pain, bleeding, cramps, and the need to actively &#8216;push&#8217; that her compliance was &#8220;not straightforward but challenging but she had maintained and been consistent&#8221; in her wish for a medical termination. He said it would be very &#8220;tricky&#8221; to get her to Newcastle for a surgical termination. That she knew a medical termination would be local and she would &#8220;suspect&#8221; if conveyed somewhere else. He said Mrs MH&#8217;s presence at the termination would be &#8220;really positive&#8221; and she is &#8220;really helpful and supportive&#8221;. In answer to a question from Mr Sachdeva he said that Ms H &#8220;is keen for the pregnancy to end, she wants control over that. Anything done forcibly is likely to have a significant effect on her&#8221;. It was important to &#8220;to give her some control and autonomy and to be supported with the termination.&#8221; He was clear it was more damaging to have the surgical termination. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She sets out the circumstances of when surgery would be available to Ms H at her hospital. She says that if Ms H has heavy bleeding the clinical team would seek to remove the foetus or placenta vaginally if expelled from uterus. If that is not possible, the team may need to perform a hysterotomy (an abdominal incision) which would also require uterotonics. In the case of torrential bleeding, Ms H may require a hysterectomy. The risk of a hysterectomy is said to be less than 1%. In such circumstances another consultant would become involved. Dr D&#8217;s evidence is:</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;It follows that there is a stark difference between the Trust offering emergency surgery by way of a hysterotomy if medical termination does not proceed as planned, and a surgical termination. Hysterotomy requires an abdominal incision to be made. Whereas a surgical termination can be performed vaginally, at later gestation the cervix needs priming by either chemical or mechanical methods. The &#8216;emergency&#8217; procedure is not something that we would offer at the outset and hence cannot be seen as an alternative to the two options available to the court which are (i) medical termination at my Trust; or (ii) surgical termination with an alternative provider (if they are willing to proceed to a surgical termination after assessing [Ms H]). A surgical termination will involve a delay before assessment and then treatment which cannot be considered to be desirable for [Ms H].&#8221;</p>

If Ms H requires to go to theatre for placenta removal or because of heavy bleeding, then &#8216;most patients&#8217; would receive a spinal anaesthetic, which is a local anaesthesia. This will depend on Ms H&#8217;s presentation. If that is not possible then general anaesthesia would be offered. When anaesthetised, then the placenta could be removed manually or by suction.

She said that if there were to be a medical termination, arrangements could be put in place so that Ms H did not see the delivered foetus should she not want to. She reiterated her written opinion that a medical termination was better for Ms H because it was consistent with her wishes, there was no risk of perforation of the womb or risk of damage to the neck of the womb. It was also better as it did not involve travel to a hospital in Newcastle. In answer to questions from Ms Richards she said that as the surgical procedure was not offered at her hospital they did not really explain to Ms H what it involved. Dr AD and a midwife went last Friday to try to explain it but Ms H did not engage. She referred me to Dr A&#8217;s discussion. She said that the pain involved in a medical termination was predominantly in the second 24 hours of the 24-48 hour period. She had no experience of Ms H&#8217;s pain threshold. She said there was not much active involvement on the part of the patient to deliver the foetus but sometimes more effort was needed to remove the placenta. She said most woman only required 5 doses of misoprostol and it was &#8220;very rare&#8221; that a short break was needed and the process started again. </p>

Dr D understood she has received covert medication in apple juice. If there was a partial procedure and she was not compliant with all medication, then there could be risks to Ms H&#8217;s physical health. If the foetus remained in &#8220;its bag of fluid&#8221; there would unlikely be an infection. She said that if she was bleeding but the foetus/placenta did not come out then they would need to do a vaginal examination. There may need to be more than one. If they are unsure as to the location of the foetus and placenta then an examination would be needed. She was asked by Ms Richards about the care plan which states:</p>

In answer to questions from Ms Richards she accepted that, given she would have a private room, if she wanted to leave, for example to smoke when she was bleeding, &#8220;we might have to prevent her leaving&#8221;. Once she starts the medical termination she would need to continue. Attempts would be made to persuade her and then use of covert medication could be deployed. There was a risk that if she began the process and did not complete it because of non-compliance she was at risk of infection if the foetus&#8217; &#8220;bag&#8221; broke. She was concerned that vaginal examinations would be needed if the foetus and placenta were not delivered after taking the medication. Clinicians would need to check the location, particularly of the placenta. It might be in the uterus, not having come into the vagina and would need to be removed surgically under general anaesthesia. She said that some of the placenta remaining was &#8220;pretty common&#8221; and happened in 13/100 patients subject of a medical termination. She accepted Ms Richards&#8217; question that Ms H was at risk of a greater than 13/100 chance of the need for surgical intervention given her mental health co-morbidity because she might be non-compliant with the medication. In answer to a question from Mr Berry in re-examination she said that Ms H was not at higher risk of a hysterotomy than the average woman. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">His evidence was that he was content to provide a surgical termination. This would likely take place on Wednesday 1 November 2023 in Newcastle. Given the complexity and arranging staffing it was not likely to take place earlier. He emphasised certain studies that demonstrated the patient&#8217;s choice of termination procedure was very important. He agreed the risk of further intervention at the risk of 13/100 was likely with a medical termination. He explained the three options for &#8220;priming&#8221; the cervix in advance of the surgical termination. The first was with the use of small rods inserted into the cervix to procure mechanical dilation. These would be inserted with the patient resting on their back with their feet in stirrups. With skilled clinicians and cooperation this could take place quickly. There was no need for the patient to be in situ for six hours. This was his preferred method of dilation and was the most effective. It required 6-8 hours from insertion of the rods for dilation to take place. A patient could be ambulant after insertion. The second option was pharmacological priming. At 17 weeks +4 days this involved one dose of drugs six hours before and then a further dose three hours before the general anaesthesia prior to the surgical termination. The most effective administration of the drugs was vaginally but they could be given orally. There were two important risks of pharmacological dilation: the first was that the dilation would be ineffective and the second was the risk of termination before theatre. The third option was insertion of the rods under general anaesthesia and then waiting before a second general anaesthetic to carry out the surgical termination. This ran the risks of two general anaesthetics. He said this was a low risk but deferred to an anaesthetist. He was alive to the risks of non-compliance. He had no prior experience of requiring restraint in patients the subject of a surgical termination. </p>

This would need to be treated quickly. He said the chance of failure of the medical termination was 1/200 patients (0.5 %). If the patient was non-compliant at some stage with the medical termination, it having begun with taking some of the medication, then there was still a &#8220;high chance&#8221; there would be an abortion but the timescale could be several days for the bleeding. This would still involve the risk of the placenta not being expelled which would require surgery. </p>

She last met with her on Zoom on 27 September 2023. She was very concerned she had not been informed about her daughter&#8217;s pregnancy and found out by accident. She was concerned her daughter would not cooperate with a medical termination. She was concerned about the pain of a medical procedure. She felt a surgical termination would be less traumatic. She said she felt Ms H would become very distressed and would be in pain with a medical termination. She said that on reflection she would be with her daughter if there was a medical or surgical termination. She wanted a screen in place so as not to see the delivery of the foetus. She was re-assured by Dr A&#8217;s involvement. </p>

When I say rational, I do not necessarily say they are good reasons, nor do I indicate whether I agree with her decision, for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> expressly provides that someone is not to be treated as unable to make a decision simply because it is an unwise decision. It seems to me that this lady has made, and has maintained for an appreciable period of time, a decision. It may be that aspects of her reasons may be skewed by paranoia. There are other reasons which she has and which she has expressed. My own opinion is that it would be a total affront to the autonomy of this patient to conclude that she lacks capacity to the level required to make this decision. It is of course a profound and grave decision, but it does not necessarily involve complex issues. It is a decision that she has made and maintains; and she has defended and justified her decision against challenge. It is a decision which she has the capacity to reach. So for those reasons I conclude that it has not been established that she lacks capacity to make decisions about her desired termination, and I will either make a declaration to that effect or dismiss these proceedings&#8221;</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8220;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless&#8221;. But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</p>

The first, which is for the doctors, not this court, is whether the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref> are satisfied. If they are not, then that is that: the court cannot authorise, let alone direct, what, on this hypothesis, is unlawful. If, on the other hand, the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref> are satisfied, then the role of the court is to supply, on behalf of the mother, the consent which, as in the case of any other medical or surgical procedure, is a pre-requisite to the lawful performance of the procedure. In relation to this issue the ultimate determinant, as in all cases where the court is concerned with a child or an incapacitated adult, is the mother's best interests.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">An important practical consequence flows from this. In determining the mother's best interests this court is not concerned to examine those issues which, in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref>, are a matter for doctors. But the point goes somewhat further. Since there can be no lawful termination unless the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> are satisfied, and since it is a matter for the doctors to determine whether those conditions are satisfied, it follows that in addressing the question of the mother's best interests this court is entitled to proceed on the assumption that if there is to be a termination the statutory conditions are indeed satisfied. Two things flow from this. In the first place this court can proceed on the basis (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1(1)</ref>(a) and (c)) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, to the life of the pregnant woman or of injury to her physical or mental health or (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(b)) that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to her physical or mental health. Secondly, if any of these conditions is satisfied the court is already at a position where, on the face of it, the interests of the mother may well be best served by the court authorising the termination."</p>

It can be offered by Dr D&#8217;s team. The obstetricians and midwives have now met with Ms H several times they know each other. Ms H can also be supported by staff known to her from the second applicant&#8217;s Trust because of the close proximity. Importantly, Dr A can also be present on and off over the 24-48 hour period of a medical termination. He would, I find, provide considerable support and re-assurance to Ms H. The medical termination can take place as early as 25 October 2023. It avoids delay. I agree with Dr D&#8217;s evidence that each passing day counts. This is because the foetus will continue to grow and therefore the risks to Ms H gradually increase. More importantly however is the damage to her mental health. I accept Dr A&#8217;s evidence that Ms H is frustrated and tired of talking about the termination. I accept she wants the medical termination and for the matter to be resolved as soon as possible. </p>

Ms H would have to be conveyed from Manchester to Newcastle. It is likely she would need to be informed of why she is being transferred. She is, as set out in the summary of her wishes and feelings below, likely to be strongly opposed to a surgical termination. I find that she is likely to be non-compliant and anguished by this prospect. It is not clear in the evidence but a sizeable team from the second applicant&#8217;s staff would likely be required to travel with her. Possibly a ratio of 3:1, at least, would be required. The journey itself would be risky. Ms H would need to travel the afternoon before the surgical termination as Professor R told me, so that she would be present on the ward early in the morning to allow for the dilation to begin. She may have to be restrained from leaving the ward overnight.  Of the three possible options for dilation, in my judgement, the second would be the least harmful to Ms H. This would avoid the need for insertion of rods into her vagina. It avoids the possible trauma of her legs being placed in stirrups given her strong feelings of having been sexually abused. The pharmacological dilation would be less damaging to her mental health. However, I note it is less effective and creates the risk of abortion before theatre. This could be very distressing. Professor R, as I have noted above, is prepared to carry out a surgical termination based on the pharmacological termination. I have discounted the third option involving two general anaesthetics and the insertion of rods for dilation, as the pharmacological option appears better and less stressful for Ms H. </p>

Notwithstanding the precautions that could be taken by the second applicant whilst Ms H remains detained on section, there is a real risk of very significant mental harm if Ms H is forced to have a surgical termination. Those risks include the risk she would kill herself. The Official Solicitor is entirely correct to factor this matter in as a decisive factor in favour of medical termination. </p>

The clear evidence of Professor R was that both procedures are for patients without co-morbidities essentially safe and effective treatments.  I accept a medical termination runs a less than 1% risk of a hysterotomy or a hysterectomy. Dr D&#8217;s evidence was that she had never seen a hysterotomy performed in 7-8 years of clinical practice. I accept the evidence that 13% of woman will require a further &#8216;intervention&#8217; most likely caused by the placenta not being discharged. This may cause bleeding and require a general anaesthetic and surgery. However, whilst I acknowledge the risks of the anaesthesia, this is a routine and generally safe procedure. I also accept that for Ms H&#8217;s the 13 % risk of intervention is, for her, likely to be a higher risk given the risks of her non-compliance. However, I note on the other hand that a general anaesthetic will be required with a surgical termination. I also accept the risks of perforation of the womb or damage to the neck of the womb of the surgical termination. There is a the risk of an infection caused by the amnionic sack bursting but the foetus not being delivered, which would require surgery in the event of a medical termination.</p>

A procedure that could leave her distressed, in pain, bleeding and with cramps and other side effects from the medication. There is also the risk of her seeing the foetus being delivered. This is likely to be distressing and is exacerbated by her mental ill-health. Her mother is particularly worried about this. There is also the risk that the termination is not successful and a surgical termination would then in any event be required. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In summary, I agree with the pros and cons set out by Ms Richards above. In my judgement, Ms H&#8217;s very strong wish for a termination and her stronger wish not to have a surgical termination have a powerful role in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> 2005 Act best interests analysis. Whilst I have found her to lack capacity to make this decision and I have found her to have false and delusional beliefs, the termination of her pregnancy remains a profoundly personal one for her. It may not matter very much to her whether the foetus is alive or dead, whether it is one foetus or twins or whether the conception was a result of rape. She has a visceral desire to be free from her pregnancy and she has elaborated consistently and clearly her firm desire for a medical termination and opposition to a surgical termination. This perspective is not one the court is unable to give effect to. On the contrary, it is supported by two NHS Trusts. It is also, on balance, supported by the Official Solicitor. Notwithstanding my concerns in respect of Ms H&#8217;s non-compliance with a medical termination and the risks of her being deeply anguished during the 24-48 hour period, I consider this less psychologically harmful to her than being conveyed and possibly restrained <span style="font-style:italic">en route </span>to Newcastle, where she would then be faced with being in hospital against her will for around 24 hours and would quite likely require chemical or physical restraint, given her opposition to a surgical termination.</p>

Professor R said he would consider this. No party sought an adjournment for this purpose. All recognised that further delay was wholly contrary to Ms H&#8217;s welfare. I consider such a plan to be practically and clinically very difficult. It would likely involve multiple mental health staff working shifts to cover the 4-5 days required. It is not a realistic option and is not one properly before the court. </p>

However, I am persuaded to authorise restraint only in circumstances where the medical termination has begun, Ms H has been administered the medication described above, but after the passage of time, either the foetus or placenta or both have not been discharged and the clinicians require, to protect Ms H&#8217;s safety, to carry out a vaginal examination. </p>
