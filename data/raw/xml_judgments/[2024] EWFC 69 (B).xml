I have read, however, a very full bundle of documents and I have been very ably assisted during the course of the hearing by counsel for the parties and by the father&#8217;s solicitors who have undertaken much of the preparatory work.  I have heard evidence from both parents, an expert psychologist called Dr F and, given that this is a Practice Direction 36Z case, the author from Cafcass of the child impact reports who is called Ms G.</p>

To that end, I am proposing to direct a transcript at the end.  However, the fact that I do not mention something in this judgment does not mean that I have not fully considered everything.  It is impossible, in fact, to refer to absolutely everything that I have heard and read.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; positions, in summary, are these.  The father seeks a final order that V and W live with him and have only indirect contact with the mother.  He says that the mother does not accept the court&#8217;s findings and that she continues to perpetrate abuse, with which he struggles.  Until the mother addresses her own abusive behaviours, he says, there is no direct contact which is safe.  He also seeks that the prohibited steps order dated 4 July 2022 and the s.91(14) order dated 12 October 2023 continue, and that the non-molestation order made on 5 July 2023 be extended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother sought, at the hearing on 14 November 2023, an order, as I have said, that the proceedings be extended in order to give her time to engage in a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme and that supervised contact continue in the interim.  The court declined that application, and her primary position today is that her contact with the children does not need to be supervised at all.  That is in slight contrast to the position as set out in her final evidence dated 17 January 2024, in which she says she was seeking a final order for shared care which mirrored that ordered on 21 July 2022.  However, it was submitted to me today that, if the court is not in agreement with the mother, then the mother seeks for supervised contact to continue at this stage.  The mother opposes any application for no contact and she does not view indirect contact as being able to meet the best interests of the children, whether in the short, medium, or long-term.</p>

It said that it was almost always in the interests of the child to have contact with the parent with whom he or she does not live, and the court should not readily accept that the child&#8217;s welfare would be injured by direct contact.</p>

I made a series of findings that the mother had perpetrated abuse against the father, the children, and the paternal grandmother, and also that she had made false allegations against the father.  I made a finding that the father was only likely to have proposed shared care at all in order to keep the peace and that that was therefore linked to the findings made against the mother.

Once again, I gave a judgment explaining why that application failed to give proper consideration to the outcome of the fact-finding hearing and why, the psychologist&#8217;s and child impact reports not having been received at the time, the application was premature.

I have directed myself in the context of the hearing in June 2023 as to that.  It is to be expected that they were emotional during the course of giving their evidence given the significance of the issues in this case.  Considering what they said, though, it seemed to me that both parties expressed themselves ably and the mother had the assistance of an interpreter.  It was evident to me that both parties are clever people, and both had submitted witness statements which presented their thought processes logically.  What struck me about their oral evidence was that, whilst the father&#8217;s thought processes remained clear, in contrast the mother&#8217;s live evidence was peppered with inconsistency. </p>

For example, she would ask to know who was looking after the children, or she would raise issues in relation to insect bites or minor injuries.  He acknowledges that, on one view, that these questions can be viewed as reasonable, but he says that he understood them to be the mother&#8217;s ongoing attempts to undermine his parenting, maintain control over him, and to gain an advantage for herself in these proceedings.  </p>

The father accepted that the contact arrangements have settled down and that that particular concern has not been prevalent lately.  However, he pointed to the notes as an example of how contact supervision does not protect him from allegations being made by the mother.  He said he is on edge prior to every handover and goes through a mental checklist to ensure that there is no risk of any angle being used by the mother to make another allegation.  It was suggested to him that he could just let things go and move on with the support plan that the mother proposes but he disagreed that it was that easy.  He suffered years of abuse and he said he does not trust her.</p>

She presented in a heightened emotional state and talked over the contact supervisor who recorded that V&#8217;s welfare did not appear to factor into the situation.

From that, the court can see that she clearly loves V and W and that they love her.  She has an ability to cater for their physical, emotional, and developmental needs.  Her [&#8230;] heritage is an important factor in V and W&#8217;s own lives and she is better placed, on any view, to support them with that than anyone else.

The fact that she does not accept that, in relation to the physical abuse she did accept in December 2020, injury was caused does, in my judgment, suggest either that she continues to minimise the impact of her behaviour or that she was testing the waters to see what minimum level of acceptance would enable her to move matters forward within these proceedings.</p>

Taking that logic through to its conclusion, what she presumably believed, when writing her statement, in consequence, is that W was born as a result of what she says she described as sexual assault and not what the court actually found, which was that the sexual intercourse was consensual.</p>

In the context of other allegations, she has tried to adduce new evidence or has resubmitted evidence which was already before the court at the fact-finding hearing as new evidence, such as text messages dated 12 August 2019.  I gave a case management ruling about my approach to that at the start of the hearing, so the parties could be clear about the court&#8217;s views, and that needs to be considered alongside the judgment that I give now.  That further evidence was submitted by the mother despite the fact that the preparation for the fact-finding hearing was carefully managed at a time when she was legally represented, despite her unsuccessful appeal, and despite her apparent understanding that the welfare determination at this hearing is based on the factual matrix established at the fact-finding hearing.  I was told by counsel representing her, in the position statement submitted on the night before this hearing started, that the mother sought recitals to the order that I would be making today to redress the injustice which she perceived that she had suffered as a result of the findings made in June 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the other things that the mother seemed to think that the court got wrong was what she perceived as its failure to determine her allegations of abuse.  As I have already said, her appeal in respect of the non-resolution of her allegations of abuse was unsuccessful.  The mother has, on one view, persisted in attempting to make allegations against the father or, on another view, attempted to redress the balance portrayed in the evidential picture before the court.  However, what the court cannot get away from is the fact that her ultimate proposal for child arrangements has been, at every stage since the fact-finding hearing until she gave evidence yesterday, for shared care.  In my judgment, that alone tends to confirm that her decision in March 2023, that it was neither necessary nor proportionate for her allegations against the father to be resolved, was the right one then, and remains the right one now.</p>

I have checked the contemporaneous police disclosure whose terms are slightly different to the more recent disclosure.  Whilst I accept that the referral to CPS was made by the police on 28 October 2021 in relation to a prospective charge for coercion and control, it remains correct that a decision was later taken in November 2021 by CPS to charge the mother with the offence.  It was only because the father retracted his complaint at about the same time that the police ultimately decided to take no further action, presumably on the public interest test rather than on the evidential test pursuant to the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>

On balance, it seems to me that this is one example of which there are many of the mother, to use her own words, &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; parts of the evidence which, taken out of context, supported her position in a way which was liable to be misleading.  I have reached that conclusion, on balance, not least because the court directed itself specifically in para.185 of its June 2023 judgment, which is the very next paragraph to that with which the mother takes issue, as to the approach that it took.  The court could not have been clearer.</p>

She said that she understood that children get bruises and that the children had sustained bruises when she had had care of them, that she was not concerned about the father&#8217;s care, and that, had the court agreed that the contact supervisor could give evidence, all of this misunderstanding could have been cleared up.  However, that is at odds with her statement dated 4 September 2023 in which she stated, in terms, that the injuries sustained by the children in the father&#8217;s care were only witnessed by him, and that he had not provided any explanation to her.  There was a small bruise to V&#8217;s bottom which the mother pointed out to the contact supervisor on 5 September 2023.

It was not, however, clear to me why the mother went physically to the school, rather than telephoning, if all she needed to know was about the provenance of the document.  She said she did not think to telephone and that she simply wanted a role in the children&#8217;s lives.  I do not need to make a finding about this, but I doubt, given the mother&#8217;s past presentation when she perceives that she is being challenged, that it was simply a question of her wanting to calmly check that the document had come from the school.  </p>

That is informed by the gravity of the abuse perpetrated by the mother and the lengthy period of time over which it was sustained.  Although the impact on the father would be greater if contact were to be unsupervised, Dr F&#8217;s conclusions are that, by remaining involved in court proceedings or where mandated to have any form of contact, whether direct or indirect, with the mother, his abuser, there is a lack of ability for the father to exercise autonomy in his life or in the lives of V and W.  Lack of agency, lack of autonomy, and a perception of constraint, Dr F says, is a central feature of coercion and control and, in her opinion, likely to exacerbate the father&#8217;s symptoms.  That, therefore, includes even taking the children to contact where he knows the children would be spending time with the mother.</p>

She thought it had similarities, too, to stalking behaviour.  Of the email to the court dated 22 January 2024 in which the mother alleged that the father had set up a false email address or tried to obtain the mother&#8217;s records, Dr F referred to consistency with her view that the mother projects her less desirable behaviours onto others, in the same way as she referred to the paternal grandmother as a narcissist.  When considering the mother having gone to the school at 7.20 a.m. on the morning of the first day of the hearing, Dr F considered that that was an example of the mother&#8217;s tendency to behave impulsively instead of being able to contain her discomfort.</p>

That view was reinforced by the recent actions in obtaining the therapy notes and the email to the court of 22 January 2024 in which the mother overtly says that the father and his solicitors are lying.  Dr F thought that that was inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s expressed remorse.  Dr F considered, therefore, that the mother would be unlikely to be eligible for a perpetrator programme due to her lack of insight into the impact of the physical and emotional abuse that she has inflicted.  </p>

When the mother loses control, she must regain it at all costs, even if that means a lack of respect for boundaries.  That was a theme which permeated her evidence and provided the context for the mother&#8217;s position that she is fighting to have care for her children.  For example, it was consistent, Dr F thought, with the high number of applications made in these proceedings, and including the application that Dr F needed to make herself.  She considered that the mother believes her behaviour to be rational, and that it is also to do with survival, whereas others, including the court, have understood that same behaviour to be irrational.  She referred to it as being the mother&#8217;s narrative, and that she is justified in her own mind because she believes that she has been wronged and has a need to seek vengeance.  The mother&#8217;s behaviours, Dr F considered, were ongoing.  Her assessment was therefore that the mother presents a high risk of future perpetration of IPV or domestic abuse, and at particularly elevated levels through coercive control.

An example she used is the finding about the assault of the father whilst he was driving.

In that respect, she refers to the contact notes of 8 September 2023, when what the mother considered she deserved appeared to eclipse her ability to put V&#8217;s needs first.

That is currently undertaken by contact supervisors, which Dr F considered protected against overt or direct risks to the children.  An enhanced level of intervention might include, she thought, the therapeutic input for both parents and, if there were to be a criminal conviction of the mother, there would be likely to be monitoring of the mother by His Majesty&#8217;s Probation Service through imposition of license conditions, <span style="font-style:italic">et cetera</span>.

However, Dr F has reservations about the mother&#8217;s capacity to engage meaningfully with that therapy at the moment due to likely resistance flowing from suspicion of external influence, her primary interest in her own needs or an inflated sense of self, and a lack of acceptance of any need to make change.  Once any schema therapy starts, Dr F considered that it may take at least twelve to fifteen months to complete.  Dr F said that there was a risk of destabilisation during the first three months of therapy and so one would not expect to see positive change in that period and, indeed, she said she would expect to see the opposite.</p>

That does not therefore easily lend itself to reports being made back to court by the treating clinician.  Dr F said it has to come back to behaviour, and whether we are seeing different behaviour. She was asked how the court can distinguish between appropriately motivated change and disguised compliance.  What Dr F said about that is that it is tricky, but one has to look at patterns of behaviour.  It would involve evidencing that the mother had engaged with therapy and a lack of offence paralleling behaviour.  One way of measuring that, she said, might be to instruct a further independent assessment with no reference being made to the treating clinician.  </p>

She thought that the mother may defeat the purpose of a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme through her impression management.  In other words, the mother would be liable to do whatever it took for the boxes to be ticked.  Given her pattern of deceit, Dr F was not satisfied that the fact that the mother has tried to enrol on to a programme equates to genuine remorse or an understanding of a need to effect change.  It might show, she said, a willingness to turn up and do the work.  Whether it is evidence of motivation to make change or will, in fact, elicit change to reduce risk is different.  She was clear that she was not saying that the mother should not do a programme but described it as being like applying a plaster to a septic wound.  It might cover it up but at the same time it may not target the root of the problem which may require antibiotics.  Dr F describes the psychotherapy as the antibiotics.</p>

Dr F highlighted the point that the evidence is that that threat has been present since the fact-finding hearing and it has not been a sufficient deterrent to prevent the mother&#8217;s abusive behaviours even very recently.  Similarly, if a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> order were made, Dr F described that as an extrinsic motivator and not intrinsic to the mother&#8217;s motivation to change.

She agreed, for example, that creating a false email account and obtaining the therapy notes was significantly concerning.  If the father was having thoughts about how far the mother would be prepared to go, Ms G thought that that would impact on his emotional availability to the children, whether by virtue of his being distracted or distraught in front of them.  She was concerned also about whether the mother would take steps to influence the children, although she did accept that that is mitigated by supervision of contact and there has been no real indication of that happening so far throughout the contact notes.</p>

I asked some questions about where the idea that an exit plan is required came from in that, in my experience, the court does order supervised contact on an open-ended basis, for example, in care proceedings.  Ms G told the court ultimately that it was a matter of Cafcass policy.  On one view, the mother undertaking a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme, whether that be a programme which she paid for herself or a perpetrator programme directed after any later criminal conviction, Ms G thought, would provide an exit plan.  Ms G considered that, if the mother were to have accepted the findings made by the court and had she been eligible, therefore, for a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme, Ms G could have given consideration to inviting the court to direct supervised contact.  However, it was principally because of the lack of acceptance by the mother of the findings, and the lack of insight, that Ms G had concluded that supervised contact could not be safely directed, but that was primarily based on her assessment of the welfare risks rather than the need for an exit plan.</p>

In other words, that it was neither necessary nor proportionate for her allegations to be resolved in order for the court to be able to make welfare decisions in this case.  She has, after all, proposed on multiple occasions since June 2023 that the shared care arrangement continue, including in her most recent witness statement.

When the court thinks about that, the key difference is that, by and large, those arrangements are underpinned with an order that a local authority shares parental responsibility for the children, perhaps by virtue of a care order.  In turn, the local authority has an obligation to keep contact under review but, of course, the local authority in those circumstances is a corporate parent.  In private law proceedings, a local authority is not there to hold the ring, and that dynamic review of contact has to be undertaken by the parents themselves.  It is well outside the role of contact supervisors to do any of that for the father and, in my judgment, it would be impracticable, even ignoring the expense, for him to employ someone else to fulfil those roles even if, which I doubt on the psychological evidence, that would alleviate the types of symptoms which the father is described as experiencing.</p>

The mother has been found to have posed a significant risk of harm to the father and continues to do so.  I am reinforced in my view by the mother&#8217;s conduct since the hearing in June 2023, in that she shows no sign of accepting her past wrongdoing and has continued to use these proceedings as something of a battleground, for example, by making, since the fact-finding hearing, five interim applications for contact on an almost identical basis and three applications for disclosure of particular CCTV evidence.  The court has made six orders in this month alone based on applications made by the mother.  Whilst one of those applications, for the giving of oral evidence by Dr F, was to be expected, the others were borne of the mother&#8217;s mistrust that the information she had received was complete, or of her disagreeing with decisions made by the court.  The court certified both of the applications made by the mother to set aside orders made by it as totally without merit.</p>

That is consistent with Dr F&#8217;s evidence about her psychological profile, the father&#8217;s evidence that the mother takes every point that she possibly can, however reasonable or otherwise, and the court&#8217;s view previously that the mother seeks to control outcomes for herself.  In turn, in my judgment, those matters both underline her lack of introspection and insight into the findings of abuse that the court has made against her, and reinforce the court&#8217;s conclusion that she has used the proceedings themselves as a form of abuse.</p>

The mother accepted a small number of the findings, but those were admitted in a mealy-mouthed sort of way and their impact minimised.  She maintained her position that she did not accept the majority of the findings of the court until after Dr F and Ms G had given their live evidence within the context of this hearing.  She was then fundamentally unclear in her evidence about what she did accept, for example, by saying on a number of occasions that she accepted that findings had been made by the court against her, rather than whether she accepted that the findings were true.  That, it seemed to me, was likely to have been borne of an internal dissonance, a lack of the intrinsic belief described by Dr F that she needs to develop, namely that she was wrong to have behaved as she did and that she is ready to face up to her abuse and effect change.  When the court considers whether it is more probable that she had something of an epiphany over the weekend and now shows genuine remorse and insight, or whether she has instead sought to limit damage to herself in her oral evidence, the court is satisfied that it is the latter that is significantly more likely than not.</p>

The onslaught of applications, and the allegations made against the father in contact notes, to the police and to the court, have been relentless.  She has complained about the father&#8217;s solicitors and demanded that they withdraw from acting, knowing that they are part of his support network.  She has continued to behave aggressively and dishonestly.  The deceitful and unlawful procurement of the father&#8217;s confidential therapy notes and her reaction to being caught out is an example of that, and highlights the collateral damage which she has prepared to allow be inflicted, for example, that to the therapist herself.</p>

Her sudden expression of acceptance of some of the court&#8217;s findings yesterday was, in my judgment, a further attempt to control outcomes for herself in these proceedings.  How could the father himself manage the mother&#8217;s egocentric and manipulative behaviours on an ongoing basis?

The mother does not have a good track record of operating within boundaries that are set.  The evidence of her fabricating an email address to obtain documents in respect of which the court had already refused disclosure is but one example.  It is submitted by the mother that she will know, in effect, that this is the last chance saloon, and that if she steps over the mark then direct contact will stop altogether.  Dr F&#8217;s point that the mother has known that that is a consequence that has been on the cards for some months, and yet it has still not deterred her, it seemed to me, is a good one.</p>

The father would presumably need to issue a contempt application, thus starting a new set of proceedings with all the attendant triggers for his PTSD that goes with litigation.  The mother then may seek to defend those allegations, her liberty at that stage being on the line, on the basis that any safeguarding concerns raised by her were reasonable or any allegations made were not untrue.  If that were to happen, then before they knew it, the parties would be back in the midst of hotly contested allegations.  In my judgment, the undertaking offered provides inadequate safeguard.  Fundamentally, the mother&#8217;s safety plan requires a high requirement for her to operate within boundaries.  The court has no confidence that she will.  Notwithstanding that she is a lawyer, she is prepared to break the law.  She shows very little respect for boundaries at all. </p>

I can see why she told the court in her evidence that she had accepted the court&#8217;s findings when she had not.  I have given myself a <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> direction because I understand that today she is facing the consequences of her actions which include the potential for an order that she may have no contact with her children.

What Dr F said was that the father&#8217;s ability to care for V and W was intrinsically linked to his remaining outside of an abusive relationship.  I accept that evidence and, in my judgment, consider that there is every reason to conclude that that would include separated parents in a coparenting relationship where the mother, as here, has continued to perpetrate abuse.  That is consistent with Dr F&#8217;s other conclusions that contact was likely to be harmful to the father, and that that had a consequence for V and W associated with his lack of autonomy in respect of parenting decisions.  Ms G&#8217;s views about the risks posed to the children due to the impact on the father&#8217;s ability to provide stable care was consistent with the principles in paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 12J and paragraph 31 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span>.</p>

On Dr F&#8217;s evidence, the father&#8217;s own state of emotional wellbeing is likely to worsen all the time that he has to maintain communication with the mother, as I have said.  What he therefore needs, and what the children need, in my judgment, is for the father to have the time and space to heal and, for example, to carry into effect the therapeutic recommendations of Dr F.</p>

They will lose some of their links to their [&#8230;] parts of their heritage even if, as the father said, he would himself endeavour to promote that.  Whilst I accept the evidence of Dr F and Ms G that some of the observations of V in the document from the school are consistent with the idea that he suffered harm as a result of exposure to domestic abuse, I am very aware that I cannot place great weight on that, given the way in which the document was produced, the fact that the court has not heard evidence from the teacher who produced it and the relatively limited context provided.  I do not close my mind to the possibility that some of what is described may have come about as a result of the changes to child arrangements in June 2023.  That is, on the face of it, consistent with what the father describes in this evidence about the children&#8217;s resistance to going to contact in the autumn of 2023.  It is difficult to predict to what extent a further change of circumstances will impact the children&#8217;s emotional and psychological wellbeing, but the court takes the view that it will be extremely difficult for V and W.  However, what the document from the school also tends to suggest is that, with proper support, V and, by extension, W can be helped to manage any adverse impact to their wellbeing.</p>

On my reading of the provision, the starting point is that paragraph 36(3) is in mandatory terms, namely that contact should be ordered <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">only</span> if I am satisfied of the matters in subparagraphs (a) and (b).  As to the latter, I am not satisfied, on balance, that any form of direct contact would not see the father being subjected to further domestic abuse by the mother.

Ms G took my comments on board, and I understand that V&#8217;s school is able to support him to receive indirect contact from the mother and to check that it is age-appropriate and contains no negative comments about the father and to help him to respond.  I understand that ELSA support can be put in place in addition.  W is younger and due to commence nursery.  So it may be that a family member other than the father can support him if the nursery cannot but, in any event, Ms G&#8217;s view is that his story board could be shared later given his age.

The father&#8217;s concern was the mother may use those last few contacts to do something rash and harmful to either him, or the children, or all of them.  There is evidence that the mother loves the children and she tells the court that she had not intended to harm him and that, apart from during one contact session in September 2023, she has, during supervised contact, conducted herself appropriately.

I have reminded myself of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, which was introduced by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref>, and the provisions of Practice Direction 12Q.  Given the lack of acceptance of the court&#8217;s findings by the mother or any real insight, and what I have therefore already said about her remaining close to the start of her own journey, given that the abuse has been perpetrated by her since at least 2018 and there has been no let up, given my finding that these proceedings have been used to perpetuate the abuse of the father until this final hearing, given the volume of applications which the mother has made since 23 June 2023, and taking into account what Dr F says about the time needed for schema therapy to result in positive outcomes for the mother and the whole family, in my judgment, the imposition of an order for a further period of three years is a proportionate response to the level of harm which it is seeking to avoid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If the mother undertakes a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme and, more importantly on Dr F&#8217;s evidence, makes progress in terms of the schema therapy, the court will consider any earlier application for permission appropriately.  The purpose of the order is to try and filter applications made prematurely, abusively, or when the evidence of change is not present. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current non-molestation order was made by me on 5 July 2023.  I have reminded myself of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> and the relevant case law, including that perhaps most helpfully set out by Lieven J in a case called <span style="font-style:italic">DS v AC</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2023/46" uk:canonical="[2023] EWFC 46" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWFC 46</ref>.  On the first limb of the test, the abuse that I found provides evidence of molestation.  On the second, the fact that the abuse has continued until now satisfies me that the intervention of the court is required in order to control the behaviour complained of.  I will vary paragraph 5 of the current order to make it clear that there should be no contact from the mother, whether directly or indirectly with the father, except through solicitors or professional mediators.  Subparagraphs (a) and (b) will be deleted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order will not prevent the mother from having indirect contact with the children, but she needs to be aware that messages directed at the father in any communication sent to the children may constitute a breach of the order and therefore a criminal offence.  The seriousness of the abuse and the length of time over which it has been perpetrated, and the time it is likely to take for the mother to undertake the work required of her, informs the duration of the order which, in my judgment, should also remain in place for another three years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, the court will not stand in the way of information flowing to the mother from the school or nursery about the children&#8217;s educational progress.  I suggest, though, that the father makes the arrangements for that and that it is one-way communication in that the mother needs to continue to be very careful about communications by her to the school or nursery who would be duty-bound to communicate certain information to the father and the likelihood of that therefore constituting indirect communication to him, although I will hear submissions about that particular point.</p>
