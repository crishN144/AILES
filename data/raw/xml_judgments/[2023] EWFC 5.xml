The case presented very serious allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour by the father (F), in the context of two relationships. The first of the relationships analysed in that judgment concerned the mother (M) of the two children with whom I am concerned at this hearing. They are Y, now aged 8, and S, now aged 5. The litigation history, as I recorded in the earlier judgment, had been extraordinarily protracted. The final fact-finding hearing, which I concluded in January 2021, had been adjourned 6 times. The originating application was made by F in October 2017. In August 2021, there had been a successful appeal from a case management decision by a Circuit Judge, and the case was then allocated to me. Peter Jackson LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, referred to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;extremely difficult procedural history&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

It should be noted that he has never met S (the youngest child). There was also an application for a Specific Issue Order, seeking a change of surname for S. The latter application, in particular, and in the context of my findings, reveals, at best, an arrogant lack of empathy for the effect that the protracted proceedings had already had on M and the elder child, Y. More than that, however, it reveals how F has used the Court proceedings as a different facet of controlling behaviour. </span></p>

It would appear to require to be stated that disclosure of the judgment to the police does not require a Court order. Unless the court specifically prevents it, the police and CPS are entitled to a copy of a judgment pursuant to Family Procedure Rules r.12.73. The information within that judgment must only be used for the purposes of child protection and/or investigation of crime. M&#8217;s legal team also sought disclosure of the court order to F&#8217;s immigration lawyers. </span></p>

The Secretary of State intervened. Russell J concluded that Parliament had determined that &#8220;birth&#8221; mothers and &#8220;married&#8221; parents should be afforded an irrevocable legal status and that there were legitimate reasons underpinning the legislative distinction, which also resonated in other areas of Family law.

Accordingly, she determined that the statutory scheme was not incompatible with the Convention. Importantly, in her detailed factual analysis of the case, Russell J concluded that the inability of the applicant to secure a revocation of the respondent&#8217;s parental responsibility had not amounted to a failure on the part of the State in its positive obligation or duty to do what was reasonable in all the circumstances, to protect her and the children from a real and immediate risk of harm: </span></p>

The residual trauma is undoubtedly severe enough to require treatment, but its primary cause was the behaviour of the FZ in the present case and not as a result of her inability to make an application to revoke parental responsibility as opposed to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> orders granted which have virtually extinguished FZ's ability to exercise that parental responsibility.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As Russell J observed in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">MZ v FZ</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (supra), society and families have changed very considerably since the introduction of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (in October 1991). Cohabitation outside marriage has become far more commonplace. Marriage is available to same-sex couples, civil partnerships have been created and extended to heterosexual couples, carrying with them, the same privileges, and responsibilities of marriage. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act 1990</ref> has now opened opportunities for biological parenthood to those for whom it would never otherwise been available. In this case, I found that F had raped M on more than one occasion. It is worth reflecting that even the concept of marital rape was not recognised until after the Children Act came into force. Each of these developments represents significant social change. Collectively, they reveal a very different social landscape to that facing the authors of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Prescient though the legislation has proved to be, I do not think it could have contemplated social change on the level we have seen. Against this backdrop, it is uncomfortable to realise, in 2022, that M may not make an application to divest F of his parental responsibility entirely due to the fact that she was married to him when the children were born. Moreover, by the time of the marriage, as I found in the judgment, M&#8217;s autonomy had already been significantly corroded in consequence of her treatment by F. Her parents believed and continue to believe that the marriage was driven by F&#8217;s desire to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom. However, whilst I find this anomaly of legal status to be profoundly uncomfortable, I do recognise that the contemplated protection for the applicant parent and children is to be found in the regime of Prohibited Steps Orders and Specific Issue Orders which the Children Act affords. Thus, whilst the legal status of a married father remains intact, it can be stripped of any potency to reach into the lives of the mother and children. His ability adversely to affect the welfare of either may be effectively prevented.  This was the approach endorsed by Sir Andrew McFarlane P in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Sheikh Mohammed v Princess Haya <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/3480" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 3480 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 3480 (Fam)</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

He played a full part, including giving evidence, in the fact-finding hearing. If he has decided that his evidence in that earlier hearing was untrue and wishes to qualify or change it there is nothing unfair in letting him choose to do so. We observe that even <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> provides no protection in the case of perjury. The Strasbourg Court generally looks at the totality of proceedings before determining whether they have been fair for the purposes of article 6. It does not exclude the possibility that a single step may render them unfair. Yet it is inconceivable that the refusal of a pre-emptive blanket order of this sort could amount to a violation of article 6. We are satisfied that the approach to disclosure from the family proceedings found in Re EC (Disclosure of Material) (see para. 17 above) provides appropriate protections and ensures that the family law proceedings would, in this respect, be fair.&#8221;</span></p>

As is abundantly clear, it has been heavily litigated. The challenges and obstacles to the smooth and timely resolution of the case, as discussed in the judgment from the fact-finding hearing, have been almost entirely of F&#8217;s making. At risk of repetition, it requires to be emphasised, that F found the opportunity to extend his controlling behaviour into the Court arena. The Children Act embodied, for the very first time, in English statute, the obligation to avoid delay in litigation relating to a child. Underpinning that is a recognition that delay is invariably inimical to the welfare of children. Here, it has been actively harmful. The protective provisions agreed by the parties and set out above related to the findings that I had made but they did not recognise the opportunities that the litigation has created for F to exert control over M and the children&#8217;s lives. With this omission in mind and with the full co-operation of the parties, I decided to hear evidence from the Cafcass Officer and from M and F. </span></p>

Neither is it a bar on access to justice. Where a Court identifies an issue that requires to be resolved, the case will proceed but where it does not, the child and the primary carer are protected from the stress and uncertainty of a misconceived or vexatious application.

The section provides a powerful tool with which Judges can protect both children and the parent with whom they live, from corrosive, demoralising and controlling applications which have an insidious impact on their general welfare and wellbeing and can cause real emotional harm. This amended provision strikes me as properly recognising the very significant toll protracted litigation can take on children and individuals who may already have become vulnerable, for a variety of reasons. It also dovetails with our enhanced understanding of the nature of controlling and coercive behaviour. When all other avenues are lost, too often the Court process becomes the only weapon available. Lawyers and Judges must be assiduous to identify when this occurs, in order to ensure that the Court is not manipulated into becoming a source of harm but a guarantee of protection. </span></p>

My husband and I are extremely concerned of how the Applicant will continue to deceive professionals to further himself in obtaining contact with [Y] and [S]. Currently, as [Y] and [S] are so young, they are without a voice. This worries me further as the Applicant seems to damage and ruin everything he touches, which can be seen in the psychological and emotional trauma he has caused to the [Z] children, who are much older than his own. It has always crossed my mind whether the Applicant requires professional psychological help to assist him in his urges to manipulate, control and abuse women and children. All we can hope for is that these proceedings will acknowledge the damage the Applicant has inflicted upon us and bring some justice to enable our family to heal, grow and progress.&#8221;</span></p>

This begs an inevitable question. If that were so, why would she recommend indirect contact? It struck me that the Cafcass Officer had reverted to general principles, without weaving them into the particular circumstances of this deeply troubling case. It is a professional and, indeed, a human instinct to preserve some thread, however vestigial, that leaves open options for a child who does not have contact with a parent. Generally, this is considered to be an opportunity for a child to obtain some understanding of their cultural and genetic inheritance. As a principle, it is obviously both sound and important but it must not be seen as automatic. The need for it and the potential damage that might be caused by it, need properly to be evaluated. Nor, in my judgement, should the importance and reach of indirect contact be underestimated. </span></p>

She recalled some facts to which she attributed significance, correctly in my view. F called himself 'Jordan', that was not his name, as emerged a few weeks later. He said that he was 40 years of age, he was 26. He stated that he had a Master&#8217;s degree, that his family lived in Windsor and that he had been educated at Eton College. He claimed to drive a white Mercedes sports car and to live in a flat near London Bridge, where he was looked after by a housekeeper. I am not sure whether Mrs G had met many old Etonians, but she had perhaps seen sufficient of them in the media to cause her strongly to suspect that F was not one of their number. All this background was fantasy.&#8221;</span></p>

He is, as I concluded above, a fantasist. Already MGM spots something of this fantasy life creeping into the limited indirect contact he has taken up. I consider her judgment to be correct and I entirely share her concerns. I note that F signs his cards off by stating </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I love you a lot and I miss you&#8230;&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This is, on the face of it, innocuous but in the context of the background of the case, it is manifestly unsettling and confusing for the children. I emphasise again, that F has never seen the youngest child. Throughout these proceedings, F has not revealed the slightest insight into his own behaviour nor have I seen him exhibit even a scintilla of empathy for those whose lives he has grievously damaged. In cross-examination by Mr Stott, F was arrogant and even, at times, belittling of Counsel&#8217;s questions. </span></p>

They are not strikingly &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; in any offensive way, but they are cards intended for an adult. One of them shows an old couple walking along a road together, but there is something dark and slightly frightening in the image.  It is intentional on the part of the artist. It is far from the type of card that one would send to children of this age. F told me that he bought the card because he had been talking to a woman at the Tate who had created the images on the card and was selling her own work. He told me that he engaged in conversation with her and that she was an artist from the South-West. He wanted to encourage her work. This may be a laudable sentiment, but it failed entirely to recognise that this was a card for his children and not an opportunity for philanthropy. I found the absence of empathy, warmth or sentiment towards the children to be striking. I agree with M that the casual inappropriateness of the card is, itself, illustrative of F&#8217;s attitudes and behaviour. MGM puts it simply: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;It is hard to believe that the Applicant is able to love anyone else but himself&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

By contrast, it is easy to see how it might be unsettling and potentially harmful to the security of both the mother and children. After reflection in the witness box, the Cafcass Officer decided that this was a case where indirect contact was not appropriate. Though M, through her previous counsel, had been prepared to agree to an order for indirect contact, it was plain that she was doing so in an attempt to avoid conflict. It is equally plain that she could see only trouble coming from it. Additionally, she is very respectful to authority and I think, had been prepared to accept that if the Cafcass Officer had recommended indirect contact, it must have been in the interests of her children. That she was prepared to take advice that ran counter to her own instinct, reflects her determination to do what is right for her children at every turn but, it is also a signal that she has not yet fully achieved the capacity to assert her own autonomy. In my view, she should follow her parental instincts. Despite all that has happened to her, she is proving to be a very good mother. Her children are both doing extremely well. I asked M if she had their school reports. She told me that she had and brought them in the next day. They were in a folder in chronological order. This was not prepared for the Court; it was how she kept them and it reflected her obvious pride in them. The reports also told their own story, particularly, in relation to Y. The growth of Y&#8217;s confidence can be tracked with each passing term. She is now doing very well academically. However, she knows when her mother and grandmother have had to attend Court and this causes her anxiety. It would have been impossible to conceal this from her given that the litigation has endured for 5 years and required many court attendances. </span></p>

For reasons which are clear from the above paragraphs, the case requires a judgment to be given. Moreover, there are occasions where it is necessary to recognise a disagreeable truth. There is, sometimes, though very rarely, a parent who has nothing to offer a child and whom the child is better off without. This is such a case. When children are received into the care system and subsequently adopted, indirect contact is invariably ordered, though on a very limited basis. This recognises that though parents will not have been able to provide a satisfactory standard of care for their children, the children continue to be loved and their parents have an important contribution to make to their evolving understanding of their lives. The decision not to order any indirect contact has to be seen in this light, truly to understand how uncommon the order is and why. My comments in respect of this father are not ones that any Judge makes lightly. Judges do well to avoid emotive terms, but equally, where a clear finding requires to be made, it cannot be concealed in abstruse and cryptic language, which might only serve to soften or occlude the message. My conclusion accords exactly with that of M and her family. In the light of all they have experienced, it seems to me that they are entitled to know and in unambiguous terms, that their assessment of this father is, in my judgement, entirely accurate. </span></p>
