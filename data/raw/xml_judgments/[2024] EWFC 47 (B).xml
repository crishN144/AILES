	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I make it clear from the outset that I recognise how much the mother loves her daughter, A, and I accept that she has done everything she can within the context of her difficulties and limitations to demonstrate that she should be able to care for her. Sadly, the overwhelming and unanimous professional evidence persuades me that even with 32 hours of support through Adult Social Care, additional support through Children&#8217;s Social Care and psychological support through therapy, (none of which is actually in place) that the combination of the mother&#8217;s long term chronic ill health, compounded by her neurodiverse cognitive profile and unresolved trauma means that she is unable to provide the level of care that A now requires on a full time or even on a shared care basis. Much of this is not the mother&#8217;s fault but is reflective as to the realities of her functioning and the level of her own needs. I accept that she has done her very best, but having regards to A&#8217;s welfare and her needs being paramount, I am going to make a final Care Order for A to stay in foster care with FC. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am concerned with the welfare of A , born on 11 January 2018, who is now just six years old and is placed in foster care under an interim Care Order with FC, who was helping the mother care for her in 2020. A is represented through her children&#8217;s Guardian, Miss Motivaras, who instructs counsel, Mrs  Thomas. Her mother shall be referred to as R, who was born on 22 August 1980 and is now 43 years of age. She is represented by counsel, Miss Dobson, and has been supported by an intermediary, Mr Psuick.</p>

His preferred option was that A was placed in the care of her mother and if this was not possible, for her to remain in the care of FC, with whom he accepted A has an established relationship. A&#8217;s current social worker is Alana Clarke, but previously it was Jessica Noakes and then Georgia Burton. The Local Authority is represented by counsel, Mrs Bacon. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Leicestershire County Council made an application for a Care Order to include an interim Care Order on 4 March 2022. An interim Care Order was made on 23 March 2022, which remains in force. A is and has been in the primary care of FC, who is approved as her long-term foster carer. FC does not seek a Special Guardianship Order at this juncture and prefers for the Local Authority to be responsible for the ongoing contact arrangements between A and her mother and I will return to that point below. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The proceedings have far exceeded the 26 week statutory timetable. It was anticipated, given the unusual characteristics of this case, that there may be some delay and had the court timetable for directed statements and assessments been adhered to, it is fair to say that it should not have taken this long. The case has now been in play for 98 weeks. This level of delay can only be prejudicial to the welfare of A and I have been very keen, in this hearing, to keep matters on track, while allowing for the mother&#8217;s difficulties and reasonable adjustments, the need to take regular breaks and including letting her leave early before the end of a court day, with the intermediary, providing her with a simplified summary of her counsel&#8217;s cross-examination of the social worker.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">A further complicating feature in the delay has been that an application was made by the Local Authority in May 2023 for a section 34(4) order for permission to refuse contact between A and R. This followed an allegation by A to her teacher, which she repeated to her foster carer and social worker that her mother had, inappropriately, touched her below area when applying cream. An order was made by me on 6 June 2023 and an urgent order was made against the police for them to file a statement in relation to the mother&#8217;s bail conditions. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The police have now completed their investigations and on 27 December 2023, notified R that they are not taking any further action and the bail conditions have been lifted. Not having had contact with her mother therefore for seven months, A resumed video contact on 5 January 2024 and on 12 January 2024 had an introductory direct contact, which went very well. Albeit there was some hesitancy by A that her mother should not take her to the toilet, and she did not want cuddles. A also spends weekly family time with her maternal grandfather, MGF and his partner. This happens unsupervised on Sundays, which the mother does not agree with, and it is fair to say her relationship with her father remains strained. </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">As I say, the Local Authority seeks a Care Order. The care plan is for A to remain in the care of FC in long term foster care. The Local Authority supports ongoing direct contact between A and her mother, to be supervised at a minimum level of once per month, but also to include fortnightly contact through video and then letters and cards in between and for A to reciprocate, if she wishes. Contact arrangements will be kept under review under the Looked After Children process and by Di Yates, who is the Independent reviewing Officer. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Local Authority asserts that it is committed to funding play therapy for A, as recommended by Dr Martinez and signposting the therapy that the mother needs if she wishes to engage. Further, offering some level of mediation between the mother and FC, given that their relationship is fractious and supporting, at some point, the systemic therapy sessions to improve A&#8217;s relationship with her mother. The Guardian supports the Local Authority&#8217;s plans and had considered whether a Special Guardianship Order should be made to FC , but does not consider this to be appropriate at this time. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The mother does not accept the threshold is met and seeks, in the first instance, the return of A to her full-time care. She seeks to set out alternative arrangements, or she sought to, in her most recent statement dated 11 January 2024, which sets out the secondary position of shared care. In essence, the mother&#8217;s position has always been that she has been asking for the correct support from before A&#8217;s birth and that the discrepancies between Children&#8217;s Social Care and Adult Social Care have meant that the services that have been provided have not always been what she needed to ensure that she was able to meet A&#8217;s needs. She accepts the need for support but is critical of what has been offered. She does not really think that the Local Authority should have issued these proceedings. </p>

She was subject to pre proceedings for three months with, the Local Authority says, minimal progress. There has been a concerning social care history for A, who has had Children&#8217;s Social Care involvement from prior to her birth. There was a brief period between September and December 2018 where there was no involvement, but then concerns were raised by the health visitor, as A was said not to be meeting her developmental milestones in her mother&#8217;s care. </p>

R suffers with Myalgic Encephatis (ME) and later that has been diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome, which affects her day-to-day functioning and was, as I say, originally diagnosed as ME. This is a long-term fluctuating neurological illness. </p>

She also has symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivtiy Disorder (ADHD), which Joan Crawford confirmed and has been investigated for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, known as POTS. Dr Martinez assessed that she shows traits of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which, to be fair, R readily accepts and that this is highly likely and makes sense. What she does not accept is that this means that there is an unreasonable level of rigidity on her part, and she does not accept that this means she has a lack of insight into A&#8217;s emotional needs. </p>

These concerns about her ability to meet A&#8217;s needs heightened during the Covid 2019 pandemic, following the closure of childcare provisions, which left A in the sole care of her mother. At the start of the pandemic, when all childcare provisions ceased, the Local Authority supported Mother to arrange for A to receive wrap around care for most of the day, enabling her to preserve her energy to care for A during unsupported times.</p>

The Local Authority was only able to secure an assessment from the Yorkshire Fatigue Clinic which, in fact, was somewhat helpful. </p>

It was suggested that that assessment could be undertaken within eight weeks. I have to say I am, with the benefit of hindsight, able to see that Dr Crawford&#8217;s assessment was always going to be somewhat limited in Dr Crawford&#8217;s inability to assess A and her needs, which are fundamental to the question of whether the mother, with all her difficulties and even with the right package of support, can meet A&#8217;s needs. </p>

Baker LJ agreed with counsel for the Appellants that the judge in the lower court had failed to subject the evidence to a degree of vigorous scrutiny required in these circumstances. For example, Baker LJ noted that the lower court judge had recognised:</p>

What this authority does highlight is the need for the court to have carefully scrutinised the Local Authority&#8217;s assessments, the plans and any packages of support on the ground based on the analysis of risk. It highlights that one of the domains in the Care Act is inability to carry out any caring responsibilities that the adult has for a child. Local Authority Adult services organisations cannot simply say here that Children&#8217;s Services do that, because the statutory functions are wholly different and owed to different people. A disabled Adult with responsibility for children is entitled to have a &#8216;needs led&#8217; package of care which can be turned into a budget. </p>

The package of care needs to be related to assisting the person to care for a child and not just to pay for childcare. Both parents owe parental responsibilities and so any non-disabled parent can rightly be expected to care, unless there is good reason to the contrary. </p>

In her opinion, R meets the criteria for provision of formal support under the Care Act provisions of 2014 and this generates an assessment for a personal budget. This can be utilised either as a direct payment, through council managed services, domiciliary services or a combination of both. </p>

She has therefore always elected to have a personal budget to employ her own personal assistants through domiciliary care agencies or privately or through APA support care agency. However, they have workers who are only registered to provide care for adults over the age of 18 and cannot be employed to provide care to a child. This is the same for the other agencies like Ican and Aspirations. At one point, it is clear that ASC contacted over 11 different types of agencies to identify a package of support that could be provided through a combination of personal assistants (Pas) and then gaps plugged by Children&#8217;s Social Care. </p>

In her statement, Miss McWilliams, considered the recommendations of Dr Joan Crawford, the mother&#8217;s preferred expert, and accepted that a consistent team of carers supporting the mother would be of great benefit to her ability to care for A. The issue was getting those individuals employed, in place and then to remain in place. ASC assisted the mother in drafting an advert, contacted, as I said, over 11 domiciliary service agencies and PA agencies. The team approached live in carer agencies that might be able to live in to support Mother and A and that would have to be jointly funded between  ASC and Children&#8217;s Social Care. </p>

I further note that in June 2022, OP Care approved a powered wheelchair for Mother, with a six to eight week wait on delivery. The delay was in agreeing the funding, which under the Disabilities Grant Scheme had to be approved for a ramp to be fitted in the mother&#8217;s home, which was a three month to twelve month wait.

However, the reality is that the support has been offered, but [R] has not been able to consistently engage with this, therefore meaning that it has ended and it&#8217;s not been replaced.

What I found she lacks in insight is an understanding of A&#8217;s emotional needs and that her rigid thinking about the way in which she wants care being provided is simply not consistent with what, in reality, is on offer on the ground.

She really only sees things from her own perspective, which includes also how she sees her father, who she describes as a narcissist. She was unable to see that his relationship with A might be very different to the relationship he had with her and I could not quite square the inconsistency of when it suited her, MGF was used to provide care to A one day a fortnight in 2021. </p>

I find this based on the evidence of Sarah Seekins, who acknowledged that A may still have been asking her mother for boob, but in the context of telling everyone else that she did not want to do this anymore and hiding, the mother should have reasonably taken on board that advice and stopped.</p>

This is despite the fact that, in my judgment, ASC has taken a person-centred approach with R and has tried extensively to promote her preferred method of support which has been increasingly difficult for ASC to meet her outcomes using PA&#8217;s.</p>

I also find that in any event, Dr Crawford&#8217;s assessment, which is entirely beneficial for the mother, was indeed purely an adult led assessment, and that she sadly did not have the skill set to a) either help the Local Authority as to how it should work with R, but also b) make an assessment of how such a package of support would meet A&#8217;s needs and ensure her safety. In my judgment, this assessment was always going to have its limitations and cannot be relied on by the Court to the extent that the mother would wish for me to do so. </p>

What this means that if something else is going on in her life, this mother finds it very difficult to even consistently liaise with those services that are there to help her, and the evidence base for that is also in R&#8217;s answers in saying that she has never actually formally made any complaints to Adult Social Care.</p>

The fact that A openly repeats this information and talks about her mother doing &#8216;bad things&#8217; is equally something that just simply cannot be ignored. Reducing the time that A spends with FC, as her primary secure attachment figure, is likely, in my judgment, to have a negative impact on A, unless the time is used for safe contact with the mother and A is given permission to feel that it is OK that she is living with FC.

It ignores that there is a fractious relationship between FC and the mother, where the mother still asserts that FC has negatively influenced what A has purported to allege. Equally, the impact of not being returned to live with her mother on her is something that will have, I find, a limited emotional impact on her, because she has become accustomed to living with FC and with her life including school, being based around the stability of that placement. </p>

Certainly, for a child like A, if in fact there is, in due course, any identified special need for her, and given that Mother&#8217;s belief is that her father is autistic, having an annual medical is likely to be in her welfare interests. Furthermore, in due course, if relations between the mother and FC improve, it may be that a Special Guardianship Order is something that can be considered in the future which will, of course, then ameliorate the risks that carry from being a looked after child.</p>

If I make a Care Order, then the prospect of a shared care arrangement is difficult legally, because the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan is one of placement in foster care with an approved long-term carer. The Local Authority is highly unlikely, as I have said, to agree placement with parent regulations, given the Local Authority&#8217;s ongoing concerns as to the risks to A of emotional harm and unintentional neglect, if she were to spend unsupervised and overnight time with her mother.</p>

Sometimes that has been successful and there has been one for a period, but that has not been able to be consistently achieved and the offer of support from ASC, even for this hearing in the form of a care worker to be present every day, was refused by R, because she did not consider this to be the right support. </p>

I do not expect her to agree with my decision, but I have not found, on the evidence before me, that there are a series of failings on behalf of the Local Authority.

This is a rather sad conclusion to reach because I have no doubt that R has a lot to give to A and I would hope that in time she could access the therapy recommended which would, at least, help her to understand and improve her ability to maintain relationships and relate with a deeper insight into A&#8217;s long term emotional needs. </p>

Because whilst she wants to see and be with her mother, she is still openly sharing what she believes her lived experiences have been.
