The following day (10 July 2009) the mother invited me to give directions for submissions in relation to costs and indicated that her stance in relation to seeking permission to appeal in respect of the disclosure issue might be affected by the father&#8217;s response to my judgment (not yet given) in relation to the section 8 issues. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pelling responded on 20 July 2009, indicating, in relation to the judgment on the section 8 issues, that the father would be seeking an order that there be &#8216;no order for costs&#8217; and that he would be seeking to appeal &#8220;at least some parts&#8221; of my decision, adding that they needed time to consider this and take further advice. He drew my attention to the procedural difficulties arising out of CPR 52.3(2) and 52.4(2) and referred me to the notes in the 2007 Green Book to CPR 52.4. He continued:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;So I would respectfully ask that you fix a very short hearing on or around 31 July 2009 early AM to hand down both Judgments in final approved form in open court, including your decision on costs in both cases. Both Orders could be finalised and dated for the same date. I would wish to attend on behalf of [the father] to ask for Leave to Appeal and to collect printed copies of the Judgments; [the father] would not object to others not attending, or requesting Leave to Appeal in writing (if copied to [him] and myself), but on the basis that any request for Leave to Appeal would be adjudicated upon at the hearing. [The mother] can similarly make any request in writing about the continuation of [the father&#8217;s] Undertaking, to be adjudicated at the hearing. So nobody need incur costs of attendance if they did not wish to. An advantage of proceeding in this way is that all parties would then have 21 days from 31 July (or around then) to go to the Court of Appeal on any matter they wished to appeal. This would give adequate time to all parties and their advocates in what after all is now the summer holidays and it isn&#8217;t only [the father] and [the mother] who have children to look after.&#8221;</p>

This is because it is a wasteful exercise in time and costs, there being no expectation that Leave will be granted on any issue and because experience shows that if you set out your detailed reasons for asking Leave &#8211; effectively disclosing your intended grounds of appeal &#8211; then judges use that as an opportunity in Form N460 to embellish and add to their Judgments and to influence the Court of Appeal against the appellant. It is for the Court of Appeal to determine appeals and applications thereto for Leave to Appeal and in my submission the introduction of Form N460 was wrong because it allows the Judge under appeal to be effectively heard in the Court of Appeal via his response to a leave application in the lower court. In practice some judges use this opportunity to try and scupper the appeal if they have knowledge of the appellant&#8217;s intended grounds to be put before the Court of Appeal. [The father] will therefore reserve his grounds of appeal and reasons for asking Leave to Appeal to the Court of Appeal. </p>

She points out that it was at the direction of the court that the guardian&#8217;s counsel filed submissions first, on the basis that it would assist the court and the mother, as the mother was not legally represented. Had the mother been legally represented the guardian would have been in the position of supporting the mother&#8217;s case, and the submissions of counsel on the guardian&#8217;s behalf would consequently have been shorter and less time consuming for the father to reply to.</p>

In justification of this figure, she says that as the father was clearly attempting to re-open the case, effectively challenging the validity of the consent order, all the earlier documentation pre the consent order had to be revisited. The amount of time she spent, she says, can only be assessed, as she did not keep time sheets, but she asserts that 14 hours a week on average would be &#8220;very conservative&#8221;, so given the time which has elapsed since the father first began to have second thoughts, the total number of hours spent would be in excess of 650.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pelling&#8217;s response to Ms Farror&#8217;s submissions is to point out, correctly, that in relation to the disclosure issue the child&#8217;s welfare is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the paramount consideration. On the contrary, he says, it was hardly likely to be affected. So, he submits, there is no reason why costs should not in fact follow the event. His response to Ms Farror&#8217;s three points as I have summarised them above can be summarised as follows:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, he submits that it was patently obvious (as, he says, the judgment makes clear) that the welfare of the child was never going to be affected and the &#8216;reaction of the mother&#8217; argument was not supported by any medical evidence. It was in truth, he says, &#8220;a pathetic argument.&#8221; Moreover, he submits, the novelty of the point is not something that has ever been accepted as a valid reason not to pay the successful party&#8217;s costs. &#8220;Those who want to fight to make a point of law must still be prepared to pay the costs if they lose.&#8221;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, he disputes that the amount claimed is excessive. One has, as he points out, to distinguish, as Parliament has done, between work done by the litigant in person himself (where the pecuniary loss factor, the &#8532;rds rule and the &#163;9.25 per hour rate all apply as appropriate) and disbursements and payments reasonably made for legal services relating to the conduct of the proceedings (where the full cost is claimable). Dr Pelling accepts that he has no formal legal qualifications but says so what? He submits that, unless the court is to indulge in discriminatory practices without any rational foundation, why should not the principle of equal pay for equal work apply? One should rather, he says, examine the merit of the work done, not the paper qualifications. He accepts of course that an advocate&#8217;s expertise and experience is reasonably taken to be reflected in the merit of his work (QCs are paid more than juniors), which is why, as he puts it, his rate is somewhat lower than Ms Farror&#8217;s. Likewise he accepts that it is of course open to the court to tax his bill down if the rate is considered too high, but says it should be on proper grounds.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pelling&#8217;s response to the mother&#8217;s application, although lengthy, can I think fairly be boiled down to the following essential propositions:</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, and fundamentally, he disputes that the father has been guilty of the kind of unreasonable conduct in the course of the litigation which alone is relied upon as justifying an order for costs against him. In support of this contention Dr Pelling analyses in turn each of the father&#8217;s applications with a view to demonstrating that each of them was in fact reasonable and that the mother&#8217;s characterisation of the father&#8217;s litigation conduct is unwarranted. He emphasises that the father was not acting mischievously or selfishly, being motivated only, he says, by his genuine concerns for his son&#8217;s welfare. And he stresses what he says were, from the father&#8217;s perspective, two key provisions in the consent order: one was the review to take place in the following year; the other, without which, he says, the father would never have consented to it, was the curb on the mother moving to live by herself with N away from her own parents. He submits that it can hardly be said to be unreasonable for the father to object to that key safeguard being removed without a proper investigation.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, he makes the point that in any event it cannot be said that the father was acting unreasonably in relation to either (a) the matters which in the event were dealt with by consent or (b) the matters where I made no order (rather than an order dismissing the application) or (c) the matters where the father&#8217;s application, even though in the event unsuccessful, was responsive to the mother&#8217;s inappropriate actions or (d) the matters which arose out of a shared experience of difficulties in making the consent order work or (e) the matters where the guardian herself recognised that some adjustments to the consent order might be appropriate. So the mother&#8217;s broad brush approach cannot, he says, be justified. Each of the various applications must be examined carefully in order to determine which were, and which were not, unreasonable.</p>

That should reflect in any costs order. Of course, [the father&#8217;s] position is that neither were unreasonable.&#8221;</p>

The guardian herself has wisely and reasonably taken that approach and decided not to seek costs. If however the court disagrees, then unless it were to take the extreme view that every single application of [the father] (and consistently of [the mother]) constituted unreasonable conduct of litigation of such gravity as to resound in costs, the court would &#8230; have to embark on an analysis of which ones were so unreasonable and which were not, and [the mother] would have to provide some evidence or reasonable calculation of time spent on the unreasonable ones and not just pluck vague guesstimates out of the air. In costs the brush may be broad, but there are some brushes which are just too broad. Further, bearing in mind that Mr Holden has told me he is not charging [the mother] fees, but has clearly had a very major input in the conduct of [her] case and advocacy &#8230; it would be necessary for [the mother] to convince the court that time she claims for was really her own and not Mr Holden&#8217;s. </p>

And it is a fact that, even if only responsively to the father&#8217;s many applications, the mother did make and pursue &#8211; unsuccessfully &#8211; some applications of her own.

For that which is lawful if expressed in the temperate or scholarly language of a legal periodical or the broadsheet press does not become unlawful simply because expressed in the more robust, colourful or intemperate language of the tabloid press or even in language which is crude, insulting and vulgar. Judges, after all, are expected to be, and I have no doubt are, men and women of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate, and the vehemence of the language used cannot of itself measure the power to punish for contempt. On the contrary, so long as it does not undermine what in Art 10(2) is referred to as &#8216;the authority and impartiality of the judiciary&#8217;, such criticism is healthy. There is, I think, much to be said for the view that the judges must be kept mindful of their limitations and of their ultimate public responsibility by a vigorous stream of criticism expressed with candour however blunt. Moreover, a much more robust view must, in my judgment, be taken today than previously of what ought rightly to be allowed to pass as permissible criticism. Society is more tolerant today of strong or even offensive language. Society has in large part lost its previous habit of deferential respect. Much of what might well, even in the comparatively recent past, have been considered by the judges to be scurrilous abuse of themselves or their brethren has today, as it seems to me, to be recognised as amounting to no more than acceptable if trenchant criticism.&#8221;</p>

Judges at first instance who are asked to give leave to appeal routinely ask for, and are routinely given, at least in outline, the reasons why it is being said that leave ought to be granted. My direction was carefully drafted and quite limited in what it required: &#8220;a brief skeleton or written submissions (no more than 4 sides of A4) identifying precisely the issues on which and summarising briefly the grounds on which permission is being sought.&#8221; I vigorously dissent from Dr Pelling&#8217;s proposition that my power is limited, as he would have it, to requiring him to identify the parts of the order against which he is asking for leave to appeal. The proposition that &#8220;beyond that the Judge cannot go&#8221; is not merely absurd; it is disproved by the daily practice of the courts.</p>

How is the judge in such a situation to complete that part of Form N460 which requires him to set out the &#8220;reasons&#8221; for his decision, as the case may be, either to give or to refuse leave to appeal? Dr Pelling&#8217;s riposte, as we have seen, is simply to assert that &#8220;the introduction of Form N460 was wrong.&#8221; He may choose to ignore it. I may not.

The mother points out that if one can complain about anyone concerned with the proceedings, one can therefore complain about the other party &#8211; so, purely as a vindictive exercise, one party could complain about the other party and send very private documents, for example, to the child&#8217;s school or to an employer. Moreover, she asks rhetorically, &#8216;How many complaints can a party make?&#8217; Is a disgruntled litigant to be able to complain, as she says the father has done here, about two Cafcass officers, a solicitor, a barrister, a social worker and a psychiatrist, and deploy all the documents in the case in support of each complaint? </p>

In any event, in a case such as this it is, I think, for the Court of Appeal rather than the judge at first instance to decide that leave to appeal should be given on this ground.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the father&#8217;s application for leave to appeal, Dr Pelling seeks a further extension of time from 26 August 2009 until 4 September 2009. The mother indicated at the hearing on 5 August 2009 that she does not oppose this application. I will accordingly extend the father&#8217;s time for appealing until 4 September 2009 and extend the mother&#8217;s time for appealing likewise.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father does not need any stay of my order in relation to the section 8 issues pending appeal. The mother, on the other hand, does require a stay of that part of the order in relation to the disclosure issue which releases the father from his undertaking, for otherwise her appeal might be rendered nugatory. I propose to stay the relevant part of the order, initially until 4 September 2009 and then (if, but only if, she has by then filed an appellant&#8217;s notice) to extend the stay for a further week to give the Court of Appeal an opportunity to decide whether the stay should be extended any further.</p>
