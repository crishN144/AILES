	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">I am concerned here with T, a male child born in the Spring of 2019. The mother (M) is represented by Counsel and solicitor. The father (F) has elected at this final hearing, as he has done throughout the proceedings, to act as a litigant in person. This decision is driven by his fundamental belief that neither the Court nor the State, through the arm of the Local Authority, has any jurisdiction to take decisions in relation to his children. He invests great belief in the scope and ambit of The Cestui Cue Vie Act 1666. I have addressed this in an earlier judgment <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/1572" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 1572 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 1572 (Fam)</ref>. However, when F came into the witness box to give evidence, he requested that he take his oath based on an embossed document, which he had prepared, emphasising his &#8220;decree of divine sovereignty&#8221;. I permitted him to do so, for entirely pragmatic reasons. He has requested that I determine as a preliminary issue whether he, as a &#8220;Sovereign being&#8221; can be required to answer questions in these proceedings and, if not, he seeks an immediate order for the return of all his children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Whilst I recognise that F&#8217;s beliefs are strongly held and, I believe, genuinely so, I have little hesitation in concluding that he is required to engage as fully as possible in these proceedings, brought by this Local Authority to protect T from what they contend is &#8216;significant harm&#8217;, as contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31 (2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>&#8217;). Parliament has enacted the legal framework by which vulnerable children are protected and provided scope for parental rights and responsibilities to be evaluated in the application of the criteria within Sec 1 (2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, &#8216;the welfare check list&#8217;. In that process it is in the parent&#8217;s interest to give evidence and to advance their case. Inferences may be drawn from any failure to do so. It requires to be stated that this is also and manifestly in the best interests of the child subject to the proceedings. The embossed oath, which I have redacted in order to protect the privacy of T, reads as follows: </p>

Both parents believe F to have been wrongly traduced and that the finding of rape, in particular, represented a miscarriage of justice. Parallel proceedings emanating from the same facts resulted in F&#8217;s acquittal in the Criminal Courts. The parents sought to appeal the findings but they were unsuccessful. HHJ Atkinson&#8217;s findings were, as is now good practice, summarised in a concise document appended to her judgment. It is important that the gravity and extent of them is not lost and so I set them out: </p>

This was refused on the papers and F subsequently sought an oral permission hearing. It is, of course, a fundamental principle of judicial review that it is not an appropriate course of action where there is an alternative remedy available. Lieven J, who heard the application for permission, considered that an application to reopen the findings, in family proceedings, was a potential alternative remedy which had not been pursued. The application for judicial review was, accordingly, dismissed. F sought to appeal the order of Lieven J, permission being refused on the papers by way of an order dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019. </p>

In the course of this hearing both parents but particularly M, have recognised that their actions caused real distress and alarm to an experienced Circuit Judge.

F has pursued every conceivable route available to him to seek to overturn them. He spends many hours putting documents together to pursue his wide raft of applications. It has become a full- time occupation for him. I must also observe that he organises his paperwork with meticulous and almost obsessive care.  He prefers to use his own bundles and, during the course of his arguments, he is able to refer to the documentation quickly and with remarkable accuracy. He prepares careful and, it must be said, lengthy notes for cross examination of witnesses. He chooses to be a litigant in person, notwithstanding that legal aid is available to him, sufficient to permit the instruction of experienced counsel and solicitors. His preference for the regime of the Cestui Cue Vie has made it difficult for him to identify counsel who he feels can advance his case in the way he wishes. Before HHJ Atkinson, F had legal representation. He is very critical of his former lawyers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">The diligence of F&#8217;s legal research has extended to reading a significant number of judgments that I have given. These judgments have been read carefully and thoroughly. Occasionally, F has offered his own critique. During the course of the hearing, when M came into the witness box to give evidence, I was acutely conscious that she too had made an allegation of rape against F, from which she had subsequently resiled. Although the couple live together and very much wish to continue to do so, I nonetheless felt some disquiet about F cross examining M in person against this background. I approached this issue with M whilst she was in the witness box and before she began her evidence. She had anticipated my questions and reassured me that she was perfectly happy to be questioned by her partner. She told me that she understood and, I sensed, to some degree appreciated my concern. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;you gave a judgment about this&#8221;,</span> she volunteered. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I understand your concern but I am fine&#8221;. </span>M was referring to<span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-weight:bold">PS v BP <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/1987" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 1987 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 1987 (Fam)</ref></span>.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>Though<span style="font-weight:bold"/>I would have expected F to have made this kind of remark, I was slightly surprised by M&#8217;s knowledge.

F had not foreshadowed his application, nor had M&#8217;s legal team. It was not on notice to the Local Authority or to the Guardian. There was no supportive documentation presented in advance. It therefore took Mr Barnes, who appears on behalf of the Local Authority and Mr Littlewood, who appears on T&#8217;s behalf, entirely by surprise.  In any other sphere of law this application would not have been permitted to proceed. It would have been regarded as fundamentally unfair to the other parties and, given that it has been made, in various guises, on at least three previous occasions, would likely have been considered to be an abuse of process. </p>

Any adjournment, necessitating delay, would be entirely inimical to T&#8217;s welfare. He is now in foster care. T&#8217;s needs must direct the timescales and not the exigencies of the litigation. I have not the slightest doubt that F took a conscious decision, in effect, to ambush the Local Authority with a surprise application. It placed the Local Authority, in particular, at serious disadvantage. It is axiomatic that the Court was also placed in a difficult situation. F advanced his argument with, in my assessment, more than usual care and skill. He flitted dextrously through his bundle and sought to persuade me that there was significant information that had now come to light which rendered Judge Atkinson&#8217;s findings unsafe. He now presented his argument on the basis that he had wrongly criticised the judge and that he owed her an apology. The full evidence, he contended, had not been placed before her. F insinuated that this was likely to have been deliberate and that the judge had herself been duped. Whilst aspects of this argument displayed a paranoia about the integrity of various public bodies which has been fretted throughout his reasoning generally, it was nonetheless advanced with sufficient eloquence and force as to cause me, once again, to revisit the application. This is my obligation to T, not to the parents. His interests remain paramount throughout and even this late in the day against a backdrop of, what I find to be, conscious manipulation of procedure, I considered it necessary to address the argument in full. </p>

I gave Mr Barnes sufficient opportunity to garner his material and to respond. I indicated that I would reserve my judgment on the application to be given at the end of the case, along with the substantive applications. It was then possible to return to hearing the evidence. One of the consequences of this unforeshadowed application was that Ms Jo Duncombe, who had undertaken a risk assessment of F, attended two days at court without being heard. It was necessary, ultimately, to take her evidence by telephone link. Both F and each of the parties has now had the opportunity to address me in full and in writing on the further application to reopen HHJ Atkinson&#8217;s fact-finding.</p>

The appeal was made in the context of the Criminal Law and emanates from the Scottish Courts. F submits that these two features undermine its authority and relevance to his case.

The ratio of the case is entirely supportive of the approach F pursues in advancing his argument. I think F has assumed that because it was placed before me by Mr Barnes, it must therefore be inconsistent with his own case. On the contrary, it is an illustration of the independent Bar elucidating the application of the law from an entirely neutral perspective to preserve the integrity of the hearing.

The tests in each case are different, and they must be considered and applied separately. The first question is whether the material which has been withheld from the defence was material which ought to have been disclosed. The test here is whether the material might have materially weakened the Crown case or materially strengthened the case for the defence: HM Advocate v Murtagh, para 11. The Lord Advocate's failure to disclose material that satisfies this test is incompatible with the accused's article 6 Convention rights. In the case of police statements, the position is clear. Applying the materiality test, all police statements of any witnesses on the Crown list must be disclosed to the defence before the trial: McDonald v HM Advocate, para 51. </span></p>

The question at the stage of an appeal is whether, given that there was a failure to disclose and having regard to what actually happened at the trial, the trial was nevertheless fair and, as Lady Cosgrove said in Kelly v HM Advocate, para 35, as a consequence there was no miscarriage of justice: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/106/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995</ref>. The test that should be applied is whether, taking all the circumstances of the trial into account, there is a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict.&#8221; </span></p>

Where fresh evidence is adduced on a criminal appeal it is for the Court of Appeal, assuming always that it accepts it, to evaluate its importance in the context of the remainder of the evidence in the case. If the Court concludes that the fresh evidence raises no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused it will dismiss the appeal. The primary question is for the Court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had on the mind of the jury. That said, if the Court regards the case as a difficult one, it may find it helpful to test its view 'by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict' (Pendleton at p83, para 19 [R v Pendleton [<ref href="#" uk:canonical="2002 1 WLR 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">2002 1 WLR 72</ref>]). The guiding principle nevertheless remains that stated by Viscount Dilhorne in Stafford (at p906 [Stafford v Director of Public Prosecutions 1974 AC 878]) and affirmed by the House in Pendleton: 'While . . . the Court of Appeal and this House may find it a convenient approach to consider what a jury might have done if they had heard the fresh evidence, the ultimate responsibility rests with them and them alone for deciding the question [whether or not the verdict is unsafe].'" </span></p>

The above extracts demonstrate, it seems to me, both helpful and unhelpful practices. The real danger is that unsubstantiated opinion, perhaps predicated on nothing more than an unfavourable impression, might quickly become the prevailing orthodoxy, thus leading the investigation in, potentially, an entirely wrong direction. Additionally, these reports will invariably be disclosed within legal proceedings and thus have the potential for further and perhaps unhelpful consequences. When expressing opinions, police officers might do well to remember that these documents may have a wider audience. </p>

F is entirely correct to highlight the concern I expressed in the course of his submissions, regarding the arson. As I have said above, F&#8217;s application in relation to this material, arrived without notice and without written argument. However, as I have detailed, I provided Mr Barnes with an opportunity to address the issue and to evaluate the evidence. He responded by providing an unedited extract from the note of evidence before HHJ Atkinson and a copy of the written submissions presented by F&#8217;s counsel, Ms Julia Gasparro. F had told me that his counsel had not put his instructions, particularly concerning [X&#8217;s] credibility. I have to say that Ms Gasparro&#8217;s written closing submissions on F&#8217;s behalf reveal a very different picture. It is illustrative to note the following submissions <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;when considering [X&#8217;s] credibility, the learned judge must consider that [X] has willing lied and sought to mislead a number of professionals over the years&#8221;. </span>The attack on X&#8217;s credibility goes further <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[X] has a documented history of mental health problems&#8230; she has been observed to be irrational&#8230; incoherent</span>&#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">Dr [J] and Dr [K] have diagnosed [X] as having an emotionally unstable border line personality disorder and recurrent depressive disorder.</span>&#8221; </p>

I also note that Ms Gasparro is critical of the opinions of a Dr Van Velson, who provided an independent assessment in earlier private law proceedings.

Of course, he would have known that Ms Gasparro had taken all these points on his behalf. Similarly, he would have known the questions put to X in cross examination. From F&#8217;s perspective it was extremely unfortunate that the Local Authority was able to identify the above material so quickly and efficiently. It entirely dismantles F&#8217;s argument. The best interpretation that I can possibly place on this conduct is that both parents have contrived to make an application based on what they knew to be an entirely false premise, as a last ditch and desperate attempt to overturn the findings. In this ambition they have singularly failed. </p>

In the context of the totality, the fact that the judge&#8217;s attention was not drawn to the wrongful allegation of arson against F made by X, has, in my judgment, no impact on the overall evidential landscape. In other words, applying the reasoning of Lord Hope in <span style="font-weight:bold">McInnes (Appellant) v Her Majesty&#8217;s Advocate (Respondent) (Scotland) </span>(supra), taking all the circumstances of the hearing before Judge Atkinson in to account, there is no real possibility that different findings would have been made.

She also carefully explored the discrepancies in X&#8217;s evidence and some of the inherently unlikely explanations advanced by F. Finally, the judge sensitively evaluated the demeanour of all the witnesses. I made the following observation in my judgment, which I consider bares repetition here: </p>

It is important to identify that this was not a case where the Judge confined herself to simply evaluating who she believed. She was undertaking a forensic trawl of the corroborative information available, to assess whether it supported or undermined the reliability of the allegations. It was, if I may say so, a thorough and impressive forensic exercise. The details of it are particularly in evidence in paragraphs 76 to 89. I do not propose to work through these in the course of this judgment but again they can be read into it.&#8221; </span></p>

Similarly, though M has been effective in managing her mental health, she has a history of self harming and suicidal behaviour. It also has to be identified that as recently as June 2018, immediately following Baker J&#8217;s decision not to return T&#8217;s sibling, M got extremely drunk, self-harmed by cutting both her wrists and attempted suicide by cutting her throat with a razor blade.  </p>

He was critical, directly and inferentially, of the building and the staff. I also note, in passing, that F was somewhat disdainful of the other residents.

Later, when F came to give evidence himself, I asked him if he recognised that he had this impact on Mr Hill. He told me that he did recognise it. He also acknowledged that he appreciated the real distress he had caused to Judge Atkinson. In addition, towards the end of the case, F proffered an apology to Mr Barnes to whom he has been extremely discourteous and, on occasions, belittling. In what it will be seen is something of a pattern, F speculated adversely about Mr Barnes&#8217;s personal and family life. Mr Barnes, like Mr Hill, bore the onslaught with dignity and professionalism. It is necessary to state that this behaviour has taken place in front of me in a court room. I had a strong sense of F endeavouring to rein himself in. I infer that in different circumstances he would have unleashed his invective more freely. I record that F expressed some remorse for his behaviour to Mr Barnes, which I consider, on balance had, at the time it was given, some sincerity to it. What F lacked, however, was any even tentative understanding of why he behaved in such a way.  </p>

Even allowing for the fact that she is the professional representing F&#8217;s child and recommending an adoptive placement and might therefore expect a degree of robust questioning from a father acting in person, F&#8217;s treatment of her was overbearing, oppressive and bullying. The Guardian should not have had to endure such an onslaught. I was, on reflection, rather too slow in closing down F&#8217;s behaviour towards her.

Moreover, it is exhibited by both parents in varying ways and to differing degrees. It creates an alarming spectacle. Even when the couple is quiet or behaving humorously, as they sometimes do, there is a fragility to the peace and an underlying tension. I agree with the Local Authority&#8217;s view and indeed, with the evidence of Dr. Sinclair that the behaviour that I have described is reflected in the couple&#8217;s own personal relationship. M rarely shows an ability for independent thought or action. As Dr. Sinclair states M is heavily invested in the relationship. She has, Dr. Sinclair considered, experienced such a difficult and traumatic life that the love she perceives to be offered to her by F, is of a more nurturing quality than anything she has received before. F states in the assessments and to me in this court that he is attracted to women whom he perceives to be &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; and who he can &#8216;rescue&#8217;. I formed the impression that M considers that she has been rescued by F. Dr. Sinclair made it plain that if confronted with a conflict between the needs of her baby and those of F, M would choose F. In her report Dr. Sinclair notes that F frequently interrupted M, insulted her when he became angry and made generally derogatory remarks about her intellect.  </p>

The Court of Appeal did not agree with that submission. It has to be said that it is not easy to reconcile these views with F&#8217;s own sexual orientation as he expresses it. Indeed, some might regard it as a hypocritical position.

This incident involved his receiving oral sex from a prostitute in his car in the Bethnal Green area. Initially, F gave some rather ludicrous explanation suggesting that the police officer had mistaken the sexual act for discovering F &#8220;urinating into a bottle&#8221;. I note that M stood by F&#8217;s explanation. However, when I indicated a degree of scepticism at a Directions Hearing, F amended the account. In many ways I have to say that I consider the altered explanation to be equally odd. F says that he encountered the woman in Bethnal Green entirely by chance. She had recently been &#8220;beaten up&#8221; and her bruises were evident. She had cuts to her face to which she had applied a plaster. As I understand it, blood was still visible. F told me that he felt sorry for her. He explained that he had oral sex with her because he had a long-standing difficulty with erection dysfunction and he wanted to &#8220;experiment&#8221; with another woman to see if the difficulty was localised to his partner or a more general problem.  </p>

I also consider it troubling that M accepts this later explanation and, again, without criticism. In fact, M is critical of herself, explaining F&#8217;s behaviour to be a consequence of her low sexual drive at that time following her suicide attempt. In what I regard as a rather benign analysis Mr McKenzie states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it may also be noted [F] appears to have acted out by seeking the services of a sex worker which is a different course from being sexually forceful with [M]&#8221;</span> All this leads Mr. McKenzie to the view that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[F&#8217;s] sexual aggression is a dysfunctional means of acting out his aggression and anger in situations of significant mutual conflict&#8221;.</span> However, Mr. McKenzie concludes that his report <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;remains limited in its understanding of [F&#8217;s] sexual aggression&#8221;</span>.  He highlights the fact that there are three reports of rape <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;within highly conflicted intimate relationships&#8221;</span>, the most recent allegation of rape was made by M, two years ago, from which she resiles, on the basis that it was a malevolent complaint on her part born of her anger with F at the time.  </p>

The consensus, as I see it, between Dr. Sinclair, Mr McKenzie and Ms Jo Duncombe (independent sexual crime/child protection consultant) is that F is a low sexual risk to a child of T&#8217;s age. It is important to state that this important qualification offers little if any reassurance for the future.  </p>

I do not see any indicators at all of F being able to curb this behaviour, nor did Mr McKenzie. When he was asked whether there was any evidence that indicated some potential for open and easy cooperation with safeguarding agencies and Local Authority social workers, sufficient to justify a plan of rehabilitation, Mr McKenzie was unable to identify any. He posited instead that there should be some identifiable sanction if cooperation was not forthcoming. </p>

It is important to state that Mr McKenzie immediately realised the unsustainability of such an approach. By way of illustration, I remind myself, here, that T has not received any childhood immunisations at all to date. This is notwithstanding that his case has been before the High Court and that he has been represented by a Guardian. Nobody has, until this last hearing, brought this to my attention. Both parents are equally opposed to it on what are, to my mind, unsustainable medical grounds. The chaos and confusion they both contrive to create around them is inimical to good professional practice. It confuses and distracts those charged with responsibility for T and it creates fertile ground for error and professional misjudgement. Mr King, who has worked heroically with this family both in these proceedings and the earlier proceedings is accused by both of them as pursuing <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a vendetta against them&#8221;.</span> In fact, in his determination to keep M and T together at the unit, Mr King has proved himself to be entirely independent and objective. During the case before me M screamed at Mr Harmer (the social worker who co-worked the case with Mr King) that if T was not returned she would kill herself and it would be his fault. All the evidence points clearly and irresistibly to a profound, deep seated and intensely hostile approach to the Local Authority and to authority in general. Of course, as I have referred to above, much of this is intrinsic to F&#8217;s philosophical resistance to the scope and ambit of the State&#8217;s powers. </p>

As has been observed, the legal proceedings have completely taken over F&#8217;s life. They have also taken him away from his son. He has been repeatedly advised to concentrate on the former. This is advice he has been unable to take. As I have already stated, F has spent many hours on his feet in this court room asking questions across a broad sphere of issues, supplemented by his voluble interruptions of the cross examination of the lawyers. Frequently, it has proved easier and less painful to others, simply to grant him a very wide licence. Inevitably, of course, this has frequently led him, inadvertently, to unpick his own case.</p>

Additionally, there is a great deal of supervision and observation. It is an undoubtedly claustrophobic situation. F convinced himself that it would be possible for the family to return home together following the six-week review. There is no evidential basis for such optimism but F believed that Mr Hill would recommend it. In fact, Mr Hill proposed a further period of assessment that permitted the parents to take T out in to the wider community for unsupervised periods.  It was, at this time, that F unleashed the gossip he had heard to the effect that Mr Hill had been seen smoking cannabis with one of the residents. F&#8217;s position quickly became untenable and he returned to his own home. In his unsparing and discourteous cross examination of Mr Hill, F contended that the extended assessment was a cynical and exploitative device to misuse public funding for profit. </p>

It was said to have been made by a male with a discernibly West Indian accent. Unusually, the caller did not give a name or indicate where he was calling from. As I understand it, the call was made the day after M thought that she had found a bump or bruise on T&#8217;s head. The caller stated that he was employed by the unit but it was obvious that he was telephoning from outside and, it seems, near a busy road. The caller reported that T had been dropped on a pavement or some kind of hard surface. I am clear that this did not happen, indeed, I can find no evidence to support such an incident. I strongly doubt that the call was made by an employee of the unit. Why should they say they worked there and decline to give their name? I also found M&#8217;s evidence to be particularly tortured and confusing. M had suggested that someone at the unit had injured T and insinuated that it was a particular carer. This fell short of an actual accusation. I should also say that the insinuations decreased when M was pressed for detail. The doctor who examined T was prepared to accept the presence of a bruise but those involved in T&#8217;s care (other than the parents) saw no bruise and considered this was just the shape of T&#8217;s head which did not change. There is no convincing evidence of any skin discolouration. Mr Barnes has been unable to identify sufficient coherence in the evidence to press for any finding. He submits that, in any event, it is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not forensically necessary for the Court to strain to resolve this issue&#8221;</span>.

F&#8217;s attitude towards the world generally is aggressive, as the history of this case reveals.

Nor is there any prospect of this being bridged within timescales that are even remotely consistent with T&#8217;s. There is a wide raft of concerns which are, both individually and collectively, incompatible with any further delay in resolving T&#8217;s future. Here there is not only a complete inability to work with the Local Authority or with any of the safeguarding forces, there is virulent and bitter resistance to it. There is, for all the reasons I have set out, a corrosive dynamic in the parent&#8217;s relationship which is likely to be emotionally harmful to any child exposed to it. There remains, in the light of HHJ Atkinson&#8217;s un-displaced findings of rape, a continuing risk of sexually aggressive behaviour and domestic violence on F&#8217;s part. Moreover, it must be identified that, whilst T may not be at sexual risk from F, at this stage, the evidence offers no reassurance in relation to that risk as T gets older.  </p>

It is important that I say that I am entirely satisfied that each of the professionals involved and without exception, has been determined to give this family the very best possible opportunity. It is equally important that I identify, as I have above, the efforts made by M to achieve and maintain her sobriety. Most importantly of all, M&#8217;s loving and nurturing care for T will place him well for the future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">There have been no members of any wider family canvassed as potential carers in this case. It is perhaps important to say that even if there had been it is difficult to see how any family placement could have sustained the kind of onslaught which would undoubtedly have been directed towards them particularly from F. The starting point in assessing T&#8217;s future is to identify his most pressing needs. These are clear: T needs a secure, stable, permanent, loving home; a family that will sustain him throughout his childhood, adolescence and beyond; an environment in which he is permitted to flourish and grow and which provides an opportunity for him to realise his potential, whatever that may be. This is unlikely to be achieved in foster care but there is every prospect of it within an adoptive placement. In coming to this view, I bear in mind the emphasis on the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life, highlighted in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children&#8217;s Act 2002</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>): </p>

The circumstances I have taken some care to set out above point a magnetic north towards adoption in this case. I am entirely satisfied that &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221; or to put it differently any other alternative would fall significantly short of achieving the basic welfare needs of this child. I am clear that this is a case which requires the parent&#8217;s consent to be dispensed with. Accordingly, I approve the Local Authority&#8217;s plans. </p>

As I have indicated above, I have permitted F, as a litigant in person, a degree of latitude that I certainly would not have extended to counsel. I am here, as in every case authorising a permanent separation of a child from a birth family, extremely conscious of the enormity of the decision. I permitted F to explore a wide range of issues which were not foreshadowed in case management. The consequence of all this, as I made clear at the time, was that no judgment writing time was available, nor could I identify any before the end of the term. Additionally, after the hearing had concluded I was informed that there were two outstanding appeals relating to interim orders in these proceeding made by a different judge. This was not drawn to my attention during the hearing, nor to that of any other party. Permission to appeal in respect of both applications was refused on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2020.
