The processes in the Court of Protection are intended to give the court wide flexibility to reach a decision quickly, conveniently and cost effectively where it can, whilst still preserving a proper opportunity for those affected by its orders to have their views taken into account in full argument if necessary. To that end, on receiving the application, the court can make a decision on the papers, or direct a full hearing, or make any order as to how the application can best be dealt with. This will often lead to a speedy decision made solely on paper which everyone is content to accept, but any party still has the right to ask for a reconsideration.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">She continued to speak about her daughter CN. &#8216;When the children were small, she would go out and come in late. I was working at Peter Jones. When I asked her to look after her children, she nearly strangled me. The children witnessed it, and the police were called, and they took GN. CN always wants her own way. She wants to do what she wants to do. Her children are from different fathers. GN&#8217;s father got killed in a car crash. RN&#8217;s father had said to me that he was frightened of her because he was attacked by her. She attacked my husband, as well, after an argument. She does not talk to her own daughter.&#8217;</p>

She said that RN&#8217;s mother, CN, never looked after him. When she went into hospital, RN was living with BN in her property at the time. She said that later she found out that many of her belongings, her antiques, jewellery and furniture especially, had gone missing and she suspected that her daughter CN had stolen them. &#8216;They were stealing all my things. CN has a place of her own in [the same street in Clapham as BN&#8217;s property]. I could not return to my own property.&#8217; These comments were partly expressed by BN spontaneously, and partly prompted by her daughter SH, despite my exhortations for SH not to intervene at that stage.&#8221;</p>

She clearly understood what was implied by an LPA and expressed a wish to retain it in its present form. In my questions she showed she had capacity to understand and retain for a sufficient time information given to her about the LPA in order to arrive at a decision after weighing up the consequences, and communicate this decision to me. She made it clear that she was not under the influence of others when she arrived at her decisions to execute an LPA or to retain it as it currently stands.&#8221;</p>
