The first in time is that of the father, issued on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, seeking to vary the terms of an order made on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016 by District Judge Gailey.  The second application is that of the mother, dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2016, seeking to enforce the terms of the order of District Judge Gailey on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.33in">The position now is that the father seeks to care for both IL and JL in this country.  In contrast, the mother seeks to care for IL and JL in Australia.  The guardian recommends that the ideal solution would be for the parents and the children to live in this jurisdiction and for there to be a shared care arrangement, or to endorse the status quo, as set out in her report, namely that the children are separated; IL living here with the father and JL living in Australia with the mother.  On reflection, and in her evidence, the guardian&#8217;s preferred course, if the ideal solution cannot be achieved, would be for JL to come to this jurisdiction to live with IL in his father&#8217;s home.</p>

The only alternative, as she saw it, if that ideal could not be achieved, would be that JL should come to live with his father in this country.</p>

That was plainly a litigation tactic.  Why that advice was not disclosed at any time prior to the mother giving evidence I do not know and no explanation has been forthcoming, but it very greatly concerned me that IL and JL were deprived of the opportunity and the chance of having contact together over Easter on the basis of litigation tactics.
