As [14] of FPR PD12J provides, &#8220;[t]he court must ascertain at the earliest opportunity &#8230; whether domestic abuse is raised as an issue which is likely to be relevant to any decision of the court relating to the welfare of the child&#8221;.

In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence.

If there is or may be solid advantage to the children in doing so, then the inquiry will proceed, albeit it may be on the basis of submissions rather than oral evidence. But if the judge is satisfied that no advantage to the children is going to be obtained by continuing the investigation further, then it is perfectly within his case management powers and the proper exercises of his discretion so to decide and to determine that the proceedings should go no further."</span></p>

These points were also made to the District Judge. There is of course the potential that the mother&#8217;s allegations are not proved, and a risk assessment of the type envisaged by PD12J is ultimately not required. However, that is not a reason to abandon the fact-finding, rather the reverse. If the mother has made allegations that are not proved, but remains resistant to the children spending time with their father, then a fact-finding exercise may well help to provide a narrative for the family and for professionals working to help them. If the judge&#8217;s conclusion was that the hearing was not necessary or proportionate because there was no prospect of the mother proving her case at trial, then he should have made that clear and explained the reasons that he had come to that view. </p>

The mother had alleged domestic abuse and sought the court&#8217;s determination of the allegations she made before welfare decisions for the children could be made. After the judge&#8217;s decision, the case became one where the relationship was recast in the terms argued for by the father, where any disputes between the parties were regarded &#8216;situational&#8217; to the end of the relationship, with each of the parents bearing responsibility for unedifying behaviour. The effect of this recasting was that the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse were regarded as irrelevant, and she was no longer permitted to raise the allegations for determination by the Court.  I find that this did amount to a summary dismissal of the mother&#8217;s case.</p>

In many instances the effects of coercive control will be such that the victim of abuse has not for many years challenged anything the abuser has done. It may take the victim many years to speak about the abuse and, as noted above, the delay in doing so may be taken by the professionals as an indication of a lack of credibility. If and when the victim does attempt to break free of the abuser&#8217;s control, their resistance is not from a position of equality in the relationship. However, despite the very clear difference between &#8216;high conflict&#8217; relationships and domestic abuse, victims and professionals told the panel that they had experiences of domestic abuse being reframed into evidence of a &#8216;high conflict&#8217; or mutually abusive relationship, for which the solution was considered to be mutual reduction of conflict and encouragement of cooperation rather than protection of the child and adult victim from the other parent&#8217;s abuse. As some of the victims feared, and were legally advised, raising any concerns about contact with an abusive partner, was perceived as evidence of hostility to co-parenting.</span></p>

These, and other factors, establish that there is a significant and important public interest in our society having and maintaining confidence in the work of the Family Court. Conversely, a largely closed system, where the public are given no account of how the court operates, leads to accusations that this is &#8216;secret&#8217; justice and that the approach of the court is unsound, unfair or downright wrong. Openness and accessibility to the work of the court may also enhance the ability for the system and those who work within it to learn and improve.</span></p>
