      <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">This judgment was handed down after a hearing in public.  It can be reported provided that the terms of a reporting restriction order made on 26 February 2014 and amended on 17 June 2014 are complied with.  That order prevents the identification of the medical and other staff who cared for LM and the members of the Jehovah&#8217;s Witness faith who took part in the hearing.  Failure to comply with the order will be a contempt of court.</span></p>

If such a power exists, the second question is whether it should be exercised in the present case.</span></p>

I am impressed, in particular, by the basis upon which Mr Huw Lloyd made his submissions. I have already referred to the potential effect on medical and other staff, knowing that on the death of the patient their anonymity would be lost and that that might well have some detrimental effect upon the way in which they might care for the patient. I believe that that consideration also applies to the parents and members of the family of the patient, and to such people in future cases. I am also satisfied that there is a principle of medical confidentiality which is relevant in the context of the facts of this case and similar cases. It is a further matter of public interest that those who may be faced with considering the making of an application of the kind which was made in this case should be untrammelled by the fear of publicity in coming to the very sensitive and fundamental decision which it involves.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I have reviewed the judgment given in February.  It described LM&#8217;s history of mental health difficulties, her longstanding religious faith and her declining health.  None of the information given in the judgment or referred to during the hearing is of particular sensitivity or confidentiality, nor does it reflect any discredit on LM.  The physical, mental and spiritual challenges that she faced could confront anyone.  Also, her way of life, whether better described as independent or isolated, makes it unlikely that any wider harm will come from linking her name with her story.</span></p>

The right to privacy is only likely to outweigh this consideration in very special circumstances.  Mr Dodd also makes the important point that there is a public interest in the media being able to report LM&#8217;s unusual and fateful decision in an engaging manner.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I take account of the fact that LM was a private person who would not have wanted her private information to be made public.  I also have regard to her medical confidentiality.  In this instance, that has not been extensively breached.  The fact that she suffered from mental illness would have been apparent to those who knew her and little detail is given of her physical illness.  Nor can it be said that to reveal her name would deter applications in similar situations when the degree of scrutiny given to this case is considered.</span></p>

But there is a balance to be struck, and in other cases the conclusion might be different.     </span></p>

No application has been made regarding the former, while the Witnesses acted to assist the court in an emergency and should not be exposed to unwanted publicity as a result.</span></p>
