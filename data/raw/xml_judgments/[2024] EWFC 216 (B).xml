For reasons I will set out, on the evidence I have read and heard the reason is plain. A Child in Need meeting took place on 20 June 2024 and it was not disputed by the parties that the parents became very agitated and angry with one another and their voices, especially the Mother&#8217;s, were raised.</span></p>

The credibility and reliability of that parent should not be assessed simply by reference to their demeanour, degree of emotion or other aspects of their presentation. This of course works in both directions. It is as problematic to rely on an impression that a witness has an 'honest' tone, manner or presentation, for example that they appear "genuinely upset", as it is to rely on an impression that the tone or manner of a witness appears 'dishonest', for example that they cross their arms or look at the floor. These principles must apply both when the court is evaluating the parent in the witness box and when the court is evaluating the significance of the observations of other's regarding the parent's demeanour at a given point.&#8221;</span></p>

Furthermore, the FCA was left in &#8220;no doubt&#8221; that the Father presents the Mother in a negative light to the children. The Father sent the FCA a video recording that he had taken of the children. In that video he told the children if they did not listen to him then they would go to their mother.

Unhappily, that time did not take place after Elijah and Kobe made allegations about the Mother that resulted in further social services involvement with the family. There were two central allegations. The first, that the Mother strangled one of the boys. The second, that the Mother locked the boys in her bedroom. The first was explained to the FCA&#8217;s satisfaction as being a time when one of the boys was about to step into the road and the Mother pulled him back with his clothing, which caused the clothing to catch on his neck. The account from the children about strangulation has not been consistent. Kobe told his school that he had been strangled and they both now say it was Elijah. The Mother denies she locks the children in rooms. The FCA confirmed that social services have visited her home and found no evidence of locks on doors. The FCA noted that Elijah&#8217;s school is concerned by the high level of hostility between the parents.</span></p>

Within days, the Father said the children did not want to spend time with the Mother. In the FCA&#8217;s opinion the proceedings can be concluded with some trust that the Local Authority will support a restoration of the relationship between the children and the Mother. In her opinion the harm of delay outweighs the benefit of the proceedings concluding, fairly noting that they have been ongoing for 102 weeks.</span></p>

The FCA worries about the impact on the children of not having a relationship with the Mother.

What is important, as with domestic abuse, is the particular behaviour that is found to have taken place within the individual family before the court, and the impact that that behaviour may have had on the relationship of a child with either or both of his/her parents. In this regard, the identification of &#8216;alienating behaviour&#8217; should be the court&#8217;s focus, rather than any quest to determine whether the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; can be applied.&#8221;</span></p>

The situation calls for judicial resolve because the line of least resistance is likely to be less stressful for the child and for the court in the short term. But it does not represent a solution to the problem. Inaction will probably reinforce the position of the stronger party at the expense of the weaker party and the bar will be raised for the next attempt at intervention. Above all, the obligation on the court is to keep the child's medium to long term welfare at the forefront of its mind and wherever possible to uphold the child and parent's right to respect for family life before it is breached. In making its overall welfare decision the court must therefore be alert to early signs of alienation. What will amount to effective action will be a matter of judgement, but it is emphatically not necessary to wait for serious, worse still irreparable, harm to be done before appropriate action is taken. It is easier to conclude that decisive action was needed after it has become too late to take it.&#8221;</span></p>

I asked the parties to discuss what arrangements they thought best and to present their proposals to me on the following day for determination if there is a dispute. The parties agreed that the children should, from this Friday, spend week-on-week-off during the holidays and also spend each Wednesday night and every other Friday to Monday with the Mother.</span></p>

It would, upon a default by the Father, cause the children to live with the Mother. They would then be able to have a relationship with her. Such an order would mean that professional work can be done with the children away from the Father&#8217;s influence that would serve to undermine professional work.</span></p>

They would likely resist and reject it. I accept they would be very upset and be caused emotional harm. I do, however, have a degree of hope that they would come to accept the change and settle &#8211; much as they soon enjoyed their time with their mother once it started. At present, I do not have sufficient evidence (against the background of parental hostility) to give me confidence that the Mother can meet all the children&#8217;s emotional needs. To require the children to live with her in the interim, would therefore, carry risks that are presently unknown.</span></p>

I will not hesitate to order the children live with the Mother immediately and without any suspension, if the evidence leads me to conclude that is necessary and in their best interests. If such a change of residence is necessary, but cannot be executed immediately, I will consider all other options, including the appropriateness of them being in a bridging foster care placement to give them a neutral environment from which they can re-build their relationship with the Mother and be safeguarded from the significant harm they have suffered to date and which I find they are at risk of suffering. If the Father breaches the orders I have made without reasonable excuse I will not hesitate to make an appropriate Enforcement Order to promote his future compliance with the Court&#8217;s orders.</span></p>

Secondly, it will emphasise the seriousness of the circumstances to the FCA, whom I will go on to appoint as a Children&#8217;s Guardian. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, it will reinforce the seriousness of the circumstances to the Father and it may, thereby, improve the prospects of him complying with the other orders I will make, which is overwhelmingly in the children&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>
