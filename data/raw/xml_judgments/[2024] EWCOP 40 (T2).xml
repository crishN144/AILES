J is a young woman who has  diagnoses of learning disability, autism and Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (&#8216;ARFID&#8217;).  She has previously been subject to separate Court of Protection proceedings in relation to where she should live and who she should have contact with.

This is my ex tempore judgment on that application. </span></p>

As this is an application which relates to serious medical treatment: it was referred to the Vice President of the Court of Protection, Theis J, who released the matter to me.  That was on the basis that the Official Solicitor would be instructed to represent J&#8217;s interests.  The Official Solicitor is so instructed.  The parties, therefore, are the applicant Health Body who are anonymised for the purpose of this case so that J&#8217;s residence and where she lives is not inadvertently disclosed.  The Local Authority who are responsible for J&#8217;s care are a respondent.  J, through the Official Solicitor is also a respondent.  J&#8217;s mother who is a party to the separate welfare proceedings has been informed of these proceedings but has indicated that she does not wish to be joined as a party.</span></p>

J has indicated over a number of months that she has had problems and pain with intermittent and transient toothache.  This is against a background where J has had a reduced diet and poor oral hygiene for many years.  It is not known precisely when this started but certainly, since August 2023, support staff have noted that J has demonstrated pain by putting her hands to her mouth and grimacing.  Support staff have noticed that J&#8217;s front teeth are discoloured and &#8220;bad&#8221;.</span></p>

However, J was unable to cooperate or tolerate this and she was noted to be aggressive and disruptive at the appointment despite the fact that she had received a mild sedative before.  The Health Body&#8217;s&#8217;s position is that J is suffering from dental problems which require treatment.  That treatment is only achievable under a general anaesthetic.  Until there is a full examination of J under such anaesthetic, it is unclear the extent to which treatment is required.</span></p>

Further, it is proposed that a cervical smear test should take place.  J has had difficulties also with her hair and nails.  She is unable to manage them herself.  She is unable to tolerate others providing care in relation to them.  Her hair has been described as &#8220;matted&#8221;.  Her nails are unkempt.  It is proposed that whilst under general anaesthetic, a hairdresser and a podiatrist should be present and cut J&#8217;s hair so that it is more manageable in the future to clean, and deal with her nails.</span></p>

They provided evidence in respect of the risks and benefits of general anaesthetic and the treatment that is required.  It is the position of the Health Body, approved by the Local Authority and the Official Solicitor that such a course of treatment including sedation under general anaesthetic and the possible administration of medication covertly to J are in J&#8217;s best interest.</span></p>

By section 15(1) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Court may make a declaration as to whether a person lacks capacity to make a specific decision.  Section 16 empowers the Court by making an order to make a personal welfare decision on behalf of an incapacitated person which includes, under section 17(1)(d) the giving of consent to the carrying out of treatment by a person providing health care.</span></p>

In relation to the presumption of capacity, I note that a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity.  That is to be read with section 2(4):</span></p>

In other words, the specific requirement of belief is subsumed in the more general requirements of understanding and of ability to use and weigh information&#8221;.</span></p>

As against that, early intervention which is what is proposed by this treatment plan with a view to avoiding emergency admission would provide, as set out in what I consider to be a carefully drawn-up and well-thought-through care&#160;plan, a careful consideration of how to reduce any pain or distress to J and to ensure that she is able to cope as best as possible with these interventions.  It deals with a number of eventualities including whether certain medication is available or not.

Weighing up and balancing the benefits and risks of those separately, in relation to the blood tests, this is largely non-invasive.  Dr&#160;P, the GP, states it would be extremely beneficial particularly because J has been experiencing secondary amenorrhoea, i.e., she does not have periods, and she has a very limited diet.  Blood tests which would include testing for testosterone and sex hormone would assist in determining her future treatment and her future management.  Given that any disadvantage to J would be relatively minor if she were under general anaesthetic, there would be minimal distress.  In my judgment, it is in J&#8217;s best interest for her future medical treatment to have the blood taken as proposed.</span></p>

If J&#8217;s nails and hair were in a more manageable condition, she could be supported in the future to engage in routine-maintenance care of them.  In the long term, therefore, she may accept staff support to meet her personal care needs.  Progress in relation to that has been slow but, in my judgment, if J&#8217;s hair and nails can be dealt with whilst under general anaesthetic (she is not tolerating that care if she is not sedated), then this will avoid the potential need for repeat procedures in the future.&#160; In my judgment, it is in J&#8217;s best interest to undergo such treatment.</span></p>

Dr P, who is J&#8217;s GP, has prepared a balance sheet document dated 8 May 2024 in which she records that a single smear test could save J&#8217;s life and that by detecting a pre-cancer early, the treatment needed would be relatively minor.  I recognise that a smear test is an invasive and personal investigation; however, I also recognise that there is a risk identified that J, in the past, could have contracted the HPV virus and a key benefit of a screening programme is detection of potential cancer early to avoid less arduous treatment in the future.</span></p>

There is also the risk that J may be triggered to emotional distress because of what might have happened to her in the past (in respect of which no findings have ever been made nor any clear allegations made.  I make that clear).  I accept that this is a relatively finely-balanced decision but I conclude, in line with the parties&#8217; positions and in line with what the MDT meeting said that the possible benefits are likely to outweigh the burden of more invasive treatment if needed at a later stage which could hopefully be avoided.  The Health Body proposed a specialist nurse should undertake the smear test which appears to me to be appropriate.  Weighing all of this up, I am satisfied that it is in J&#8217;s best interest to have a cervical smear whilst she is under general anaesthetic.  </span></p>

The relationship between J and her mother has had its problems and contact has been very delicately built up.  It is hoped that this is something which will continue in the future as something that is in J&#8217;s interests.  The presence of J&#8217;s mother when J is having an anaesthetic may, in my judgment, unbalance this and create difficulties in the future.  It may cause J upset and distress.  In all the circumstances, I do not consider it to be in J&#8217;s best interest for her mother to be present.  However, of course, as is proposed, J&#8217;s mother should be told about the progress of the investigations and the treatment and kept fully informed.</span></p>

If upon examination it transpires that she has manageable or functional teeth with treatment, then it is hoped that such treatment would alleviate any pain or distress that J has.  If, however, it is considered in the clinical opinion of the clinicians that J&#8217;s teeth are not capable of being preserved, it would, in any event, still be in J&#8217;s best interest given the pain that she has presently had, for appropriate extraction to take place.   I note that J&#8217;s diet is a soft diet and so whilst aesthetically, the removal of her teeth may cause distress, it should not impact upon her ability to eat and drink in the long term.  In relation to the other investigations under general&#160;anaesthetic, I have set out my reasoning above.  </span></p>

I am satisfied that here there is a medical necessity for J to receive the proposed dental treatment, hair and nail cutting, cervical smear and blood tests and general anaesthetic for reasons of medical requirement.  There will be no breach of J&#8217;s human rights in those circumstances.  </span></p>
