	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I am concerned with an application for a parental order concerning twins, G and M, born in March 2013. They were born following a commercial surrogacy arrangement entered into between the applicants, a same sex couple BB and BD, and the respondents, AM and BM, through a surrogacy agency based in the US. The married gestational surrogate mother gave birth to the children following the transfer of embryos from the gametes of the applicants and donor eggs. The applicants each have a biological connection to one of the children. The children were born in Iowa and following legal steps that secured the legal position of the applicants they returned to this jurisdiction where they have remained in their care.</p>

Ms. Carew, pursuant to an invitation made by this court on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, agreed to become advocate to the court to assist the court in relation to two particular issues.  Firstly, the question of domicile which is one of the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.54</ref> of the Human <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Fertilisation and Human Embryology Act 2008</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>).

Her email states as follows:</p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Commercial surrogacy is not prohibited in Iowa however there are no explicit statutes.  Iowa Code Chapter 710 prohibits the purchase or sale of an individual and surrogacy agreements are specifically excluded from this prohibition.  Iowa law does not prohibit gay or lesbian couples from adopting children or children of a same sex partner. Furthermore, Iowa allows same sex couples to marry under the laws of Iowa. Therefore, same sex couples are allowed to enter into surrogacy contracts.</span></p>

[So very similar to the situation in this jurisdiction].  Iowa does not differentiate between heterosexual and same sex intended parents, thus, the legal process is the same.  The parental rights, or parent-child relationship, is terminated by court order with respect to the birth mother and legal father.  The intended parents&#8217; biological relationship to the child is proven by scientific evidence (usually DNA), and the court establishes the intended biological parent as the parent, or parents, and then orders the Department of Vital Records to remove the legal father from the birth certificate, and to issue a new birth certificate showing the biological father or mother, as the case may be, on the birth certificate.</span></p>

This is set out in an order signed by the court.  It is an order terminating parent-child relationships. It is on the petition of Maxine&#160;Buckmeier, the lawyer, to terminate the parent-child relationships of G.  The court finds it has jurisdiction in relation to the subject matter, it records present at the hearing Maxine&#160;Buckmeier and David Gill (who is described as the guardian ad litem<span style="font-style:italic"/>of the said child on behalf of the child).  AM and BM, the mother by birth and the legal father, are not present.  It refers to evidence being heard by the court and the parties being given an opportunity to be heard.  It records the various documents that have been signed, the release of custody and other documents I&#160;have already referred to.  It then goes on as follows:</p>

It probably also assisted in them being able to secure the relevant immigration clearance to enable them to bring G and M to this jurisdiction, which they did very shortly thereafter, arriving back in this country on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;April.</p>

Whilst there are additional payments to the agency, those relate to specific items of expenditure including matters such as insurance, legal fees, administration of the trust, and fees regarding egg donation. The $20,750 is a fee fixed by Circle Surrogacy.  There is of course an element of profit in it.

One of the matters that they describe in their statement is the difference in societal attitudes between this country and France, in particular, in relation to same sex couples bringing up children.  They say in their statement at para.50:</p>

Having lived in the UK since December 2012, our intentions remain the same. We cannot see ourselves living anywhere other than the United&#160;Kingdom, and we certainly do not envisage returning to live in France.</span></p>

General French society has, in our view, an underlying antipathy to same sex couples and particularly to the creation of families within same sex partnerships.  The 2013 campaign against same sex marriage with a large protest gathering is but one case in point. We made a decision to protect our children that we hoped to have from such a discriminatory environment, whether overt or covert.  We chose to make our future in England after much consideration and planning.  In doing so, we each made a firm decision to abandon our domicile of origin.&#8221;</span></p>

Their intention is clear, not only from what they have set out in their statement, but also by the independent steps that they have taken in terms of moving their family home to this jurisdiction and fully integrating within the system here in terms of tax, national insurance, bank accounts, and their intention to educate both children here long term.</p>
