JUSTICE KING DBE:  This judgment arises out of a hearing relating to the death of Kieron Barley (KB), who was born on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2009 and died on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2011, aged just 22 months old.  KB died from the sequelae of a non-accidental head injury inflicted on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011. Kieron Barley&#8217;s mother is Louise Barley (LB, or &#8216;the mother&#8217;). </p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">KB&#8217;s father has played no part in either KB&#8217;s life or in these proceedings. Craig Lewis (CL, or &#8216;the father&#8217;) regarded himself as KB&#8217;s father and took on that role and responsibility.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">The present hearing has been listed for a so-called finding of fact hearing.  The medical evidence filed in the proceedings is unequivocal and overwhelming to the effect that KB was subjected to two serious assaults, the second of which resulted in his death.  Neither parent was willing or able, prior to the start of the hearing to accept that medical evidence, despite the fact that each as I find, knew the conclusions to be true.  The court has, therefore, heard extensive medical evidence from a battery of eminent experts, some of whom were subjected to challenging &#8211; sometimes verging on aggressive &#8211; cross-examination.  However, when each parent subsequently went into the witness box, they accept the reality of the position, and at the conclusion of the evidence and before submissions, both the father and the mother, through their respective leading counsel, Mr&#160;Weston QC and Mr Vater QC made the inevitable concession that they now accepted the medical evidence and therefore that KB had died from an non-accidental head injury.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">Whilst it will remain necessary to set out the medical evidence in a little detail, (particularly as KB had vulnerabilities which go directly to the force which would have been necessary to cause certain of his injuries), the task for the court is now to identify, if it is so able, which of the mother and the father caused KB&#8217;s fatal injuries, and to examine the state of knowledge and involvement of the other parent.</p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">Rather than leave each of the two families, all of whom are present in court, to hear this judgment and to second guess my findings during what is inevitably going to be a quite lengthy judgment, I indicate now that I find on the balance of probabilities that the father is the perpetrator of both sets of injuries and that the mother is guilty of failing to protect KB to a very significant and serious degree.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">Finally, in introduction, it should be made clear that the mother and father loved KB deeply.  This was not a little boy living in a frightening twilight world of routine neglect and abuse.  There is no evidence that he was subjected to more than the two assaults detailed in this judgment.  Having said that, for the period of time between what I find to be the first set of injuries on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011 and the fatal injuries on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011, KB was very ill, constantly sick and constantly in pain.  Further, having caused the very serious injuries on the first occasion, the father, notwithstanding that he must have known seen on a daily basis the consequences of that loss of temper, lost control a second time and killed the child he loved.</p>

Those scans were reported by Dr&#160;Shruti Moholkar, consultant paediatric radiologist at the Birmingham Children&#8217;s Hospital.  The CT scan showed significant abnormalities and a decision was made to have an MRI scan.  The MRI on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June showed marked brain swelling.  There were bilateral subdural haemorrhages with further evidence of blood in the ventricles, as had been seen on the CT scan.  In KB&#8217;s spine, fractures to the T8 and T9 vertebral body were seen.  There was blood in the thoracic spinal canal and around the spinal cord.  Dr&#160;Moholkar was of the opinion that KB has suffered a severe injury to his brain due to lack of oxygen and that, in the absence of trauma or a clotting disorder, the presence of the recent blood and bilateral subdural collections raised suspicions of non-accidental injury.</p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">Dr&#160;McCarthy, the ophthalmic pathologist, was asked to report on KB&#8217;s eyes.  He found evidence of extensive recent haemorrhage into the optic nerves and into the retinas of both eyes.  There was evidence of previous haemorrhage in the same area and also a large retinal scar in the right eye.  Dr&#160;McCarthy was of the opinion that the recent haemorrhages were consistent with having occurred at or around the time KB collapsed.  There may be, he said, some hemosiderin, (iron-laden macrophages which are indicative of the healing process), which had accumulated during the few days that KB survived, but the extent of them that he observed was such that he was confident that most of it pre-dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and, therefore, related to a second event prior to 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  Dr&#160;McCarthy regards it as likely that those iron macrophages date back to the events of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011.  He thought that the retinal scar was likely to have been caused at the same time.  Dr&#160;McCarthy, therefore, concluded that there were two events: one likely to have been on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and one on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  The damage seen in KB&#8217;s eyes is not explicable by any natural disease process; rather they are &#8220;consistent with either head impact trauma, head movement trauma or a combination of both&#8221;. </p>

His findings can be summarised as follows.  KB was admitted with a severe(?) encephalitic illness and, following his admission, neuroimaging showed evidence of acute subdural haemorrhage at several different and separate sites, including the thoracolumbar spine.  Dr. Stoodley identified probable acute traumatic effusions, acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and intraventricular haemorrhage.  There was also hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.  Dr&#160;Stoodley, too, says that there is no naturally occurring medical condition which could reasonably account for KB&#8217;s presentation or the appearances of the scan.  He concluded that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the appearances are strongly associated with head trauma</span>&#8221; and he drew attention to the MRI of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011 which showed no evidence of such abnormality.  In conclusion, Dr&#160;Stoodley referred to non-accidental head injury as the most likely cause of the imaging and that shaking was the likely cause of the injuries.</p>

The histological examination of the spine showed the vertebrae as osteopenic; that is to say that there was less bone tissue than might have been expected for a child of 22 months.  The amount of both cortical (that is to say the outer shell) and trabecular (that is the inner meshwork) in each vertebra was less than might have been expected for a child of this age.  The T8 was a collapsed vertebra capable of being noted macroscopically &#8211; that is to say by the naked eye.  The healing response that Professor Freemont saw allowed the fracturing event to be dated relative to the time of KB&#8217;s death.  The indication is of an event of between three and five weeks prior to death &#8211; which fits 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  The T9 damage was a less significant injury.  The vertebra was partially collapsed and, although it had similar changes to those seen on T8, it did not have the end plate or cortical bone changes which were seen in the other vertebra.</p>

The reduction in the amount of bone within the vertebrae related, he believed, to KB&#8217;s relative lack of mobility.  Professor&#160;Freemont said that, whilst there is reduced amount of bone, nevertheless the bones were still relatively strong and there would have had to have been a significant compressive force to have caused the fractures.  The fact that the fractures are of one age indicates that the compressive force required was greater than that which KB&#8217;s spine might experience in daily life &#8211; for example, falling backwards on to the bottom when learning to walk.  Fractures of this type occur, he said, more commonly from force or compression from below, such as might occur if a child was forced down hard on to a hard surface and thereafter impacting either on to his bottom or on to rigid outstretched legs.

Dr. Cartlidge ruled out an impact onto an unyielding surface in the absence of scalp swelling or a skull fracture.  So far as the old injuries are concerned, Dr&#160;Cartlidge was of the view that the symptoms &#8211; that is to say intermittent vomiting, pallor, being unsettled, eye-rolling and floppiness &#8211; were consistent with the subdural bleeding around 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  He did not think that impact on the sofa as he fell, or the interrupted fall to the floor from standing described by the father, would have generated anything like sufficient force to cause the subdural bleeding.

Dr&#160;Cartlidge concluded that, whereas the force required to cause the fractures would have been less than is usual as a consequence of the osteopenia, nevertheless the force required would have been greater than that that is used in normal or rough handling.  Dr&#160;Cartlidge is of the opinion that the fractures were caused non-accidentally by KB being slammed on to his bottom and that the screaming in late May and early June were consistent with the fractures being caused immediately prior to his evident distress being noted.  Similarly, he believes that the brief impairment of consciousness seen on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May is consistent with subdural and retinal bleeding having been sustained immediately before the onset of the symptoms.</p>

She told the court that the baby had been induced in September 2004 when it was discovered that the baby was dead.  All this is a fabrication.  The mother has never had a stillbirth; rather, in September 2004, she had a termination at eight weeks.  When this was put to her, she said that she still believes that she had a stillbirth and denies lying about it.  I do not accept that.  The only time in her evidence, no matter how painful, that she actually tried to avoid giving answers was in relation to the so-called stillbirth.  I am satisfied that the reality is that she does know that she had a termination and that it was too late to pull back from what had become an accepted part of her history.  Given how damaged the mother is it would however be for a psychiatrist to interpret this behaviour on her part.  It would be grossly oversimplifying the issue to put it down to attention-seeking lying.</p>

They are hardworking, respectable people who have bought and paid for their own house and who have had their children at the heart of their lives and concern.  The father is a highly-skilled tradesman &#8211; a qualified electrician &#8211; and, in his earlier relationship with a woman, he had settled down, bought a house. They had two children,  with whom he has always had extensive contact. </p>

They were together until about 2006, and during that time had two children. For a great deal of the time, the father told me that he was working away, which put an inevitable strain on their relationship.  According to his former partner&#8217;s  statement, despite earning a good wage, the bills were not paid, which caused tension and, indeed, after they separated, leaving the father in the shared home, the house was repossessed when he failed to pay the mortgage.</p>

All these pressures were going on in the background and were added to by the fact that, following the father&#8217;s first assault on KB on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, had been significantly unwell and, therefore, inevitably unusually demanding and fretful during the rest of his short life.</p>

The paternal grandmother welcomed her into her home, having her to stay with the father for contact weekends with the children and making her part of the family.  I was told that the mother did not know how to play with or to stimulate KB when she first met the father in January 2011; and indeed for many months the father, not unreasonably, thought that his delay was a consequence of being left in his bouncy chair in front of the television watching Micky Mouse for hours at a time.  The paternal grandmother taught the mother how to play.  The grandmother showed me in court with actions how she taught the mother to play pat-a-cake and to relax and make silly noises to her baby.  It was a touching display and it shows a real generosity of spirit on the part of the paternal family that they welcomed in this mother, despite the fact that, to them, she must have seemed to have come from another world.</p>

The health visitor was also concerned at the number of short-term relationships the mother had had which, added together with the mother&#8217;s own history of mental health problems, potentially impacted on her ability effectively to parent KB,  a child with complex needs and who had already been exposed to violence within the home.

The MRI scan revealed no evidence of injury but some evidence of loss of brain tissue.  Dr&#160;Alton felt there to be dilated ventricles, just on the side of abnormal, consistent with PVL.  Dr&#160;Stoodley, subsequently reviewing the scan, felt that the ventricles were prominent but not pathologically enlarged, and, therefore, just within the range of normal.  In the event, the post mortem examination of the brain showed that KB did not have PVL.  Dr&#160;Alton and Dr&#160;Stoodley met.

She moved in almost immediately with KB.  The father spent nearly every night with the mother at the property but did not completely move in, a topic about which there was considerable text traffic between the couple.  The flat needed a great deal of work done to it but, whilst looking grim to an outsider, for the mother it was her own home where she could live with KB, as opposed to under sufferance at her aunt&#8217;s or in the toxic environment of her mother&#8217;s or, indeed, under the roof of a succession of transient male partners.</p>

He said that the mother was out at her brother&#8217;s as she was having problems with the child&#8217;s father.  That is a bizarre comment which has not been explored or clarified in evidence.

I am satisfied that the mother simply made this up to provide herself with an excuse for leaving the hospital.

EB was sufficiently concerned to ring her own mother for advice.  Her mother&#8217;s advice was to call an ambulance, which this time was duly done, and at 19.54 an ambulance was called and KB was taken back to hospital.  KB was again kept in overnight.

Both told the police that the fall on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May had occurred when the father was trying to teach KB how to walk.  Both told the police, in terms, that both the mother and father were present at the time of that fall.  The father described KB as lying on the floor moaning, looking dazed as though he had knocked himself out.  The mother described him as being dazed and floppy and not making a sound and then crying.  In his evidence, the father accepted that the account given to the police in relation to the presence of the mother at the time of KB&#8217;s fall was a lie.  It had been the mother&#8217;s idea that they should lie to the police, he said.  The mother had said that they should do so as she did not believe him to have harmed KB and she did not want anyone to suggest otherwise.  The mother, in her evidence, was less forthright, using the same excuse that she had used in relation to the stillbirth by saying that she had thought about it so many times and repeated the various accounts so often that she had got confused and came to believe that she had been present when KB fell on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.</p>

It follows, therefore, that I am entirely satisfied &#8211; in fact, beyond the balance of probabilities &#8211; that KB sustained serious non-accidental injuries; namely, the facture to the T8 vertebra and the damage to the T9, caused by KB having been slammed down on to his bottom or on to locked straight legs, together with bilateral subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages caused by some sort of shaking or shaking impact mechanism.  The injuries were inflicted on KB whilst in the sole care of his father and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he caused those injuries.</p>

Looking at the photographs taken by the police after KB&#8217;s death, it seems likely that the mother is, yet again, proving to be an unreliable historian, as one empty plate, with a knife and food and food debris, is next to the kitchen sink, and, on the floor, seemingly hastily abandoned, next to KB&#8217;s chair, is a second plate with similar unfinished food on it.  </p>

The accounts have now morphed into an unspecified event occurring at some point between the lounge and the bathroom and that KB either actually went into the bath (mother) or near the bath water (father) but that he had been stripped and was not wearing a nappy.  All the evidence given by the mother and father about what happened immediately prior to KB&#8217;s collapse is unsatisfactory, obviously incomplete and untrue.</p>

I find that KB sustained fatal injuries before he left the bedroom and that he was, indeed, as the mother told Dr&#160;Borden, blue and gurgling in his cot, it follows that he was cyanosed and dying by the time he was carried out of the room.  It is impossible to tell, and has no direct impact on the court&#8217;s findings, whether the various accounts of the role that a bath played in the events is entirely made up or whether, in some vain and desperate attempt to revive KB, he was, in fact, put into a bath prior to the ambulance being called.</p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">On New Year&#8217;s Eve, there was a further incident between the mother and father.  They had been out drinking and, according to the father, both were drunk.  On their return to the property, it is common ground that the mother completely lost control.  She was smashing up the flat and destroying the photographs of KB.  The father accepts that he slapped the mother but said that it was in the context of her being completely hysterical and him being unable to calm her down and to stop her being destructive.  The mother accepts that that was the position, and I accept that that event is somewhat different to the other three episodes of domestic violence detailed in this judgment.  When writing in her diary about the incident a few days later, the mother said (in writing to KB):</p>

I have no doubt that he is, by nature and inclination, a straightforward and truthful man, albeit private, but who finds it difficult to confide.  In many points of detail during the evidence, I preferred his evidence to that of the mother, who, I regret to say, often simply makes things up.  The father had real problems with drugs, and possibly drink, together with the other pressures I have outlined above.  </p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr&#160;Vater&#160;QC, in his closing submissions, whilst maintaining his primary submission that the court could not identify the perpetrator to the requisite standard of proof, suggested to the court that if it did, indeed, find the father to be the perpetrator, the court may find that the heart of the problems lay within KB&#8217;s disabilities.  The father told the court in evidence that he had believed that KB was slow only because he had been grossly under-estimated within the mother&#8217;s household.  That part is undoubtedly true.  The father and his family were clearly committed to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">bring KB on</span>&#8221;: to teach him to feed himself, to play, to talk and, significantly, to walk.  Mr&#160;Vater suggests that it may be significant &#8211; and I agree &#8211; that the incident on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, (when I am satisfied that the father had a momentary loss of control and assaulted KB), occurred at a time when the father was trying to teach KB to walk.</p>

He was probably tired, having had a late night the night before and then having gone to work.  He was used to the well-regulated and supportive environment of his parents and the bright responsiveness of his own children.   Whilst only the father knows what actually happened, it is not hard to see the frustration when KB failed to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">learn&#8221; to walk</span> despite his endeavours.  The tragedy was that no matter how under stimulated KB was there was a significant measure of developmental delay and KB simply could not learn to walk, no matter what encouragement was given to him.</p>

	    <p class="ListBullet" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am satisfied that the father is a man of hasty temper. The incidents of domestic violence show that to be the case, as do other glimpses of the mother and father&#8217;s life revealed through texts &#8211; for example, the father throwing down the mother&#8217;s laptop when irritated.  Whilst these are not serious in themselves, in that neither his former partner nor the mother were hurt, (although it was responsible for the ending of his former relationship), they do demonstrate a sudden lack of control, and the father himself told the court that these lapses occur, not only in drink, but under pressure.</p>

The father is by no means a stupid man.  He must have feared that he was responsible for KB being unwell.  As Mr&#160;Vater pointed out, the father wanted to take a pride in bringing KB on, and then, in June, came the news that there would be no cure, that this was not under stimulation but cerebral palsy, and the mother&#8217;s brother was the only point of reference for a picture of what lay in the future.</p>

Neither the mother nor the father, at present, are prepared to tell the court what triggered the second loss of temper on the part of the father.  I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that something happened whilst the father was in the bedroom alone with KB.  He was there, he told me, trying to find clothes, an almost impossible task given the state of the room.  Whether in frustration he threw KB into the cot to free up his hands to find something clean to put on him, rather than putting him in the cot whilst he hunted for clothes (as he told the court), only the father knows.  It may be that the mother does not herself know what the catalyst was, but she undoubtedly knows that the father did something to KB when he was alone in the bedroom.  In the same way that she devised an alibi for the father for 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, she has attempted ever since to cover up and to protect the father rather than her child.</p>

I accept that to be the case.  Similarly, the Local Authority says that this is not a mother who came belatedly to understand the medical evidence, as she was in the flat when KB died and, in a flat of that size, she must have known that something terrible had happened.  I accept also that to be the case.</p>
