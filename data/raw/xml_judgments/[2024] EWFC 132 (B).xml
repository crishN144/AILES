That was clearly far too long, and I have borne this in mind when considering the evidence given by M, who was in the witness box at the time, in the latter part of that day.

Information provided to Cafcass by F1&#8217;s local authority  suggests that the children were living between town W and London. At times the children would spend time individually with each of the parties. F1 says that because B  was so young he would sometimes stay with M while A would spend time with F1. </p>

In order to do so the court should ask itself the following questions, tailored as necessary to the circumstances of the case. First, whether the witness has told a deliberate untruth, i.e. the lie did not arise from confusion or mistake; secondly, whether the lie related to a significant issue; and thirdly, whether there is any other reason which could explain the lie such as the witness&#8217;s shame, misplaced loyalty, fear, or distress.  </p>

It often took several minutes to clarify an answer, and where there was any scope for ambiguity the interpreters would consult with each other and the witness before conveying the answer to the court. It occurred to me that in some ways this process afforded the parties a better experience than many witnesses have, because the process of interpretation was so careful and painstaking that they had more opportunity than usual to reflect on the questions, and to clarify and correct their answers. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">All three parties struggled with some aspects of their recollection, because of the significant lapse in time since the events with which this hearing was concerned. This was exacerbated by the nature of some of the events they were being asked to remember: personal relationships tend to develop incrementally, and very few people are able to remember the exact dates when their relationships stopped and started. In the litigation context problems with memory are compounded by the process of having to re-tell a story several times, a process which can distort the original memory and then reinforce the distorted one; and by the fact that parties often have strong incentives to shape their memories in a particular direction.</p>

Broadly speaking, I agree. The messages produced do not form a coherent conversation; some of them are unlinked and unintelligible; and, perhaps most tellingly of all, they do not provide F1 with incontrovertible evidence in support of his case. The messages in [a date in] 2017, for example, suggest the beginnings of an intimate relationship but do not explicitly refer to sexual intercourse. If F1 were engaged in fabricating this evidence, the temptation to bolster his case on the paternity issue would surely have been irresistible. </p>

M said herself in evidence she was &#8220;torn between the need for the milk [to feed B] and the pressure of sexual intercourse&#8221;.

He says that she put pressure on him to sponsor her visa application and to provide her with financial support; that he eventually agreed to become her sponsor and shortly after she was granted permanent leave to remain, the parties separated. Again, there is limited evidence in support of F1&#8217;s allegations; and given the parties&#8217; ongoing relationship and the existence of the children, it was not on the face of it unreasonable for M to ask him for support.  </p>

By that time they had not seen F1 for over a year. They referred to him as &#8220;sad&#8221; and &#8220;scary&#8221;, and both said that F1 had hit them (A on the bottom and B on the head). They made no allegations against their mother. I need to approach this evidence with some caution: the recording is not as clear as it might be (there is no record of what the children were asked), and it is possible that the children were influenced by either M or F2, both of whom by that point were engaged in contested litigation with F1. However the other evidence of physical chastisement of B by F1 makes it more likely that there is at least some truth in the children&#8217;s description of their experiences. </p>

Despite this, for some time thereafter the parties continued an arrangement in which the children spent substantial periods of time with both of them. In April 2022, when the children went to stay with F1, M did not take steps to secure their return for several weeks, until they had stayed beyond the time when she expected them home. Her application to the court was not issued until 13 June 2022, and in her first statement in these proceedings, dated 2 August 2022, she set out contact proposals which included  B  spending up to three weeks at a time with F1 in holiday periods, on an unsupervised basis. I note also &#8211; although, given M&#8217;s communication difficulties, I give this only limited weight &#8211; that in her C1A M&#8217;s allegations of abuse perpetrated by F1 against both M herself and the children were much less extensive than the allegations she later made in these proceedings. </p>

By the time the s7 report was prepared, A had clearly been told that F2, whom she sees regularly, was her father. Her views about F1, whom she believes to be her uncle but who may be her father, and whom she sees infrequently, were negative.
