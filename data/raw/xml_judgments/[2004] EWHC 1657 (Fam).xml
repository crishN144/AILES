The only way to establish this with any degree of precision is by undertaking a more complex type of scan such as a &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. CT scan.  &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..however it is my clear conclusion and that of the MDT (malignancy multi-disciplinary team) that it is in her best interest to undergo a CT scan to stage her tumour, even if this requires general anaesthesia.  There is no other option if a proper assessment of the most appropriate further treatment is to be made.&#8221;</span></p>
