	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before me is the application made by the applicant trust dated 26 May 2023 concerning the healthy and safe delivery of Amira&#8217;s child. The application was made on the basis that while Amira had capacity to make decisions as to her medical care and to conduct legal proceedings, it was apprehended that as the delivery approached she would lose capacity in both spheres. Accordingly, &#8220;anticipatory&#8221; declarations and orders were sought. On 7 June 2023, the day before the hearing (and also the day before Amira was due to give birth) the medical opinion on Amira&#8217;s capacity changed to assess her as lacking capacity in both spheres. The applicant trust accordingly reconstituted its application immediately prior to the hearing.</p>

The care plan sets out four options for delivery in order of preference for Amira, but reflecting the potential problems that can arise in any birth. The first option is a midwifery led water birth; the second is instrumental delivery (use of forceps, for example); the third is an emergency caesarean section in the operating theatre; the last is a combination of the first three options, starting with a low-risk birth pathway and resulting in an emergency caesarean section. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The trust also sought a reporting restrictions order given the exceptionally private and personal nature of a case which concerns serious medical treatment of Amira. After having undertaken an intensely focussed balancing exercise of Article 8 and Article 10 of the ECHR, I was satisfied that a reporting restrictions order should be made. The order was duly made on the day of the hearing. It prevents the identification of Amira or the treating physicians, or the hospitals where she has been and will be treated. It will  last until 31 December 2024 unless foreshortened or extended in the meantime.</p>

In his (second) witness statement made on 7 June 2023, and in his oral evidence given at the hearing, he explained that her mental state was stable until the 48-hour period immediately prior to the hearing. He had assessed Amira on the morning of 7 June 2023, and found her mental state to have deteriorated significantly, it now being characterised by anxiety, distress and paranoia. He explained that her paranoia was prominent; she was extremely distressed and was not engaging. When Dr A sought to discuss the trust&#8217;s care plan with her, she was unable to understand the information, let alone to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of the information. Dr A stated that he had spoken to Amira during that day, and that while he had not spoken with her that morning, the social worker had, and had reported to Dr A that Amira&#8217;s presentation had not changed.</p>

Ms Fox acting on behalf of Amira complained that the OS was placed at a considerable disadvantage because the trust had delayed in bringing their application and that the evidence in support was limited. Further, the delay meant that there was no time for the OS to commission a report from an independent psychiatrist. The supporting evidence, such as it was, was constituted by a witness statement made on 19 May 2023 by Amira&#8217;s treating psychiatrist Dr A to which he attached a short report dated 8 March 2023 which stated:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my opinion it is reasonable to suspect that changes in [redacted]&#8217;s medical condition, state of pregnancy, and the delivery, might well trigger a significant deterioration of her mental state.  She has a clear history of abruptly changing symptoms and resulting risk, including physical aggression, in the context of perceived stress.</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">During the initial phase of [redacted]&#8217;s current admission when her symptoms of psychosis were more severe her decision-making capacity surrounding her pregnancy was impaired.  During this phase she declined follow up with midwives and declined ultrasound scans.  This contrasts markedly with her more recent level of engagement with obstetric follow in the context of her improving mental health.</p>

		  </level>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Clearly, it will be necessary to evaluate [redacted]&#8217;s decision making capacity contemporaneously in relation to any future medial issue that might arise.  However, if her mental state worsens, based upon what is currently known about her psychiatric history, it is reasonable to conclude that her symptoms will significantly impair her capacity to understand information, impair her capacity to retain information, and impair her capacity to weigh-up information.  Additionally, relapses of her psychotic illness are characterised by severe communication difficulties and lengthy period of mutism.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Clearly, on the basis of that evidence, Amira did not lack capacity in either sphere on 8 March 2023 (the date of the report), or on 19 May 2023 (the date of the witess statement which identified no change since the date of the report), or on 26 May 2023 (the date of the trust&#8217;s application which likewise identified no change).</p>

Further, had the application been made in a timely manner, Amira would have had capacity to conduct litigation and would have been able to participate fully in these proceedings. That is true, but if the application had been made then, Amira would not have lacked capacity to make the decisions about her care and so there would not have been any valid issue for the Court of Protection to decide (as I explain below).</p>

It does not strain the wording of this provision, in any way, to extrapolate that it is apt to apply to circumstances which are foreseeable as well as to those which are current. There is no need at all to diverge from the plain language of the section. In making a declaration that is contingent upon a person losing capacity in the future, the Court is doing no more than emphasising that the anticipated relief will be lawful when and only when P becomes incapacitous. It is at that stage that the full protective regime of the MCA is activated, not before.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">That said, I would venture some observations. First, the making of contingent declarations will almost always be an interference with, or have the potential to interfere with, the Art 8 ECHR rights of the individual concerned to respect for their private and family life, including their autonomous decision making about what is done to them physically. That potential exists even where, as here, the contingent declaration made accords with, promotes, and facilitates the person&#8217;s current, capacitous decisions, and thus their autonomy. It exists even in those circumstances because, whether capacitous or incapacitous, people have the right to reconsider their positions and change their minds. Indeed, in an evolving healthcare situation, the changing clinical picture may require reconsideration of previously made decisions. Ideally, everyone should have access to the full range of options when the time comes to put into effect a decision about their private and family life but a contingent declaration or order, restricts that full range.&#160; It is for this reason that such relief should only be granted where it is necessary, justified and proportionate, and why the power to grant relief should be used sparingly, or only in exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

Provided that before doing the act D takes reasonable steps to establish whether P lacks capacity in relation to the matter in question, and when doing the act, D reasonably believes both that P lacks capacity in relation to the matter and that it will be in P's best interests for the act to be done, then D does not incur any liability in relation to the act that he would not have incurred if  P had capacity to consent in relation to the matter, and had consented to D's doing the act. If the act is to restrain P then, in addition, D must reasonably believe that it is necessary to do the act in order to prevent harm to P and that it is a proportionate response to the likelihood of P suffering harm, and to the seriousness of that harm. </p>

To be clear, it is my opinion (which is consistent with that of Mr Ruck Keene KC, as well as with the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Jirehouse Capital v Beller</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/908" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 908" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 908</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 WLR 751" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 WLR 751</ref>) that the question whether the court has &#8220;reason to believe that P lacks capacity&#8221; for the purposes of s.48 is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> &#8220;a question whether a person lacks capacity within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.&#8221;  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S.2(4)</ref> applies where the Court is determining substantively whether or not a person lacks capacity. Under s.48 the Court is doing something quite different, namely making a preliminary prediction, using the applicable degree of likelihood, whether in due course that finding will be made. The argument of Mr Neil Allen, as referred to in the commentary, appears to be that in order to satisfy the terms of s.48 (taken with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s,2(4)</ref>) the court has to make a finding along the lines of: &#8220;Although the evidence does not satisfy me today that it is more likely than not that P lacks capacity it does satisfy me that it is more likely than not that at a later date I will be so satisfied.&#8221; To me, that is internally contradictory and almost impossible to operate as a test.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If my construction is correct, this may well have the result, were capacity to be lost very shortly before the birthing process begins, that it would be very difficult in the short time available for an NHS Trust such as the applicant to obtain orders under ss.16(2)(a) and 4A(3) and (4) (or even an order under s.48 backed up by a High Court authorisation of deprivation of liberty) giving absolute, court-ordered, immunity. I recognise why, in a litigious world, trusts would want to have the gold standard of immunity. I also recognise just how challenging it is to prepare an application for such relief and to get it heard by a High Court judge at very short notice.</p>

This starting point is applicable here given the potential consequences of non-compliance or aggression during a vaginal delivery and the required antenatal care. Without appropriate management of the situation this has the potential to be life-threatening to both Joanna and her child. Dr A considers it very unlikely that Joanna will be able to comply with the care and interventions that may be needed. This could lead to an emergency caesarean section which carries a greater risk to Joanna and her child than a planned caesarean section.&#8221;</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being."</p>
