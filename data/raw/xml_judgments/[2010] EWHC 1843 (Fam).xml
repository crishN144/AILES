They are both nationals of Sweden and were both born and brought up there.  As well as their nationality, they retain other links with Sweden and jointly own two properties there; but they have both been habitually resident in England for about fifteen years.

It is not in issue that under Article 3 of the regulation jurisdiction to divorce these parties lies with the courts of both England and Wales and Sweden.  If, as has happened, proceedings relating to divorce are brought before the courts of both England and Wales and Sweden, the effect of Article 19 of the regulation, which I need not reproduce, is that the court first seised takes priority and the court second seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seised.  The overall issue at this hearing is, accordingly, was the court first seised the Principal Registry of the Family Division here in England and Wales or the Stockholms tingsr&#228;tt in Sweden.  I will, for convenience, call them respectively the &#8220;English court&#8221; and the &#8220;Swedish court&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Both England and Wales and Sweden have systems of issue-then-serve so sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 1 of the article is not directly in point, and it appears that there is no paragraph 2.  There is no doubt, and it is not in issue, that the wife lodged the relevant documents with the English court before the husband did with the Swedish court. So the argument in the present case turns upon application of the proviso in paragraph 1(a) of Article 16.  The husband says that the wife failed to take the steps she was required to take to have service  effected upon him because, although her documents were actually served upon him very promptly, they were, on two occasions, served on a Sunday. This raises the question whether it is permissible to serve a petition for divorce (and/or a later supplemental petition) in England on a Sunday and if not, what are the consequences of doing so.  The question: &#8220;can a petition for divorce be validly served on a Sunday?&#8221; is the simplest of questions and one might have thought that the answer would be clear-cut and part of the A, B, C of the law. Apparently it is not.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The reason why the issue arises is patently one of tactical manoeuvring by each of these parties in which, as I have been told today, they have now jointly invested around &#163;120,000 to &#163;130,000 in legal fees.  As such, a divorce in either England or Sweden would be just as effective and just as appropriate as a means of dissolving their marriage.  But each patently shares a common belief (whether correct or not) that the wife would receive greater financial provision if the divorce is here than if it is in Sweden. </span></p>

So, quite considerably more or less for the wife may be at stake.  Although both parties are each patently engaged in tactical manoeuvring, it is permissible to do so and each is perfectly entitled to seek to take advantage of the legal position as it now is in the events which have happened. </span></p>

The parties began living together in England, where they were both then working, in 1995.  They have lived and been habitually resident in England ever since. They married in Sweden in 1999.  Their two children were born in 2000 and 2002.  Sadly, the marriage became unhappy. In early 2008 the husband was receiving in-patient treatment in a clinic.  While the husband was at the clinic the wife issued a petition for divorce in the Principal Registry of the Family Division on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January, 2008.

The writer of the letter is extremely experienced and renowned in this field, and patently appreciated the significance and importance of the step at that time of service.  It was not intended to &#8220;hold the petition in secret and not serve it until it suited the petitioner&#8221; as referred to, and deprecated by, Mr. Justice Ewbank in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">R v R (Divorce: Stay of proceedings)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> [1994] 2FLR 1036 at p.1038f.</span></p>

The husband fully admits that he was served with all the required documents.

The wife could, alternatively, have applied under FPR Rule 2.6(4) for leave to present another, fresh petition, but it was entirely appropriate, and indeed the better practice, to update the pleadings and revive the suit after the period of resumed cohabitation by means of the supplemental petition.  To all intents and purposes she started again on Thursday, 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November, 2009 and it is upon that date that Mr. Lewis Marks, QC, on behalf of the wife, particularly relies, treating the supplemental petition as &#8220;an equivalent document&#8221; for the purposes of Article 16.1(a) of the regulation - an approach to which Mr. Valentine Le Grice, QC, on behalf of the husband, did not demur.  </span></p>

This tends to suggest that the solicitors were positively contemplating that service would be effected, or at any rate attempted, on that Sunday.  The reason was that the wife did not know the address at which the husband was then living, but knew that he would be coming to the family home on the Sunday to see the children.  Indeed, the process server, Kathleen Veronica King, clearly describes in her affidavit of service, dated 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November, 2009 that she was specifically instructed by the solicitors to attend at the former matrimonial home between 2130 and 2200 hours on that Sunday.

Patently, for so long as it remained in force, nearly three hundred years, this provision rendered service of a petition on a Sunday &#8220;void to all intents and purposes whatsoever&#8221;.  It was repealed in 1969.  At that time new rules were added to the RSC 1965 and between then and the advent of the reforming Civil Procedure Rules in April 1999 both the RSC 1965 and the CCR 1936 and 1981 contained a general prohibition (with an exception in relation to admiralty matters) against the service of &#8220;process&#8221; on a Sunday, and in the case of the County Court Rules, Good Friday or Christmas Day.  The Matrimonial Causes Rules (MCR) 1977 provided that subject to the provisions of those rules and of any enactment the CCR and the RSC should apply, with the necessary modifications, to matrimonial proceedings.  The MCR 1977 were replaced in 1991 by the FPR 1991.  At that time the later CPR had not come into existence and the general rules in force were still the RSC 1965 and the CCR 1981.

He submits that FPR rule 2.9 is intended to be, and is, a comprehensive code on the topic of service of petitions and that its effect is to exclude reference back to the CCR or RSC on any issue as to service; and specifically on the issue as to service on a Sunday.  He submits, in short, that if the makers of the FPR had intended that service on a Sunday should be prohibited (save in a case of urgency, with leave), they would have said so, either expressly or by an express incorporation of RSC O65r10 and CCR O7r3.  He points to, and relies in particular on, FPR 2.9(10) which does expressly incorporate CCR O7r8 into the FPR by reference, and he says that the rule makers could, and would, have made a similar express reference to CCR O7r3 if they had intended it to apply.  Mr. Marks also relies upon the comments of the editors of the White Book at RSC 65/4/24 as indicating, he submits, their view that service in matrimonial causes is the subject exclusively of the FPR and not at all of the RSC.  More generally, Mr. Marks says that it is an archaic anomaly with no policy or other justification that petitions or other initiating family process still cannot be served on a Sunday when, since 1999, any other civil proceedings can be.</span></p>

I must do so as a matter of the construction of, and application of, the relevant rules which I have quoted, considered in the context in which they were made.  Save where the rules themselves are deliberately flexible, black letter rules of court do not have the same inherent flexibility as, for instance, the European Convention on Human Rights which has been described as a living instrument whose meaning and effect can evolve to accommodate changing social conditions.  There has been no relevant change in the wording of any of the relevant rules since 1991 and the answer to the question: is service of a petition on a Sunday prohibited (except in a case of urgency, with leave)? must be the same today as it was in 1991.  The fact that in 1999 the position changed for all other civil proceedings cannot change the position for family proceedings, precisely because the FPR continued to apply the former CCR and RSC and not the reforming CPR.  So, the question is: what did the FPR intend and require in 1991?</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I have been unable to discern, nor have either leading counsel suggested, any policy reason why there should be a different rule as to the service of petitions than as to the service of any other initiating civil process.  In contrast, there are obvious policy reasons for the special rule in divorce that in no case shall the petitioner himself effect personal service.  So, just as Mr. Marks submits that it is archaic, and now anomalous, if family process alone amongst initiating process cannot be served on a Sunday; so also it seems to me that it would have been anomalous if, in 1991, family process was exempted from the then general rule UNLESS the makers of the FPR were deliberately taking the opportunity to modernise the general prohibition or restriction on service on a Sunday.  As it happens, I was, as Mr. Marks has pointed out, one of the makers of, and signatories to, the FPR 1991.   But I make clear that I actually have no personal recollection whatsoever whether there was any discussion at all about service on a Sunday, and in any event I could not judicially rely on any such subjective recollection even if I had one.  I do remember, much more generally, that the pressing task of the committee at that time was to decide the policy for, and to draft, all the many rules necessary to implement the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  It is my general recollection that the rules in relation to divorce were largely reproduced unchanged from the MCR 1977, there being simply no time to tackle the larger project (still not achieved) of modernisation of procedure in divorce.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Marks submits that FPR rule 2.9 is a complete code as to service, but if that is so it was not a new code.  If FPR Rule 2.9 is compared with rule 14 of the MCR 1977 it can be seen that the later rule simply reproduces the earlier rule almost verbatim.  There is nothing new about it at all in 1991.  So, one then has to turn back to the position as it was when the MCR were made in 1977.  The general rule then was to prohibit, or restrict, service on a Sunday.  Indeed, the RSC 1965 had only relatively recently been amended to that effect following the repeal in 1969 of section 6 of the Sunday Observance Act 1667.  It seems to me that if the rule makers in 1977 intended to displace that general rule in relation to divorce or matrimonial proceedings generally, they would have done so expressly by an express rule to that effect, or a rule expressly disapplying the then relevant rules of the RSC and CCR.  They did not do so.  It seems to me quite clear, as the editors of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Rayden</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> at that time thought, that the prohibition continued to apply between 1977 and 1991.  In 1991 the prohibition was still the general rule in civil proceedings.  It again seems to me that if the rule makers in 1991 thought about the point at all, and if they intended to disapply the general rule, they would have done so expressly.  It is only really in and from 1999, and the advent of the CPR, that the continued application of the rule to family proceedings appears so archaic and anomalous. But, as there has been no relevant change to the relevant rules for family proceedings in or since 1999, that cannot now change the position as it emerged on implementation of the FPR in 1991.  </span></p>

Service on a Sunday was indeed merely an irregularity, done in good faith and, on the first occasion, with the good intention of avoiding the documents being sent by post to the clinic or, perhaps even worse, being formally served there by a process server.  On the second occasion - Sunday, 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November, 2009 - the process server might, and indeed should, have followed the husband to his destination and delayed service until immediately after midnight.

These types of case ought to be a one-hour and not (as was estimated and allowed) a three-day hearing, although a significant part of the time in the present case related to the discrete Sunday service point.
