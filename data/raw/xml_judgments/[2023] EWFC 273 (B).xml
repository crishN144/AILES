The parties separated finally in 2018 although they are at issue as to whether or not there was any effective reconciliation after 2013 when the divorce petition itself was issued. The applicant wife presents a case that the parties effectively reconciled and that the final separation was in October 2018. The respondent husband disputes this and says that although he did not leave the former matrimonial home until October 2018 the parties were not living as man and wife. </p>

It had become evident that his VW van had been transferred to his new partner&#8217;s father in return for payment of the loan upon it. He further argued that his Mustang car effectively belonged to his partner&#8217;s sister D by virtue of her having made the balloon payment on the PCP agreement relating to it.  I was of the view that neither party could afford a further hearing and that we ought to effectively treat the matter as a final hearing on proportionality grounds. That was how the matter progressed. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0.09in">It has been common ground that the former matrimonial home, is a  matrimonial asset ,albeit held in the husband&#8217;s sole name.  The wife continues to live there with M and with her granddaughter who is currently at college but who hopes to be working shortly and the wife is therefore hopeful that the granddaughter will be able to contribute something towards the home expenditure. The value was earlier recorded as agreed at &#163;220,000 although the husband has sought to argue that it is potentially worth more whilst the wife has argued that in fact its value may have reduced and it may be more realistically in the region of &#163;215,000. The property is subject to a mortgage with the Halifax which remains outstanding in the sum of approximately &#163;147,417. It is accepted that the husband has not paid the mortgage since January 2019 and the wife gave evidence to the effect that she was advised not to pay the mortgage by the Halifax because she would effectively be taking on responsibility for the husband&#8217;s debt. It is the wife&#8217;s case that the Halifax have been sympathetic to her predicament and that they are minded to provide her with mortgage facilities if she is able to secure a transfer of the property to her sole name. The husband seeks to assert that she cannot afford to live in the property and that the property will have to be sold although he has indicated via offers that he is prepared to cede his interest in the equity. On the figures given, dependent on whether the court accepts the Husband&#8217;s value of &#163;240 or the figure of &#163;220,000 after mortgage there is equity of around &#163;85,983 or, alternatively, a lesser sum of &#163;65,983</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0.09in">During the course of the time that the parties technically remained married, the husband received a large inheritance from a woman treated as an aunt in the sum of approximately &#163;244,847.62. The total estate was shared equally with his brother C. That the husband received this sum (244,847.62) is not in dispute &#8211; he accepted it himself. There is also no argument that &#163;116,382 was used to purchase the property next to the former matrimonial home which the husband apparently wished to purchase to be able to control who lived next door. But the exact amount of the inheritance is disputed by the wife who has argued that a property which formed part of the aunt&#8217;s estate and was sold, effectively realised the husband and his brother an extra 60 to 70,000 each. </p>

In fact, this was not however the case. The property was placed in the sole name of the husband. It was rented to the wife&#8217;s daughter under a formal tenancy agreement with rental paid by the local authority. They inhabited the property for some two years until the respondent served them with notice in approximately August 2018, having decided that he was going to move away to Essex, telling them that he needed the money and the house needed to be sold. </p>

A sum of &#163;80,000 was paid to 2 people, one being a man called G and the other being a woman called A, who was, in fact, a relative of his partner S. He claims that the payment of these loan sharks was managed by his partner&#8217;s uncle who &#8216;knew how to deal with these people&#8217; and with the assistance of his partner S, who transferred money on his behalf to assist him. The Skoda vehicle was returned on the expiry of the lease in January 2021 and the VW van was transferred to his partner&#8217;s father. The father, T was repaid in return for him having allegedly cleared the finance debt on the same vehicle. This was a sum of &#163;16,027. The husband also claims to have repaid a credit card debt to Prime Credit of &#163;7789 and a further sum of &#163;7703 to MasterCard and finally a sum of &#163;15,845 to his brother C for a &#163;16,000 loan</p>

However, Miss Khalique, for the wife, was clear that this was not the basis on which she argued the wife&#8217;s case. Instead, the wife&#8217;s position was that there had been a clear and deliberate dissipation of assets held by the husband and he should therefore be held to account. </p>

However, in this case, the wife did have a number of telling documents to refer to, not least the bank statements showing transfers between the husband and his new partner, S, particularly those which followed immediately upon the husband leaving the former matrimonial home in October 2018 and later transactions of 2021. </p>

I suspect that she simply did not appreciate the significance of some issues until after the event, when it was effectively too late to remedy the situation. She did not present as a sophisticated woman who was canny in her financial management and grasp of financial matters. She gave an account of the husband is being controlling as to financial matters during the marriage and not having access to his accounts. In terms of the length of the relationship, the wife was adamant that the letter from her solicitors which the Husband&#8217;s counsel read to her dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2023 was incorrect in stating that the relationship ended in 2009. She described the husband is working in [redacted] and returning to [redacted] for the weekends. Between 2009 and 2013 she was clear he was under the same roof and they were attending marriage guidance. The husband&#8217;s counsel queried the tax credits claim the wife clearly made during this period on the basis that it supported the husband&#8217;s claim that the parties had separated. The wife was clear that, as she put it, she was &#8216; not allowed &#8216;to stop claiming these benefits because the husband had told her his business interests were&#8217; going down the Swanee&#8217; </p>

She na&#239;vely accepted his indication that he would go to see solicitors, taking this promise at face value.

The exact amount was unclear but on his own admission the husband received a sum of &#163;244,847.62, as set out at page 268 of the Main Bundle. The wife sought to assert that the true figure was in fact much higher due to sale of the aunt&#8217;s property but it was apparent we did not have full estate accounts.

The father gave evidence of having paid &#163;20,000 to buy the husband &#8216;breathing space&#8217; and explained his ability to access the sort of money is arising because he is a car dealer by occupation and has access to cash. He apparently did this for a man he had known at that stage for only a very short period of time and whose financial affairs were not known in detail to him. The payment was allegedly made after a visit from a couple of loan sharks who arrived in early about October 2018. The father of the husband's new partner did not involve the police, as most of us would have done, but instead chose to turn to his brother for assistance &#8211; a man who would apparently know how to deal with it because it emerged upon the questioning I myself put to the husband, that the brother was himself a loan shark.</p>

The husband and indeed T asked the court to believe the story. We know a sum of &#163;16,027.02 was paid on 17 October 2018 as it features on the bank statements to S's account in the bundle 372. The husband and T asked the court to believe that this was T&#8217;s money and not the husbands. Set against the history of this matter this is a difficult account to accept.</p>

This account is quite incredible &#8211; not to mention unbelievable. It is clear that these transactions were made immediately after the husband had fled the former matrimonial home in [redacted] with the sole aim of defeating financial claims made by the wife. S could not give any corroborative detail in relation to the debts allegedly being cleared on the husbands behalf. She claimed no knowledge of G but apparently transferred a sum of &#163;50,000 to him without question because her uncle (the loan shark) asked her to. </p>

His account of being &#8216;in financial bother&#8217;, transferring money to S in October 2018 because she had offered to help him sort it out was not credible. The communication from M, the party&#8217;s son, in questioning the husband, &#8216;Why did you take all the money?&#8217; is telling- the husband knew full well that the wife was expecting a &#189; share. He had intermingled the money from the inheritance by spending on both cars and holidays, issues he himself did not dispute. To reiterate, I am entirely satisfied it is proper to regard the inheritance as part of the matrimonial assets set against this background. Further, I am satisfied that when he left in October 2018, the husband planned his move with the specific intent to defeat claims made by the wife. Honest, well meaning people do not leave in the early hours without discussion of their plans. </p>

This case is essentially a&#8217; needs&#8217; case. The wife who is 55 has various health issues. She suffers from Fibromyalgia, Inflammatory Arthritis, PTSD, anxiety and social phobia. She gave evidence to the court that adaptations had been made to the former matrimonial home to accommodate her needs. She is in receipt of benefits comprising ESA and PIP and will probably not work again. Her income from all sources is in the region of &#163;18,000pa. She has had care of M, the couple&#8217;s son, since the husband and left in October 2018 albeit that he is no longer of a minority age but he is still in education. She needs a roof over her head. She is currently still in receipt of back payment of arrears relating to the husband&#8217;s no payment of child maintenance. The stress of this case contributed to the death of her older son by suicide in 2019.  </p>
