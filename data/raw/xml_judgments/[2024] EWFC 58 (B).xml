		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The relevant agreement or consent can be inferred or can arise by implication. However, care is needed in deciding whether such inference or implication is appropriate. When the court infers such an agreement it is making a finding of fact and holding that the evidence is such that the parties must have made such an agreement either expressly or by their actions notwithstanding a current contention to the contrary. There is to be an implication that a particular item of property has become a partnership asset where there is a partnership formed by agreement and the bringing in of the asset is implied as a term of that agreement by application of the normal rules for the implication of terms. This approach was exemplified by the approach of Harman J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miles v Clarke <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1953] 1 WLR 587" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1953">[1953] 1 WLR 587</ref></span>. Harman J had to determine whether the lease of premises from which a partnership operated a photography business was an asset of the partnership and he set out the approach to be adopted thus (at 540): &#8220;In my judgment no more agreement between the parties should be inferred than absolutely necessary to give business efficacy to that which has happened, and that is the only safe way to proceed.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;In the circumstances of farm land being used by a farming partnership as happened in this case it is not normally necessary for business efficacy to imply a term that the farm land is a partnership asset. In my judgement there is no such need in this case as the partnership could operate entirely effectively on the footing that Ben Wild retained ownership of the Farm. That is an arrangement which is adopted, as HH Judge McCahill QC pointed out, in a considerable number of farming businesses. The question then becomes one of whether an agreement to that effect is to be inferred. In this case this means that I must consider whether I am to conclude from the circumstances taken in the round that Ben Wild intentionally brought the Farm into the partnership with the First Defendant agreeing to that or at least accepting that the Farm was being or had been brought into the partnership. This is a matter not of implication but of inference.&#8221;</p>

In many cases, once the equity is established, then the fulfilment of the promise is likely to be the starting point, although considerations of practicality, justice between the parties and fairness to third parties may call for a reduced or different award. And justice between the parties may be affected if the remedy is out of all proportion to the reliant detriment, if that can easily be identified without recourse to minute mathematical calculation, and proper regard is had to non-monetary harm.&#8221;</p>
