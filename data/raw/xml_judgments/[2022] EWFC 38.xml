These were unusual applications without apparent precedent.  I contacted the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to enquire whether she would be prepared to appoint an advocate to the court. She did so, and I am grateful to Mr Murray for his written advice.  At an earlier case management hearing I also advised Ms L and Ms M of the existence of &#8216;<span style="color:#333333;background-color:#FFFFFF">Advocate&#8217; (formerly Bar Pro Bono Unit), the charity which helps to find free legal assistance from volunteer barristers</span>.  Through this, Ms M obtained the services of Ms Fottrell QC and Ms Magennis; in turn, Ms M was supported by Ms Dally of Goodman Ray.  That expert legal team then offered similar support to Ms L.  I am particularly grateful to the lawyers (all counsel and solicitors) for the applicants who have acted for them most ably, and without fee.</p>

His estate has not yet been distributed.  Ms T has been served with notice of the hearing, but has not attended.  Ms L&#8217;s adoptive parents are both deceased; they would otherwise have been automatic respondents to the application.  I considered, but regarded as unnecessary, the joinder of PJ&#8217;s known children; for reasons which I do not need to discuss here, they did not have any contact with PJ or other members of his family since the early 1970s.</p>

I do not think that she will want to be involved and there is a real risk that by serving her with notice I have made this application will just make her shut down and I fear that  my relationship with her will be severed by her.   When my mother fell pregnant with me, she told no one.  She did not tell her parents or her friends.   She had me in secret and when she signed the paperwork for the adoption in 1964 giving me up for adoption, I do not doubt that she thought that was forever.   The world has changed, but I believe that my birth mother is entitled to her own space, privacy, freedom and anonymity &#8230; if this court were to write to her, I do not think that she would engage in these proceedings and I know that to take this step would emphatically mean the end of our very fragile relationship &#8230;  I still want to retain, where possible, some semblance of relationship with my birth mother.  My mother&#8217;s name is not being removed from the birth certificate.  The application I am making is about my father and I.  It will not affect her status on my birth registration.&#8221;   </p>

In reaching this conclusion I exercised the wide discretion afforded to me to regulate this legal process &#8211; this power entitles me to exclude parties from hearings, to withhold information from parties, to discharge parties from the proceedings, and to dispense with the rules altogether. These powers can be, and often are, exercised in accordance with the overriding objective provided that they cohere with the principles of law and justice which have been developed and recognised both at common law and under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref></span>.

They quickly established a mutual acceptance of their probable biological link, and PJ&#8217;s family welcomed Ms L into their family.  Ms L became close with the family, and they remain so.   Unexpectedly, PJ died in 2020.  He died intestate; his sister, Ms T, who I joined as a respondent to this application (as mentioned above), is administering his affairs.</p>

PJ&#8217;s maternal grandfather (Ms L&#8217;s great grandfather) was Italian; his family had emigrated from Italy to the North East of England in 1896 and had a large family of ten children. Through researching the family tree, PJ made many connections around the world with the Italian side of the family. PJ published a family history document for the benefit of the Italian family; materially, following his introduction to Ms L, he named Ms L and her children in the publication as members of his own family.  It is no great surprise that Ms L has been able to identify very strong personal character traits in herself which she recognises that she shares with members of PJ&#8217;s Italian family.   It is unlikely to be a coincidence that in her chosen career, she has been drawn in many different ways to Italy.</p>

Her birth mother was a young woman from an aristocratic family in her early 20s, and was unmarried; it is believed that no one in the birth mother&#8217;s family knew at the time of the pregnancy, the birth of the baby, and/or the subsequent adoption.  Within two months of her birth, Ms M was placed with substitute parents, and was adopted by them in the spring of the following year.  Both of Ms M&#8217;s adoptive parents are now in fact deceased.

The Applicant engaged private investigators and tried various other routes to trace her birth father, to no avail. The breakthrough came when Ms M submitted DNA results to a number of genealogy websites searching for matches. In 2020, Ms M was notified that there was indeed a match who could be either a nephew or a half-brother. The man (in fact later identified as a half-brother) named his father on his family tree as &#8216;BE&#8217;. After further online searches Ms M found a number of other members of the wider family who were identified as cousins and siblings; they were all quick to accept that Ms M is indeed a member of their family.   Ms M was however &#8220;devastated&#8221; to discover that the man for whom she had been searching for so many years had in fact died in 2010.</p>

It transpired that BH had married a woman in 1965 (three months after Ms M&#8217;s birth); fortuitously, his marriage certificate recorded his address at the time. Significantly this is/was the same address held on the Barnardo&#8217;s adoption file for BH, the man identified in that documentation as Ms M&#8217;s birth father.  It now appears that BH had altogether 11 children from a number of different relationships.  Ms M has now discovered a great deal about BH &#8211; he was a brilliant academic, fluent in many languages, a womaniser, an alcoholic, and a gambler; he was also said to be a charming man with &#8220;a big heart&#8221;.</p>

This DNA test confirmed to a very high degree of probability indeed that the deceased (BH) is her birth father.

The effect of an adoption order is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">to extinguish any parental responsibility of the natural parents</span>. Once an adoption order has been made, the adoptive parents stand to one another and the child in precisely the same relationship as if they were his legitimate parents, and the child stands in the same relationship to them as to legitimate parents. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Once an adoption order has been made the adopted child ceases to be the child of his previous parent and becomes the child for all purposes of the adopters as though he were their legitimate child</span>.&#8221; (My emphasis by underlining).</p>

The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person.

It is worthwhile picking apart what we mean by &#8216;natural parent&#8217; in this context. There is a difference between natural and legal parents. Thus, the father of a child born to unmarried parents was not legally a &#8216;parent&#8217; until the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref></span> but he was always a natural parent. The anonymous donor who donates his sperm or her egg under the terms of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref></span> is the natural progenitor of the child but not his legal parent: see the <span style="font-style:italic">1990 Act</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">sections 27</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">28</span>. The husband or unmarried partner of a mother who gives birth as a result of donor insemination in a licensed clinic in this country is for virtually all purposes a legal parent, but may not be any kind of natural parent: see the <span style="font-style:italic">1990 Act, section 28</span> . To be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that person's family, but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the child's welfare&#8221;. </p>

There would be a coherent case to suggest in particular that an entitlement to share nationality with other members of one&#8217;s family (as is the case both for H and C) is part of one&#8217;s private and family life and therefore it is likely to be entitled to protection under the convention.&#8221;</p>

The original birth certificates will again be annotated with the reference to the fact that the subject child (in each case the applicant) was indeed adopted.
