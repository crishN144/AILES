	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">An issue arises in private law proceedings concerning B who is three years old. A fact finding hearing has to take place. One of the many serious allegations made by the mother is that she was raped by the father in 2010. The allegation of rape would be central to the fact finding hearing and so a court conducting that hearing would have to decide whether the alleged rape took place. The Father denies that it did. That allegation is not the subject of criminal proceedings.</p>

This judgment was given on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014 with the intention that it should be referred to the Legal Aid Agency. I invited them to reconsider the father&#8217;s application for legal aid as a matter of urgency. At the most recent hearing on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March I was told that the application had been reconsidered and had been rejected again.

It is no part of the roles of the Guardian or of the children&#8217;s solicitor to adopt the case of one party in cross examination or argument. After the fact finding case is resolved it is essential that both parties retain confidence in the guardian and in the institution of CAFCASS.
