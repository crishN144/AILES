	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">This is A&#8217;s, to whom I will refer as the applicant, application made pursuant to part 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>&#8221;).  The respondent is B.  The proceedings are limited to the disposition of the proceeds of sale of a property known as &#8220;the property&#8221;, a property that at all material times was registered in the respondent&#8217;s sole name.  The applicant is represented before me by Mr Barnett-Thoung-Holland and the respondent by Mr Tyzack, both of counsel.  I am very grateful to them both for their assistance in this matter.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Notwithstanding the relatively limited remit or scope of the proceedings this case has already been subject to six hearings, excluding this one, one of which was an appeal hearing before Moor&#160;J.  His view, expressed in the final paragraph of his judgment, was that he wished to achieve a final conclusion with a minimum of extra cost and dispute.  Nearly 14 months later that has proved to be a forlorn hope.  Despite Moor&#160;J&#8217;s directions both parties applied to the court for, in effect, further directions following an unsuccessful FDR.  That delayed the proceedings by some two to three months.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">The total costs incurred to date, at indemnity rates are &#163;403,228.  The net proceeds of sale of the property are &#163;1,216,339 after allowing the respondent the costs expended by him in preparing the property for sale.  This is typical of the way the parties have conducted themselves in the divorce and financial remedy proceedings in New Zealand, where, I am told, costs of approximately NZ$2 million have been expended.  It does not take a genius to calculate, taking those two sets of court costs into account, how very much better off both these parties would have been had they behaved in a more proportionate manner.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">The applicant is 48, she was born in New Zealand, while the respondent, aged 61, was born in England.  They met in Manchester in 2000 where the applicant was working as a nurse and the respondent was a surgeon.  On a date somewhere between September 2004 and January 2005 both parties began cohabiting in the property which the respondent had been given by his father in 1994.  The parties married in New Zealand in 2006 but continued to live in England in the property until August 2007.  At that point they moved to rental accommodation while substantial works were carried out to the property.  These were funded by the respondent&#8217;s father&#8217;s estate and loans from his mother.  The parties returned to the property in August 2009 although it appears the works had not been completed.  They did not remain for long but emigrated to New Zealand in December 2009 where they have remained.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">The marriage broke down in 2011 and the parties separated on 25 May of that year.  It appears that they have been in hostile litigation ever since.  This hearing is only the latest bout as I am told that there are going to be further, what we would call, Children Act proceedings in New Zealand.  These parties have two children now aged 15 and 14.  Sadly, as Moor&#160;J observed their parents&#8217; conduct has done untold damage to their children.  As I have said they have litigated about the divorce, the financial arrangements and their children.  See the judgment of Moor&#160;J for further details.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">In February 2015, in New Zealand, Judge Rydall made a final order on the applicant&#8217;s maintenance claims in the sum of NZ$433,000.  Whenever I refer to dollars they are always New Zealand Dollars.  This represented four years of maintenance at approximately NZ$8,500 per month, capitalised.  On appeal, appeals having been lodged by both parties, the sum was reduced to NZ$383,000.  An attempt at a second appeal was, in my view, mercifully refused.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Separately, and it seems largely consecutively, the parties also litigated about what is called &#8216;relationship property&#8217; and, concurrently about the children.  In the relationship property case, the judge held that she had no jurisdiction to make orders directed at real property in England but nonetheless ordered that the applicant be liable for 50% of the debt owed to the respondent&#8217;s mother in relation to the loans for the extension and renovation of the property.  This debt was NZ$1.2 million.  The net result was that the applicant was in debt to the respondent in the sum of NZ$433,040.  The judge noted that while this may appear to be unfair the remedy lay elsewhere, ie, in the English courts.  There was an appeal and on that appeal the debt was reduced by a small amount to NZ$397,000.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Later the respondent instituted bankruptcy proceedings against the applicant in relation to the NZ$397,000 debt.  As Moor&#160;J observed at paragraph 13 of his judgment, this left the applicant with little choice but to bring proceedings in England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">It took three hearings to get a resolution of the permission stage, the last being the appeal before Moor&#160;J on 13 April 2022, some 17 months after issue of the application.  Moor&#160;J allowed the appeal and granted permission to make the claim.  It has taken over a year for the final hearing to get before me because of the parties&#8217; disputes about directions and disclosure.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">His Honour Judge Lewis directed Forms E without attached disclosure and refused to permit questionnaires on the ground that the parties appeared to be incapable of acting proportionately.  This observation, echoing Moor&#160;J&#8217;s comments, was further borne out by the parties&#8217; lodging, without permission and contrary to the order of Deputy District Judge Hodson of 22 December 2022, a bundle of 691 pages and a second bundle of 262 pages, 953 in total.  I refused an application for permission to rely on those bundles largely because it appeared to be an attempt to circumvent Moor&#160;J&#8217;s clear directions following the appeal and because I was not inclined to allow the parties to rehash the New Zealand litigation.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">A shorter bundle of 383 pages was lodged although I did allow the applicant to rely on an additional 12 pages of materials from the initial long bundle.  Further the respondent was allowed to adduce the property particulars relied upon by the applicant when she made her initial application as she said in oral evidence that she could not remember what they were and did not accept counsel&#8217;s representations as to what they were.  Unsurprisingly, in my view, I had ample evidence in the 400 to 410 pages before me.</p>

This is calculated as follows: &#163;650,000 as at 9 February 2023 reduced by &#163;100,000 in relation to his legal costs incurred since the date of the February offer, a waiver of the New Zealand relationship debt which now stands at &#163;204,843 including interest, he will pay the children&#8217;s school fees for the rest of their secondary education, he will pay the costs of the appeal and below as ordered out of &#163;76,298 held by his solicitors.</p>

It is said that the court must take account of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>, section 18(2) and section 18(3) when coming to its decision because none of those sections independently contain an exhaustive list of the relevant matters.  The Court noted that all the circumstances of the case are also relevant as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  It said that the matters in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> may be relevant to those in section 18 and vice versa.  Compliance with or enforceability of any foreign award is also a relevant matter, section 18(6).</p>

The applicant was at times emotional.  I do not criticise her for that.  Her statements were on occasion, however, extravagant, without factual basis and sometimes plainly wrong.  Her tendency to exaggerate means I have difficulty in accepting much of what she says particularly when it is not supported by her own independent documentary evidence. Ms JA is in her 70s and clearly struggled with tiredness.  All the witnesses are in New Zealand where the time the hearing started was for them 10&#160;pm at night.</p>

The respondent was born here and lived here until 2009.  He is a British citizen.  The applicant came to the United Kingdom in approximately 2000 and lived here until her return to New Zealand and 2009.  She too is a British citizen.  They lived together in the United Kingdom for at least five years, some of that time in the property.  The property was retained for 12 years after the move to New Zealand and sold only during the course of this litigation.  Both their children were born in this country.  Now there is a greater connection with New Zealand.  They have lived there since December 2009.  The respondent works there and has done so at all material times.  The children are settled there.  All the property, save for the proceeds of sale of the property, is in New Zealand.  They are both citizens of New Zealand and neither is evincing any intention to move elsewhere.  But for the property they would not be litigating in this country.  There is no connection known to me with any other country.</p>

My first consideration, of course, is the welfare of the parties&#8217; two minor children while they are minors.  It is common ground that the applicant has no income and little or nothing by way of assets.  She is a discretionary beneficiary of the A Family Trust set up by her father and mother while her father was still alive.  The assets in that trust are Ms JA&#8217;s home and cash of a little under NZ$1.17 million.  Ms JA is also a beneficiary of this trust.  It has never paid out anything to the applicant although it did distribute a piece of land to one of her siblings.  The applicant has not worked, as far as I can tell, since her move to New Zealand, although the New Zealand court obviously envisaged a return to work by February 2019 as that is when the maintenance, had it been paid monthly, would have expired.  She is in receipt of state benefits and child support from the respondent.  This appears to be paid in some way via the government.</p>

She gave two reasons for not proceeding; she felt she needed tax advice because the role would be self-employed and this involves complex paperwork.  Secondly, she said she had no time because of the respondent&#8217;s appeals, directions conferences and Children Act proceedings.  Given the training sessions were for four hours each either once a fortnight or once a month (the applicant could not recall) this does not seem to me to be a reasonable excuse for dropping training.  I have no evidence as to the complexity of paperwork in being self-employed but, by comparison with this country, it is not so complex that it would prevent a person from taking up self-employed work.</p>

The home in which he lives is worth somewhere between &#163;1.2 and &#163;1.7 million but is held in a trust which will eventually benefit his children.  The house will certainly meet his own housing need throughout his life.  He may or may not have a life plan worth &#163;132,000, there was a dispute about that, but it was not explored in the evidence.  Fortunately, it is not necessary for me to make a finding on the point.</p>

It also seems to me that whatever standard of housing is provided to the applicant in these proceedings it will not result in an unacceptable differential between the parents.  There is frequently a differential in accommodation following a divorce.  The applicant is 49, the respondent 61 and the marriage lasted approximately 10 years, possibly a little over.

The medical evidence I have does not support this.  The most recent letter from her general practitioner is dated 27 February 2023.  It was not, in fact, prepared in relation to her housing needs but in relation to her ability to work at present.  That letter states that the applicant has a recurrent L5-S1 disc prolapse with radiculopathy in both legs.  Her treatment for this is covered by the ACC therefore she is not treated publicly.  The ACC is a no-fault compensation scheme in New Zealand which pays for all consequences of accidents.  At paragraph 7 of the letter it says that, &#8220;Following three operations the applicant&#8217;s spine has become stable although she continues to suffer pain, numbing et cetera in her legs&#8221;.  She has since then seen a pain specialist, but she told me they declined to administer an epidural as a recent incident requires further consideration by a back specialist, the appointment for which is in August.  There is no medical evidence that the applicant&#8217;s back has become unstable.  The appointment with the pain specialist had been arranged by 27 February therefore it was unrelated to any subsequent incidents.  The applicant herself is the only person who says her back is unstable.</p>

The treatment for her right shoulder is pain relief and that condition should improve over time.  There is a potential treatment which is an injection of platelet rich plasma.  This is not available either through the ACC or through public health and I agree with the respondent that this is likely to be because the evidence that such an injection is beneficial is not yet established.  The treatment for the applicant&#8217;s left shoulder is ibuprofen and paracetamol and possibly a steroid injection.

When asked about them the applicant&#8217;s reasons for dismissing them were on occasion, I am afraid to say, absurd or lacking in any proper foundation.  One property was dismissed on the basis that the colour scheme was too grey.  A second was dismissed on the basis that it probably was not double glazed and probably suffered from damp and mould.  The applicant made no attempt to view any of the properties or make any enquiries and had no proper basis for her comments.  I have had as good an opportunity as she has to view the photographs on which she bases her view and, in my judgment, one cannot possibly tell whether the windows are double or single glazed or form a conclusion that the property is likely to be damp or mouldy.</p>

It is on the same street as one of the properties she herself had put forward in 2020, King Street.  While her selection was number 72 and the respondent&#8217;s was number 105, it does not seem to me that the distance between them can be that great, certainly not such that it is too dangerous to be in the one and not in the other.  I also accept the respondent&#8217;s evidence that he would not put forward properties which would place his children at risk.  In my judgment, this is more hyperbole by the applicant.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Considering all these matters it seems to me that housing of the type put forward by the applicant in 2020 is still suitable for her.  If I apply the increase in the property market to the average value of her chosen 2020 properties, and Mr Tyzack helpfully provided me with a schedule of all the calculations, I arrive at a figure of NZ$1,062,380.  This is higher than the average of the properties put forward by the respondent in 2023 but he was prepared to accept that the applicant&#8217;s 2020 properties were appropriate for her up until April 2023 and I cannot see what has changed.  Further the respondent&#8217;s properties include three Hamilton properties and Hamilton is slightly cheaper on average than Cambridge which brings his average down.  The average of the applicant&#8217;s properties increased in value by the increase in the property market means she requires a housing purchase fund of &#163;510,000 in round terms.  To this figure must be added the costs of the purchase, the costs of the move which it appears to be common ground is something of the order of &#163;1,750 in round terms.</p>

The photographs she provided of her current home do not show the full extent of the photographed rooms and they do not show all the rooms in the property.  It would, however, be disproportionate for me to make findings about whether the applicant has three or five sofas.  It seems to me to be likely that the applicant will need some funds for curtaining, lighting et cetera and is likely to need some new furniture.  &#163;5,000 seems to me to be on the low side.  Doing the best I can on the limited evidence available to me, it seems to me that a figure of &#163;10,000, or NZ$20,000, is likely to cover all necessary, as opposed to desirable, items for a new home.  When added to her current furniture she should have adequate furniture.  Accordingly, a reasonable housing fund is &#163;521,750 being property at &#163;510,000, costs of purchase move at &#163;1,750 and furnishings at &#163;10,000.</p>

It is suggested that the necessary sum is &#163;40,000.  The evidence in support appears to be a letter from a private clinic offering angiograms and angioplasty and what might be described as minor corrective treatment.  The open offer states that, and I quote, &#8220;Without this recommended private cardiac surgery our client is at risk of dying from a heart attack at any time&#8221;.  This statement is not consistent with the medical evidence of the GP.  He says that the applicant&#8217;s coronary artery disease is being managed by optimisation of antianginal therapy and management of risk factors through aspirin, metoprolol and atorvastatin.  The condition is mild to moderate and slowly progressive.  Whether intervention by stent or by bypass will be necessary in the future will require investigation.  It is clear that the applicant has not yet been referred for such investigation.  The applicant said there was no equivalent of the NHS in New Zealand while accepting that there was some public health service.  So, she told me, if she had a heart attack she will be taken to accident and emergency but will not be given a stent even if she requires it.</p>

Given that position I cannot accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence in respect of her heart condition or the availability of treatment for it.  I accept that waiting lists may be long but acute cases are treated earlier and I am satisfied that if the applicant presents in A&amp;E with an acute condition requiring a stent or a bypass she will be treated appropriately.</p>

The applicant claims liabilities of &#163;393,893 on the agreed ES2.  However, from that can be deducted immediately the &#163;240,443 being the relationship debt and interest which the respondent agrees to waive.  This leaves &#163;153,450.00.  The respondent accepts that the applicant&#8217;s hard debts have to be discharged, but he does challenge some of these hard debts on the basis that they are included in the &#163;76,000 odd figure which he must pay as a result of Moor&#160;J&#8217;s costs order; and that there is double counting in the sum of at least &#163;19,000 in relation to some of the monies claimed as being repayable to the applicant&#8217;s mother.</p>

The company to which it is said to be owed has been struck off the register because it became inactive.  There is, therefore, as a matter of law no creditor to whom the debt can be paid.  The cost of reinstating the company for a debt of this size is likely to be disproportionate therefore, in my judgment, it is highly unlikely to be pursued.  Neither a director nor a shareholder of that defunct company has locus to claim the debt.  At least that is the position under English law and absent evidence on New Zealand law I presume that it is the same in accordance with the general practice of these courts.  Further the debt dates back to 2013/2014.  Again, I have no evidence in relation to the New Zealand limitation law, so I presume it is the same as English law which is entirely reasonable given the common legal heritage of both countries.  The period in this country would be six years so the debt is statute barred and irrecoverable.</p>

I accept that the applicant wishes to pay, and I accept that history shows that when she has had the money, she has repaid monies lent to her by her mother.  However, Ms JA told me that if the applicant does not pay any sums still outstanding unlikely to be deducted from her inheritance in due course.  While she told me that there was trouble in the family over money she had lent to the applicant that did not seem to me to be a genuine reason for repayment of the sums because there have been other much larger gifts given to the applicant&#8217;s other siblings, for instance a gift of land and later a business was given to her brother, C.

On the basis of the ES2 figure that yields a total need of &#163;563,862.  Mr Tyzack says this is a needs light case on the basis of Moor&#160;J&#8217;s decisions because of a weak connection with the United Kingdom.  He also says that the applicant is the author of her own misfortune.  If she had accepted the February offer of &#163;650,000, she would now have ample money to clear all her debts including the soft debts and to pay for medical treatment and would be left with a surplus even at the higher 2020 housing need.

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">The reduction by the respondent of his offer between February and May by reference to his legal costs while prima facie entirely reasonable, his costs are very high due to his choice of solicitors, a matter for him, of course, he may spend his money as he wishes, but such costs were they to be subject to a detailed assessment are likely to be reduced by approximately 30 per cent.  In this context that would still leave the respondent with an advantage in relation to his offer.  He will retain sufficient monies to clear all his debts and will increase his income.  He has sufficient resources, as I have already set out.  At an award of &#163;564,000 in round terms that is less than 50% of the net value of the matrimonial home on either parties&#8217; calculation, however, in my judgment, that is appropriate because it reflects both the short time lived in the property by the parties and the fact that it was owned by the respondent prior to the commencement of the relationship.  One might have attributed rather more to the pre-marital ownership and source of the property, but given the monies spent during the marriage the award also reflects the added value during the marriage.</p>
