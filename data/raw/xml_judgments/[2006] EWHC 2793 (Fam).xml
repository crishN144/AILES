He was then nearly 52 (he is now just 61) and it was his second marriage: he was divorced from his first wife A, whom he had married in 1971, in 1997, although they had by then been separated for more than 2 years, and he had 3 grown-up children by that marriage, two girls, J and A, and one boy, D. For the Applicant it was her first marriage. She was nearly 20 years younger than he, then 32, now 41. They had met at work where he was an equity partner and she a trainee. </p>

The decree nisi was on 23 September 2005. The marriage effectively lasted some 7&#189; years. They had two children, H, born on 30 December 1997, now aged 8&#189;, and at School, and E, born on 8 August 2003, now 3, and at a private nursery school. </p>

On 10 December 2004, only 17 days before the fateful 27 December, the family moved into a 5-bedroom period house of approximately 2700 square feet. Since the separation, the Applicant has remained in this home with H and E, and the Respondent has moved back to the other home. Although he made an application for contact with the children on 18 August 2005, it was opposed by the Applicant, and, in the light of her opposition, the Respondent withdrew his application and, as a result, the present position is that he and the children have not been in contact since December 2004. After the takeover of the company, to which I shall refer, the Respondent was made redundant in April 2002, and he has been working as a consultant in receipt of &#163;25,000 per annum. The Applicant has not worked since the marriage. </p>

He has been paying voluntary maintenance to the Applicant at &#163;2,000 per month, together with all outgoings save the telephone, but it is common ground between the parties that there should now be, save of course in respect of the children&#8217;s position, a clean break, and the issue before me has been as to the disposition of the property and assets and the amount of the lump sum to be paid by the Respondent to the Applicant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent was a wealthy man when he married the Applicant, after a successful working life at the company, since he joined them in 1971, 26 years earlier. The Applicant was not wealthy. Her parents were comfortably off, and had given some money to her and her siblings, which enabled her to pay for or towards the wedding. But he was the breadwinner and the provider. He purchased, as I have described, the successive matrimonial homes. The assets in issue before me are as follows:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The &#8216;property portfolio&#8217;. This portfolio is based upon properties acquired by the Respondent, before the marriage, over the years, for the purpose primarily of obtaining income from rentals and capital appreciation. There were commercial properties in Dagenham, Wolverhampton, Bury St Edmunds, Rochester and Telford, all of which he retains, together with a piece of land which, it is common ground, is of no value, (&#8220;the retained properties&#8221;). In addition there were commercial properties in Peckham and Ipswich, which were sold in 2001 and 2002, and in Barrow, which was, in 2001, transferred into a trust he set up for: the first matrimonial home, sold when the second was purchased: and a holiday home in Sandbanks, which is still retained. During the marriage he acquired some further properties. This arose as a result of the fact that his firm was taken over, and his interest, and that of his partners, bought out, in 2001, for a sum payable over a period but which eventually totalled some &#163;1.2 million. With the proceeds, he acquired further commercial properties, still retained, in Gloucester and Worthing, and a residential property, which was intended to be a retirement home for him and the Applicant when he gave up work and H left school.</p>

At the outset of the marriage he had a pension fund valued at &#163;435,524, which substantially increased in value, particularly in the years after 2001. He converted the pension funds, which, when cashed in, amounted to more than &#163;970,000, into a property portfolio within the pension wrapper. There are now 4 such commercial properties within the pension fund, in Poole, Wigan, Watford and Brighton. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall turn to address what the issues have been before me, but should first explain how it has come about that a judge of the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division has been hearing this case. One of the witnesses of fact relating to the events of the marriage is a neighbour of the parties, Judge H, who is a circuit judge, experienced and well known in the Family Division. The result has been that it was thought right by the parties and the Court that a judge with no knowledge of Judge H should hear the case, and this required a judge from outside the Family Division (and Mr Roger Stewart QC was brought in to cross-examine Judge H). Consequently, I have sat as a Judge of the Family Division, and have been very well educated in the law relating to the issues which I have to decide by Counsel in the case, Mr Nicholas Mostyn QC and Miss Ann Hussey for the Applicant, and Mr Philip Moor QC and Mr Justin Warshaw, for the Respondent, to all of whom I am extremely indebted, as I am indeed to the solicitors on both sides, for the thoroughness with which this case has been prepared and argued. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the issue which falls to be decided, which is the split of the assets of the Applicant and Respondent between them, so as to effect a clean break, subject to the agreement that the Respondent will continue to pay &#163;15,000 annual maintenance for the children (there is an issue as to whether this order should be indexed linked at RPI or left to be varied as and when necessary), and their school fees (and extras). These latter are estimated at present, for the purpose of any analysis of the position, at &#163;18,000 per annum, though they are at the moment less than that, because H has the scholarship and E is not yet in full time education. The position as to school fees is agreed by the Respondent on the basis that (i) he should have credit for such payment if, contrary to his contention, the Applicant were to receive 50% of the total assets in issue (see <span style="font-weight:bold">Parra v Parra</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 942" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 942</ref>, which provided in such a situation for the school fees to be borne equally) (ii) the assumption upon which he is agreeing so to pay is by reference to London private day school fees and extras; if H were to go, as the Applicant presently suggests may be considered, after his present school, to a secondary boarding school, then, if that were to be considered appropriate, the financial burden would have to be readdressed. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also agreed between the parties that, whatever the outcome of this application, there shall be no order for costs, on the basis that (with one caveat) the liability to costs to date of both parties should, in accordance with the recent practice of the Family Division, be taken into account as present liabilities of the parties and, so far as the Applicant&#8217;s legal costs are concerned, be treated as her liabilities to be paid by the Respondent as part of the lump sum payment to be made by him. The Applicant&#8217;s net debts (inclusive of &#163;460,911 legal costs) are agreed at &#163;515,003, and that sum is to be paid off by the Respondent, after credit for the Applicant&#8217;s pension asset of &#163;7087. The caveat arises from my concern that this new approach, which, albeit that this case antedates the new rules, it is agreed should be adopted in this case, should not oust the opportunity for challenge to any apparently excessive costs which would otherwise arise on a solicitor-client taxation/assessment at the instant of a paying party. Clearly, as a matter of principle, there must be some protection for the other party and some check on a solicitor&#8217;s bill. The Applicant and her solicitor have agreed, confident that, in this case, although the Applicant&#8217;s legal bill is higher than that of the Respondent, that bill will survive scrutiny, to provide a schedule of such costs, similar to that provided on an application for summary assessment by the Court, and that, if there be any particular challenges, they can be resolved by me.</p>

Expert evidence was adduced by the parties in relation to the commercial properties, on behalf of the Applicant by Mr Duncan Preston FRICS, a National Director of Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd, and on behalf of the Respondent by Mr Paul Wolfenden FRICS, a Direction of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung. As to the residential properties, expert evidence was adduced on behalf of the Applicant from Mr Howard Gross FRICS, employed as part time Senior Surveyor by Goadsby (Survey and Valuation) Ltd, the specialist valuation division of the Bournemouth-based Goadsby group: no independent expert was instructed by the Respondent, who relied on his own evidence, on an informal market appraisal and the fact that the holiday home has been on the market, and on the comparables referred to by Mr Gross.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was necessary, before the split of the assets could be properly assessed and resolved, for me to reach a decision on those disputed issues of valuation. After hearing the evidence of the expert and of the Respondent, the issue as to Brighton - where the basic valuation had been agreed between the experts, but Mr Preston had contended for, and Mr Wolfenden and the Respondent had rejected, an additional sum for &#8216;hope value&#8217; in respect of an alleged possible accretion to the value in the context of marriage of the long leasehold and freehold, if that could be negotiated - was sensibly conceded by Mr Mostyn QC. That left the issues as to Watford, Brudenell and the holiday home for me to resolve, to which I now turn.</p>

The present rent is &#163;75,000 (categorised as &#163;70 per square foot Zone A). Prior to the Respondent&#8217;s purchase of it in February 2004 for &#163;1m, it failed to be acquired at two separate auctions. At the last rent review date in 2001, there was no rent increase: the negotiations dragged on over a lengthy period to no avail, and it appears to have been common ground that the property was over-rented. The next five-year rent review date is now imminent, and it is likely, once negotiations begin, to drag on as before, if necessary being resolved by third party assessment, so that the likely earliest date at which the new rent will be known will be in some six to eight months. It was not a matter of challenge that, where a property is being valued and a rent review is not yet agreed or completed, such uncertainties are normally reflected by a purchaser requiring, and a valuer assessing, a higher yield. The Respondent put a figure on what he thought the rent should now be of &#163;85,000 per year (which would equate to &#163;80 per square foot Zone A).</p>

The relevance of such vacant properties is not only that this may indicate a lack of commercial interest in buying such properties as the subject property in that very area, but may well also affect any imminent rent reviews (including that of the subject property).</p>

Mr Wolfenden deduced from the (non-genuine) bid of &#163;950,000 for 116A a yield of 5.22%, and he applied that yield to the present rental of the subject property of &#163;75,000 to arrive at his valuation of &#163;1.35m. I conclude, doing the best I can, that the valuation should be arrived at by applying that yield of 5.22% to the &#163;85,000 rent which the Respondent hopes, perhaps overoptimistically, to achieve. That arrives at a figure of &#163;1.539m, which I round up to &#163;1.55m. </p>

Mr Gross&#8217;s valuation, on the basis of a sale to an ordinary purchaser, of &#163;1.3m is agreed. The dispute is whether there is an element of development potential. It is common ground that, if the property were demolished and redeveloped to a standard consistent with the most modern properties in the very desirable Canford Cliffs area, the valuation of the new property would be &#163;2.5m. Mr Gross accepted that in a developer&#8217;s ordinary assessments of development value the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">rule of thumb percentage</span>&#8221; is that costs (of land purchase, demolition and construction) should be round about 40-45% of the eventual price. &#163;1.4m is 56% of &#163;2.5m. There was some considerable discussion in examination and cross-examination of costs and profits, in part by reference to another development in the area with which Mr Gross&#8217;s company was involved, but it is plain that costings would be very tight indeed, and leave little room for a sensible developer&#8217;s profit, at &#163;1.4m. I conclude that there may be an element of hope value or &#8216;development potential&#8217;, such that a developer might be persuaded to put in a bid slightly over the ordinary market value &#8211; but not much. I assess the value, including development potential, of Brudenell, as &#163;1.35m.</p>

The Applicant&#8217;s valuation is &#163;340,000, and the Respondent&#8217;s &#163;315,000. It is on the second floor and is on the market for &#163;359,950. Flat 2, a similar flat in the same block but on the ground floor, recently sold for &#163;258,5000, but it seemed to be common ground that, although there is some positive advantage to being on the ground floor, at least by way of access to the (not particularly enticing) garden, that is outweighed by the disadvantage of a ground floor flat both overlooking the car park and, in particular, thus not having such good views as a second floor flat like Flat 9. Consequently it appeared to be common ground that Flat 9 would be considerably more valuable than Flat 2. However there were other comparables produced by Mr Gross: a 3-bedroom apartment in Salter Rise, which was sold for &#163;348,500 (after an asking price of &#163;372,500), and an apartment at Sandcastles, sold for &#163;305,000 (asking price &#163;315,000). What appeared to me to be significant, was that, as is very normal, if not expected, not only did both these two properties sell at less than the asking price, but Flat 2, referred to above, which sold at &#163;258,500, had an asking price of &#163;295,000. Flat 9 is on the market for &#163;359,950 and Mr Gross expressly said in evidence that this was, in his judgment, a correct asking price. My conclusion of the value is &#163;330,000.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The fifth issue can be generically labelled as &#8220;Need&#8221;, but is to an extent an amalgam. Consideration of need used to be in the forefront of financial provision cases, at least where there was more than a sufficiency of assets, and the aim was to scoop out of the pool sufficient to cope with the need of the less well-resourced party (generally the wife), whether her needs were in a given case assessed generously or stringently. It is now, particularly in the light of the decisions of the House of Lords, clear that need is no longer the yardstick, if it ever was, and that, by concentrating upon need, there has been insufficient account taken, not only of the general principles now so clearly enunciated by their Lordships in <span style="font-weight:bold">White </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold">Miller</span>, but of such a party&#8217;s non-financial contribution to the marriage, particularly in a long marriage. The issue of need is however still material, for at least the following reasons. First if there is non-matrimonial property, but the matrimonial property is inadequate to provide for the needs of the payee, then that is a ground for &#8216;dequarantining&#8217; the non-matrimonial property, which becomes available for general distribution (see <span style="font-weight:bold">White </span>per Lord Nicholls at 994). Secondly, addressing the issue of need is a necessary check to ensure that enough is given to the payee, or left with the payer, to enable each of them to live and meet their obligations.

Lord Nicholls, as interpreted by Lord Mance, concluded that non-matrimonial property consists of (i) properties which the parties brought with them into the marriage (which I shall define as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span>&#8221;) and (ii) property acquired by <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">inheritance or gift</span> during the marriage (which I shall define as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">extra-matrimonial</span>&#8221;), together &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">perhaps</span>&#8221; (but the <span style="font-style:italic">perhaps</span> has been overtaken by persuasive subsequent first instance judgment, as will be seen) with the income or fruits of that property (para 167). &#8220;Income or fruits&#8221; have been subsequently interpreted and adopted by Mr Mostyn QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, in <span style="font-weight:bold">Rossi v Rossi</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1482" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1482 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1482 (Fam)</ref> and approved by Singer J in <span style="font-weight:bold">S v S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/2339" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 2339 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 2339 (Fam)</ref> as referable to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">passive economic growth</span>&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Baroness Hale, according to Lord Mance, takes a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">more limited conception of matrimonial property</span>&#8221; &#8211; and thus a broader concept of non-matrimonial property. She includes the two categories which I have defined as <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial and extra-matrimonial</span>, but then she adds. She includes as matrimonial property &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">family assets</span>&#8221; (as defined by Lord Denning in <span style="font-weight:bold">Wachtel</span><span/><span style="font-weight:bold">v Wachtel</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] Fam 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] Fam 72</ref> at 90) and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">family businesses or joint ventures in which both parties work</span>&#8221;. But she identifies additionally as being non-matrimonial property &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">business or investment assets generated solely or mainly by the efforts of one party during the marriage</span>&#8221;: which I could perhaps define as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unilateral assets</span>&#8221;. She is thus seen by Lord Mance as allowing for a wider category of non-matrimonial property. Admittedly she says, as Lord Mance points out, at para 152, that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the source of the assets may be taken into account, but its importance will diminish over time</span>&#8221;, and that is naturally of obvious relevance where there has been a long marriage, and such intermingling of assets that their source can no longer be identified (see also Lord Nicholls at para 25). However, that would not be of relevance in this case, where, as discussed above, after 7&#189; years, there is no difficulty whatever in identifying the source of the assets: on the contrary they plainly derive from, and in many cases are the very same as, the assets brought into the marriage by the Respondent, and insofar as they have been developed, enhanced or transformed, that is <span style="font-style:italic">generated solely </span>or, at any rate <span style="font-style:italic">mainly</span>, by his <span style="font-style:italic">efforts</span>, and they remain wholly compartmentalised, and entirely in his name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It appears to me that Lord Nicholls and Baroness Hale have come to the same bourn, albeit by different routes, and that it is <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial </span>(or &#8211; not relevant here &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">extra-matrimonial</span>) property (plus income or fruits) which are non-matrimonial, and source is indeed therefore significant. But this is not yet an answer to the case which I have to decide, because, by reference to the categories of property set out in paragraph 19 above, and leaving aside category 1 &#8211; matrimonial homes being matrimonial property whatever their source &#8211; all of categories 2, 3 and 4 are said to be non-matrimonial by the Respondent and matrimonial by the Applicant. Mr Mostyn QC would have liked to draw comparisons or contrasts with the law of Scotland or New York, but, as Mr Moor QC forcefully pointed out, not only is there no evidence of foreign law in proper form before me, but to consider solely those jurisdictions would, in any event, be selective, and such broadbrush arguments are thus of little assistance. It is also important not to descend too far into what might be called Chancery technicalities in this area. Is the asset &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">untouched</span>&#8221;? (a New York question). Is it transformed or metamorphosed? Has there been more than a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">passive economic growth</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>(Singer J in <span style="font-weight:bold">S v S</span> at para 111) or &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">natural capital growth</span>&#8221; (Mr Mostyn QC at para 17 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Rossi</span>). An example was raised by me in argument, as to what would arise if a party owned and brought into the marriage a Canaletto (plainly <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span>) and was then advised, due to the vagaries of the art market, to sell that Canaletto and buy a Renoir instead. Is the Renoir now matrimonial property? Would it make any difference if the other spouse had come to the art auction at which the replacement old master was bought? There was exploration, and cross-examination of the Respondent, with regard to the retained properties, the commercial properties brought into the marriage by him, and still retained, as to whether there had been rent review negotiations or schedules of dilapidation and, if so, who had dealt with them. Mr Moor QC would have none of this. He pointed out that the only issue raised in <span style="font-weight:bold">Miller</span> with regard to non-matrimonial property (at any rate of the Lord Nicholls variety) was as to its source, and that (para 9 of his closing submissions) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">source is what makes an asset non-matrimonial. If any proposition of law can be deduced from Miller in this regard, it is limited to (a) erosion over time and (b) use of an asset as a matrimonial home</span>&#8221;. I turn then, against this background, to the assets falling within categories 2 to 4 in paragraph 19 above, and deal first with category 2, the retained properties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These were brought into the marriage by the Respondent and still remain unsold and in his name. Although the Applicant made no assertion of any contribution in relation to these (nor indeed any other properties apart from the matrimonial home(s)) in her response to Box 4.3 in Form E, where such assertion would be expected, she sought to assert in evidence that she had played some role in relation to the commercial properties by setting up (as being more computer literate than her husband) a format on the home computer for rent returns, which the Respondent then ported to his office and used: and in relation to one of the pension properties (Poole) it appears that what was asserted by her as some involvement was limited to walking past it to have a look from the outside, when they were staying at the holiday home. It is plain that she made no contribution. As for the Respondent, I am satisfied that nothing he did can be counted as any more than sufficient to generate <span style="font-style:italic">passive economic growth</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">natural capital growth</span>, in the sense of performing the landlord&#8217;s ordinary duty to collect rents, and, where necessary, instructing a managing agent to deal with such matters as rent reviews and schedules of dilapidation. If that might have been relevant, there was not in fact any development of any of the properties. Insofar as he did any minimal such work in relation to the retained properties, it was not work which can be said to have been contributed to in any way by the non-financial contribution of the Applicant in running the home, as might be said to be the case with regard to the operation of a business by a breadwinner, while the homemaker or carer remains at home.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issues relating to the first and second of these are intertwined. At various stages in the marriage, the Respondent liquidated the cash pension funds and sold the relevant commercial properties and purchased other or different assets. Mr Moor QC categorises this as an example of a technical Chancery argument, as opposed to a dramatic metamorphosis, and equates what occurred to the situation in which, for example, pension assets held within a wrapper by a fund manager are bought and sold, as must occur every day of the week. In such a case, I would accept that it would be probable that what was important was the interest in the fund, and if the underlying assets were sold, that would have no impact upon whether the wrap did or did not remain <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span> property: and I would accept that it would be highly arguable that the same might apply to the Canaletto/Renoir switch. But in this case, property is the Respondent&#8217;s life-blood and expertise. He is an expert in respect of the purchase and sale of properties, and with an obvious eye for substantial increase in value. Once he was made redundant by the company, and had only a part time job as a consultant, this was now his main <span style="font-style:italic">earning capacity</span>. Had the pension funds remained as they were, with the seemingly substantial increase in value since 1998 from &#163;435, 524 to &#163;972, 528, they would, in my judgment, have remained <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span>, and therefore non-matrimonial, property. However, they were liquidated, just as the other commercial properties were sold, and the Respondent entered into the exercise of replacing the sold properties, but above all investing the substantial cash in properties which have, indeed, proved very successful investments. Of course the inclusion of these assets, totalling, in the case of the pension portfolio alone, a net value of more than &#163;3m, makes a very substantial difference to the available pot.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the Comany proceeds, it can be seen that the answer must be the same, although here the Applicant puts forward two contentions leading to the same result. The partnership interest in The Company was sold to the French, by virtue of the takeover, and the proceeds, as they came through over a substantial period, were used to buy properties (including Northampton Park). It is obvious that it is not a mere Canaletto/Renoir technicality that the interest in the asset has been cashed in, and, once again as a result of the Respondent&#8217;s continuing expertise and involvement, the proceeds invested in properties, so that the properties so purchased are plainly matrimonial property. However, in the case of The Company, there was another reason put forward by Mr Mostyn QC for concluding that the proceeds of the asset resulting from the Respondent&#8217;s 20-year partnership constituted matrimonial property. Although, of course, technically ownership of the income stream from the partnership at The Company was, at the outset of the marriage, an asset, it is plain that &#8211; not least because The Company were going through a bad time &#8211; the Respondent did not so consider it, or at any rate did not consider it an asset of any value. He did not include his interest in The Company, or any value for it, in his Form M1, or at all, on his first divorce. Although, in evidence, the Respondent spoke of occasional discussions with his partners as to whether there might be merger possibilities, it seems to me clear beyond doubt that what occurred with the offer from the French was a wholly unexpected and enormous windfall for the The Company partners, not unlike the sudden and dramatic increase in the New Star shares in the case of <span style="font-weight:bold">Miller</span>, which were valueless at the outset of that marriage (<span style="font-weight:bold">Miller </span>paras 69-73). I do not in the event need to decide whether this further argument, that the fortuitous event during the course of the marriage (which, unlike the position relating to the increase in the New Star shares, cannot be said to result from any particular efforts during the marriage by the Respondent) can be said to mean that the <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span> asset was of no value, and that, as it had only become of value during the marriage, it thus became, in its transformed state, a matrimonial asset (or perhaps, as an alternative, whether the massive accretion in value of that asset from nil to more than &#163;1.2m can be said to be more than, or different from, <span style="font-style:italic">passive economic growth</span>). The fact that the interest was realised and the proceeds invested in properties, renders the question moot. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to my findings in respect of conduct. I heard the Applicant and the Respondent examined and cross-examined at length, and I shall turn to them in due course. There were a number of other witnesses, and I accept the evidence of Judge H, who lived locally and attempted to mediate between them, Mrs F, the next-door neighbour at the first matrimonial home. Mr P and Mrs F, neighbours at the holiday home and Mr O, a close friend of the Respondent, called on behalf of the Respondent, and of Mrs M, a close friend of the Applicant, called on her behalf, as truthfully, honestly and helpfully given. I found the evidence of Mrs E, a former babysitter and a friend of the Applicant, called on her behalf, unreliable and of no use: she was, in my judgment, exaggerating and embellishing &#8211; even beyond the evidence which the Applicant herself gave &#8211; in an endeavour to assist her client and friend. Much of the evidence from these witnesses went to the issue of how the Applicant and Respondent behaved to the children, and in particular H. This issue was not strictly before me, but suffice it to say that nothing that I heard would have stood in the way of the Respondent&#8217;s claim for contact, had it been pursued. I accept the evidence of Judge H that, when (inappropriately) in May 2002 the Applicant complained in H&#8217;s presence to Judge H of the Respondent having kicked her (incident 3A referred to below) H volunteered that it was in fact she, the Applicant, who had kicked the Respondent first: of Mrs M that H said in front of and about his parents &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">here they go again</span>&#8221;: of Mrs F that she was sufficiently upset by what she saw and heard of the Applicant&#8217;s approach to H that she called social services (including one incident when, as I accept, the Applicant left H locked out in the street): of Mrs F that the Applicant in August 2004 launched a lengthy and upsetting tirade against H in the holiday home carpark (for which the explanation that he had previously thrown a scooter at her was hardly a justification): and of Mr P that he too was concerned at the Applicant&#8217;s treatment of H. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the Applicant and the Respondent, as I listened to the evidence, it did seem to me wholly distressing that what could and should have been a comfortable and successful second marriage in his 50s for the Respondent, and a first marriage for the Applicant which would bring her both substantial material benefits and companionship and children, went so badly and so quickly wrong, due to the conflict of their personalities. The Respondent is, in my judgment, dogmatic, domineering, demanding, intolerant and a cold fish. He attempted to control his temper, though, once roused to anger, found it difficult to exercise restraint, and he seems to have regarded it as his role as the older man to criticise a younger wife who seemed to him to be making no effort to play the role that he had expected. The Applicant is hyper-emotional, uncompromising, quick-tempered and sharp-tongued, quick to lash out, particularly when criticised, whether with violence towards the Respondent - though it became soon apparent that that was counter-productive by virtue of his response - or, once she realised the way she really could rile him, by an attack on his possessions. She was, aptly in my judgment, described by Judge, as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">drama queen</span>&#8221;, and is and was prone to exaggerate or embellish: for example I accept Judge Hs&#8217; evidence that, in describing the events of 27 December to her, she said that she had had to have fourteen stitches when, in fact as will appear, unpleasant as the injury to her was, she had no stitches. Both the Applicant and the Respondent were not prepared to make the necessary compromises for an easy relationship, and there were, as I am satisfied, constant rows between them almost from the outset of the marriage. I accept Mrs F&#8217;s evidence &#8211; indeed it was not really challenged &#8211; that there were frequent arguments between the Applicant and the Respondent, which she could hear or see. Mrs M accepts that there were rows between the two of them, although she believed that, on the whole, such rows would have been provoked by the Respondent. This of course depends on what is meant by &#8216;provoked&#8217;, for I find it easy to accept that the Applicant found the Respondent irritating. But I accept the independent evidence of both Judge H and Mrs F that both of them were to blame. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I propose to make findings in relation to the events and incidents prior to 27 December 2004 in relatively schematic form. I do not want it to be thought that I minimise the unhappiness of both parties to the marriage by making skeletal findings, and they fall to be set against what I have had no difficulty in accepting above, that there were constant rows throughout the period. Nevertheless, particularly because, as set out in paragraph 40 above, it is the 27 December incident upon which the Applicant relies for the &#8216;gasp factor&#8217;, it is most convenient to set out the earlier incidents in this manner. Mr Mostyn QC, in his skeleton, identified, and numbered, ten incidents, starting in June 1998, of which the last is the 27 December incident itself. In the course of the evidence, a number of other incidents were explored, and, in order to preserve Mr Mostyn QC&#8217;s numbering, we began, in the course of argument, and I have now expanded, the use of subordinate numbering, As, Bs, etc. I make these findings on the basis of what I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, occurred, after hearing the evidence of both the Applicant and Respondent &#8211; much of which, though not all, is not in dispute &#8211; and the evidence, where relevant, of the other witnesses, which I have accepted. I have also taken account of the diary that the Respondent kept. The Applicant accepts that he kept what she called a &#8216;dossier&#8217;, which she discovered, and which she made him burn. He then started to compile, unknown to her, a new one, as from July 2003. Although it seems a somewhat unemotional and self-serving thing to do, the diary records a great many of the incidents referred to below, and the contents turned out, on the evidence being given and tested, to be largely accurate and often unchallenged.</p>

It is clear to me, not least from comparison of their accounts before me with accounts both of them have previously given, with Police records and with the evidence of Mrs M, that, due to the passage of time, and because of the heat of emotion, both at the time and subsequently, the Applicant has overplayed, or over-remembered, what occurred and the Respondent has underplayed and under-remembered.

I conclude that Mrs M probably then telephoned the Applicant on her mobile, and, when she learned what had occurred, she came angrily downstairs. I do not accept that what happened thereafter was &#8216;wordless&#8217; as the Respondent now states, though contrary to what he said to the Police at the time, but that the argument lurched from her being angry with him for having been, as she saw it, rude to her friend Mrs M, to his being critical of her for not agreeing to allow his friend Mr O to come to the birthday party which he was arranging for her. He was sitting in the chair facing the television, and she was standing slightly behind the chair. She clearly became frustrated with him, as so often in the past, and she spat once or twice at the back of his head. It is common ground that she was behind him, but I am satisfied that she was close enough to him that, when he held up his hand to ward off the spit, it came into contact with her face, and hit her lip, and that it was not a deliberate attack on her. </p>

I find that it is much more likely that, while she picked herself up and raced up the stairs, he turned his attention, as he has said in evidence, to his father&#8217;s tobacco pot, and trying to recover the pieces. I am satisfied that, in her temper, she grabbed the first thing of his that she saw, namely the grandfather clock at the top of the stairs, and pulled it off its moorings, so that it fell crashing to the ground. I do not find that she was doing that because he was at the time closely pursuing her: I conclude that it would have to have been pushed against quite vigorously to have been forced away from its connections, and that that would have taken more time than would have been available to her if he was in hot pursuit &#8211; not least because, in fact, if he was in hot pursuit, given that she would have taken time to pick herself up from the bottom of the stairs, he would probably have caught up with her even before she got to the clock. It was then, on hearing the crash and realising that it was his clock, and because of what she had done to the clock, that he did indeed pursue her and was, as he accepts, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">absolutely furious</span>&#8221;. By the time he reached the ground floor, where the clock lay, she was already well on her way upstairs, and he leapt up the next flight after her. By the time he reached the top of the stairs, he knew she was in the bathroom, and he pursued her in. Unknown to her, as they had only just moved in, there was in fact no lockable bolt on the bathroom door and she was thus unable to secure it behind her, as she intended, and attempted, but she strove hard to hold the door shut, while he pushed hard against it to get in.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next few moments in the bathroom form the nub of the Applicant&#8217;s case against the Respondent. Her case is that, when he burst into the bathroom, she was standing in the middle of the room and that he deliberately smashed her head against the shower post at the corner of the shower cabinet, just inside the bathroom behind the door, causing her injury, which consisted of a jagged cut from above the bridge of her nose up to the hairline. The cut was, in the event, only superficial, and required no stitches (contrary to what she subsequently told Judge H), but oozed a great deal of blood; and the photograph of her head covered in blood, taken some time later that night, is obviously a distressing sight. The Respondent pleaded guilty, as set out in paragraph 2 above, to causing her actual bodily harm, and his mitigation was put by his defence Counsel on the same basis as his case before me, that is that he did not deliberately smash her head against the pole, but that she must have incurred the injury, as he accepts recklessly caused by him, in the course of the struggle when he forced his way in against her opposition. At the outset of the hearing we had a rough plan of the bathroom, which was inaccurate in two respects, one of which was known and one not. The first inaccuracy was that the bathroom door was shown opening to the left, whereas it was common ground that it opened to the right, i.e. up against the shower cabinet. The other inaccuracy only became clear as a result of the view, and in consequence an accurate plan was prepared. It is now clear that, contrary to the original plan that showed the shower cabinet only projecting into the bathroom as far as the opening of the door, in fact the shower cabinet continues out further, so that the post at the corner of the shower cabinet is in a position 11 inches beyond where the door when fully open makes contact with the shower cabinet.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Moor QC, operating on the basis of the inaccurate plan, in order to postulate how it was the Applicant&#8217;s right temple must have come into contact with the shower pole, had to suggest that the Applicant had been attempting to keep the door closed by standing with her back to the door, and had then been swung 90 degrees when the door opened, causing her left temple to come into contact with the pole. The suggestion that the Applicant had her back to the door is not consistent with any of the contemporaneous accounts. Now the true position is known, it is possible for the Applicant to have been facing the door and to have been swung around as the door opened, and as she fell away, due to the force exerted by the Respondent, for her left temple to have come into contact with the shower pole 11 inches on the bathroom side of the fully opened door, causing her to collapse in a heap in the middle of the floor. </p>

Neither is a creditable explanation of what occurred, and it perhaps exemplifies his cold personality, to which I earlier referred. But I am satisfied that he did so immediately, and did not return to the bathroom for that purpose (his return to the bathroom was for the purpose of his recovering his sponge bag &#8211; while the Applicant continued to lie on the floor &#8211; as he had decided to leave the house and go down to the holiday home, as he had done after previous incidents). Although the Applicant now believes that he went out of the bathroom and came back in again to try and remove her ring, she was not so certain about it at the time she made her statement in these proceedings (paragraph 67) and when she made her statement to the Police at the time, she gave a clear description that the Respondent&#8217;s sudden attempt to pull at her engagement ring followed on immediately after his blows, before he left the bathroom, and that his return to the bathroom was to collect the sponge bag. This is consistent with the evidence that the Respondent gave in his witness statement in these proceedings, in his evidence in chief (although, at that stage, asserting that he had only thought of doing so), and again in cross-examination.</p>

On the one hand the Respondent, after a conversation with her, in which he unfeelingly said that, if she could not cope with the children, they would have to go into care, simply left the house. On the other hand she did not, although she says that she thought she was dying, call either an ambulance or the Police, but made calls first to Mrs M, who has given the account to which I have referred in paragraph 53(iv) above, and then to her parents.</p>

However, although the whole sad history of the marriage, which I have sketched, and which Judge Hughes made unavailing attempts to save, may leave me with what might be called a &#8216;gulp factor&#8217;, arising out of what each of these two parties did to each other, verbally and physically, I am not left with Mr Mostyn QC&#8217;s &#8216;gasp factor&#8217;.

This is aimed at redressing any significant prospective economic disparity between the parties arising from the way they conducted their marriage. For instance, the parties may have arranged their affairs in a way which has greatly advantaged the husband in terms of his earning capacity but left the wife severely handicapped so far as her own earning capacity is concerned. Then the wife suffers a double loss: a diminution in her earning capacity and the loss of a share in her husband&#8217;s enhanced income. This is often the case. Although less marked than in the past, women may still suffer a disproportionate financial loss on the breakdown of a marriage because of their traditional roles as home-maker and childcarer.</span>&#8221;</p>

I am quite satisfied that she gave no sign of what might be the case in other circumstances, a thwarted ambition or an irrevocably damaged career. I do not believe that this head of loss can be said to arise in every circumstance. It is not an unfamiliar situation, e.g. in employment tribunals, where it is said to be the consequence of an unfair dismissal that a claimant can never recovery satisfactory employment, although in that forum there is the statutory cap to compensation. In this case, I am not persuaded at all that anything has been lost by the 7&#189;-year gap in the Applicant&#8217;s employment, or as a result of the mutual agreement between the parties that she would not work: indeed the understanding, and her own desire, as was plainly in evidence, was that this arrangement of her not working would not be limited to the period when she might have to be the carer of the children, but would extend to their joint enjoyment of his retirement at Brudenell, where she would choose to spend her time in sailing and painting. </p>

It is plain that there is no call for a line by line analysis of these estimated figures by a judge: and it is important to bear in mind what the standard of living in fact was during the marriage. Sympathetic as one must be for a single parent, it is not the job of the court in this regard to compensate her for the loss of her husband by enabling her to have a social life which is an improvement upon that which she had during the marriage.

Equally there is no indication whatever of any visits to the opera or the theatre, at any rate on any more than a very occasional basis.

I am satisfied, having heard what I have described above as her own negative reaction to the suggestion of what talent she may have, that, notwithstanding her obvious intelligence, there are no particular openings available for her: but I feel sure that she can, at any rate, earn &#163;15,000 per annum starting in a year&#8217;s time.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I am not persuaded that it is necessary that she and the children stay in the matrimonial home. Plainly it would be an advantage by way of providing some short term stability, and that may consequently lead to a more amenable approach to access to the children: but the house is, in my judgment, larger than they need, and is not one to which, by virtue of the last 17 days of the marriage, it can be said that the family was habituated. I am also far from persuaded that, simply because the Applicant has become a no doubt valued committee member a society in the area, she has to remain in the area &#8211; as opposed for example to moving to Highbury and becoming an equally valued member of the Highbury Society: and in any event it was their plan that, within a few years, she and the Respondent would be moving to Poole. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">However</span>, if by making economies here and there, the Applicant can enable herself to remain in the matrimonial home, then a transfer to the Applicant of the matrimonial home free of mortgage would enable her to do so &#8211; but it is not my intention to give her provision so as to ensure that that is the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that, if I make such provision as gives her a sum of &#163;50,000 net per annum for her reasonable expenditure, to which will be added the &#163;15,000 for the children and, once she finds some suitable job, another &#163;15,000 per annum, that may in practice enable her by making necessary economies to stay in the matrimonial home. If, however, she finds herself unable to do so, or indeed feels it more sensible and preferable to trade down, then she would release for herself the agreed estimated sum of &#163;800,000 now, rather than in 20 years time. A lump sum of &#163;700,000 would, on the &#8216;modified&#8217; Duxbury basis, i.e. postulating sale of the matrimonial home in 20 years time, secure for her approximately &#163;50,000 per annum net. If she decides to trade down now, then that would immediately free up the &#163;800,000 from the matrimonial home, which would give her (by reference to the Duxbury tables) an additional &#163;35,000, namely a total of &#163;85,000, which is a more than an adequate sum per annum for her needs, without any economies, to which the children&#8217;s maintenance, and a reasonable sum by way of net earnings, would fall to be added. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that there should be an allowance for the substantial financial contribution of the Respondent to the marriage, over and above the norm, and after taking into account the Applicant&#8217;s contribution as carer and homemaker, by virtue of the pension portfolio and the The Company proceeds. This contribution is, in my judgment, at least sufficient to justify an entitlement of some 60% of the matrimonial property (while he retains the <span style="font-style:italic">pre-matrimonial</span>) which would itself make no allowance for the fact that the Respondent will be, as is agreed, paying off the entirety of the Applicant&#8217;s debts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I order, as I am minded to do, and on the basis of the payment off of the debts, the transfer, free of mortgage, of the matrimonial home (valued at approximately &#163;1.8m) plus a lump sum of &#163;700,000, that would (i) constitute approximately 40% of the matrimonial property (ii) leave the Applicant with the opportunity to retain the matrimonial home in addition to a sum which, by reference to the Duxbury tables as modified, would equate to &#163;50,000 per annum, together with the &#163;15,000 maintenance for the children, plus any earning capacity, to which I have already referred. If, as I am satisfied she may well be able to do, she can manage comfortably on that sum, then she will be able to retain the matrimonial home as she would wish. If it turns out that she cannot, then she can dispose of, or deal with, the matrimonial home and will, as I have set out in paragraph 63 above, in those circumstances, have what I am satisfied would be more than adequate for her requirements. I am satisfied that this amount both meets her needs and constitutes her entitlement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Mostyn QC submitted that the effect of Lord Nicholls words in <span style="font-weight:bold">White</span> at 989 is that the judge must test his conclusion against the yardstick of equality of all the property, including the non-matrimonial property. I do not agree. I consider that the yardstick is by reference to 50% of the matrimonial property, and that the non-matrimonial property is excluded, and only brought into consideration if needs dictate. However, if I am to measure my conclusion against that yardstick, then the total figure I award to the Applicant (exclusive of the payment off of the &#163;500,000 debt) would fall from approximately 40% of the matrimonial, to approximately 35% of the total of matrimonial and non-matrimonial, property. This latter, lesser, percentage would be, in my judgment, more than justified by virtue of the fact that the Respondent&#8217;s financial contribution would then have to be considered to be all the greater, if it included, not only his financial contribution to the matrimonial property, but his deemed contribution of the entirety of what is otherwise non-matrimonial property. In either event, against whichever yardstick my award is measured, there is, in my judgment, and by reference to the factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>, ample good reason for it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to look at the position of the Respondent, who I would intend and expect if at all possible to be in a position to retain Brudenell for his intended retirement (and for his present weekends) and, if he so chooses, the first matrimonial home, at least for the present, while he is working in London; and to fund the outgoings for the properties, in addition to his own living expenses, any debt he may have to continue, including the mortgage on this home if so advised, and the maintenance for the children. He will need to find &#163;700,000 in respect of the lump sum, plus the &#163;500,000 to pay the Appellant&#8217;s debts including her legal costs, and the &#163;700,000 to pay off the matrimonial home mortgage, a total of approximately &#163;1.9m. He has net non-pension assets, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">excluding</span> first matrimonial home and Brudenell, of approximately &#163;2.3m. He would thus be in a position, given time, to fund those capital outlays entirely out of his non-pension assets, leaving a small balance, which would continue to earn him some income, while he would still have 100% of his pension assets as income earning, together with his net earnings for his last four years, as presently planned, which should more than cover his own expenses and outgoings.</p>

There is only one financial dispute remaining, given that the parties have already agreed that there should be (subject to my caveat) no order for costs, and that relates to whether the &#163;15,000 agreed for the children should be index linked to RPI. I consider that that would be appropriate, in order to avoid any continuing dispute between the parties, which I hope (subject to resolution of the question of chattels) can now be put behind them, while they dedicate themselves to the interests of the children, and this will hopefully entirely avoid any need for any applications for variation now or in the future. </p>
