The facts that the local authority seek to prove do not concern any of the five children directly as they are historical and concern what happened to the three grand-daughters of GM (the grandmother) and GF (the grandfather) when they were children placed, by the local authority in their care in March 1995 following proceedings concerning their mother (MA) herself the daughter of GM and GF. These three young women X, Y and Z have experienced great difficulties in their lives since being in the care of their grandparents. X&#8217;s two children are the subject of these proceedings and one of Z&#8217;s children has been removed from her care and her second, a son born in June 2015, is now the subject of public law proceedings. At the time of the fact finding hearing K and L were placed with their great-grandparents GM and GF. </p>

These complaints first arose in 2009 when both Y (then 16)  and Z (then 14) were interviewed by the police;  The complaints were centred on the grandparents&#8217; home; both alleged that they had been sexually abused by their uncle FA (born 1985) who as an adolescent and young adult was still living with his parents during the time X, Y and Z were placed with them. In addition Z complained that she was regularly hit by both her grandparents. Both complained of emotional abuse and of being treated with less favour then their elder sister X; specifically they complain that GM put them under emotional pressure not to pursue their complaints about FA&#8217;s sexually abusing them. </p>

At the outset of the oral evidence of Y (following the viewing of the DVD of her two interviews with the police in 2009 and 2014) she gave evidence in court with all the parties in court. As can be readily seen by the headings to this judgment the court room was very full; to capacity in fact with counsel sitting in three rows and the parties occupying chairs along the full length of the back wall of the courtroom. Y became distressed during her evidence at which point her grandfather (GF) shouting out &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">drama queen&#8221; </span>can only have added to her distress<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>I then took the step of providing for the lay parties to sit in another courtroom and to watch and listen to counsel by video link. No party objected to this method of conducting proceedings and as counsel were all able to see the  witnesses this measure complies with the provision for measures for witnesses eligible for  assistance on the grounds of fear and distress in criminal proceedings (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/23/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s17</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/23" uk:canonical="1999 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</ref>).

Much is made of her history of self-harm, overdose and uncontrolled behaviour particularly by counsel for FA in his submissions, these are matters to which I will return, but in respect of her evidence she was able to give evidence without the lay parties in court. Counsel were asked to ask focussed questions and did so; it is accepted that no complaints were raised about the procedure adopted by the court. Three friends of Y, now themselves young women, felt similarly intimidated by the court room full of strangers and gave evidence while the lay parties watched the court (but not the witnesses) from another court room.</p>

It is certainly further evidence of a vulnerable and disturbed young woman and one who has exhibited very disturbing and distressing behaviour since she first made the allegations in 2009. The evidence contained in the report has to be seen in the context of this case as a whole. It is equally possible to argue that her current mental health difficulties probably have at their root the treatment that she suffered while living with her grandparents and young uncle FA. While I must approach Z&#8217;s evidence with some care I keep in mind suffering from a mental disorder does not render a person incapable of telling the truth. I can say from the outset of the proceedings before me that what has struck me is the total lack of sympathy, concern and compassion for Z from either of her grandparents; even taking into account the difficulties in dealing with a very disturbed young person who exhibits behavioural difficulties. </p>

All the witnesses called by the local authority are accused of lying by FA, GM and GF. The retractions by Y and Z of the allegations of sexual and physical abuse first made in 2009 are relied on as evidence of their unreliability as witnesses. In addition Y is said to have lied in 2011 during the trial of a man accused of serious sexual assault on her. He was convicted and sentenced to 8 years in October 2011.   Taken on their own such retractions and lies would have to be given considerable weight, however it is part of the local authority&#8217;s case that the reason that both Y and Z have retracted their complaints and that Y lied during the trial was because they had been put under emotional pressure to do so by GM, their grandmother and the mother of FA. If such pressure was put that puts their retractions in quite a different light. The evidence is intertwined and none of it can be viewed in isolation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is something that I will keep in mind when considering the evidence of all the witnesses. The way in which people remember things is inconsistent of itself; the way that a child may remember something is bound to be different from that of an adult or older person who will have a different understanding of events, informed by their greater experience and the understanding born of such experience. Recalling events such as sexual and physical abuse is likely to be distressing and is difficult for anyone to cope with, without further emotional impact. One such impact may be a struggle to recall when each events happened; victims of childhood abuse, particularly abuse which happened repeatedly over a period of years as they grew from a young child into a adolescent, can confuse events with each other, coinciding with a attempt at  suppressing the memory of some of the details of the abuse to avoid the distress caused by their recollection. </p>

She was admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment and discharged in early December 1976. Ten days later her daughter MA (the mother of X, Y and Z) was admitted with head injuries including a suspected skull fracture after a fall. While the treating medical staff were not suspicious of inflicted injury there was reported to be general concern about the children, and, specifically GM&#8217;s mental health and marital difficulties; GM had made suicidal gestures and GF had left on several occasions.

The evidence shows that Z, in particular, was treated differently. It would be hard to disagree with their assertion that GM was a powerful figure in their lives for indeed she was: they were largely dependant on her from a very young age. Their mother was never able to provide an alternative source of security, affection and care. GM&#8217;s reaction to their complaints about FA was to immediately and comprehensively dismiss them and to protect her son; she has not wavered from that course. The local authority submit that she was a domineering grandmother who cared not for them but only for her son, leaving Y and Z  very vulnerable, isolated and unable to speak out about what was happening when they were younger living with her and dependant upon her for their home. It is an undisputed fact that even after they left their grandparents&#8217; home to live with their mother (in the case of Y) or with foster-carers (in the case of Z) as teenagers they came back to live with GM and GF; they had nowhere else to go.</p>

This serious assault took place at the home of Y's mother. I accept that it is not part of the local authority&#8217;s case to defend the behaviour of MA at the time of the rape or before or after it took place. Ali was later convicted after a trial in 2011 during which the principal issue was whether the act had taken place. It was not in issue that he had engaged in some sexual activity it was denied that he had raped Y. Y's account (that she was) was accepted by the jury which convicted Ali. This court is not asked to,  nor can it, go behind that conviction which stands. The evidence of Y regarding her treatment by FA, GM and GF cannot be undermined by the truthful allegations she made against Ali. If I find that GM did put pressure on Y to deny the abuse by her uncle during the criminal trial then the fact that she did so will not undermine her evidence regarding the abuse for the purpose of this trial.</p>

Y told her that he had done the same to X and Z.  According to MA she asked the other two girls but they denied it.  MA said that she told her own mother GM who denied anything had happened.  MA said that Y was told by her grandmother to say that she had made it up so she could live with her mother (MA) again. MA contacted the social worker and Y and Z repeated their complaints to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y was first interviewed by the police on 21 July 2009. The court bundle included a handwritten summary of the interview and a typed copy of that summary. West Yorkshire Police have not been able to locate the video of Y&#8217;s 2009 interview.  In the interview on 21st July 2009, based on the summary, Y described sexual abuse by her uncle FA starting when she was 7 or 8 years old, although later in her statement in these proceedings she says that she was 5 or 6. Y described numerous and various forms of sexual abuse by FA. It is recorded that she said he asked her to "play with his penis" and when she said "no" he told her that he loved her and that nothing would happen to her. FA came into her room, pulled down his pants, grabbed her face and pulled it towards him whilst telling her that he was the only person in the house who loved her. Y said that penis had gone erect or hard and he sat on her bed but that she pulled away saying she did not love him. He tried to get her to touch his willy with her hand. She described how on a trip to the toilet, he had rubbed up against her and kissed her; his penis was touching her stomach and she could feel a lump in his pants.</p>

On a holiday in Ibiza he had pulled down his pants to expose his penis. Y said that at home, three or four times a week he had <span style="font-style:italic">done stuff</span> in the living room when he would close the curtains and get her to "<span style="font-style:italic">do stuff</span>". FA would get his penis out which was erect. Y had touched it once, "<span style="font-style:italic">he grabbed my hand, it felt horrible"</span>. Y is recorded as having said that FA asked her to go on his X-box and then started rubbing her leg. He asked her to "<span style="font-style:italic">suck his willy</span>" a couple of times when she was about 10 years old. She said the last act of abuse was when she was laid on the bed watching TV.  He came in, grabbed her hand and tried kissing her.</p>

The local authority contrast this with the evidence of FA, GM, GF and her sister X.

GF went as far as to shout out &#8220;drama queen!&#8221; during Y&#8217;s oral evidence.

There was, I found, a straight forward and plain quality to her answers in interview which was repeated in her evidence before me. There were occasions when she could have easily added to the descriptions which she had given, she did not do so.</p>

In 2011 Y had received a sum in compensation after she was raped by Ali. This knowledge has fuelled the suggestion that her complaint against FA was and is financially motivated. While it was put to Y that the resurrection of the allegations in 2014 was financially motivated FA, GM and X have all accepted that she had not been motivated by money when she had first made the allegations in 2009. I accept the local authority&#8217;s submissions that they had little option. Those complaints made by Y in 2009 were long before there was ever any suggestion that Y was aware of criminal injuries compensation.  In addition Y had confided in school friends that she was suffering sexual abuse before the complaints were made to the police in 2009. In any case Y did not receive compensation monies until after Ali was convicted in 2011. </p>

In 2009 FA was not living in the home of GM and GF by then and had not done so for some time. I can see no reason for Y to make false allegations against FA to avoid living with GM and GF when he was no longer there; in any case she returned to live with them later that year. By the time Y made the allegations against FA to the social worker, and then to the police, she was over 16 years old and could leave to live with her mother or elsewhere if she wanted to. Moreover Y had previously confided in school friends about the sexual abuse that she was experiencing. Y had asked her friends to keep her confidence and her friends abided by her request which is incongruent with making false claims in order to be able to leave home.  Her behaviour is more consistent with a victim of abuse victim who felt shame and embarrassment. The local authority submitted that the emergence of allegations by Y against FA in 2009 is consistent with her having reached an age and finding herself in a situation where she felt able to speak about her experiences, in circumstances where she was unable to previously. </p>

It is the local authority&#8217;s case that the retraction was as a result of pressure placed on Y and Z by their grandmother. There is evidence before this court that prior to 2009 both Y and Z had made some attempts to tell their grandmother of sexual abuse by FA.  Y had described telling GM but her grandmother telling her to shut up.  This is corroborated by what she told BP at the time.  Y described Z trying to tell GM that FA had tried to do something. GM was described as having slapped Z on another occasion when she tried to tell her about FA.  In her oral evidence GM denied either Y or Z had ever said anything to her.  This conflicts with her statement to this court when she referred to Z having told her of abuse by FA, although she had added that Z then said she had made it up and "<span style="font-style:italic">I could never get to the bottom of what she was talking about"</span>.</p>

The submission of the local authority that there are three particular events which, if accepted by the court, convey the pressure placed on Y to withdraw her allegations of sexual abuse against FA has some force. Each involved GM, the first in time was the visit to MA's home after Y's complaints in 2009; the second was Y's oral evidence at the Ali trial in 2011 and the third was the visit to the hospital after the birth of Y&#8217;s child in April 2013.

She was at the time a vulnerable young person, who did not have any family support and in those circumstances it would have been very difficult to press on with her complaints. She was susceptible to her grandmother&#8217;s threats, such as those witnessed by MG.

When considering the wider context of Y withdrawing her complaints in 2009 the effect of GM&#8217;s pressure on her do so, coupled with her disbelief of anything Y said about FA was more likely than not to have resulted in the suppression of the allegations.  </p>

Counsel for FA seeks to rely on this evidence as proof that Y has previously made serious allegations of sexual assault which were not true. This young man when he came to give evidence told me that it was because he had been led to believe that he was being accused in court of sexually assaulting Y and that that was the reason he had, reluctantly, come to give evidence.

GM said that she had spoken to Y about Facebook messages that Y&#8217;s brother had sent denying that he was anything like his sister Z.

Her actions show that she cared little or nothing for Y and had no interest in what she may be going through. Y was older by this time and living independently from her grandparents. The Facebook messages she sent shed some light on Y&#8217;s motivation. In her Facebook message to FA on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013 Y repeatedly refers to his having messed up her life and that he had not even said he was sorry or why he did it to her; it refers to her lying in court not for him &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">but for grandma</span>&#8221;.

I pause here to reflect that MA found Z difficult to deal with and it is not disputed that she would on occasion refuse to have her at a weekend when she, Z and Y were to stay with their mother. Any suggestion that MA is party to Z fabricating stories about GM and GF is undermined by the fact that MA did not want Z to stay with her.

After the assault was over he gave her a bottle of pop that he kept in his room. Z says that she remembered feeling sick.

Ms Begum said that Z was not allowed to get a drink without first asking her grandmother&#8217;s permission. It is likely that Z would have gone to ask FA for a drink; he would not have been kept short of pop. Z&#8217;s demeanour on the DVD is of a young woman distressed by what she is recalling.

FA was unable or unwilling to consider or show any insight into the effect of the trial and giving evidence on Y and Z. He betrayed no understanding, if he had any, of the effect on Y of having to answer questions about the Ali trial; indeed he, like the others dismissed her distress as he said she was putting it on. FA was unable to tell the court what his reaction had been to (what on his case would be) the shocking allegations) made by Y; he said he could not remember. Nor could he remember the effect that Y&#8217;s denial of any abuse had had on him after she had given evidence in the Ali trial. This apparent lack of recall of what would, on his case, be strong reactions undermined his credibility.</p>

In any case he would have been at home for meals, to sleep and to go to his room to play on his computer or to do his school work. There is no reason why his parents would not go out leaving all the children at home whether it was to shop, take one or another child to appointments, take the dogs out or any other of a myriad of reasons why parents have to leave even for a short time.

These factors are aetiological. It is highly likely that members of her family themselves suffer personality dysfunction. Her mother, sister and uncle like [Z] are all involved with Social Care in respect of their children. [Z]&#8217;s grandparents may, given her description of them, subscribe to personality dysfunction furthermore. In addition, [Z]&#8217;s mother is said to abuse alcohol and be depressed, her sister abuses alcohol and her brother abuses alcohol and drugs. It is of course very difficult to disentangle genetic effects from those of poor parenting.  Again, [Z] endured a quite appalling childhood in most respects, and it is difficult to imagine how any young person would emerge with their personality unscathed. An unrealistic degree of robustness and resilience would be required to escape the consequences of such an upbringing. Neither did she benefit from protective factors, such as an unusual degree of intelligence, a particular talent, or positive support from an adult outside the family. As [Z] has indicated regrettably services failed to protect her, she was abused by her parents and grandparents throughout. I do tend to accept [Z]&#8217;s account of what happened given the nature and degree of personality disorder. Apart from physical and emotional abuse, [Z] also suffered sexual abuse and no one protected her from this. Regarding [Z]&#8217;s father, he played no part in her early life, and when she did go to him for help he suggested an incestuous relationship. There seems to have been no one who protected or cared for [Z] during her childhood as they should have done and I reiterate it is difficult to understand how any young person could have survived this. [Z]&#8217;s genetic background and her childhood adversity are, I would emphasise to her, not her fault.&#8221;</span></p>

Y did not claim to know what electronic or other device that FA took obscene pictures of her with and his own identification of a particular mobile phone is self serving and does not detract from her evidence about how the pictures were taken and what he said and did at the time. Sexual abuse is in essence furtive and clandestine, within families it invariably takes place when the opportunity arises for the perpetrator within the family home which includes when other members of the family are present in the same house. The descriptions of what was said to the children by their uncle is consistent with grooming and the threats about being in trouble would all too readily be believed by children who were aware they were not the favourites in the household.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consistency of Y&#8217;s evidence is supported by that of her school-friends. Although proof of complaint rather than the acts of abuse themselves they are evidence that something distressing was happening to Y and that she told them her uncle was abusing her. The fact that they kept their counsel at her request is in keeping with their ages at the time. There is no easily perceptible reason for them to have come to court to lie. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that Y and Z retracted their complaints in the past can be explained by the pressure put on them by their grandmother. I prefer their evidence to hers. She contradicted herself in her evidence and attempted to build her case until her evidence amounted to her having been housebound for years if her account is to be believed. I do not believe her. GM was unabashed in her views about her granddaughters, young women that she had been responsible for bringing up, as liars and fabricators. The evidence of MG directly supports that of Y in respect to GM putting pressure in 2009. I accept the evidence of Y that GM did so again in 2011 at the Ali trial and again in 2013 hours after the birth of Y&#8217;s baby. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept the evidence of Z in respect of physical abuse at the hands of both her grandparents. GM denials about hitting Z with a belt were undermined by her introduction in oral evidence of further excuses for using a belt to threaten Z. GM&#8217;s 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> statement contained no allegations that Z had been winding Y up about being raped although it contained many negative references to Z which sought to blame Z for the difficulties she had endured in her childhood. GM told the social worker that she had beaten Z with a belt shortly afterward and it is recorded in the social services records. It is highly regrettable that Kirklees did not take action as they should have done at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition I find that as children, both Y and to a greater extent Z were starved of love and affection; they were not protected by their mother or their grandparents; the latter abused the children and neglected their emotional well-being with results that are all too obvious in the difficulties that these two young women now face. X has her own difficulties and it is more likely than not that she had suffered significant harm as child herself; at the very least by being brought up in such a dysfunctional household where her sisters were treated so badly. X would have been aware of their distress and the physical abuse by GM and GF.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not able to find that GM and GF knowingly failed to protect Y and Z from sexual abuse. I do find that since 2009 GM and GF failed to do anything to deal with the effects of sexual abuse and that GM exacerbated the emotional abuse that is part of persistent intra-familial sexual assault by then pressurising Y and Z to retract their allegations. She has repeatedly failed her granddaughters and subjected them to emotional abuse, as has GF; that must include X whose children are now subject to these proceedings as a result of their mother&#8217;s difficulties which, in turn, have impaired her ability to safely parent K and L.</p>
