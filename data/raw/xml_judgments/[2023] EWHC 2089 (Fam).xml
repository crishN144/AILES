A stay was granted by Mostyn J and has been extended right up until today's hearing. Because the Grounds of Appeal significantly attacked the way that the court conducted the fact- finding hearing a transcript was ordered of the entire hearing.  It was the late application for that transcript, together with a delay in its production, that has largely led to the unacceptable delay in hearing this appeal. There have been what seem to me to be an unprecedented number of directions orders, 10 in all of which eight were made by Mostyn J.</p>

The appellant was represented by very experienced counsel who did not at any point submit that the appellant, on account of being heavily pregnant, should not give oral evidence, or be cross-examined, or should be questioned by alternative means. Both the procedural rules and the common law set the gold standard for establishing the truth of contested facts to be oral evidence tested by cross-examination. The forensic process in all forms of litigation is adversarial although there is in children case an inquisitorial overlay based on the child&#8217;s welfare. I reject these Grounds as totally without merit inasmuch as they imply that the Recorder&#8217;s conduct was personally inappropriate. </span></p>

I will grant PTA on this limited basis, although I am doubtful that it will succeed. As reformulated, these grounds are certainly not strong for the purposes of the Wenden principles.</span></p>

Indeed the appellant positively decided not to pursue allegation No. 4. On the other hand it is clear that the appellant was not happy at being deprived of the opportunity of pursuing all the allegations, even though the scope of the pleaded matters greatly exceeded what the court had permitted in its interlocutory case management directions. This is quite a difficult issue where different aspects of the overriding objective pull in conflicting directions. I therefore grant PTA on this ground.

I do not accept that argument either. It is only during the course of the testing of evidence does it become apparent that an argument is false. The judge heard all the evidence and concluded that in one regard in particular, the mother had deliberately misled the court, namely by alleging that the father had told her that he had been sexually abused by his parents and then asked her not to repeat the allegation. The father had denied he ever said any such thing. </p>

In my judgment, there can be no criticism of the judge for reaching and expressing a conclusion on this allegation.

It will determine J&#8217;s future and will very likely influence the future of the unborn child, for whom proceedings are also contemplated.  A hearing in these circumstances is bound to be exceptionally stressful for a person in this young mother&#8217;s position, and her experience of her first pregnancy can only exacerbate matters.  Her evidence will doubtless be significant, and she will face cross-examination. The Local Authority has suggested that she need not attend court in person and that she could give evidence by video link and attend the rest of the hearing &#8220;from the comfort of her own home&#8221;.  This overlooks the important fact that a party participating in a court hearing remotely is still attending court and should be able to engage fully with the process.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The mother is in any event entitled to expect that she could attend for the whole of the hearing in person if she wants, and certainly that she should be able to choose to attend court to give evidence</span><span style="font-style:italic">: indeed we are told that the court was willing to accommodate that. </span>[emphasis added]</p>

The difficulty began when the court imposed a date, despite being told of the mother&#8217;s situation and that of her advocate.  At the hearing itself, the starting point was to identify the likely practical arrangements for the hearing, but that did not happen.  A general intention to allow breaks in proceedings, whatever their format, does not remedy the position if the hearing should not be taking place at all.  Then, no adequate consideration was given to the mother&#8217;s anxiety, expressed with moderation, at the prospect of having to participate in such a heavy hearing during her last month of pregnancy.  Rather than engaging with her concerns, the Judge told her that it would be better for her if the hearing went ahead, and he did not refer to the fact that she would be doing so without her advocate of choice in a case with a long history.  The approach taken was that a person in her position could accommodate the court process, provided allowances were made.  </span></p>

In fact though, whether or not The Women&#8217;s Organisation had raised the matter, there is a duty imposed on the court by, in combination, s.63 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 and the effect of Part 3A and PD3AA.  As appears above, s.63 of the Domestic Abuse Act requires that where a person is, or is at risk of being, a victim of domestic abuse, the court to proceed on the assumption that their participation in proceedings and evidence will be diminished because of vulnerability.</span></p>

She said that the court needs to grapple with every allegation of abuse, as they were all relevant to the question of the impact upon the mother and the child. If the mother was the victim of abuse, then there is a heightened risk to her and the child, and the judge should not unilaterally and arbitrarily have decided that the allegations should be pruned. The allegations of sexual abuse were relevant to the child's welfare and should be heard as they were relevant to risk.</p>

Dr Proudman did not accept that it was not a relevant allegation. She says that it illustrated a pattern of behaviour on the part of the father and goes to the whole issue of whether or not the mother could trust the father. It was an important allegation which the judge should have dealt with.</p>

The judge wished the mother to be selective about her allegations as set out in sections 3 and 4 (see paragraph 5 above). During the course of the hearing, there was debate about the number of allegations to be determined. The mother offered to forgo the allegations of sexual abuse of her to be replaced by the allegations set out in Section 3. To try and curtail further discussion, the judge eventually determined that she would leave in all the allegations under Section 4, save for the issue of the father&#8217;s virginity. </p>

I take the view that this very difficult hearing was conducted fairly and in accordance with the way that the mother wished, given her condition.  I do not accept that her vulnerabilities were not properly taken into account, and nor do I accept that the court failed in its duty to protect her. I have no doubt that the case was a great strain for the mother.  Everyone appreciated that. It does not follow that an adjournment would in any way have reduced the strain upon her. She was entitled to take her own view as to whether the case continued or not. The judge always made it clear that the health of the unborn child must take priority and at all times the advice of the mother's treating team was followed.</p>
