A mere general reference to a web site is not enough to find publication. Deschamps J observed that excluding hyperlinks from the scope of the publication rule is an inadequate solution to the novel issues raised by the Internet. The blanket exclusion exaggerates the difference between references and other acts of publication, and treats all references, from footnotes to hyperlinks, alike, thereby disregarding the fact that references vary greatly in how they make defamatory information available to third parties and, consequently, in the harm they can cause to people&#8217;s reputations. </p>

As Abella J observed the hyperlink communicates something exists but a further act is required before access is gained to it.

Mr Dean rightly referred the court to this decision but it does not assist in the situation this court is dealing with, as the context was limited to what facts could be left to a jury in a defamation action. I accept it could be said that the publication of the judgment citation together with the hyperlink is sufficient but, in my judgment, that does not equate with publishing the full judgment in connection with any identifying information relating to the children. It comes very close, but in the circumstances where this court is dealing with in proceedings involving contempt the position needs to be unambiguous.   </p>

The question is whether if a person publishes a hyperlink to material is that equivalent to publishing the material itself. He submits it doesn&#8217;t for the following reasons. The publisher of the hyperlink does not, in fact, publish the material. The publisher has no control over the content of the material, which may be changed or removed at any time and the publisher of the hyperlink did not cause the material to be published.

The matter was listed at 9.45 this morning. There has been a delay because when the court convened at 9.45, Ms Root indicated that she had decided to represent herself and to discharge her counsel and solicitors who have represented her since March 2018.   </p>

She confirmed she had no criticism of her legal team, accepted they had done a good job and that she wanted to rely on the written submissions from Mr Dean. After about three adjournments, Ms Root confirmed that she wanted to represent herself. Having sought confirmation from Mr Dean and his solicitor that it did not put them in a difficult position Ms Root accepted the invitation of the court that they remain in court, available to her if she required them. The court is enormously grateful to Mr Dean and his instructing solicitor, Ms Weir, for their assistance today. They have both been present during this hearing.  After Ms Root had finished her oral submissions, the court gave her a short adjournment to enable her to seek any further advice or guidance from them.  They rightly reminded her to refer to Mr Dean&#8217;s written submissions, which Ms Root fully supported and did not take any issue with their content.   </p>

Ms Root was a party to those proceedings and had legal representation, as did the children.  Final care orders were made in 2011 and the children, now young adults, are still in receipt of support and guidance from the local authority.  Ms Root has never accepted that decision and, between 2011 and 2016, sought to challenge it by making applications to discharge the care order and for contact, and unsuccessfully pursued appeals against the refusal of her applications.  </p>

Injunction orders have been in place since December 2011, in effect prohibiting publication of court papers and information relating to the proceedings about the children, in particular in a way that would identify them.  Those orders have been varied since, but the message that underpins them is the same.  This court and the previous courts which have dealt with this have been satisfied that such material (including quite personal information) being made public has caused each of the children enormous distress. The updated statement from the team manager responsible for both the children, confirms that it continues to do so.   </p>

On 11 May having considered the mitigation from Mr Dean, who represented Ms Root, I imposed a six-month prison sentence for each of the two breaches I considered to be the more serious and a three-month sentence for the other two breaches, all to run concurrently. The total sentence imposed was six months, suspended for twelve months on condition of compliance with the orders I made that day.  In my judgment I stated the following:  </p>

He set out the details in relation to her medication and the need for monitoring, which she has and could, if required, be made available to the prison authorities.  I have no doubt if the court imposed an immediate custodial sentence this would cause Miss Root some considerable anxiety, but her medical and psychological position would be monitored.  I have factored in the risks that are said to be to her financial situation and her accommodation, but I have no real details of what those risks would be. I note these features have been part of her mitigation since August 2017 yet, despite that impact on others, she has chosen not to change her behaviour, despite all the efforts of the court, and possibly her wider family, to encourage her to do so.  </p>

I have reached that conclusion because, having explored all other options, which have sadly been ignored by Ms Root, the position has been reached that only an immediate custodial sentence is likely to secure compliance with the court orders and mark what the court has said about the consequences of repeated noncompliance with court orders.  I have carefully considered Ms Root&#8217;s personal position, the impact on her, on her family, on her accommodation, on her health, but, as I have said, these are all matters that have been known to her for some considerable time.  The position in relation to her health is that an immediate custodial sentence, whilst it will cause her some health </p>

However, despite the court&#8217;s efforts, there has been no change in her behaviour.  On one view, there has been, and continues to be, an escalation.   </p>

In relation to the new breaches, I have taken the view that I will impose a consecutive sentence of three months for each of the breaches, each of which will run concurrently but consecutively to the six-month sentence, so that there will be a total immediate custodial sentence of nine months&#8217; imprisonment.   </p>

It will be open to her to be able to apply back to this court at any time during the currency of that sentence to purge her contempt.

If that step was taken, there may be some prospect of her restoring her relationship with her children. Without Ms Root taking that step, which she would easily do and is within her control, what she seeks to achieve, namely some kind of relationship with her children, is likely to remain unfulfilled.  </p>
