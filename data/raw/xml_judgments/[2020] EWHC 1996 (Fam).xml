	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the judgment in the case of D.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2018, so just over two years ago, H - who was just eight weeks old - was found dead in her cradle at home.  Whilst initially it was thought she had died from a cot death, later inquiries revealed extensive multiple injuries.  Subsequently her parents (CD and E) were arrested and later still charged with murder.  Very much later, considering the evidence including two psychological reports, the prosecution offered no evidence against the mother and she was acquitted on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2019, after nearly 16 months.  H&#8217;s father E was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum recommendation of 20 years.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with the welfare of J, born on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006.  He (J) is H&#8217;s much older half-brother.  He is the son of the mother and CP and has lived with - as they were at the time - very close friends of the mother (Mr and Mrs X) since those events in June 2018.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has followed a trajectory unlike any other I have been involved with in over forty years.  The final hearings for one reason or another have been adjourned, and the mother&#8217;s acquittal in October last year which one might have thought to have substantially cleared the way to reunification has not in fact occurred. Uniquely, this case has required a hearing - in fact a remote hearing - which began on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020 to establish J&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings with regard not just to contact but more importantly to where he would live.  That has become necessary because his expressed wishes and feelings changed, at least as far as the court was concerned, apparently very abruptly in January 2020, and in particular in relation to his mother and his mother&#8217;s family.  It is now clear to me in fact that those perspectives were founded in much earlier events when there were clearer expressions of what was taking place within his foster carer&#8217;s home, and it has become necessary for there to be an inquiry as to the role of his foster carers Mr and Mrs X, they after all have been caring for him.  J has moved from a position of having supervised contact with his mother and family to a position where in fact he was refusing to have any contact at one stage at all, and those expressions were impervious to further inquiry.   </p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The way in which this inquiry has come about has been significantly fuelled, indeed I suspect triggered, by Mr and Mrs X&#8217;s and J&#8217;s refusal to comply with my order of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January which envisaged a modest and uncontroversial  gradual and gentle reintroduction of unsupervised face-to-face contact.  However, there was also a growing body of evidence - which as far as I can tell only slowly came to light - which justifiably gave rise to question whether the placement with Mr and Mrs X was or indeed has been in reality the right placement for J at all.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event during the course of this hearing, having heard Mrs X giving evidence over some two days, what had previously been unfathomable and apparently inexplicable ,became much clearer, and indeed I commented as much, through the prism of Mr X&#8217;s evidence.  Importantly, additionally Mr X at the conclusion of his evidence - having been cross-examined by Miss Grief QC, in enquiries made by me - made it clear that he thought that it was ludicrous that J was still living with them after two years and that it should be sorted out and that he should be living with either of his parents.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority - whose position has not always been completely easy to understand at least from my perspective, and about which I make no findings at this stage because much of the evidence is untested - nonetheless now say that it is their clear view that J should leave the home where he has been living for the last two years.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, it is clear that the situation where he has been living with Mr and Mrs X has been - at least to the court - somewhat masked, and the situation in my judgment has become increasingly toxic.  It is a strong word which I believe I may have used earlier in this case, but which I am satisfied properly portrays the environment in which J has been living.   </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority maintains - and indeed there is no contest about it - that it is necessary for J to leave Mr and Mrs X&#8217;s home and go and live somewhere else.  In fact, the current situation is urgent and inevitable.  No one submits to the contrary.  Whilst the parties or some of them have made submissions on the evidence as to the current circumstances, in fact the issue of placement, significantly, has rather resolved itself during the course of the last 10 days.  The reality is that this hearing has not just cleared the mist on J&#8217;s perspectives but has in fact been the key which has unlocked the door to the way forward.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs X and the mother were the best of friends but, as became clear during the evidence, the relationship had a closeness - indeed an intensity - which was unusual.  The loss of that friendship, for whatever reason, continues to cause enormous, seismic even, emotional upset and disturbance for Mrs X. Inevitably when the mother&#8217;s life unravelled two years ago, it was Mrs X to whom she turned, and it was in fact the Xs who cared for J where as I say he has remained.  The Xs were of course not approved as foster carers, so the whole statutory process was invoked leading ultimately, after assessment, to approval.  It does make what subsequently appears to have developed all the more surprising, but that is undoubtedly for another day.   </p>

My instincts - honed over four decades in family law - told me, when I heard of the reactions to my order of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2020, that it was necessary for J to move home, whatever its advantages or his expression, and that is especially so since of course I then learnt that Mr and Mrs X gave notice of terminating the placement.  The evidence which I have heard subsequently, revealed and demonstrates comprehensively and conclusively that those initial thoughts and instincts were entirely correct.   </p>

I also wish to record without embarrassment that it is a very long time since the court has heard such effective inquiry into two witnesses.  It may be the material was there, but the material needed marshalling, and the approach taken revealed layer by layer how the household run by Mr and Mrs X functions and functioned, both its strengths and its vulnerabilities.  Importantly, it revealed almost completely those aspects which I was primarily concerned with, which is why J expressed himself in the way in which he did and why in fact it was so unfathomable.   </p>

Mr X gave evidence over one, but his evidence was not completed because by that stage the conclusion of the court was inevitable.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of giving evidence remotely over long days, nor of the strain of the proceedings, nor of the strain of their own personalities and priorities.  However, inevitably it seems to me that I conclude that it is clear beyond any doubt that Mr and Mrs X have, have had and continue to have strong negative views about the mother and that was evident from everything that they told the court: from their demeanour, from their affect, from the way in which they gave evidence, and from the content of their evidence.  Indeed Mr X made really no attempt to conceal it.  He demonstrated what seemed to me to be little short of open hostility and barely controlled anger.   </p>

Currently and indeed historically, Mrs X has refused to sit in the same room as the mother&#8221; on the basis of all the lies that the mother has told in the criminal trial.&#8221;   </p>

Mrs X also suggested that the references to anger at the criminal trial related to the impact of the arrest and subsequent events on J, but frankly that was completely unconvincing and seemed to me to be a rationalisation after the event.   </p>

However, it is just one of many instructive parts of the evidence.  Mrs X sought to suggest that her anger had evolved, and clearly it has.  However, it is clear that many of the complaints raised by Mrs X were not reflected by J himself, and I am sure that that lies at the foundation of his apparent confusion.   </p>

Mrs X spoke of her own feelings of anxiety in relation to the contact, and indeed went on to say that she was exhausted by the relent less game play, notwithstanding the fact that J appeared to enjoy contact and contact went well, and there is nothing to suggest the contrary.  Mrs X was unable to even sit in the same room as the mother, so a performance had to take place whereby all the LAC reviews took place on different days, and it was clear that Mrs X requiring notice of who was to attend any meeting and who was to attend at contact meetings was about her own anxieties and had got really nothing to do with, it seemed to me, the welfare of J.   </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">sense - what has taken place, in supporting his wife as best he sees it.  He was unable to think of any reason why J might feel uncomfortable, or conflicted in having video contact ;  it seemed to me he was either misleading me or utterly devoid of insight, or ultimately, I have concluded, more likely both.  He was hostile during the course of evidence.  His evidence was difficult to listen to.  He seemed to me to be a strong forceful barrier, frustrating contact at every level, choosing not to comply with court orders.  He was the one who made it quite clear that he was not going to have anything to do with &#8220;that woman&#8221; that he did not trust her as far as he could throw her, and in relation to a number of issues - for example the most recent issue which finally led the local authority to finally do something ( the situation in relation to the headphones) - speaks volumes. Whilst he said that he remained present because J needed that support, in reality it was because Mrs X got wound up when any contact was taking place.  I am satisfied that his conduct in this case has become increasingly obstructive, belligerent and offensive, deliberately so, it was designed to affect the relationship between J and his mother, and even J and the social worker.  So within the household, there were two very different dynamics: someone who is very close to J who was highly emotional and found it very difficult to deal with the situation, and her husband who was supportive of her and controlling.  J somehow had to make sense of both of those dynamic pressures.   </p>

It is clear that as soon as Mr and Mrs X were forewarned about the prosecution offering of no evidence in the criminal trial at the end of September 2019 - curiously even before the mother knew herself about it - they indicated that they would not support unsupervised contact.  She set out her position to the social worker on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019, saying that whilst they no longer wished to put themselves forward as long term carers &#8211; (that also was not disclosed to the court or indeed anybody else, as far as I can tell, until much later - with the mother out of prison), any sort of unsupervised or supported contact would not be manageable.  She said the mother would approach them and make them feel uncomfortable, Mrs X was worried about her reaction to the mother in front of J.  As far as I can remember, none of that was brought to the court&#8217;s attention.  On the same occasion Mrs X was saying that she would not have anything to do with mother and that they were no longer really prepared to help in, for example, transport and the like.   </p>

There will be no unsupervised contact in our house.  We have always made it clear there will be no unsupervised contact, and it is an absolute no-no&#8221;, that they did not want&#8221; that woman&#8221; infiltrating their family and their home, they did not trust her, and they did not want her to have any unsupervised contact.

So, in that context of trying to take things slowly and trying to avoid feeling awkward, it is entirely understandable how the enormous negativity that has arisen or apparently arisen as expressed through him - although in fact not really evidenced.  </p>

In the middle part of 2019 in relation to a discrete  inquiry( as to whether or not he ought to be living with his father,) it is especially troubling that after the earlier interviews Mrs X developed a nonverbal signal or system whereby J could indicate if he was not comfortable with something and therefore either the specific inquiry or even I think the entire meeting could be terminated.   </p>

He was clear that he wished to see his father, but did not want to live with him because he did yet &#8221; not massively know him,&#8221; and indeed his position today is that he very much values the relationship with his father but it is a developing one.  Of course, all those expressions were on the basis that in fact he did not know (and indeed I had not been told )that Mr and Mrs X were not putting themselves forward as carers,  indeed I think he only learnt that as far as I know within the last few days.   </p>

It was difficult because Mrs X had clearly made it her business to point out - she herself working through the website and the information that had been given to her - that the mother had lied in the criminal trial, ( indeed that was her reason for not sitting in the same room with her,) and that the conversation and details that she had discussed with J - wholly inappropriately &#8211; were of  the different levels and standards of proof; because when J was discussing it with his mother ,and the mother tried to explain it  to him, it clearly was at odds with what he had already been told, and indeed the meeting became increasingly  difficult , when it should not have been.  It should have been quite the reverse.  So, J was upset, he took the view that his mother had lied to him in the meeting.  The only basis I conclude for him coming to that conclusion must have been what he had been told by Mrs X.  There cannot be any other conclusion.  This should have been a seminal meeting for the mother and J, but that was not to be.   </p>

She described it as a &#8220;pantomime&#8221; that would flair up his anxiety, she described the mother&#8217;s reasonable request as &#8220;mind games&#8221;.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The next pivotal moment occurred on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2020.  Despite the fact the guardian had visited J only a week earlier, the social worker also visited J and interviewed him alone.  It seems to me that the value of that discussion was correctly observed to be undermined by Mrs X&#8217;s actions that day, because she made it clear during the email which she sent shortly after the school run that she had been feeling really anxious about the whole situation with court and unsupervised contact; and of most significance, J asked her if he stayed with her would she allow him to have contact with the mother, and Mrs X had replied &#8220;Well, yes, but only if it was supervised.&#8221;  J understandably had asked her why.  She said it was because she was unhappy with the mother&#8217;s behaviours.  Asked if she would consider letting him having unsupervised contact with the mother later on but only if he felt comfortable with it, Mrs X said that she would but only if she saw a marked improvement in the mother&#8217;s behaviour, &#8220;We would reconsider it at a later time.&#8221;  I think she put that at &#8220;at least six months&#8221;.  J immediately acquiesces with her view.  He said &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not important to have unsupervised contact at the moment&#8221;, and he preferred it to be supervised.  It is clear later - as she said in evidence - that she assumed that he wanted her (Mrs X) to verbalise it for him.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The social worker&#8217;s discussion with J revealed - as was the case before the court on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January when I made the decision - that J was unable to explain some of the things that he was saying, and there was that dichotomy which was before the court.  He consistently shrugged his shoulders and said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; when asked about the possibility of unsupervised contact.  He said he could not say why he wanted to extend the transition plan now to the summer, and he could not explain what his reservations were.  His main reason was not to feel awkward.  Obviously and inconsistent with what he was saying was that he had expressed an entirely different view until just a few weeks before, and indeed all the observations of contact were such that contact seems to have gone well and he appears to have enjoyed it.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The social worker understandably found it hard to get a sense of what J really wanted because his presentation did not match what he was saying,  she had a strong sense that he was not allowed certain things that were important to him if he was returned to the mother, and the social worker described him - correctly I think - as conflicted.  That was how it was presented to the court.   </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">should take place.  In fact, so much of the information was not made available to me However, it seems that my view was imparted to Mr and Mrs X, and there was some discussion with them I understand by telephone that day.  They were called from court precincts.  They were described, I have noted, that they were&#8221; giving some leeway on some conditions&#8221;, all of which indicates pretty clearly what was going on, although perhaps the full significance of it was not apparent.  None of that was brought to my attention. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">So, a meeting which took place at school, at which J now gave a totally different account.  He said - amongst other things - he did not want to go home, he did not want unsupervised contact, he would not go unless it was supervised, and that the judge was forcing him.  He said that he did not feel safe, he said that he could not be himself, and that the mother would &#8220;overstep his boundaries and ask me personal questions&#8221;.  He was not able to explain in really any detail what that meant.  He said that he would know that boundaries had been stepped over by the feeling he gets, and he struggled to explain what he meant by &#8220;be myself&#8221;.  He further said that he did not want to live with his mother because &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if she will move to Oxford, and I probably won&#8217;t have contact with my father&#8221;, it is clear that there were a number of other discussions which were not recorded and which I have subsequently been made aware of.   </p>

He did not want unsupervised contact because the mother can be controlling and he did not trust her.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January the court was confronted by a really very delicate situation.  Despite intuitively suspecting what was going on and taking a really very dim view of the approach of Mr and Mrs X, absent any evidence about what was actually taking place (&#8217;though all the evidence was there), it seemed to me that I had to take a pragmatic decision,  anxious about the apparent  fragility of J in his current placement.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Extraordinarily, whilst I am told still giving judgment late in the day, Mrs X then went to school and met J from contact where he was about to be taken to contact but for some reason did not go, and it was the following day on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January that a letter was produced from J to the court saying that he did not want unsupervised contact and wanted to stay with Mr and Mrs X.  Of course, subsequently, it seems, to me there were the events of the Covid 19 pandemic which have made matters even worse.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Having listened to and recorded only some of the events , I conclude without any  doubt as follows: that J was party to, and fully aware of the negative views held by Mr and Mrs X of the mother; that as late as 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January of this year he was actively expressing the view that he wished to live with his mother, but that has to be seen in what he was saying in relation to unsupervised contact; and that everything I have seen and the context of what I have heard and seen was that he was shielded from nothing by his carers, and was only too painfully aware of their views.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I acknowledge of course that Mr and Mrs X - well, Mrs X - sought to justify her position as to some of ways in which the mother had conducted herself.  However, I conclude that all of those assertions are subsequent justifications for the anxieties which Mrs X herself had and which had in fact arisen from the early information in 2018 and the tension caused by her acquittal (or the knowledge of the acquittal at the end of September).  I conclude that J was spoken to about the criminal trial and the acquittal of the mother in which she had&#8221; told lies. &#8220; The way in which Mrs X has expressed herself both then and later about her view about the relationship speaks volumes.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I record that the depth and feeling of fear and of hostility by Mrs X towards the mother is to my mind absolutely extraordinary and is not and has not been for a long time in the best interests of J.  All of which of course underscores and explains J&#8217;s total inability to articulate reasons for not wanting unsupervised contact.  His change of view in saying that living with the mother is not his first choice anymore , came about because he was aware - either because he had been told or he had heard or otherwise somehow knew- that Mr and Mrs X had given notice on the placement, even though they say that he was not aware of it.  It is inconceivable that he was not, having regard to the strength of feeling and of how affected they were by my decision.  But it was the court&#8217;s decision, not theirs.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The only conclusion that I can come to is that the lack of explanation from an otherwise highly articulate and intelligent, and emotionally intelligent young man is that he was simply unable to resolve the experience of living with Mr and Mrs X and of his mother, and that he was deeply conflicted between his main carer Mrs X and his mother.  As he says, &#8220;I have now realised that I won&#8217;t see them.&#8221;   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">So , finally, bringing these threads together,  I am clear that the evolution of J&#8217;s wishes and feelings has been affected , subverted, by the environment in which he has now lived for two years, and that his assertions - that is to say what he has been saying more recently - cannot now be relied upon as a true expression of in fact what he thinks at all.  It is clear beyond all doubt from the nature of the evidence of Mr and </p>

If one thinks about it,  when they gave notice on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2020 when the final hearing was not then until March demonstrates the depth of their feeling and how in fact they did not have J&#8217;s best interests at the forefront of their mind.  It seems to me he would have had to go and live somewhere else.  It might have been with his father, it might have been in foster care.  None of this was about him.  It was all about them.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I make it clear I shall give close consideration about how it was that Mr and Mrs X clearly took the view that the local authority supported their stance, and it is only very recently that that has been changed.  All of that - much of which seems to me to be overwhelmingly obvious from the evidence that has now been available - has been supported by events that have unfurled over the last few days.  The situation which was plain  to me on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, had all the evidence been made available, had there been some decent and proper evaluative thinking and decision , and which has become so crystal clear during examination of the evidence of Mr and Mrs X., could have largely been avoided.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally - and demonstrating how acute that situation was - since that time, J having been told that he will no longer be staying with Mr and Mrs X, he has chosen the option that he would want to live primarily in a house provided by his mother and cared for by his grandmother, and it should be remembered that his grandmother was someone with whom he has had a close relationship but who even with her he was also expressing some reservation.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not heard the grandmother giving any evidence, but I have of course seen and heard her during the course of this hearing.  She strikes me as a thoroughly sensible, intelligent, sensitive and forthright individual in whom J properly has considerable trust and affection.  He obviously loves her, and it is clear that he &#8220;does not mind&#8221; being cared for by her.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">All of that illustrates again beyond doubt that his expressions were created by the environment in which he lived, and which were, if I may say so, infected and manipulated by those that cared for him.  It is a good example of the danger of being primarily led by a young person&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings when all the other evidence and objective evaluative judgment suggests the opposite.  It clearly demonstrates that it needs to be put in the context of what is known at the time, and that may be something which will require further inquiry.  I do not know.  But at the present time, that is all I have to say.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">J clearly has to leave his current placement.  He clearly has to go and live somewhere else until I can decide further.  I very much hope that that can be done by and at the hearing at the end of July.  I see no reason why it cannot be.  I know nothing about the house secured by the mother or the circumstances of his care.  Various proposals have been put forward, of J being cared for by his grandmother for now in his mother&#8217;s new property, all of which seems to be very sensible and constructive.  In fact there seems to be a consensus between all of the parties as to what should occur, but the detail clearly needs working out.   </p>
