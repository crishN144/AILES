She was born in the country of Estonia. The father, LAB, was born on 4<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>February 1948 in England and is now 61 years of age. I believe from the papers, although there is not much information about it, that he may have been married before and had possibly one child, and possibly more than one child, by that marriage. There is a suggestion that such a child may be living in Spain. The parties met in Estonia in or about 1995 and began their relationship. The birth of T and J followed on the dates given above. Between the births of those two children, on 5<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>September 1998, the parties were married in the Register Office at Kidderminster in England. After the birth of those two children the parties moved to live in Spain. The marriage between the parents deteriorated and on the day when the mother was finally moving out of the family home and was taking chattels to the new accommodation, which she had prepared for herself and the children, the father, in her absence, wrongfully removed the children unilaterally from Spain to England. The date of that event was 24<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>September 2005. He accepts that this removal was without notice to the mother, and in breach of her rights to custody (as they would be called under the Hague Convention - I shall call that instrument &#8220;the Convention&#8221; simply for shorthand purposes.)</p>

On 30<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>July 2007 the court of first instance in Torremolinos made the orders to which I earlier referred. The father did not return the children to the care of the mother as required. There was a subsequent application to stay the order, but he was specifically ordered to return the children to their mother in Spain. The father continued and continues to be in contempt of those orders, I am told by his counsel that he was never served with the relevant order. Even if that is correct he knew, or must have known, of his obligations.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.32in;margin-right:0.09in">I have already referred to three dates, but it is necessary to set out in more detail a little of the history of those proceedings. Hearings took place, as earlier noted, on 6<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>February when there was preliminary examination of the mother's claim for residence. On 9<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>February there was the full inter-partes interim hearing concerning the father's claim for divorce, residence, contact and what we would call ancillary relief, both as between the spouses and in relation to the children. I have been supplied with a copy of the judgment of the Spanish court which I have read. It appears in the bundle. I invite attention by any other reader in particular to pages B98 and 99 of that bundle. As I have mentioned above, at that interim hearing the father was allowed to retain the children in England. On or about 23<span style="font-size:9pt">rd </span>May 2006 the public prosecutor became a party to the proceedings concerning the children, and represented their interests in that litigation. On 4<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>January 2007 there was a further full inter-partes hearing concerning all matters. A court-appointed psychologist had been required to see the children and had done so. On the occasion of the interview with the children it appears that, certainly in respect of T and possibly in respect of J, the mother acted as their translator, although it is suggested that some of the interview may have been conducted in Spanish. If it was not the mother who acted as translator for J, it may have been her then partner, M. Subsequent to that hearing, all parties were allowed to file written submissions on all of the evidence filed and the oral evidence heard. The mother and the public prosecutor did so, the father did not. On 30<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>July the order the subject of the appeal was made. On 29<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>October of that same year, the father issued a notice of appeal against the judgment and orders of 30<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>July. On 2<span style="font-size:9pt">nd </span>February 2008 the mother made application in Spain for the return of the children, which was ordered and again. On 21<span style="font-size:9pt">st </span>May 2008 a further order was made for the return of the children to Spain<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">. </span>On 2<span style="font-size:9pt">nd </span>June 2008 the order of 30<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>July was certified under the terms of the regulation. On 11<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>September 2008 the Spanish courts sent a certified copy of the order to the Kidderminster County Court. I regret to say they received no reply. Further enquiries were made by the Spanish court later that year on a date or dates unknown to me, and approaches were made to the British Liaison Judge in Madrid by the court in Torremolinos. Ultimately, this led to the order referred to above being registered. I have not referred to each and every aspect of the intermediate stages of this litigation, for to do so is unnecessary, but it gives the flavour of the timetable.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.32in;margin-right:0.08in">I have been supplied with and read a number of transcripts of the judgments from time to time of the Spanish courts. It is noteworthy, in my judgment, that, as can be gleaned from those Spanish judgments, the English and Spanish courts approach litigation concerning children in a way which corresponds with each other's principles and practice. Those correspondences include the principle that the welfare of the children the subject of the litigation is of the greatest significance, (here, we would say of paramount significance) and that their wishes and feelings, although not determinative, should be taken into account in deciding on arrangements for their future. So should their age, their needs, and the ability of their parents to meet those needs.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.32in;margin-right:0.1in">As to the ascertainment of the children's wishes and feelings, I have earlier described how they were elicited and that the public prosecutor, as party to the litigation, brought the material to the notice of the court. On 30<span style="font-size:9pt">th </span>July the Spanish court said this of that material:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:1.07in;margin-right:0.1in">&#8220;In the report made by the psychologist of Torremolinos courts (sic) after interviewing the parents and children, considered especially relevant because of its impartiality, exhaustivity (sic) and objectivity and because its take (sic) into account children's wish, it is recommended to grant care and custody order to the mother.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.32in;margin-right:0.1in">As is also clear from that judgment, the court, in hearing all of the oral evidence and considering the written material, paid considerable regard to the psychologist. The psychologist's interviews with the children were, as they note in their judgment (see pages C6-8 of the bundle), carried out as the psychologist deemed to be appropriate, with the minors and with their parents. They regarded the psychologist's evidence as &#8220;particularly relevant because of its impartiality, thoroughness and objectivity, and because it states the wishes and desires of the minors, is considered of interest, amongst other matters, to the resolution of the issues with which we are concerned.&#8221; That judgment went on to make certain observations about the father's physical care of the children, the way in which (as they found) the father had been controlling and not interested in encouraging communication between the children and the mother, and that he had used the minors as a means of pressurising the mother to return to him. Those findings were based, as I understand the judgment, particularly on the analysis of the psychologist. There was evidence, and indeed findings, to the effect that once he realised the reconciliation with the mother was not going to go ahead, he decided not to cooperate with her. He did not encourage contact and &#8220;there is evidence that he had been speaking ill of the mother and blaming her for the situation and separation&#8221;. They went on to recite other aspects of the psychologist's report to the effect that there is a strong emotional link between the mother and the children, as to her methods of raising them based on affection, communication and encouragement of independence, etc. They also noted the expressed wishes of the children. In respect of T it was suggested that she had not fully adapted to life in England and she was sad, and she can &#8220;be seen to be very worried about the family situation&#8221;. At that time J was clearly stating that his desire was to live in Spain with his mother. I do not set out in elaborate detail their findings on this material. Suffice it to say that in summary, as appears from the judgment C8, they found, consistent with the evidence of the psychologist, and on an examination of all of the material, that the position was indeed as the psychologist had reported, and for those reasons (and others which I need not recite) they transferred the residence of the children to their mother.</p>

Nor did he challenge the jurisdiction of the Spanish court. Indeed, he embraced it, though declining to obey their orders when he did not like the outcome.</p>

It refers, rather, to recognition being contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child. Merely to reconsider the best interests of the child would be to review the Belgian judgment (which is clearly welfare based) as to its substance, which is forbidden &#8230;. I have to take into account the best interests of M, but ultimately to consider whether recognition is manifestly contrary to English public policy. To say that something is contrary to public policy is a high hurdle, to which the Article adds the word 'manifestly'. This is an international convention and I must apply it purposively, giving appropriate weight to the word manifestly. Indeed, the judgment of the European Court in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Krombach v Bamberski </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 3 WLR 488" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 3 WLR 488</ref>, &#8230; although given in a very different context, affords some guidance.

Nevertheless, all issues of enforcement are for another day, and, provisionally, it seems to me that the English court, as the enforcing court, will have similar discretions as to the extent to which and terms upon which it enforces the order, as it would have when deciding how far to go in actual enforcement of an order of its own.&#8221;</p>

Article 24(3) [the current equivalent in the regulation I am considering being Art 31(3)] repeats, specifically in relation to the enforcement stage, that 'under no circumstances may a judgment be reviewed as to its substance'. So that embargo is as emphatic in relation to enforcement as to recognition. [I have made the same point already when setting out the relevant provisions of the regulation I am construing.] Article 24(2) [that is Art 31(2) of the regulation I am considering] imports into the enforcement stage the 'reasons' in Arts 15, 16 and 17. [that is now Arts 22, 23 and 24] Note, however, that whereas Art 15 employs imperative language ('shall not be recognised'), Art 24(2) is permissive: 'may be refused', although refusal may only be for one of the reasons specified in the stated Articles. It is, however, significant that reference to the Art 15 reasons is repeated in Art 24. The whole of section 2, Enforcement, only comes into operation when a judgment has been already recognised/registered and, accordingly, that it has been concluded that none of the Art 15(2) reasons apply. So the fact that Art 24(2) imports again the Art 15(2) reasons into the enforcement stage must indicate that a decision in relation to those reasons at the recognition/registration stage is not conclusive for the enforcement stage. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Art 15(2) all relate to past events and, essentially, to matters of fact and it is difficult to see how the reasons in those paragraphs could fall for reconsideration. Clearly, however, the facts under paras (e) and (f), which refer to a later judgment, could change if such a later judgment was given; and it seems to me at least possible that facts could change between the recognition/registration and enforcement stages such that enforcement would be manifestly contrary to public policy even though recognition/registration was not.</p>

To do so would be, in effect, to undermine the whole thrust and purpose of Brussels II and to substitute at the enforcement stage local 'principles' for the principles and decision of the State of origin. It would infringe the embargo in Art 24(3) against review as to substance, and would substitute local 'principles' as a reason for non- enforcement for the much more stringent reasons under Art 15.</p>

When the court enforces an order of its own, one of the powers it may exercise, actually or implicitly, is the power to vary. That power is not available when enforcing under Brussels II. Further, within a purely domestic case the welfare of the child must be paramount even in the enforcement process, although consideration of obedience to court orders is important too.</p>

The duty is to make the foreign judgment happen and there is only such discretion as fulfilment of that duty requires. &#8230; The position of the child, and of the adults, and the well-being of the child are all relevant. &#8230; But welfare is not paramount or even the primary consideration.&#8221;</p>

The importation of these Regulations into English domestic law has the effect, as it seems to me, that our own public policy must enshrine and give credit to the concept that the child's interests (as the judge in the court of recognition and enforcement may perceive them) are but an element in the equation, and thus that the policy must be save in the most exceptional of circumstances not to allow the foreign judgment to be subverted.&#8221;</p>

Without going into elaborate detail, the differences between the two may be illustrated by just one reference to the order that was there being sought to be enforced, I having decided that it should be registered. It was a consent order made by a Polish court on the basis of what they were told was the full consent of the mother and the father to the arrangements therein proved by that court. In fact, the mother was entertaining a grotesque fraud on the father and the court and was only ostensibly consenting to the order decree-ing, amongst other things, extensive contact between father and daughter on the basis that it would give her opportunity, which she quickly availed herself of, of fleeing the country with the child and disappearing for as long as she could. I shall, despite the factual differences, nevertheless take the liberty of citing a brief passage from it to illustrate the all too obvious point that there may come a time when an order of a member state is so stale (Miss Meyer's submission here) that, coupled with a variety of other powerful factors, a court would have to take a view in the light of welfare considerations as to whether or not that order should be recognised and/or enforced. Yet such a court would, in my judgment, remain powerfully constrained in so considering such an order by the necessary consideration of those matters set out in Art 23 of the regulation, and would not readily or easily depart from the underlying principles of the regulation.

It also seems to me, and perhaps I was in error in one of the passages I have read out is not emphasising that because it was so wholly exceptional a case it had fallen into the category of one of the grounds in Art 23 leading to non-enforcement on public policy grounds.</p>

The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy alongside the circumstances which give the court the discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child's rights and welfare. I would therefore respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in paragraph 32 above, save for the word 'overriding', if it is suggested the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</p>

Here it is the filtering lens of Art 23 of the regulation which must be looked through to see whether or not delay in combination with other powerful and exceptional factors might have led to a change in a child's life of such significance that the new scenario would amount to a reason for non-recognition of the kind identified in Art 23.</p>

My brother and I have talked between ourselves and we want to live in England because we have enjoyed living in England with our Dad. The statement that my mother has given is totally untrue. We did not speak Spanish to the psychiatrist. I was asked who I wanted to translate for me. I said my mother because I didn't really like her ex-boyfriend, M. She sat with me and translated what I said. I was asked who I wanted to live with. I said my Mom because I was worried of hurting her feelings. We would like someone to listen to us as we want to stay in England with our Dad and our friends, family. This is our home. We have spoken to Mom about staying in England but she is not listening to us. I have told her lots of times. We do love our Mom but we do not want to live with her, and we do not want to live in Spain. We want to stay in our home. I am looking forward to going to my new school in England. We have lots of hobbies in England we don't want to give up: horse riding (horsemanship), trampolining, Guides. My brother would like to continue his karate and swimming.

The children's letter to me (see paragraph 42 above) further undermines the father's submission, for T makes it clear that what was reported to the Spanish court was what she said in fact, namely that she stated she wanted to live with her mother in Spain, an assertion of wishes and feelings examined carefully by the psychologist and the court, even though T now seeks to put a gloss on the circumstances.

I am, as I understand Mr. Setright's position (although I shall be corrected if I am wrong) invited to permit a short period for the father to make necessary arrangements with the children for their transfer to Spain before going on to consider more formal methods of enforcement. I shall do so. I make it clear that in my judgment the facts and matters which have been raised before me cannot amount to a gateway to escape from the terms of the order of July 2007 as considered in the light of the underlying principles of the Convention and the relevant specific Articles of it.</p>

Even if I am wrong about that, I would not have so ordered in any event. In particular, it seems to me that at the heart of the submission is the need to hear the views of the children, consonant with the terms of paragraph 19 of the preamble to the regulation. But I have already received that information in the form of the letter set out in full in paragraph 42 above and thus that alleged deficiency in the material available to me falls away. I express no opinion one way or the other but leave it to another case on another day to decide the issue of whether or not Miss Meyer's submission that in default of that letter of information from the children, I would have been obliged to order a welfare report on wishes and feelings (at a minimum) before considering enforcement. These children have unquestionably had their voice heard. But, as the English and Spanish courts agree, such wishes and feelings are not of themselves necessarily determinative.</p>

It is open to him to apply to the Spanish courts for such a transfer, pursuant to the provisions of Art 15(2)(9) and to seek to persuade the Spanish court to transfer relevant aspects of the case under Art 15(1)(b).

I was making submissions on coercion and what would happen if that stage were reached, and I suggested it had not been reached at the moment and one might reasonably expect that the father (and I do not interpolate these words but I do now for clarity) faced with a decision in principle would then cooperate in the interests of the children in making provision for a regular and easy transfer, however much he may regret having so to do. So the short period was literally that, my Lord. It was a matter of a few moments, if my Lord gave the indulgence now, for the father to see whether he was able to agree proposals.
