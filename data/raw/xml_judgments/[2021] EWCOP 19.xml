	    <p style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.53in">The sole issue in this case is to determine whether it is in the best interests of CR to have a declaration made to enable the Applicant ('the CCG') to administer a vaccination to CR against Covid 19.  There is no dispute that CR does not have the capacity to make this decision himself. This is the first such application of which I am aware in this Region (and which geographically covers the North West of England). The application was made on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2021.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.53in">The CCG rely upon the following assertions to support its application.  It states that the professionals involved in the care of CR all share the opinion that it is in his best interests to have the vaccination.  These comprise his GP (Dr M); a clinical psychologist (Dr P);Dr B (CLDT); his social worker (Mr F); his community learning disability nurse (Mr K); the manager of the care home where he currently resides ('the care home'); his relevant persons representative (CW, and who is also his litigation friend in this application) and the author of a witness statement (Ms W) who is employed by the CCG  and which statement summarises the professional opinions of those listed above together with other matters of fact as well as opinion drawn from Government Guidance on the issue in dispute. The vaccine that will almost certainly be used is that manufactured by Astra Zeneca.  </p>

He has been living at the care home since 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2021. This may be a temporary arrangement.  His litigation friend (CW) supports the application made upon behalf of CR.  CR himself is classed as 'clinically vulnerable' as opposed to 'clinically extremely vulnerable' as a result of his epilepsy and severe learning difficulties.  He is also overweight, and it is estimated that this now 22 stone.  His classification as being clinically vulnerable is by reference to the opinion and advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2020).  He falls within the priority group for a vaccination. CW agrees with the evidence of the CCG that CR lacks capacity to make decisions as to whether to have a vaccination or not.   </p>

In response to questions from myself, he stated that he had no objections to the vaccination in principle, but that this was not the right time for his son.  This was based (mainly) on the lack of data as to the consequences of such a vaccine for those who fell into the same category as his son.  He (and his family) did not think that there had been enough testing for those with learning disabilities (and as a result of which the relevant evidence was absent). He was also concerned that the contents of the vaccine itself might interact with the other medication that his son is receiving and in particular those that were used to control his epilepsy, and treat his ADHD.    He agreed that (in part) his concerns were linked to the (now) discredited theories proposed by Dr Andrew Wakefield as regards the link between autism and the MMR vaccine,  and which he still believed were accurate.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0.53in">CR himself is currently in a placement that may be temporary and is described as being for the purposes of an assessment.  It is my understanding that this is connected with matters that are unrelated to the application before the Court but are connected with his conditions. It states that CR can communicate via a limited range of Makaton and will respond to physical cues.  He can be resistant to intervention, including medical intervention.  Indeed, there is a reference to  him having a phobia of hospitals and health interventions (F8 of the bundle). However, in January 2021 he did permit blood samples to be taken from him by  Dr B, and with staff at the care home to provide him with reassurance. I was informed that at that time CR was sedated (as a result of medication for one of his conditions) but that physical intervention was not needed and nor did CR pull away.  Indeed, the CCG will not administer the vaccination if any form of physical intervention is required.  This was confirmed by way of evidence in the form of minutes of a meeting which took place on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2021.  </p>

In such cases as this, there is a strong draw towards vaccination as likely to be in the interests of a protected party (P).  However, this will not always be the case, nor even presumptively so.  What is important to emphasise here, as in so many areas of the work of the Court of Protection, is that respect for and promotion of P's autonomy and an objective evaluation of P's best interests will most effectively inform the ultimate decision.

His objections were not intrinsically illogical.  They were certainly not deliberately obstructive.  They were made upon the basis as to what he regards as being in the best interests of CR.
