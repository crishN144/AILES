	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MB is a 26 year-old woman who is 37 weeks pregnant and due to give birth to her first child within the next fortnight.  She is currently detained in Hospital A pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> having been admitted there on 14 March 2023.  These proceedings concern an application in relation to serious medical treatment, namely the birth plan which is to be put in place to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both mother and baby during the delivery process. As part of that plan the court is being asked to authorise a planned Caesarean section should that become necessary at any stage of MB&#8217;s labour. It is agreed in this case that MB currently lacks capacity to make informed and considered choices about how her unborn child is to be brought into this world. Since that proposed surgical intervention and the administration of anaesthesia would potentially represent an interference with fundamental human freedoms and the right to choose whether to consent to serious medical treatment, the court is being asked to authorise that course as being in MB&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application was issued by the Trusts on 16 May 2023.  The matter came before Knowles J on 18 May 2023 when it was listed for an urgent hearing before me today.  The issues to be determined were stated to be (i) whether MB lacks capacity to make decisions regarding her obstetric care, and, if so, (ii) what care plan is in her best interests.  </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the respondent, Ms Fox has criticised the manner in which this application has been brought.  In my view, those criticisms were justified. When the application was issued on 16 May, it was envisaged that MB&#8217;s child would be delivered by Caesarean section the following week on Wednesday, 24 May.  There was no supporting witness statement to explain the background, context or urgency of the application.  MB had by then been a patient at Hospital A for almost nine weeks.  It was clear to those charged with her ante-natal care that this was a rapidly evolving situation both in terms of evaluating capacity and deciding upon an appropriate birth plan. It is not clear to me why this application was made without sufficient notice to enable the Official Solicitor to carry out her enquiries with proper information and without the pressure of court deadlines.  This was not a case of a genuine medical emergency.  As it was, the Official Solicitor was obliged to instruct Dr M to assess, and report on, MB&#8217;s capacity both to conduct court proceedings and make decisions about the birth of her child within the space of 48 hours.  Dr M was able to attend Hospital A last Friday and prepared her report over the weekend.  She has attended court today to assist the court, as have two professional witnesses for the Trusts.  Whilst the evidence of all three medical witnesses has been of assistance to me, I can see no good reason why this application could not have been issued much sooner and in accordance with the clear guidance set out in <span style="font-style:italic">NHS Trust 1 and NHS Trust 2 v FG </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/30" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 30" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 30</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 WLR 1984" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 WLR 1984</ref>.</p>

She emerges from the history she was able to give to her doctors as an isolated individual who has travelled through the care system from the age of 11 following many years of severe neglect as a younger child.  She appears to have little ongoing involvement with her parents and, as an only child, her family and social network in terms of ongoing support appears to be limited.  She has lived alone in a one-bedroom flat in north London for the last five years.  The father of her unborn child is, as yet, unknown and she does not appear to be in an ongoing relationship with any partner.  That said, she has no medical history of note and, significantly, no evidence of any previous mental health difficulties.  It is agreed that this is likely to be the first presentation of psychosis and it is a condition which has responded well to the medication she has received since becoming an in-patient at Hospital A.   </p>

She was complaining of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.  Her presentation on that occasion caused concern to the obstetric team in that she claimed to be hearing voices and was expressing an interest in the babies of other patients.  Following assessment by the psychiatric liaison team, she was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 2</ref> MHA and admitted to a psychiatric ward at Hospital A.

Whilst initially reluctant to take it, she later co-operated with the medical staff and was compliant with the treatment.  At that point she was testing negative for all substances related to illicit drug use which appeared to rule out addiction as a cause of the psychosis.  When she was first admitted to the ward, she became increasingly chaotic, violent, aggressive and irritable with the result that she had to be placed in seclusion (per Dr N, her consultant psychiatrist). She was treated with lorazepam and, on returning to the ward after 24 hours, remained compliant in terms of her medication.  </p>

After one such absconsion she was returned to the hospital &#8220;heavily drunk and thought disordered&#8221;.  Dr N examined her at the time and found her to be floridly psychotic as a result of having stopped her medication.  She was put back on lorazepam and quetiapine which gradually restored her equilibrium.  As at 18 May 2023 when he signed his witness statement, Dr N&#8217;s view (para 18) was that:</p>

In my view there is a risk of her not being able to take care of her baby because of her mental health problems.  Risk of suicide is low and risk of harm to others is moderate because at times she can be very aggressive when she is psychotic.  In terms of risk from others outside, it is hard to say because she is very vulnerable.  She needs the right support and the friends she keeps use substances.&#8221;</p>

That assessment confirmed she was experiencing episodes of psychosis but that her capacity to make decisions was fluctuating.  A subsequent assessment on 18 May 2023 confirmed that she was much more settled.  In Dr N&#8217;s opinion, she was able on that occasion to understand the nature and purpose of the proposed birth plan which then involved an elective planned Caesarean section.  He felt she was able to retain the information he was giving her and she signed a consent form to that effect.  Her adherence to the medication programme had restored a significant element of her mental stability although he considered that she remained at risk if she stopped taking quetiapine as she had threatened to do once her baby was born. There appears to have been an entirely lucid conversation on that occasion between MB and her two consultants when various options were discussed and MB was able to express her personal preferences in terms of a birth plan.  At that stage she was keen to embark on a normal vaginal delivery but accepted that a Caesarean section may be required if she or the baby were in difficulties during labour.  Whilst her capacity to retain information at that stage was limited, both consultants were of the view that she was then capacitous in relation to her obstetric care although she lacked capacity to &#8220;follow court proceedings&#8221;.</p>

Postpartum psychosis usually entails a rapid and severe deterioration in mental state and initial symptoms include intense anxiety, sleep disturbance.  This illness presents usually with a strong affective component.  Further symptoms are perplexity, alteration in the pattern and content of speech, altered energy levels, psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, erratic behaviour that can result in self harm or suicide attempts.  Typically, there will be a breakdown in childcare and the infant is often incorporated in the mother&#8217;s delusional beliefs, with consequent risks to the infant&#8217;s safety either through neglect or accidental/non accidental harm.&#8221;</p>

All the treating clinicians in that case agreed that she had capacity to make decisions in relation to her ante-natal care but, given the substantial risk she might lose capacity during labour, they sought advance approval from the court that any decision to perform a Caesarean section would be lawful, including any necessary deprivation of R&#8217;s liberty which would be necessary to achieve that outcome.  R had consistently stated that she did not wish to have a Caesarean section.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the birth plan for MB&#8217;s, as yet unborn, child is now in its third iteration.  Mr Hallin has this afternoon produced an amended version of earlier plans dated respectively 18 and 20 May 2023.  Significantly, the current plan now reflects the views and wishes which MB herself has expressed during the currency of these proceedings.  The plan to carry out an elective Caesarean section on Wednesday of this week has now been superseded by a revised plan which anticipates a vaginal waterbirth in accordance with the views expressed by MB on 18 May when she was considered to be expressing capacitous views about the available options.  Subject to ultrasound scans confirming normal amniotic fluid indices between now and MB&#8217;s delivery date at 39 weeks (7 June 2023), she will be allowed to move to spontaneous labour and a natural vaginal delivery. The birth plan includes detailed provision for how MB is to be transferred from Hospital A if she goes into spontaneous labour before her due date and the care she will receive on arriving at the hospital where she will give birth to her child. If surgical intervention is required during the course of labour to protect either MB or her child, the birth plan envisages an elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthetic.  Because of the need to ensure a still and compliant patient in order to administer the spinal anaesthetic, it will only be as a last resort that MB undergoes this procedure under general anaesthetic, unless she expresses a wish or preference for general anaesthesia and it is considered in her best interests to do so.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The birth plan also provides for a potential escalation or dysregulation in MB&#8217;s presentation and/or a further episode of psychosis in the postpartum period.  MB is aware that her baby will need to be transferred to the neonatal unit following birth because of the medications she has taken during the latter stages of her pregnancy.  The infant&#8217;s exposure to quetiapine and lorazepam, in particular, is likely to cause sedation and drowsiness and may in the early stages affect the baby&#8217;s alertness and ability to breastfeed.  MB has been made aware of these concerns.  The birth plan makes specific provision for MB to be &#8220;treated like any other mother&#8221;.  She will be taken to the neonatal unit to visit her baby unless she is either medically unfit to leave her bed or she is in a state of florid psychosis.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of whether the relief sought is in MB&#8217;s best interests, there are a number of factors which lead me to the clear conclusion in this case that the applicants are entitled to the orders they seek.  Whilst it is clear that MB has at times expressed ambivalence towards her pregnancy, in lucid moments when she has been communicating clearly with those charged with her care she has expressed a wish to deliver a healthy baby through as natural a process as possible. I regard the safe delivery of her child as an intrinsic factor in a consideration of her own best interests.  The current iteration of the birth plan which I am being asked to approve in this context is aligned with MB&#8217;s own expressed wishes.  I accept that cases involving Caesarean sections offer particular challenges to courts who must intervene to preserve the fine balance which exists between preserving what has often been referred to as &#8220;the inviolability of a woman&#8217;s body&#8221;, a vital aspect of her fundamental freedom, and the legal protection sought by those responsible for her care and that of her unborn child when their safety and wellbeing requires medical intervention which, without her informed and capacitous consent, would be unlawful.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of this particular case, as both counsel accept, I am not required to make anticipatory, or contingent, declarations as to the lawfulness of any proposed treatment.  MB lacks capacity.  Her safety and wellbeing requires the formulation and approval of a clear way ahead given that she may go into spontaneous labour, or her unborn child may become distressed and require medical intervention, at any point prior to 7 June which is her due date.  Whilst it is not impossible that between now and then she may have moments, or even periods, of lucidity, the preponderance of the evidence is that such periods are unlikely to be sustained.  No court can reach important decisions in relation to an individual&#8217;s capacity from a single &#8216;snapshot&#8217; or event isolated from a trajectory or continuum of medical presentation.  The statutory framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> is designed to support and enable individuals to achieve personal autonomy in terms of their decision-making capabilities.  I very much hope that, with the right support and treatment, that outcome will be achieved for MB.  However, for present purposes, she is not in that position.  I have already referred to the circumstances and timing of this application.  I might have found myself in the territory of contingent or anticipatory relief had this matter not come before the court with possibly days or, at most, two weeks, before MB&#8217;s delivery date.  I have concluded that, in the circumstances which are presented to this court, and for so long as the applicants act in accordance with their current birth plan, reflecting, as it does, MB&#8217;s seemingly capacitous wishes, they will be acting lawfully should surgical intervention be required.</p>

MB is presently unaware of it although Ms Fox, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, has made representations on her behalf. The local authority has given notice of its intention to apply for an interim care order once MB&#8217;s child is born.  In the context of future public law proceedings, the local authority&#8217;s current plan is to seek the court&#8217;s approval for the immediate separation of mother and child.  Whilst the final plan is yet to be formulated, although it has been advertised as one of placement and adoption, it is reasonable to suppose that in the interim the local authority will seek authorisation for the immediate placement of the child with short-term foster carers. MB has not been made aware of these plans.  The issue I have to determine is whether she should be told in advance of her labour and/or the delivery of her child that this is what is proposed. I understand that the local authority has expressed a willingness to be guided by the applicant trusts in terms of whether this information is disclosed to MB prior to the birth of her child.</p>

She confirmed that, notwithstanding MB&#8217;s earlier ambivalence towards her pregnancy, a separation immediately after the birth would be traumatic for her.  It would be likely to add to existing traumas with consequent increased distress and a possible deterioration in her mental state.  Dr M foresaw a significant escalation in the risk that MB would abscond from Hospital A once she became aware of the proposal.  She was likely to cease taking medication which, in turn, would put both her and the pregnancy at risk.</p>

She told me that giving this mother an opportunity to bond with her child in the hours and days following his or her birth without imparting the knowledge that there was likely to be a separation could have more significant long-term consequences.  Dr M accepted that there were clear risks of telling her now but she was concerned about informing MB at a time when, post-delivery, the risks of postpartum psychosis would be heightened.  If she was told before the onset of labour, Dr M considered that she would be able to process the information and would be more prepared for what would happen.  She would have an opportunity to speak to a solicitor about the options. During cross-examination Dr M accepted that she would need very close monitoring if a decision was made to tell her before the birth. She accepted that it was a very difficult decision either way and the significant risks involved would need to be mitigated.  She accepted that, if MB were to abscond at this very late stage of pregnancy and thereby put the viability of the pregnancy at risk, the damage to her mental health could be life-long.  She accepted that she did not know MB well having only met her once and thus her reactions were not easy to predict.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr N has been MB&#8217;s treating consultant for several weeks.  He has seen her on the ward on a regular basis since her admission in March this year.  He saw a significant escalation in the risk of MB absconding from the hospital before she delivered her baby if this information was given to her prior to the child&#8217;s birth.  He foresaw a likelihood that she would disengage from her current treatment programme and abandon the medication which was controlling, or partially controlling, the psychotic symptoms which she was exhibiting both on admission to hospital and after previous disengagements with her treatment plan.  Were she to abscond and stop taking her medication, she would put her unborn baby&#8217;s health at risk as well as her own.  Dr N acknowledged the increased risk of postpartum psychosis following delivery as well as the risk that, if told after the birth, MB may well try to abscond and take her baby with her.  He acknowledged that it was a very difficult decision either way and that the risks were significant and would need to be managed.  On balance, he was clear in his professional view that the risks of informing MB before delivery in terms of the potential safety and wellbeing of both mother and child were too great.  In the context of managing those risks, he told me that there would be ongoing psychiatric liaison between the medical team at Hospital A and the obstetric team in the hospital where MB will give birth.  That team will be available to provide support when she is told about the proceedings concerning her child and his or her potential removal.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My starting point is this mother&#8217;s entitlement to know about matters which have the potential to infringe her basic rights which, here, include the right to a family life with her child (Art 8).  MB is an individual who is in an advanced state of pregnancy, who lacks capacity to make decisions about her medical treatment and/or to engage in litigation, and who has only recently achieved a degree of mental stability following a period of florid psychosis.  That position is being maintained by a carefully controlled regime of medication.  I agree with Mr Hallin&#8217;s description of MB&#8217;s current mental health as &#8216;extremely fragile&#8217;.  I also agree that any relapse would have potentially devastating consequences both for her and her unborn child.  Both experts agree that the risk of her discontinuing her medication is high if she attempts to abscond on learning that her child is to be removed from her care at birth.  The use of increased sedation during this critical pre-birth period is not an answer to mitigating that risk because part of the rationale for telling her now is to provide her with an opportunity to process the information and seek advice on her options.  Quite apart from questions about her current ability to process information and options at this particular point in time, even with appropriate psychiatric support, she will not be in a position to take up this opportunity if she is being medicated to prevent her leaving the hospital.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event of a Caesarean section and in the absence of medical complications, MB is likely to be on the labour ward for approximately 48 hours before discharge back to Hospital A.  Dr N anticipated that the best course for MB and her baby would be to allow them to bond for a period before any attempt to remove the child.  I have no evidence about the practical options which might be available to enable this to happen.  I do not know whether the local authority&#8217;s application for an interim care order is likely to be dealt with in a time frame which would permit the immediate removal of the child who, following delivery, will need to spend time in the neonatal unit in any event.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having weighed matters carefully in the balance, I have reached a clear conclusion that it is in MB&#8217;s best interests to protect her from the consequences of further trauma and distress in the remaining days of her pregnancy.  The process of labour will be challenging enough for her in any event given her extreme vulnerability.  Dr N, who is very familiar with the evolution of her presentation, is quite clear that the risks of further deterioration in her mental health are greater if she is told before the birth of her child. As matters stand, she is on what Mr Hallin has described as a constructive and collaborative path to labour where she is engaging with her medical team.  She is focussed on the amended birth plan which will now allow her to attempt delivery by a normal and spontaneous vaginal water birth.  That was her stated wish when she was last considered to have capacity to make decisions in relation to these matters.  She has seen the facilities which the hospital will provide to enable that to happen. To the extent that she can be, she appears to be focussed on that plan.  I regard maintaining that stability as being entirely in accord with her best interests.  I know not what position she may take in response to the local authority&#8217;s advertised application.  Her ability to care for this child in the future will be a crucial question for the court in any future proceedings.  This is a first presentation of psychosis with no discernible history to inform a future finding of chronic or recurring mental illness.  These are not matters for this court but MB&#8217;s ability to present whatever case she chooses to advance in future proceedings is a relevant factor in deciding how to mitigate the risks of a further deterioration in her health in what is likely to be a relatively short period before her child is delivered.</p>
