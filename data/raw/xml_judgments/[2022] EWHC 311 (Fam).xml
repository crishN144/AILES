	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The application before the court, dated 29 October 2020, has been brought by RS, a father (&#8220;the father&#8221;) under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/60" canonical="1985 c. 60" type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref></span> (incorporating the <span style="font-style:italic">1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of the International Child Abduction </span>(&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention 1980</span>&#8221;)). The application concerns his younger child who I shall refer to as C; she is 9y 5m old. He seeks the return of C to Poland. The application is opposed by C&#8217;s mother, AM (&#8220;the mother&#8221;). This is a rehearing of the father&#8217;s application, following his successful appeal to the Court of Appeal (<span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Child)(Abduction: Article 13(b)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/1354" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 1354" court="EWCA-Civil" year="2021" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2021] EWCA Civ 1354</ref>).</p>

I suspect that this must be one of the last abduction cases before the court in England and Wales to which the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">Council Regulation 2201/2003</span> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">BIIA</span>&#8217;) applies; <span style="font-style:italic">BIIA</span> provides an additional overlay to the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention 1980</span> in this case to which I return briefly at the conclusion of this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The background can be summarised briefly as follows. The applicant father is 42 years old and is a Polish national. The respondent mother is 33 years old, and also a Polish national. The parties were married in 2009 in Poland. Some three and a half years after the parties&#8217; marriage, C was born. The father had previously had a relationship with the mother&#8217;s mother, by whom he has a daughter, D, who is now aged 23. D is therefore a maternal half-sister to the mother. D is both a paternal half-sister and maternal aunt to C. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The parents&#8217; relationship appears to have run into particular difficulties in the autumn of 2019, and it was then that the mother issued divorce proceedings in Poland, alleging adultery on the part of the father. In fact, the parties remained in a relationship of sorts for a further 12 months. The mother alleges that the relationship was significantly blighted by physical, emotional, and sexual domestic abuse, perpetrated in a home environment characterised by controlling and coercive behaviour by the father. She alleges that during the marriage (and since) the father abused alcohol and suffered from mental ill-health. I return to these allegations at &#167;34-36 below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 17 September 2020, the mother removed C from the family home, together with the family&#8217;s pet dog. It is apparent that she had planned this for some weeks. She travelled to England to be united with a man with whom she had apparently formed a relationship, who I shall refer to as Mr E; they currently live together in the North of England. The mother had not informed the father of her intention to remove C from Poland in this way, or at all; indeed, she had misled him into believing that they were going to visit an aunt in Pomerania, some 275 miles away. The mother took money from a joint bank account. The father alleges that, some days after the mother&#8217;s disappearance Mr E contacted him and, using foul and threatening language, told the father to leave the mother alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Within less than a fortnight, the father discovered that the mother had removed C to England; during a telephone call, C told her father that she had made a long journey, and showed him the uniform for the English school which she was going to attend. The father entirely appropriately contacted the Polish Central Authority, and through the ordinary formal channels he was enabled to issue this application in the English High Court by the end of October 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Following C&#8217;s move to England, she had contact with the father by facetime or phone; the mother recorded a number of those conversations, and transcripts of two of those conversations have been placed before this Court. The mother relies upon these transcripts as evidence of the father&#8217;s inability or unwillingness to adhere to formally recorded agreements and/or court orders regulating his behaviour. To set a context, the father had filed sworn evidence in these proceedings in March 2021 describing the indirect contact as going well, describing how C &#8220;has been expressing longing for me more and more&#8221;. The reality (from these transcriptions at least) is rather different. In the first transcribed call, I note that the father told C about the imminent court hearing, advising her to &#8220;pack her bags&#8230; your days in England are numbered&#8221;. C not unnaturally became distressed and told her father that she did not wish to speak with him; the father replied with a threat:</p>

The Polish court has dismissed applications by each parent for substantive orders in relation to interim child arrangements. In those proceedings a report from a multi-disciplinary psychological/social work team (known as OZSS<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Assessments are carried out on the basis of in-depth interviews and observations and recommendations for residence, contact and any therapy are made in reports to the court.&#8221; After the preparation of the report, he described it as: &#8220;&#8230; a biased, one sided, superficial, highly speculative and wholly inadequate piece of work which lacks analysis and balance and fails to include any interviews with the mother and child nor any observation of contact or family relationships.&#8221;</p>
	      </authorialNote>; this report has been based very largely on interviews conducted in May 2021 with the father. This report is unfavourable to the father, but he has &#8211; through lawyers &#8211; formally challenged it, questioning in the main its methodology.

What is to some degree of more interest to me in this report is the authors&#8217; description of the father&#8217;s defensiveness, his lack of ownership of any of the problems in his relationship with the mother, and his lack of insight into his alleged behaviour.

To be clear, in this regard, I have drawn particularly on the evidence (albeit unproven) that C has been directly involved in incidents of domestic abuse (as she herself has alleged), and has further allegedly been the victim of direct harm herself; a photograph has been produced of an injury to C&#8217;s head (said to be dated April 2020), allegedly caused by the father, although I know he maintains that this was accidentally caused by his granddaughter.

The objection is rooted, it seems to me, in a genuine fear that she will be brought into close contact with her father either in an arranged or in an unsolicited way; she appears genuinely to perceive that he poses a serious threat to her and to her mother. I am wholly satisfied that C currently wishes to avoid any risk of physical contact with him. Her objection is also doubtless fashioned to some extent by the fact that she has now been living in England for 18 months, and is (as the school reflects) happy and settled here. I am quite sure that C will have been exposed to the negative views held by the mother about the father and his family; I am also conscious that C has started to call her stepfather &#8220;dad&#8221; and her father by his first name &#8211; illustrative of her shifting sense of affection, loyalty and/or family alignment. However, I am satisfied (reliant on Ms Magson&#8217;s assessment) that C is expressing her <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> views about a return to Poland, and is not merely parroting the views of her mother, even though &#8211; I acknowledge &#8211; their views coincide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is of course widely recognised that the essential purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic">1980 Hague Convention</span> is to effect the swift and summary return of children wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence. I recognise that C is a Polish child born to Polish parents; prior to September 2020 she was indisputably habitually resident in Poland, and that her first language remains Polish. I accept Mr Hames&#8217; submission that the family had very little association or connection with this country until the mother and C travelled here in September 2020 ostensibly so that the mother could establish or develop a relationship with Mr E. However, in this unusual case, the moment at which a swift return could be effected has long since passed; C has settled in England, and has been in school here now for 16 months. Although (as Mr Hames argues) a return order would appropriately send her back to her home country, in reality it is likely that C would move to a new home (or indeed a refuge), possibly in a different part of the country, effectively in hiding from the father, unable to reconnect with those aspects of life in Poland which she left behind (her family, friends and school) all because of the mother&#8217;s enduring fear of the father. It would be, as Mr Setright argues and I accept, a very artificial environment to which she would return and a wholly different life to the one she left in September 2020.</p>

That said, there is little prejudice to the Polish court process for the mother and child to take part remotely, and if the Polish Court formed the view that they wished C to return, they could so order her.</p>

He accepted that the restoration of the relationship will need to proceed cautiously and gradually, probably with an element of professional supervision &#8211; all much easier to achieve if the father and C are living in the same country. </p>

I accept Mr Setright&#8217;s argument that the route to restoring the relationship between C and her father is one which requires caution and diplomacy; paradoxically her forced return to Poland by court order would only be likely to cause her to reject more vigorously the approaches of her father. </p>

The fact that she has, now, a reasonable understanding of the Hague process, and is maturely progressing at school lend weight to this aspect of the case. Her objection is rooted in her experience of life in Poland before September 2020 living in a climate of fear as she experienced it; an order for return would be likely irreparably to damage her trust in the authorities which are purporting to act in her best interests. </p>
