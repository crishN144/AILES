She was permitted to use a &#8216;vape&#8217; at 12 noon every day and often made demands to use it earlier. When refused, the mother would threaten to harm her baby. In August 2022, when challenged by a Prison Officer for stealing items, the mother &#8216;stormed back to her cell screaming and swearing&#8217; and began punching herself in the stomach. In September 2022, the mother self-harmed causing superficial cuts to her arms but a significant cut to her thumb due to destroying items in her room whilst continuing to make threats to &#8216;punch the fuck out of my belly&#8217; if she was denied her vape.</p>

As caring for a baby is stressful and places huge demands upon the care-givers own needs and ability to prioritise those needs, the pre-birth assessment concluded this posed a further risk to her unborn child.</p>

The information contained within the PNC documentation reveals the mother has 21 convictions which encompass 41 offences commencing in 2005 when she was a teenager. The attempted robbery offence which led to the mother being imprisoned at the time of C&#8217;s birth was committed in June 2022 which also placed her in breach of a community order imposed in May 2022. Accordingly, there is a conviction of an offence whilst a community order is in force.  In addition to the sentence of imprisonment, the Sheffield Crown Court imposed a restraining order for five years.</p>

In the March 2021 offence, the mother was suspected of shop lifting and produced a bread knife which she used to threaten shop staff when she was challenged by them. When arrested, the mother was in possession of two knives.</p>

The psychiatrist sets out the mother&#8217;s unusual psychotic beliefs and delusions in his report, and identifies her sudden changes in mood for no apparent reason and her threats to harm herself and her unborn child as features usually seen in people with EUPD traits. Whilst acknowledging he has not observed the mother caring for C, he opines her mental health, her unpredictable presentation, her use of illicit substances and the associated distress which causes her to self-harm are all likely to impact on her ability to care for a child safely.</p>

But she has now used illicit drugs regularly for over half of her life and was not motivated enough to engage with Forward Leeds upon her recent release from prison. She has experienced serious problems with her mental health for the past 7 years but continues to use maladaptive coping mechanisms which are likely to make it worse. Sadly, the mother&#8217;s criminal offending associated with this means she is now likely to be in prison for the next 6 months at least. I am persuaded any changes she may now make in any of these areas are wholly outside C&#8217;s timescales for finding a permanent home. He needs a decision to be made without further delay.</p>

During the first session she was unable to settle him and failed to engage with him, she left 30 minutes early to go to a fast food restaurant. During the second session she fell asleep for the last 30 minutes. This evidences the magnitude of the changes which the mother needs to make in terms of prioritising the needs of a child because she has struggled to sustain caring for C even within short, supported contact sessions.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:-0.47in;margin-right:-0.39in;text-indent:0.12in">Accordingly, I am persuaded C is likely to suffer significant harm in the care of his mother. His welfare is likely to be neglected, his development impaired and he is likely to experience significant emotional harm. There is no package of support which could be devised to ameliorate this risk posed by the mother in the short to medium term.  For whatever reasons, and the most salient one may be the mother&#8217;s mental health, she is not yet minded to address the difficulties in her life in a constructive way which reinforces my conclusion her behaviour is likely to be repeated to the detriment of C&#8217;s welfare until she does.</p>

His maternal grandmother has indicated she is unable to care for him, and &#8216;A&#8217; who is the daughter of Z is also unable to care for him due to her own pre-existing caring commitments. As there are no other family members who have come forward and been positively assessed, I am persuaded it is likely his need for stability and permanence can only be met in an alternative placement outside of his birth family. </p>

The mother has said C&#8217;s birth father is a black male who was tall in height and of slim build. C is described as the happiest of babies, he is strong willed and loves cuddles, kisses and attention. He struggled with withdrawal symptoms from his mother&#8217;s drug/methadone use during the first 6-12 weeks of his life but it does not appear to have affected his development thus far as he is meeting if not exceeding, his developmental milestones. In the longer term the impact of his mother&#8217;s illicit drug/methadone use in early pregnancy is unknown but he currently has no health condition which is likely to impact adversely upon the likelihood of an adoptive family being found for him. Having experienced one change of primary carer when Z passed away and having spent the rest of his short life to date in foster care, he is in urgent need to be cared for by a permanent family who he may call his own.</p>

I accept the unchallenged evidence of the guardian that it is likely C would wish for a birth family placement to grow up in if it could be a loving, secure and safe environment where he is protected from harm.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:-0.47in;margin-right:-0.39in;text-indent:0.12in">The immediate and obvious disadvantage of adoption would be the loss to C of his identity by ceasing to be a member of his birth family and becoming an adopted person. He is likely to lose the potential of any relationship with his maternal grandmother and older siblings as well as with his mother.   However, C&#8217;s need for a permanent family who he may call his own exceeds this disadvantage.  I am persuaded the loss of any relationship with his birth family is a disadvantage which it is necessary to take and a more proportionate response is for C to maintain his link to his birth family by way of indirect letter box contact and a Life Story book.</p>

This is because in light of his age and his need for permanence it is likely such placement would not offer the same degree of durability and a right to family life to the same degree an adoptive placement would offer. A foster placement is more likely to break down because of the lengthy period for which it is going to be required and if this were to happen it would cause further harm to his welfare. As Mrs Lewis states in her report, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Ideally, his next move should be his last move</span>&#8221;.</p>

In doing so, I grant the mother permission to withdraw her application for a residential assessment for the reasons it is not necessary and would cause further delay which would prejudice C&#8217;s welfare.  I commend the mother for making the difficult decision not to pursue her application and offer my sympathy for the many challenges she faces in her life.</p>

There is no other realistic option before the court. The mother has not given her unconditional consent and I must formally consider dispensing with her consent on the basis the welfare of C requires it. Having reached the conclusion that adoption is in his best interests in the care proceedings, it follows I must dispense with the mother&#8217;s agreement to C being placed for adoption in accordance with section 52 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to implement that plan.  Accordingly, I dispense with the mother&#8217;s consent to placing C for adoption and I make a placement order authorising the local authority to place him for adoption with prospective adopters of its choice.</p>

It was a very positive meeting and she expressed her view she was happy she had met them and was reassured to know C would be well cared for and loved. In July 2024, C was made the subject of a final adoption order. Sadly, his mother was once again part of the prison population.</p>
