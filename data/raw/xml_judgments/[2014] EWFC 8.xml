		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;Where a child of any age goes lawfully to reside with a parent in a state in which that parent is habitually resident, it will no doubt be highly unusual for that child not to acquire habitual residence there too.  The same may be said of a situation in which, perhaps after living with a member of the wider family, a child goes to reside there with both parents.  But in highly unusual cases there must be room for a different conclusion, and the requirement of some integration creates room for it perfectly.  No different conclusion will be reached in the case of a young child.  But, where the child is older, in particular one who is an adolescent or who should be treated as an adolescent because she (or he) has the maturity of an adolescent, and perhaps also where (to take the facts of this case) the older child&#8217;s residence with the parent proves to be of short duration, the inquiry into her integration in the new environment must encompass more than the surface features of her life there.  I see no justification for a refusal even to consider evidence of her own state of mind during the period of her residence there.  Her mind may - possibly &#8211; have been in a state of rebellious turmoil about the home chosen for her which would be inconsistent with any significant degree of integration on her part.  In the debate in this court about the occasional relevance of this dimension, references have been made to the &#8220;wishes&#8221; &#8220;views&#8221; &#8220;intentions&#8221; and &#8220;decisions&#8221; of the child.  But, in my opinion, none of those words is apt.  What can occasionally be relevant to whether an older child shares her parent&#8217;s habitual residence is her </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">state of mind</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> during the period of her residence with that parent.  In the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Nilish Shah</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case, cited above, in which he propounded the test recently abandoned, Lord Scarman observed at  p.344 that proof of ordinary (or habitual) residence was &#8220;ultimately a question of fact, depending more upon the evidence of matters susceptible of objective proof than upon evidence as to state of mind.&#8221;  Nowadays some might not accept that evidence of state of mind was not susceptible of objective proof, but, in so far as Lord Scarman&#8217;s observation might be taken to exclude the relevance of a person&#8217;s state of mind to her habitual residence, I suggest that this court should consign it to legal history, along with the test which he propounded.&#8221;</span></p>

Indeed when, in a later section of his judgment, he addressed her assertions, his focus was on her hostility at that time, namely in 2013, towards a return to Spain.  Nowhere did he give separate &#8211; or any &#8211; attention to what she had said about her state of mind when in Spain in 2012.  The Court of Appeal was impressed by the fact that in refusing to grant permission to the father to appeal, Cobb J observed that, &#8220;The stated wishes of the three older children to be in England now...did not affect their integration in Spain at the time.&#8221;  Cobb J&#8217;s observation was correct.

In my view this is the most difficult question posed by these appeals.  When they were in Spain, none of the boys was an adolescent or had the maturity of an adolescent.  It will be clear from my formulation of the question in para 1 above that in my view it is, in principle, the state of mind of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">adolescent</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> children during their residence in a place that may affect whether it was habitual.  Thus, although when considering the alleged objections of L and A to returning to Spain, Cobb J concluded that they had at least attained an age and</span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">a degree of maturity at which it was appropriate to take account of their views and although they made comments to Ms. Vivian indicative of lack of integration on their part in Spain, I find it hard to imagine that a judge&#8217;s exploration of their state of mine could, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">on its own</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, alter the conclusion about their integration in Spain reached by Cobb J be reference to the other evidence before him.  But there is another feature in play; it is the presence of their older sister, T, in the daily life of all three of the boys.  Ms. Vivian described the four children as a very close sibling group.  There was</span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">a solidarity in the presentation of the three older children to her.  When Cobb J addressed the integration of the children in Spain, he did so compendiously in relation to all four of them.  In the fuller, more focused, inquiry into T&#8217;s habitual residence, the High Court will no doubt receive evidence about the integration in Spain of the four children as a whole.  Were it to conclude that T never lost her English habitual residence, the court would need at any rate to consider whether its conclusion could sit easily alongside a conclusion that, by contrast, the three boys acquired </span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">a habitual residence in Spain.  In relation to their habitual residence, might T&#8217;s habitual residence in England (if such it was) be a counterweight to the obvious significance of the mother&#8217;s habitual residence in Spain?  It can be inconvenient for a judge at a remitted hearing to have to note that all options have not been left open to him.  By a narrow margin, I find myself persuaded that the proper course is to set aside the finding of habitual residence in respect also of the three boys so that the issue can be reconsidered in relation to all four children.&#8221;</span></p>

It is not a matter of intention: one does not acquire a habitual residence merely by intending to do so; nor does one fail to acquire one merely by not intending to do so.  An illegal immigrant may desperately want to become habitually resident in this country, but that does not mean that he does so.  A tax exile may desperately want to lose his habitual residence here, but that does not mean that he does so.

Some of these are objective: how long were they there, what were their living conditions while there, were they at school or at work, and so on?  But subjective factors are also relevant: what was the reason for their being there, and what were their perceptions about being there?  I agree with Lord Wilson (paragraph 37) that &#8220;wishes&#8221;, &#8220;views&#8221;, &#8220;intentions&#8221; and &#8220;decisions&#8221; are not the right words, whether we are considering the habitual residence of a child or indeed an adult.  It is better to think in terms of the reasons why a person is in a particular place and his or her perception of the situation while there &#8211; their state of mind.  All of these factors feed into the essential question, which is whether the child has achieved a sufficient degree of integration into a social and family environment in the country in question for his or her residence there to be termed &#8220;habitual&#8221;.</span></p>

It is the child's integration which is under consideration. Each child is an individual with his own experiences and his own perceptions. These are not necessarily determined by the decisions of his parents, although sometimes these will leave him with no choice but to buckle down and get on with it. The tiny baby whose mother took him back to her home country in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Mercredi v Chaffe </span><span style="font-size:14pt">was in a very different situation from any of the three children with whom we are concerned. The environment of an infant or very young child is (one hopes) a family environment and so determined by reference to the person with whom he lives. But once a child leaves the family environment and goes to school, his social world widens and there are more factors to be taken into account. Furthermore, where parents are separated, there may well be two possible homes in which the children can live and the children will be well aware of this. This may well affect the degree of their integration in a new environment.</span></p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later.

Under English law, the mother alone has parental responsibility for the two older children (only because the change in the law giving parental responsibility to all fathers named on the birth certificate only came into force later; we have no evidence as to what the position is under Spanish law). She could therefore change their habitual residence. The father does have parental responsibility for the two younger children, but Cobb J held that he had (albeit reluctantly) consented to their change in habitual residence. But it is not a question of the parents' determining the habitual residence of their children. It is a question of the impact of the parental decisions about where they and the children will live upon the factual question of where the children habitually reside.&#8221;</span></p>

They have at times betrayed by their language some deep sense of conflict they have in articulating to their mother, or indeed to Ms. Vivian, their views about not wanting to be in Spain, but that conflict is clearly not (I find) evidence, as the mother would have it, that they have been influenced to such an extent that they are prepared to lie so as to align themselves with their father (see also paragraph 45 above).</span></p>

Nevertheless, there is a passage in Ms. Vivian&#8217;s latest report in which she considers the comments to her of L and A over a long period (albeit those comments relate to their views about England) which illustrates their consistency as historians, and to my mind the authenticity of what they say.  The passage is:</span></p>

		      <p class="Default" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">I would expect that, given the passage of time and their different ages and stages of development, the children&#8217;s views might have changed or hardened particularly as the legal proceedings have been ongoing. However, the children remain consistent in their views and report their feelings about England in a similar vein that they did to me many months ago, although I think L and A now speak with greater strength, conviction and rationality. Their views have been formed over a period of months and not been made on the spur of the moment. This consistency is, I think, an indication that their views are not contrived simply for the purposes of these proceedings, but that they are in fact authentic, their own, genuinely and strongly held, and a proper reflection of their own truth, feelings, emotions and experiences. As L said: &#8216;most of the stuff is hard to describe, it&#8217;s something I have inside&#8217;. A year on from my last report, England for these children continues to be where their day to day routine is, their base of reference, where their connections are and their security lies. These things are important to all children, not least these particular children, if they are to thrive and develop happily and healthily. None of this is any surprise given that they have spent their entire lives in this country other than the five months when they were in Spain.&#8221;</span></p>

In Year 5 (i.e. the penultimate year of primary school) T had also joined &#8220;The Da Vinci Group&#8221;, an online learning platform for gifted young students which, she tells me, is a collaboration between Warwick University and Brasenose College, Oxford.  It offered T the opportunity to interact with other students and develop skills in communication, philosophical thinking, debating etc.  T has told me that she really enjoyed the Da Vinci Group, &#8220;it was challenging, I fed off it, I enjoyed using my brain, I am competitive and I was up against 14 year olds&#8221;.  T told me how she had competed against 14 years in a debate and won a scholarship.  Although she had not been able to attend the resulting course that she was competing for (as the scholarship only covered 90% of the fees) she described it as &#8220;great to win though&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p>

As for his life outside school in the relevant period, and taking account, as I did with T, and shall do with A when I come to consider him, of the history before the relevant period, and what he has said about this issue subsequently, I have come also to the view that he never lost his habitual residence in England.

All of this indicates that, from their side, their relationship(s) with their mother are potentially enduring; however I do think that their relationship(s) with her, to differing degrees, have been damaged and are in jeopardy.

They report mutual respect for each other; they engage with each other in play and learning and seem to me to operate as a &#8216;team&#8217;; they care for each other and love each other. Significantly, despite holding their own individual views and feelings that they acknowledge and accept, they have made clear through their actions in these proceedings that they wish to remain as a sibling unit in this country.

Individually, given their different personalities and ages and stages of development, the emotional toll would be great for all of them. The boys and T would experience loss which I think would manifest itself differently in each child and the experience for them, I think, would be akin to experiencing a traumatic event, the recovery from which would be slow and unlikely to be complete. As I have suggested, the experiences of the children to date already makes them already emotionally vulnerable. The sibling group is the one significant, lifelong and stable factor in their lives. Furthermore I am in little doubt that the loss experienced by splitting the sibling group would made all the more profound [&#8216;Our lives would be gone and wasted&#8217;, A] by what would bring it about, namely their removal from their secure base and being taken to live in Spain where they were unable to settle in 2012 to live with their mother with whom [to differing degrees], I can only assess, they have a fractured relationship. &#8220;</span></p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be. </span></p>

It was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations. In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country. </span></p>

		    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

Irrespective of that point, the hearing before the Spanish Court in February was one-sided in that the father was not able to attend.  Furthermore, the mother appears to have misled that court, and now makes it abundantly clear that she will attempt to uphold its order, come what may.  In addition on the face of it the children did not have their voice heard in those proceedings.  It seems therefore to me that although the Spanish court has given a judgment and made a consequential order, those proceedings are susceptible to challenge, and this court is able to find that there is at the very least an arguable case for saying that the relevant issues should be tried in this country, and/or that the Spanish order will not be enforced in this jurisdiction.</span></p>
