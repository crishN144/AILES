	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2021 I heard an application by the mother for permission to relocate to a country in Africa.  I refused the application for a number of reasons, chief amongst them the importance to B of his relationship with his father.  I made a child arrangements order which provided for B to share his time between his parents.  In the term time he was to live primarily with his mother, spending a long weekend with his father every other weekend, and the holidays were to be divided equally.  In the course of my judgment I made some observations that the mother had a dismissive attitude towards the father which, I considered had the potential to affect B&#8217;s  views about spending time with him as he grew older.  I said that if B spent a lot of time away from him the father might diminish in his eyes.  In saying this I very much had in mind the mother&#8217;s attitude to the father and that it would influence B.  I also noted that the mother had not (at least at that point) alienated B from his father, as there had always been ongoing contact.  My decision to refuse the application was not appealed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In April 2022, less than a year after my decision the mother took B to another country in Africa (which I shall call Country X).  Her case is that this was simply for a holiday, but that whilst she was there she fell ill.  In her written evidence she complains that the father made &#8216;persistent allegations of &#8220;abduction&#8221;, court applications and threats&#8217;, although she did in fact decide during the course of the holiday and after she recovered that she would not return to the UK. Her view as expressed to me is that this does not amount to an abduction because she gave B the choice to go back to the UK without her but that he did not want to do this.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father said he at first accepted the mother&#8217;s explanation that she had fallen ill and would still be coming back but once it became apparent to him that this was not going to happen he issued proceedings for a summary return.  Proceedings were then issued in Country X by B himself (although as he was 13 at the time, it seems likely that the mother was behind this). Several return orders were made in this country. The mother made an application for permission to appeal the first order, and for a stay. I note that the stay was refused by Moylan LJ who stated &#8216;there is no justification for staying the return order. The mother&#8217;s application for permission to appeal and if granted, her appeal, can be determined after [B&#8217;s] return to England. The apparent merits of the proposed appeal and the balance of prejudice point firmly in favour of refusing a stay&#8217;.</p>

On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November the return orders were stayed by Cobb J pending the full hearing of the application to discharge the return orders.  Cobb J made a number of directions for the filing of evidence, including a requirement that the mother set out her proposals for contact between B and the father in the event that he did not return.</p>

The father has given evidence and B has seen a court appointed expert and a social worker.  The parties have made submissions although as I understand it the mother has not given any evidence.  The court is expected to reconvene on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  May and to let the parties know when to expect judgment.</p>

She states that he was physically abusive to her when she was pregnant and that he has behaved in a coercive and controlling way by repeatedly bringing court proceedings with respect to child arrangements, accusing her of abduction and making unwarranted applications for prohibited steps orders.  She says he also perpetrated economic abuse. She points out that in the past he was required by the court  to attend a Domestic Violence Perpetrators Programme but that he did not do so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This family have been before the courts on many occasions. A decision was made long ago that there should not be a fact finding hearing.  I accept that the father has not been on a DAPP but this was all a long time ago and the father continued to have contact thereafter and at the hearing before me it was not suggested that the father should not have contact with B.  At the last hearing I considered the litigation history between these parents as well as their behaviour to each other. At paragraph 47 of my judgment I specifically found that the father had not abused his position or used his time with B to undermine the mother.  I heard evidence about some matters the mother complains about in her statements &#8211; for example the father&#8217;s conduct in taking the phone from B outside a railway station on the way back to the mother and my findings did not accord with the mother&#8217;s allegation.  Despite the many hearings before the courts, no court has concluded that the father&#8217;s behaviour in bringing proceedings has been motivated by a desire to abuse the mother or child. There was a s91(14) order made at one point but this was to give B some respite, not because the father was being singled out as causing harm to B.   Some of the proceedings were brought about by the father looking to increase his time with B which was granted by the courts, and the proceedings that led to the hearing before me in May 2021 arose because the mother wished to relocate.  It is somewhat difficult for the mother to complain that the father&#8217;s behaviour in making applications for prohibited steps orders to prevent her removing B from the jurisdiction in the light of what has happened now.</p>

In addition to the matters I have set out I note that her case is that she is not coming  back to the UK and that B should stay in Country X too.  Further, the order that she seeks on her own and B&#8217;s behalf, namely that the father be prohibited from exhibiting any of the abusive behaviour described in the 2021 Act is fraught with problems and would simply lead to further litigation. The same would apply if I made a non-molestation order in conventional terms.  This means that I do not consider that the making of such orders is necessary or proportionate or that it would secure the well-being of either the mother or B. </p>

Given the history of this case I considered that the mother should not be cross examined by the father and so I asked questions of the mother myself. Many of the questions put by the father related to the history of the case which is contained in the documents, of which I am very aware and so I did not feel that such questions would assist me in making my decision. I asked a few questions about the circumstances of the decision to stay in Country X and what should happen about contact. The mother attended from Country X by video link and the courtroom was arranged so that she did not have to see the father and he was not able to see her.</p>

Her stance is essentially that he is responsible for all the years of litigation that have taken place although she did concede that the proceedings in 2021 arose as a result of her wish to move to Africa with B. She also accepted that her decision to stay in Country X had also led to proceedings although she said she was 100% convinced that there would have been further proceedings here in any event.  She said that she had had no intention to stay in Country X beyond a holiday and only did so because the father had issued proceedings for a return order.</p>

She accuses the father of being abusive and says that he does not respect B&#8217;s wishes. She says that B is old enough to make up his own mind.  She said that she intends to remain in Country X for several years. So far as contact is concerned, she believes that this is a matter for B to agree with his father. She did not seem overly concerned at the effect on B of not having contact with the wider paternal family.</p>

The father said that he had told B that all that needed to happen was for him to come back.  He agreed that he had had to raise his voice because B was crying so much but that he was not angry.  I accept that even if the father was frustrated at what was happening he was not angry with B and he only raised his voice so that B could hear him.  It is not difficult to see how B could have interpreted this as his father not listening to him, and that the mother would have easily jumped to the conclusion that the father was angry.</p>

He points to the history and my finding in May 2021. He says that the mother acted deceitfully and has influenced and placed pressure on B.  He submits that B was doing well in London, and that his removal to Country X has led to a cessation of contact with all of his family in Europe.  The father believes that, if B was to return, he would accept this if it was properly explained to him.  The life here is one he knows and has been content with.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Country X is not a Hague Convention country and therefore the return orders were made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction.  The test to be applied when coming to my decision is that of welfare, bearing in mind that it is generally in the interests of a child for decisions about his or her future to be made by the courts of the state in which the child is habitually resident. The child&#8217;s welfare is paramount and the factors in the welfare checklist apply. In the Supreme Court case of Re NY, paragraphs 55 to 64, Lord Wilson set out a number of matters to which a court considering the making of a summary return order should give consideration.  In that case the return order in question was an outgoing rather than an incoming one, but subject to that the same principles are applicable.  I will not recite them here but record that I have the points firmly in mind.  A summary application for return can be difficult in that the court will frequently be asked to make a decision on less than full information.  That is the case here but I have come to the conclusion that what I have before me is sufficient to make a decision as to the orders for return.</p>

Being there has given him respite from the endless tension between his parents (albeit not the litigation). It has come at a considerable sacrifice of the relationship with his father, but from his perspective the price for that relationship at the moment is just too high.  In June last year when he spoke to Ms Cull-Fitzpatrick he did not particularly mind the prospect of coming back to England but things have moved on since then. 10 months in the life of someone who is 14 is a long time.</p>

The same applies as to his education. Both these parents have high standards for their son&#8217;s education and his school reports are very good.   From an emotional perspective his needs are not being met because he has been caught up in adult issues and his relationship with his father has been disrupted. He also appears to be carrying some responsibility for his mother&#8217;s emotional welfare.   Nonetheless, he is happier in himself because his current circumstances give him space and respite from the pressure that he felt when he was living in the UK, and because he likes the life he is leading.  He is of an age where he needs to be able to concentrate on his studies, to make friends, to enjoy activities and to learn about life.

Whilst he is undoubtedly influenced by the mother in matters pertaining to his living arrangements and his father I do not doubt his genuine wish to remain living in Country X.  The views he has expressed to various professionals are nuanced in the sense they do not merely mirror those of his mother. I understand that the father does not believe that some of what B says is really him but in my judgment the voice of B is there and it is authentic.  He is enjoying life in Country X for good reason and I think it would do him a lot of harm to force him back to England. It would tear him away from his new life when he has settled down and enjoyed the respite that he has experienced. A move back would be likely to affect his happiness and his mental health.  That harm would outweigh the advantages to him of resuming his relationship with his father &#8211; indeed I think it would damage it.

What can be said is that B and his father do have an established relationship which can be built upon as time passes, even if after a significant gap and the father should not view this as a rejection by his son, or his last word on  their relationship.  I know that B will be exposed to the mother&#8217;s unfiltered views about the father in the meantime but as he grows older he will become more independent and able to rely better on his own observations and experiences of his parents.

The jurisdictional route for this court to consider issues of contact is somewhat complex in advance of at least one case which is currently being considered by the Court of Appeal.  During the course of exchanges with Mr. Edwards he suggested that one possible route for me to take would be to deem that the father had made an application for child arrangements and to adjourn the proceedings for another six weeks or so until after judgment is given in Country X.  Subject to this court having jurisdiction it would at least ensure there was a forum for contact arrangements to be considered.
