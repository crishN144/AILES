	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is dealing with an application brought by the NHS North West London Integrated Care Board (&#8216;ICB&#8217;) for an order that permits the withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (&#8216;CANH&#8217;) to Z age 70 years. That application is supported by The Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability (&#8216;the RHN&#8217;), by Z&#8217;s sister, X, and one of his close friends, Y, and opposed by his wife, W, and another of his close friends, V. Having had the opportunity to hear the evidence the Official Solicitor, on behalf of Z, supports the application. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Until 2021 Z was someone who lived life to the full. He embraced life in every sense of the word, in particular the outdoors. He was an accomplished scuba diver, pilot, sailor, a much loved brother, a true friend and a devoted husband. The court has had very powerful evidence from his sister, two of his close friends and his wife. They all spoke as one about Z&#8217;s character, his sensitivity, concern for others and his curious and inquiring mind.  In addition many other friends attended the hearing in support, demonstrating how much he is loved by so many. Although W, X, Y and Z were not parties to the proceedings they each took an active part in the hearing and W has had the benefit of an experienced solicitor, Ms Hobey-Hamsher, to speak to when she needed to. Ms Hobey-Hamsher acted pro bono in providing that advice and assistance, for which the court is very grateful.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no issue about Z&#8217;s current medical position, or that he lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings or make decisions about his treatment. The court has evidence from the clinical team at the RHN and the benefit of a second opinion from Dr Nair, Consultant in Rehabilitation Medicine, and an independent expert report from Dr Barry, Consultant in Palliative Medicine. Dr H, Consultant in Neurorehabilitation Medicine at the RHN, gave oral evidence as did Dr Barry, together with X, Y, V and W.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What is in issue is whether it is in Z&#8217;s best interests for CANH to be withdrawn or for him to continue in receipt of that treatment. Whilst the RHN support the withdrawal of CANH it has made it clear that if the court refused the ICB&#8217;s application Z would remain in receipt of CANH.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I had the very great privilege of going to visit Z the day before this hearing in the company of Mr Edwards from the Official Solicitor. I had the opportunity to read the papers before that visit and the detailed attendance note from Mr Edward&#8217;s last visit to Z in April. I was shown round the grounds by members of the clinical team, briefly saw W and spent some time with Z. He was in his wheelchair by his bed, surrounded by photos of his family, friends and his many adventures during his life. A picture was painted for me of what his day to day life consists of. Z appeared calm, stable and restful for most of the time when I was there.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Z enjoyed excellent health until 2021 when he had a calf melanoma excised. Following that a right tonsil carcinoma was incidentally picked up, for which the plan was for Z to undergo surgery to remove the cancer, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Z had the surgery in September 2021. Tragically, nine days after surgery Z suffered a major haemorrhage from the surgical site. Due to the severity of the haemorrhage he suffered a cardiac arrest which resulted in global severe anoxic hypoxic brain injury. A tracheostomy was formed and a percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (&#8216;PEG&#8217;) was inserted for the provision of CANH. A &#8216;Do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation&#8217; direction  was placed in October 2021 and a wardbased ceiling of care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">A referral was made to RHN for an inpatient admission to the Brain Injury Service but it was agreed that the RHN&#8217;s specialist nursing home would be more suited to Z&#8217;s needs. In early December 2021 funding was requested for admission to a specialist nursing home bed at RHN with the following recommendation: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;[Z] will be reviewed as part of our MDT annual review process for individuals in a PDOC as per the recommendations by the Royal College of Physicians. This will include: completing PDOC assessments and comparing results with previous ones to see if there has been any change; should any change be observed, follow up sessions with OT will be provided to explore whether [Z] has the potential for functional communication or activity participation&#8217;. </span></p>

Clinically the assessments did not change and appeared to be diagnostic of a vegetative state without any trajectory of behaviours along the spectrum of consciousness. MRI investigation confirmed severe and well established widespread damage to his entire brain, in keeping with further progression of his hypoxic brain injury.</p>

Each assessment concluded Z remained in a PDOC at a level of vegetative state. During the assessments Z&#8217;s eyes were noted to be closed with some partial opening and eyelid flutters, his eyeballs were noted to be roving behind closed eyes and his lip was noted to twitch. His arousal was overall low; he opened his eyes to stimulation (loud noise, music or being touched). Some grimacing was noted outside of the assessment in response to sound or music without differentiation. Dr H describes some other behaviours noted by staff and Z&#8217;s wife including yawning, head and neck movements to sound with no consistency to suggest they were localising behaviours, facial features to suggest muscle relaxation when music was played, some escape of tears from his eyes, grimacing in response to sound, and what was described as &#8216;silent crying&#8217;.</p>

He can have thick secretions and is prescribed medication to help break up the mucus to make it easier to clear them from the respiratory system. Z has a strong cough and secretions are removed via a suction device into the tracheostomy tube, which is observed to cause Z discomfort.

He set out the reasons why the RHN did not support removal of Z&#8217;s tracheostomy and that it was not a treatment that was being offered to Z and so is not an option for the court to choose.  Z has been dependent on his tracheostomy since his brain injury in September 2021. There have been no formal attempts to wean him off this device. That was the advice given from the acute hospital and continued on his transfer to the RHN due to the nature of his primary malignancy and neck surgery. </p>

To remove it would be a step into the unknown as whilst Z may die relatively quickly he may not and he may continue breathing independently for some time. It is not possible to remove a tracheostomy and &#8216;see what happens&#8217;, consideration would need to be given to the nature of the weaning process (which could take several months to a year) and to justify the purpose of doing it.  </p>

It would be highly likely to increase his respiratory effort, work of breathing, and physiological distress. In Dr H&#8217;s view that situation would be very difficult to manage clinically bearing in mind the TEP. Dr H recognised that there is an ongoing burden of care in managing the tracheostomy, the most significant of which is the suctioning that is required on average about 6 times per day, but can sometimes be double that frequency. If the tracheostomy was removed Dr H&#8217;s evidence was that it would not be clear Z would die, there is a chance he could continue to breathe and the support required to enable him to do that would be disproportionate at every level and could include Z drowning in his own secretions and may take months.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr H also addressed deflating the cuff of Z&#8217;s tracheostomy as part of the PCP if CANH is discontinued. The purpose of the inflated cuff on a tracheostomy is to reduce secretions creeping down into the lung from the throat above the cuff. If the main tracheostomy and inner tubes get blocked with thickening secretions, there would be no airway available and any patient will quickly go into respiratory arrest. If the cuff remained inflated to ensure there were no blockages to the tubes Z would have to be examined and monitored continuously connected to a monitor and alarm, with frequent clinical interruptions. The aim of the PCP is to ensure that as far as possible Z remains calm, pain free with as little medical intervention as possible.</p>

This may result in Z struggling to breathe which could result in additional intrusive medical intervention, including suctioning. By deflating the tracheostomy cuff, if it can be tolerated, the likelihood of blockages is reduced as is the need for intervention.</p>

Dr H recognised the concern expressed by W about Z experiencing hunger and thirst if CANH is withdrawn. In his opinion, due to the nature of Z&#8217;s condition, it is unlikely hunger and thirst would be sensations Z would perceive. Dr H emphasised the importance of good mouth care and to keep mucus membranes moist. He recognised there would be noticeable changes, for example Z&#8217;s skin would change, he would have a more gaunt appearance. Dr H&#8217;s view was Z would not become skeletal, as feared by W. The purpose of the PCP is to proactively alleviate as much as possible so that a calm environment can be achieved for Z to enable him to die in peace and with dignity with his family and friends there, if they wished, supported by the experienced clinical team.</p>

As regards Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings Mr Rylatt acknowledges that due to Z&#8217;s current position it is not possible to ascertain those and it is not a situation that he had expressed a view on previously. However, there is unanimity of views that Z would not want to live in his current condition. W expresses her belief that Z would want a quick death rather than the delay and uncertainty if CANH was withdrawn and for W to witness that. She considers her view is fortified by researches Z made when he was first diagnosed with cancer about dying with dignity.</p>

He is relatively stable at the moment, in the sense that he does not fluctuate but that is down to the highly skilled clinical care supported by the consistency of the devoted care provided by W. There is a constant risk of an acute event (such as a chest infection) that could lead to death due to the TEP, with the result that Z would succumb to whatever the acute event may be. Z could, in those circumstances, die very quickly or over a more prolonged period of time, with possible challenges in managing his clinical care.

Although Z has no conscious experience of pain there is evidence of Z responding to certain care with grimacing, coughing and going red (for example during suctioning). In addition, there will be the need to replace the PEG, which will involve Z going to an acute hospital. This needs to be considered in the context that Z has not left the RHN since his arrival there in December 2021.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">If CANH is discontinued Z is likely to die within 1 &#8211; 3 weeks. Dr H considers it more likely to be a week. Dr Barry cautions that whilst these are the averages it can (unusually) be longer. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">What W understandably wants is for Z to be able to die swiftly and she believes that is what Z would want. That is not an option open to the court.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">The united view of the medical evidence is that it is in Z&#8217;s best interests if CANH is discontinued. They are all experienced specialist clinicians who have taken great care in reaching their decisions. Whilst their conclusions are not decisive they have, in my judgment, carefully balanced the benefits/burdens in reaching their respective conclusions.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">In seeking to understand Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings, beliefs and values there is unanimity that he would not want to live in his current condition. I agree. There are then differing views about what his wishes would be if he could not die swiftly. No one suggests Z had this discussion with them. W relies on the fact that</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0in">he searched dying with dignity after his diagnosis. What W says is that Z would find it difficult to accept the changes to his body brought about if CANH was discontinued. Even accepting that some changes may take place it has to be balanced with the alternative which is for him to remain living, possibly for a number of years, in a way that everyone accepts he would not want. As Dr H described he did not believe that Z would wish to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;remaining alive at all costs in a state of permanent unconsciousness from which all semblance of a treasured identity has since departed&#8217;.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.25in">There would undoubtedly be a short term burden to CANH being discontinued asit may involve changes to be managed (such as thickening secretions requiring suctioning), changes in Z&#8217;s appearance which may be very distressing to others but they would be relatively limited when compared to the longer term clinical management and risks if CANH remained in place. The PCP provides a well thought out, proactive and flexible plan to manage Z&#8217;s condition so that he would experience minimum interference. Whilst I recognise the distress this decision will cause to W and others, in my judgment, when balancing the benefits/burdens of the alternatives it is the option more focussed on Z&#8217;s best interests which is what guides any decision I reach. Based on the evidence the court has Z would not want anything to cause W distress but equally he would be concerned about the continuing conflict, the position he is in and there being no other better option for anyone.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.25in">I fully recognise that there can be no guarantee about any of the timescales given,and that factor has to be weighed in the balance. However, the collective experience and expertise of Drs H, Nair and Barry, which I accept, was that if CANH was discontinued it is likely Z would die within 1 &#8211; 3 weeks. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:-0.25in">(12)In my judgment, the evidence demonstrates from those who have actual experience of this that discontinuing CANH will enable Z to die with dignity, in the least discomfort, in the greatest peace and with those who want to be with him to be able to do so. </p>
