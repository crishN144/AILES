	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application before the Court is for the continuation and extension of a reporting restriction order.  The order relates to four children, Maisie Stedman born 9 February 2009 (2 months), Chantelle Stedman, her mother born 22 December 1993 (15), Alfie Patten born 3 January 1996 (13), who it was alleged was the father of Maisie, but in respect of whom DNA has shown that not to be the case and Tyler Barker born 7 May 1994, (nearly 15) who believes he may be the father of Maisie and is about to be the subject of DNA testing. The court is however primarily concerned with Chantelle, Alfie and Maisie.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a consequence of Mr Patten&#8217;s actions Maisie, Chantelle and Alfie became the subject of intense media interest.  Photographs and video footage were taken at the hospital on 11 February 2009 and video footage and photographs were taken at the Stedman&#8217;s family home the following day with the consent of Chantelle&#8217;s mother.  </p>

The sensational aspect of the feature was not that her mother was aged 15 years but that Alfie, the alleged putative father, had only just turned 13.  The article continues to be available on <span style="font-style:italic">The Sun&#8217;s</span> website together with photographs, the video of all three of the children and an interview with Alfie and Chantelle.</p>

The following day in light of the intense media focus the Stedmans stayed at a friend&#8217;s house for a few days before returning home on 22 February 2009.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is hard to comprehend the amount of publicity the birth of this baby generated.  There has been extensive publicity throughout the world and the belief that Chantelle had conceived Maisie whilst Alfie was 12 provoked a public debate about teenage pregnancy and sex education for those under 16.  The story was carried nationally and internationally in the tabloids and in the broadsheets.  Comments were made by the Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition and the Government&#8217;s children&#8217;s secretary. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within a matter of days after the first article there was speculation in the press that Alfie was not in fact the father.  On 17 February 2009 &#8217;The Mail Online&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic"/>carried a story naming another two boys as potential fathers with photographs of each of them (an article which is also still available on the newspaper&#8217;s website).  The article described what they referred to as &#8216;farcical scenes&#8217; when Mr. Patten arrived at Alfie&#8217;s home wearing a devil mask and carrying a fluorescent yellow placard saying &#8220;No Comment. Call Max.&#8221; (a reference to a well-known publicist) with a TV crew from Channel 4 in close attendance.  Even the time honoured phrase &#8216;media circus&#8217; does not adequately describe what went on in the first week or so after Maisie&#8217;s birth.</p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s concerns about the media frenzy were such that on 17 February 2009 they obtained an order that Maisie, Chantelle and Alfie should be made Wards of Court.  The following day, 18 February 2009, the Local Authority made an application for a reporting restrictions order in order to prevent further publicity about Maisie, Chantelle or Alfie.  The matter came before Mrs. Justice Baron who made an order which was to last until 10 March 2009.  </p>

The current evidence is that Chantelle is making good progress in that she now feels able to go out and about with Maisie and is hoping to start to go to school 1 day a week in the near future.  The Local Authority is concerned in the short term that progress may be damaged, and that there may be long term consequences if the media are allowed to print stories about the DNA tests and accompany them with photographs.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">In differing ways Chantelle and Alfie have suffered harm. Alfie enjoyed the attention the media gave him but his Guardian is of the opinion, which I accept, that he has been psychologically damaged by the whole experience. Chantelle in the early stages had a miserable time. No doubt she thought there would be nice photographs of her and Alfie in the papers, instead she not only read hurtful and what she felt to be inaccurate things about her, but for the first few days the family were door-stepped, leading to them leaving home for some days prior to the original order being made. Chantelle was subjected to some verbal abuse in her locality.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">It is submitted on behalf of the Local Authority that, if further publication is allowed, it will inevitably cause further harm to the children; things have calmed down and reactivation of the publicity will once again expose them to damaging comment. There is, it submits, no public interest in knowing who the father of Maisie is or is not; Mr Lord reminds me that interest of the public is not the same as public interest. Alfie, they say, needs protection from further exploitation and permitting the story to run, far from putting the record straight, potentially exposes him to ridicule.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">It is submitted by the Local Authority that any media coverage would doubtless involve a rehearsal of prurient and unkind speculation as to Chantelle&#8217;s sexual activities and as to the identity of alternative candidates for the father.  Photographs would enable her to be identified and potentially expose her to renewed verbal abuse. The harm caused may, it is suggested, be long term and may seriously impact on Chantelle&#8217;s ability adequately to parent Maisie even to the point where she has to be removed from her mother&#8217;s care.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">I accept that further publicity will be very distressing and damaging for Chantelle.  Judging from the tone and content of some of the earlier reporting, a rehash of public domain information will be hurtful and is unlikely to pay heed to her youth, naivety or the fact that she bears absolutely no responsibility for the fact that she is in the public eye.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1">This is confirmed to me, if confirmation was needed, by Mr. Nicklin&#8217;s response to a suggestion made by me that reporting the DNA test results did not require photos of Chantelle and Maisie and that perhaps <span style="font-style:italic">The Sun</span>, (if <span style="font-style:italic">The Sun</span> succeeded in resisting the Local Authority application), could act in Chantelle&#8217;s interests and refrain from publishing photographs of her and Maisie. Mr. Nicklin told me that such a photograph would be likely to be used, not to mislead so as to suggest they were a family, but to show what had been thought to be the case prior to the DNA test results. In any event he rightly said that he only represented NGN Ltd and he could not speak for the rest of the media.

Newspapers are sometimes irresponsible and their motives in a market economy cannot be expected to be unalloyed by considerations of commercial advantage. And publication may cause needless pain, distress and damage to individuals or harm to other aspects of the public interest. But a freedom which is restricted to what judges think to be responsible or in the public interest is no freedom. Freedom means the right to publish things which government and judges, however well motivated think should not be published. It means the right to say things which &#8216;right-thinking people&#8217; regard as dangerous or irresponsible. This freedom is subject only to clearly defined exceptions laid down by common law or statute.&#160;&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1">I have however seen no evidence in support of the &#8216;Armageddon outcome&#8217; floated by the Local Authority; that the consequences of more publicity may result in Chantelle being so distressed that she will be unable to care for her child and Maisie will, as a consequence, end up in the care of the Local Authority.  Such an extreme outcome fails to take into account that, all things considered, Chantelle is doing well with Maisie.  They are living with Mrs Stedman who, regardless of whatever errors of judgment she may have made,  offers them the guidance and support one would expect from a grandmother in these difficult circumstances. Chantelle&#8217;s Guardian referred to further publicity as likely to cause a &#8216;serious setback&#8217; for Chantelle and that unmanaged reporting would be gravely detrimental to Chantelle&#8217;s emotional and psychological welfare.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">No court would choose for Chantelle to go through what she will go through if I refuse the Local Authority application. I by no means underestimate the misery which the media is capable of inflicting on Chantelle by the tone of their reporting. I must however conduct the balancing exercise with care, reminding myself always that, in the context of this application, the welfare of the wards is not the paramount consideration of the court.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">The Local Authority seeks also to prevent the disclosure of the results of the DNA saying it would harm Alfie (as well as Chantelle and Maisie).  Alfie&#8217;s Guardian does not agree. She thinks that the information should be released and asserts that it is impossible to remove all the photographs and images of Alfie already in the public domain.  The Local Authority&#8217;s fall back position is that, if the results of the DNA test are to be disclosed, it should be done in a controlled way without pictures and in a form that seemed to me to be more in the nature of a press release rather than a news piece, with neither Chantelle nor Maisie&#8217;s names being mentioned.</p>

It was these falsehoods (as was conceded), which made it justifiable for the newspaper to report the fact that she was an addict. The issue in dispute before the court was whether the newspaper went too far in publishing associated facts about her private life. The House of Lords held that details of Miss Campbell&#8217;s therapy and treatment went beyond that which was necessary to the legitimate story (that she had deceived the press) and went beyond the journalistic margin of appreciation. </p>

During the course of the hearing a Google Image search of Chantelle Stedman produced 5,660 images of her often including Maisie as well.

Star Newspaper Co Ltd</span> [1894] 11 TLR 4 and <span style="font-style:italic">Creation Records Ltd v. News Group Newspapers Ltd </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1997/370.html" style="text-decoration-line:none;color:initial"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] EMLR 444" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] EMLR 444</ref></a>, 456. The same may generally be true of private information of a personal nature. Once intimate personal information about a celebrity's private life has been widely published it may serve no useful purpose to prohibit further publication. The same will not necessarily be true of photographs. Insofar as a photograph does more than convey information and intrudes on privacy by enabling the viewer to focus on intimate personal detail, there will be a fresh intrusion of privacy when each additional viewer sees the photograph and even when one who has seen a previous publication of the photograph is confronted by a fresh publication of it. To take an example, if a film star were photographed, with the aid of a telephoto lens, lying naked by her private swimming pool, we question whether widespread publication of the photograph by a popular newspaper would provide a defence to a legal challenge to repeated publication on the ground that the information was in the public domain. There is thus a further important potential distinction between the law relating to private information and that relating to other types of confidential information."</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Nicklin rightly emphasises that the &#8216;naked film star&#8217; example used in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hello!</span> case is an example of a photograph that is intrinsically intrusive namely a covert picture taken of a person whilst naked; the intrusion on her privacy with each repeated publication is obvious. In the present case, he submits, the photographs in question are not intrusive per se; they merely show a young boy or girl or baby whether together or separately. The photographs, Mr. Nicklin says, do not therefore fall into the &#8216;naked film star&#8217; category (another example of which are the <span style="font-style:italic">Mosley</span> images), rather, he says, they fall within the category whereby the information, in the form of the photographs, has been widely published and it therefore serves no useful purpose to prohibit further publication.</p>

NGN Ltd should not be able to bolster their case by relying on the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">The Daily Mirror</span> has already published the story in relation to the DNA tests to their readership of about 5million.  That publication was, he submits, if not a flagrant breach of the order of Baron J of 18 February 2009 at the very least  wholly contrary to the spirit of an order which was quite clearly designed to prevent the reporting of &#8216;new&#8217; information about the children. To allow NGN Ltd to rely on the publication of the DNA test results in support of their &#8216;public domain&#8217; argument would, the Local Authority say, undermine the authority of the judiciary.</p>

It seems to me to be an absurd state of affairs that copies of the book, all of course originating from Peter Wright - imported perhaps from the United States - should now be widely circulating in this country, and that at the same time other sales of the book should be restrained. To me, this simply does not make sense. I do not see why those who succeed in obtaining a copy of the book in the present circumstances should be able to read it, while others should not be able to do so simply by obtaining a copy from their local bookshop or library. In my opinion, artificially to restrict the readership of a widely accessible book in this way is unacceptable: if the information in the book is in the public domain and many people in this country are already able to read it, I do not see why anybody else in this country who wants to read it should be prevented from doing so.&#8221;</p>

One may express this conclusion either by saying that Mr Mosley no longer has any reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of this now widely familiar material or that, even if he has, it has entered the public domain to the extent that there is, in practical terms, no longer anything which the law can protect. The dam has effectively burst. I have, with some reluctance, come to the conclusion that although this material is intrusive and demeaning, and despite the fact that there is no legitimate public interest in its further publication; the granting of an order against this Respondent at the present juncture would merely be a futile gesture. Anyone who wishes to access the footage can easily do so, and there is no point in barring the <span style="font-style:italic">News of the World</span> from showing what is already available.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1">When assessing the words of Eady J, I bear in mind that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, Y (Children) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] EMLR 29" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EMLR 29</ref> the public domain material was old and had been published only in local newspapers. In<span style="font-style:italic"> A v M </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 562" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 562</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>the information in the public domain was information from court proceedings concerning the children which proceedings had been held in private. Although the mother had approached the media, there had been no widespread publicity of the type in either the <span style="font-style:italic">Mosley </span>case or the present case. In both cases the injunction was capable of enforcement.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">I have to deal with the reality of the situation regardless of whether or not the <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Mirror</span> article was published lawfully. There are not just hundreds of public domain photographs of Chantelle, Maisie and Alfie in existence, there are tens of thousands all over the world and largely on the internet. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"> The Local Authority says that it is the print medium which will be particularly damaging to Chantelle and that the injunction they propose can be enforced so far as the print media is concerned. I feel unable to reach any such conclusion: print may appear to be the most immediate medium but it is a matter of public record that newspaper circulation is suffering as a consequence of the large number of (particularly younger) people reading the news online. If the fear is that it is printed stories which will render Chantelle vulnerable to abuse it should not be overlooked that young people can be every bit as cruel and thoughtless as every other age group</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">In taking a pragmatic view about the publication of public domain photographs of Alfie, Mr Inglis said that it is &#8216;simply anachronistic to assert that the net is a less accessible medium than the printed press.&#8217;  I agree. If that were the case why, for example, would &#8220;No 10&#8221; set up its own &#8220;YouTube&#8221; channel upon which the Prime Minister has appeared?</p>

It is not for the court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. Article&#160;10 entitles journalists to adopt a particular form of presentation intended to ensure a particularly telling effect on the average reader. As Neill&#160;LJ recognised, a tabloid newspaper is entitled to tell the story in a manner which will engage the interest of its readers and the general public. If there is no basis for injuncting a story expressed in the temperate or scholarly language of a legal periodical or the broadsheet press there can be no basis for injuncting the same story simply because it is expressed in the more robust, colourful or intemperate language of the tabloid press.&#160;</p>
