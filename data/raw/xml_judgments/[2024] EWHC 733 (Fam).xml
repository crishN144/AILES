	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 3 October 2023 the online divorce portal operated by HM Courts and Tribunals Service [&#8216;HMCTS&#8217;] issued a final order of divorce in proceedings between Mrs Williams, the applicant wife, and Mr Williams, the respondent husband. The solicitors acting for the applicant, who had used the online divorce portal to apply for the final order, did so without the instruction or authority of their client, Mrs Williams. The solicitors have explained that the member of staff involved had intended to apply for a final order of divorce for another client, in a different divorce case, but inadvertently opened the electronic case file in &#8216;Williams v Williams&#8217; and proceeded to apply for a final order in that case.</p>

It must, however, be observed that the difficulty in the present case does not arise in that way. An application was made for a final order and the court&#8217;s system issued a final order. There was no apparent error made by the court and nothing on the face of the order to suggest, to use Mr Todd&#8217;s phrase, that it did not reflect &#8216;the court&#8217;s intention&#8217;. The error here was in the making of the application, not the granting of the order. As Gwynneth Knowles J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">IC v RC </span>[2020] EWHC 2997:</p>

Mr Todd accepts that some wording has clearly been omitted from the order, but that is a matter that could be rectified under the slip rule as it was clearly the intention of the court that the final order should be set aside. It is the Wife&#8217;s case that the DDJ was given an accurate factual account by her solicitors of their mistake, and that the Husband&#8217;s solicitors, whilst not on formal notice, had been told of the application and had communicated their views to the court. Mr Todd therefore submitted that the order of 17 October should not be disturbed and, as a result, the final order of divorce has already been set aside and the couple remain validly married. He invited this court to confirm that that was the position.</p>

The rule is apparently broad and unfettered, but considerations of finality, the undesirability of allowing litigants to have two bites at the cherry, and the need to avoid undermining the concept of appeal, all push towards a principled curtailment of an otherwise apparently open discretion. Whether that curtailment goes even further in the case of a final order does not arise in this appeal.</p>

He observed that each of the options put forward by Mr Todd referred to process and procedure rather than substance. CPR, r 3.1(7) and FPR 2010, r 4.1(6) are concerned with &#8216;case management&#8217;, in contrast to a final order for divorce which was, he submitted, pre-eminently not a matter of case management.</p>

It is the Husband&#8217;s case that there is, therefore, no factual or legal basis for rescinding the final order of divorce. The Wife had petitioned for divorce, she was entitled to a divorce, a conditional order had been made and a procedurally valid application had been made by her solicitors for the final order to be issued; all was, therefore, in order and, in Mr Ewins&#8217; submission, there is no ground for the final order to be rescinded.</p>

Sir James Munby P, whilst acknowledging that the original error had been in the petition, held that the causative errors leading to the granting of court orders ending the marriage, when there was in reality no jurisdiction to do so, were errors of the court staff and judges. He held that the decrees were voidable, rather than void, and, in the circumstances where both parties had remarried, relying upon the decree absolute, he did not set the orders aside.

That is something one finds sometimes stated in terms &#8211; as by Phillimore LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">P v P</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1971] P 217" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">[1971] P 217</ref>, at 225, by Sir George [Baker] in <span style="font-style:italic">Dryden v Dryden</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] Fam 217" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] Fam 217</ref>, at 236, by Rees J in Wright v Wright <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] Fam 114" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] Fam 114</ref>, at 124, and by Holman J (who, as we have seen, knows a lot about these things) in <span style="font-style:italic">Krenge v Krenge</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 969" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 969</ref>, at 978 &#8211; and it is, in truth, implicit in much of the analysis which underpins all these cases. And the language used is typically robust. If Phillimore LJ confined himself to the proposition that a court &#8216;ought not lightly to treat a decree absolute as void&#8217;, Sir George, followed by Holman J, said that the court &#8216;should strive to hold that a decree absolute is voidable rather than void&#8217;, while Rees J said that the court &#8216;should only hold a decree absolute to be void if driven by the terms of the relevant statute so to hold.&#8217;</p>

Like many similar online processes, an operator may only get to the final screen where the final click of the mouse is made after travelling through a series of earlier screens. First of all, a solicitor, who may have a series of different divorce proceedings &#8216;live&#8217; on the system at any one time, must select one particular case. It was at this stage that the error made by Vardags&#8217; operative apparently took place. Thereafter a number of other screens must be traversed, each of which prominently bears the names of the parties (for example &#8216;Williams v Williams&#8217;). At the final stage, after clicking the request for a final order, a further screen comes up inviting the operative to confirm that this is indeed what is sought &#8211; again the name of the case is prominently displayed on this screen.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Shahzad</span>, a decree absolute had been pronounced notwithstanding the wife&#8217;s pending application to rescind the decree nisi [the &#8216;conditional order&#8217; in modern terms] on the basis that the date of marriage had been incorrectly pleaded by the husband in order to assert that there had been two years&#8217; separation, when in reality the couple had only been married for a year prior to the alleged separation date. At first instance the judge set the decree absolute aside, not only because of the allegation of fraud, but also because, procedurally, the decree should not have been granted while an application by the wife to rescind the decree nisi had been pending. The husband appealed on the basis that there had been no legal basis for setting the decree absolute aside. The Court of Appeal dismissed the husband&#8217;s appeal.</p>

They are limited because a decree absolute is a declaratory judgment which conclusively determines a person&#8217;s marital status. In addition to the parties, all public authorities and all other individuals are entitled to rely on the declaratory effect of the decree. This can have significant consequences across a wide range of issues including, for example, the right to marry. To take that example, if a prior decree absolute were set aside, any subsequent marriage would be void under s 11(b) of the 1973 Act.</p>

This, as Mr Timson rightly accepted, made the decree absolute voidable.

Neither party argued that there should be any difference in approach as between a decree absolute and a final order of divorce in this respect; both orders are to be regarded in like manner. It is, therefore, in the public interest that a final order of divorce should be unimpeachable when &#8216;granted by a court with competent jurisdiction and after compliance with the correct procedural requirements&#8217;.

I am unpersuaded that these circumstances do render the order voidable. Further, I accept Mr Ewins&#8217; submission that the court should be very slow to open up a potential third stage in divorce proceedings where, post-final order, a party can come back and say that the application for the order was made by mistake.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Sir James Munby P concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span>, there is a general lack of appetite to find that the consequence of &#8216;irregularity&#8217; is that a decree is void rather than voidable. In any event, the case put by Mr Todd, at its highest, was that the circumstances of this case render the final order voidable, rather than void. Assuming (which I do not) that that is correct, then a conclusion that the order is voidable does not, of itself, conclude matters. The court would have to move on and be persuaded that the final order should be set aside in order to do justice to all those whose interests were engaged. In that context, as held in <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic">Shahzad</span> and in the earlier cases, there is a strong public policy interest in respecting the certainty and finality that flows from a final divorce order and maintaining the status quo that it has established. Approaching the question in that manner, if the final order in this case were voidable because of the solicitors&#8217; error in applying for it without their client&#8217;s authority, any public policy or other factor in favour of setting the order aside would be far outweighed by the almost invariable policy preference not to do so. </p>
