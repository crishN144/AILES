		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.33in;margin-right:0.61in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">The short answer is that 'necessary' means necessary. It is, after all, an ordinary English word.

British society is now multicultural.  Assessing parents and family members may, quite frequently does, involve considering individuals based anywhere in the world.  I&#160;do not believe that the obligation to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt">explore</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the family option for a child is weakened in any way by geography, although it can provide real challenges to already overstretched resources. The viability of these options must, from the outset, be evaluated rigorously and reviewed regularly.  The need for such assessments must be addressed at the very beginning of proceedings.  Late identification of potential family carers abroad may bring two fundamental principles of the Children Act into conflict, namely the desirability, if possible, of a child being brought up in its extended family (where parents are for some reason unable to care for the child themselves) and the need to avoid delay in planning for a child&#8217;s future.  Neither principle should be regarded as having greater weight.  The recent reforms to the family justice system have sought to emphasise why it was that the avoidance of delay was given statutory force by the Children Act and the real and lasting harm delay causes to children, particularly in public law care proceedings.  There will, in my judgement, be occasions when the obstacles to assessment of family members abroad create such delays that to pursue the option will be inconsistent with the child&#8217;s own timescales.  These are taxing and exacting decisions but they require to be confronted with integrity and without sentimentality.</span></p>

The fact that a family member may live in a country where there are high levels of crime for example, or terrorism, corruption, or civil unrest will undoubtedly be relevant to the overall evaluation of the factors set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, but to my mind they will rarely, if ever, be determinative in and of themselves.  It is the care offered by the individual that weighs most heavily and not the challenges faced by the State in which he lives.

There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that prior to that time she had been providing perfectly satisfactory care for her children with support.

However it quickly emerged that Somaliland would be too dangerous for the social worker to travel to.  That information came from two sources: firstly, the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office (F.C.O) secondly from C.F.A.B.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised against all travel to Somaliland except two cities, Hargeisa and Berbera, to which the F.C.O. advise only &#8220;essential&#8221; travel.  The F.C.O. offers guidance to British nationals, that is part of its function.

He further stresses that their commitment to the assessment was evidenced by the fact that they had identified three Somali social workers working in the UK before in fact selecting a particular social worker.  In addition they had explored the possibility of instructing an external, independent social worker.  Mr.&#160;Sharpe set out how, on receiving the advice of the FCO and CFAB, the authority came to the conclusion that it would be simply unsafe for a social worker to visit Somaliland.  The decision was taken by the Local Authority&#8217;s interim head of Children&#8217;s Services.  Mr.&#160;Sharpe says that is an indication of the extent to which this Local Authority has subjected this matter to scrutiny, conscious as it is of it&#8217;s obligation to the children to explore, wherever possible, the option of children being brought up by their father.  The conclusion was that it would be simply &#8220;reckless&#8221; to send a social worker to the area.  A visiting professional perceived to be acting for the UK government was likely, on the available evidence, to be at increased risk.  In the Local Authority&#8217;s view that was an unacceptable risk and, had that worker come to harm, Mr Sharpe considered &#8220;the Local Authority would be justly censured for acting against FCO advice&#8221;.  I agree.</span></p>

In relation to the FCO website entry which has been downloaded, copied and filed within these proceedings, Mr.&#160;Millington accepts that the advice is, &#8220;Against all travel to Somalia including Somaliland &#8230;&#8221;.  However, he submits, the court should consider that the FCO advice is specifically tailored to British nationals and/or westerners generally.  Mr.&#160;Millington said this is clear from the content of the website:</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Millington says the advice is directed to westerners and those working for western organisations.  The constant threat of terrorist attacks identified in Mogadishu and the evidence before me of the existence of extant violence against westerners in Somaliland, is, it is said, really confined to westerners.  To address this Mr.&#160;Millington identifies an independent social worker who is not, &#8220;a westerner&#8221; but has dual nationality, both British and Nigerian.  This person, a Ms.&#160;Coker, has indicated that notwithstanding the parlous situation in Somaliland she would be content to travel there, undertake the assessment and do so on her Nigerian passport.  However, there is no evidence at all upon which to substantiate the assertion that she would be less likely to be at risk as apparently a non-westerner whose purpose in Somaliland could be kept covert.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Furthermore, it is said that Ms Cole would be undertaking the assessment at the behest of the English court and therefore there should be no reason for anyone outside of the father&#8217;s immediate circle to be aware of this.  I&#160;have been told that she has been referred to the CFAB and FCO guidance and is nonetheless still willing to travel.  It is further submitted that if the court were to determine that there should be no further assessment of the father in Somaliland then given the likely problems with obtaining a visa, such a decision would effectively have the consequence of ruling him out of the children&#8217;s lives permanently as a long-term carer.  Accordingly, it is submitted that so crucial is the assessment that it plainly falls within even the narrowest concept of &#8220;necessary&#8221; within the provisions to which I&#160;have alluded.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The local authority opposes any assessment of the father by an independent social worker.  Mr.&#160;Sharpe did not accept the assertion that Ms.&#160;Coker was necessarily at lower risk than any British national merely by virtue of her dual nationality.  Moreover he outlines some real practical issues: Ms.&#160;Coker would not be able to communicate directly to the father in his own language.  He would require an interpreter and Mr.&#160;Sharpe says (in my judgment with some force) that the mere presence of the interpreter in these circumstances would draw attention to their situation and would heighten the risk to her.  Logically, Mr Sharpe observes that it would therefore expose at least two people to risk: the social worker and the translator.  In addition, it is said, the use of an interpreter will undermine the effectiveness of the assessment in the country.  To my mind that is not a strong point.  It will of course very much depend on the quality of the interpreter but the Family Court is used to taking evidence through interpreters, and to evaluating the nuances of language through translation. </span></p>

In the U.K., where assessments of prospective carers are undertaken with interpreters, the social work team aims to communicate with and to forge a working relationship with the family.  The unfolding nature of this process, to paraphrase Mr.&#160;Sharpe, often provides an ongoing and continuing assessment throughout the course of the litigation itself.  That simply would not be possible in these circumstances.</span></p>

Mr.&#160;Sharpe considers these enquiries to be unrealistic and also suggests that they will further attract attention to the independent social worker and her translator and thus heighten risk.</span></p>

However, to my mind, that is not the end of the matter, other options could be considered.  More importantly in my view, is the obligation upon the parties and the court at this very early stage to look at the real viability of any proposals that the father seeks to advance through counsel. </span></p>

Although they are coping well, they have been subjected to a profound trauma, not only the direct experience to themselves but the experience of losing their sibling.  The ordeal they have endured is not merely one of truly profound physical neglect, it is also one of acute emotional deprivation.  </span></p>

I&#160;do not require a psychologist or a therapist to tell me that it is likely that this period in their lives will take a long time to assimilate and for them to understand, if indeed they ever do.  They are already being provided indirectly with therapeutic support via the foster carers who I&#160;have been told are providing an outstanding level of care, largely intuitively, as they are not specialist foster carers.  The children are very lucky to have them, they have shown real insight.</span></p>

Conventionally, that will involve an initial assessment and most likely some program of specialist therapeutic intervention.  This court also regularly hears that trauma in the early lives of young children often surfaces in adolescence where reactivation of mental health support and services is often required.  This may be relevant when considering the legal framework for the longer term.</span></p>

In evaluating the issue of assessment I also have to consider what is ultimately contemplated by the father&#8217;s application.  Even if it were possible to surmount all the other obstacles identified, the proposal would be to take these children to a country and culture entirely alien to them and one in which the kind of therapeutic support they will need will be unavailable.  The theoretical is ultimately eclipsed by the practical, the children&#8217;s needs and timescales cannot be accommodated by the father&#8217;s case.  Logically, it is at this stage that the wider backdrop of the civil unrest in Somaliland becomes relevant, as part of the overall balancing of the factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </span></p>

I&#160;have already expressed some scepticism about that explanation.  Nonetheless, if he were to be able to obtain a visa to attend the hearing and to be available for assessment, I&#160;have no doubt that the local authority would and indeed should speak with him and assess in whatever framework available, such material as they can, in order that the father is provided with the maximum advantage to advance his case on behalf of his children.</span></p>
