His mother had asked not to have evening care and at the time she had, or was believed to have, capacity to make such decisions (MG&#8217;s assessment just over one month before concluded that RB had capacity to live as she chose). It had been agreed with VW, a local authority mental health social worker for older persons, that RB&#8217;s care would consist of a morning visit and a lunch-time visit, i.e. no evening visit. PB was willing and able to provide the evening care and he was providing RB with a home cooked meal, which she preferred, and putting her to bed. Despite his mother&#8217;s wishes and this agreement, the carer company continued to send out carers in the evenings. These carers were young and inexperienced and were unable to provide the care that RB needed. All of this was communicated to the company but they continued to send carers. PB became increasingly frustrated as he felt that he was banging his head against a wall.</span></p>

The carers were young and inexperienced, and unable to persuade his mother to accept their care.  As a result, RB was left unwashed for more than a week.  Since then, the care plan has been amended to provide a pool of 4-5 carers/support workers who are familiar with RB, to minimise the chances of her refusing care.</span></p>

At the time, it was not clear if RB had capacity to decide whether or not to wash, but it was her wish not to be washed: Staff &#8216;would not overrule her if she said categorically that she did not want to wash.&#8217; There were times when RB did not get on with staff so that they could not deliver care.</span></p>

The social worker PH had noted that she &#8216;co-operated much better with support work staff with whom she was familiar, and that a significant effort had been made to recruit and retain experienced and consistent staff where possible, with a current core team of two workers.&#8217; PB was pointing this out and understandably was upset that his mother was being left unwashed.</span></p>

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">PT did not make a contemporaneous note. She did forward a statement to head office but it is not in the bundle (her statement in the bundle uses the word &#8216;respondent&#8217; rather than head office).</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In her oral evidence, PT said that she did not see what went on initially and she was relying on what the carers told her. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I was told by PT that L is in his early 70s and suffers from dementia. He has a poor short-term memory. He is taller than PB, slender, strong, friendly and jovial. He mobilises well. PT was not aware that L had ever attacked, hit, sworn at, or intimidated a service user, staff member or visitor. He did not wander into other residents&#8217; rooms. He &#8216;is a TV person who goes from his room to the lounge. He may be forgetful but he knows where his room, the lounge and the toilets are.&#8217; He says, &#8216;my room is no. 67.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The incident was reported to the police, &#8216;who took statements,&#8217; including one from PB. The court had not seen these statements. PT did not know the contents of these statements.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">PT told me that statements were taken by care home staff from C (C/110), E (C/111) and CY (C/112). In cross-examination, it was suggested to her that the three of them described the incident in the same way, &#8216;almost word for word.&#8217; Although their statements were similar, PT did not think that the three staff members &#8216;wrote them together&#8217;.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">As to this, I find that C and E&#8217;s statements are almost identical. Either one of them saw the other&#8217;s before writing their statement or they were drafted by them together. The standard of English in C&#8217;s statement is very poor. Neither her statement nor E&#8217;s imparts much information; only that they heard PB shouting at his mother, that the police were called and that PB accused L of holding him around the neck.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">CY&#8217;s statement is more informative. The first she knew of an incident occurring was &#8216;when I overheard RB&#8217;s son shouting aggressively to L never to touch him again&#8217; (C/112). PB &#8216;rushed into the lounge to pick up a chair to point at L. And was about to use the chair against L. His mum was shouting telling him to stop. I pulled L aside and run to phone the senior on duty. PB still continued to exchange words with L, saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to see you with my mum.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">According to PT, CY called the main office to seek assistance at around 7.10pm.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">When PT attended the scene in response to CY&#8217;s call, she asked PB and L what was going on.

PB was not medically examined but he had no obvious physical signs of injury (slap marks, redness of the skin, etc). He was &#8216;very aggressive and out of control &#8230; shouting at the top of his voice.&#8217; &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t get a rational response from him. He kept saying that L needed to be controlled.&#8217; &#8216;I felt unsafe around him because he was so aggressive and verbally aggressive and what I was saying had no effect on him, it didn&#8217;t sway him. I felt that he was out-of-control and I was worried that he would lash out at me.&#8217; She felt that if she pushed any further, &#8216;he might have retaliated.&#8217; His mother &#8216;was anxious and nervous and couldn&#8217;t calm her son down. She was upset and telling him to go home. He did not threaten to hit me and nor did he hit me. It was the volume. I tried to calm him down, using all my experience.&#8217; PB &#8216;was shouting. He would not respond to me so I had to call the police.  &#8216;We got L to sit down, then I explained to PB that the police were being called because I was not getting through. He was shouting that he wanted to talk to the police. PT told PB, &#8216;This is a residential home for the elderly. You can&#8217;t behave like this &#8230; I went to the office and dialled 999. He was hyper, not in control &#8230; PB replied that he wanted to speak to the police. I walked away to make the call, PB walked behind me, shouting and saying that he had been hit. I went to my office. He came down with his mother behind him. I was concerned about his aggressive behaviour. Reception staff came to see what was happening.&#8217; His mother said, &#8216;Calm down, Paul; Go home, Paul.&#8217; While in PT&#8217;s office, he was given some paper and &#8216;began to write down what is written here, while the police were on their way. He started to write out a complaint about the incident just before the police arrived. He was now much calmer than before.&#8217; He then gave PT his note, which appears in the bundle at C/113:</span></heading>

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">PB has consistently stated that L assaulted him and that he was acting in self-defence.  He denies that he &#8216;lifted a chair to hit L with it.&#8217; In his written response to the Scott Schedule, he stated that L had touched him provocatively on two previous occasions, slapping him in the face on 30 June 2011 (see C113). PB backed down on both of those occasions. However, on 1 July 2011, L took it too far when he grabbed PB around the throat.  PB was very upset at being assaulted and he picked up a chair in self-defence to put some distance in between him and L.  </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In cross-examination, PB said that L assaulted him, holding him in a head-lock and trying &#8216;to dig my eyes out. I&#8217;ve been stabbed in the head twice by a mental health person. I&#8217;m not going to allow that again.&#8217; PB said that he did pick up a chair, in order to frighten L off. L wasn&#8217;t calming down and &#8216;still wanted a fight.&#8217; There was no space to swing the chair. L was &#8216;outside in the hallway, I was in the kitchen, with the door frame in between us, preventing the chair from being swung.&#8217; He did not lift L and throw him like a ball: &#8216;He was too strong. I couldn&#8217;t throw him on the floor.&#8217; He did not go down, he came back at me.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">PB accepted that he was shouting at the top of his voice, that PT and his mother were telling him to calm down, that his mother was upset and that initially PT couldn&#8217;t get a rational response from him: &#8216;I&#8217;d just been assaulted.&#8217; He began to calm down once L had sat down, and before he followed PT downstairs. He does not remember CY or anyone else standing between him and L. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Counsel for the Official Solicitor referred PB to his note, C/113, and pointed out that his note referred to two incidents, one from the previous day.  PB&#8217;s note suggested &#8216;that all L did was put his arm around you &#8230; There is nothing in the note about him attacking you, punches, holding you around the throat?&#8217;  PB replied that he didn&#8217;t remember CY or anyone else standing between him and L and confirmed that L did back off when PB lifted the chair.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In his oral submission, counsel for PB reminded me that no charges were laid. The notes attached to PT&#8217;s statement were not in the correct form, and were almost word for word copies of each other. PB said he had been attacked by L and also by him the day before: see C133. There was no evidence that he has lied about that. Reports from the nurses record PB &#8216;speaking about [L] hold him in his neck&#8217; and &#8216;shouting aggressively to L never to touch him again.&#8217; PB&#8217;s response to the perceived threat was not unreasonable.&#8217; PT admitted that she did not see what took place. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In his oral submission, counsel for the Official Solicitor pointed out that there were two issues to determine: (a) whether the court accepts PB&#8217;s evidence on self-defence before Ms T arrived, including what Ms T said about L&#8217;s character; (b) in the light of (a) whether PB&#8217;s behaviour after Ms T arrived was justified?</span></p>

	  <heading class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In my opinion, CY&#8217;s statement is revealing. The first she knew of an incident occurring was &#8216;when I overheard RB&#8217;s son shouting aggressively to L never to touch him again.&#8217; This is consistent with PB&#8217;s note at the time, &#8216;L tried to put his arm round &amp; he was goading me.&#8217; As counsel for the Official Solicitor implied, it is unlikely that L did more than that, given that PB did not record having been punched and nor can any of those present recall him shouting out that he had been punched. The fact that PB picked up a chair and pointed it at L, but did not strike L, is consistent with using the chair as a barrier or block, in self-defence.  PB had accepted many of the allegations put to him and therefore some weight was to be given to his consistent assertion that he was acting in self-defence. Given the location (a facility for frail, older, people), L&#8217;s mental health, age and circumstances and the distress caused to his mother and other persons present, in my view PB&#8217;s reaction was excessive and reflected his problems with anger management, shouting and swearing.</span></heading>

Because of his problems with self-control, anger management, shouting and swearing, PB&#8217;s reaction to the resident&#8217;s behaviour was disproportionate, having regard to the location (a facility for frail, older, people), the resident&#8217;s mental health, age and circumstances and the distress caused to his mother and others. His mother and staff members were upset by his shouting and swearing. Some staff members thought that he was out of control and they felt unsafe.  The police were called.</span></p>

LA&#8217;s response to PB&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s email can be found at G/164 and a carer&#8217;s note is at H/154.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">PB told me in his oral evidence that he was at his mother&#8217;s flat during his sister&#8217;s contact time. This was because his mother had not had a wash or anything to eat and he needed to provide emergency care: &#8216;Yeah, that&#8217;s correct &#8230; As soon as L arrived, I left anyway.&#8217; PB described his presence as being &#8216;an accidental breach, an emergency, I did not regard it as a breach.&#8217; He said that his sisters had been present &#8216;at my visiting times as well&#8217; but did not give any examples or detail in support of this contention.</span></p>

Although a breach of the order, there were mitigating circumstances in that he genuinely believed that his mother needed this care from him.

He &#8216;saw PB raise his voice and become verbally aggressive. He interrupted CL&#8217;s and DB&#8217;s conversation, saying &#8220;That&#8217;s all lies&#8221; &#8230; I&#8217;m the only one who cares about mum; the only one who does anything.&#8217; He was speaking in a loud voice and with an aggressive tone and manner, providing a commentary on what they were saying for slightly less than ten minutes.  He did not swear or physically threaten his sisters. DB was tearful and visibly upset. CL was also upset but Mr H did not see her in tears. The Official Solicitor&#8217;s counsel walked out of the room with the two sisters and, after that, it did not take PB long to calm down. Mr H said that he had been involved with the family for two years. He was shocked &#8216;and did not expect it in a court of law. I&#8217;ve always had a civil relationship with him. I can operate with him but he and his sisters do not get on.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In his oral evidence, PB accepted part of the allegation. He agreed with who was said to have been present.  He also agreed that he shouted at CL, to &#8216;tell her to stop lying all the time.&#8217; He said that, earlier in the litigation, CL had alleged that he had misused &#163;7,000 of his mother&#8217;s money. He remained where he was when CL and DB left the room. He said that he only interrupted once and that his sisters did not ask him to calm down. He did not see DB crying and denied making her cry: &#8216;You can&#8217;t blame me. It&#8217;s not my fault.&#8217;</span></p>

PB&#8217;s counsel reminded me that PB&#8217;s sisters were, and are, privy to the lawyers&#8217; conversations because they are acting in person. They are personally involved in the discussions about changes to the care regime or order and this can make PB feel excluded and disadvantaged.  The sisters had made serious untoward allegations about PB which he resented. With more active management, the incident &#8216;could have been nipped in the bud.&#8216;</span></p>

She did not normally visit at that time. There had been four or five changes to the care plan during the past few months and there may have been confusion. Mr H could not say that RD&#8217;s attendance at this time was discussed with PB in advance. The situation was unfortunate given the restrictions on PB.</span></p>

She said that RB &#8216;was all ready to go and looking forward to having her hair done. She then changed her mind. When PB asked where I was taking RB, his tone changed and RB changed her mind: &#8220;No, my mum doesn&#8217;t want to go.&#8221; PB was shouting loudly and RB was upset. He threw the papers around, saying, &#8216;where is the new care plan?&#8217; Then RB asked about the care plan. PB was getting really angry and was shouting until the police arrived. He shouted for a few minutes. RB said, &#8220;why are you swearing?&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember which swear words he used. I simply remember RB crying and saying, &#8220;stop swearing.&#8221; RB was crying for a few minutes and seemed overwhelmed by the whole situation. I went into the bedroom to put some clothes away. PB started doing some chicken wings while waiting for the police. He was still agitated but had calmed down.  RB was still emotional and asking why when I left, after 45-60 minutes. I had not seen RB that upset before.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">RD believed that she made the hairdresser&#8217;s appointment for RB about a week before and that it was for 3.30pm. She wrote the hairdresser&#8217;s appointment down on RB&#8217;s calendar. PB had been using that time of the week to visit his mother. He turned up expecting to see his mother there. He was frustrated and went into another room, the kitchen. He was shouting and kept saying, &#8216;Where is the care plan.&#8217; He was upset that he was not able to see his mother as per the care plan. He asked RD to contact the office. Initially he said, &#8216;Hurry up and bring her back to see me,&#8217; but his tone of voice then made his mother change her mind. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In his oral evidence, PB said that no one had contacted him beforehand to tell him that his mother would not be available to see him. He believed that he had no other visit left that week because of a change to the day centre visiting arrangements. He did not shout at RD but he did say to her, &#8216;You can leave if you like; there&#8217;s no care plan in place.&#8217; RD replied that she was not leaving and said that she was taking his mother to the hairdresser&#8217;s. At that point, RB said that she wasn&#8217;t going. RD made some phone calls. The only care plan there was one done the previous year by EC.</span></p>

His behaviour often upsets his mother, sisters and professional carers, or alienates them, so as to reduce his chances of achieving the changes he seeks. </span></p>

That is why we are going down this fact-finding route.&#8217; According to Mr Buttler, &#8216;PB&#8217;s inability to express his views without losing his temper indicates the need for such an order. If he is not getting his way there is a real chance that he will shout and swear at people.&#8217;</span></p>
