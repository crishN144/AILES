I considered the relevant law (paras 58-79). I discussed the way forward (paras 83-88). The essential problem was that the father&#8217;s application for &#8220;exceptional&#8221; funding in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</ref> (LASPO), made as recently as 1 July 2014, had, hardly surprisingly, not yet been determined.

If it is not, then I will have to consider what, if any, further order to make. I am inclined to think that, for all the reasons already indicated, the father in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> requires access to legal advice beforehand and representation at the fact-finding hearing to avoid the very real risk of the court being unable to deal with the matter justly and fairly and of his rights under Articles 6 and 8 being breached. I am inclined to think, therefore, that, if he is unable to afford representation and pro bono representation is not available, and if there is no other properly available public purse, the cost will have to be borne by HMCTS.&#8221;</p>

A letter dated 29 September 2014 to the court from the Public Law Project (PLP), which was assisting the father in his application for &#8220;exceptional&#8221; funding, gave a detailed and illuminating account of the process which the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) had adopted in considering the father&#8217;s changing financial circumstances. This culminated in the following letter from the LAA to the PLP dated 26 September 2014:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Please note that the means assessment in respect of your client was based on his financial circumstances at the application. Following the change in his financial circumstances, it was incumbent on your client to complete fresh means assessment form to reflect his current position. In addition, your client will need to provide a letter from his landlord confirming what he currently pays as rent on a weekly or monthly basis. We also need a letter from the relevant Local Authority stating that his Housing Benefit Entitlement has ceased and that he is no longer in receipt of this Benefit. We have requested this additional information because whilst your client has provided us with a receipt a proof of rental payment, the receipt does not indicate what the payment relates to. Neither does it confirm that Housing Benefit is no longer being paid.</p>

At no point during this process has the LAA addressed the merits of [his] case, or considered whether funding should be granted in view of the requirements of fairness and [his] Convention rights.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Counsel for the Mother informed the court (upon her client&#8217;s express instructions) that the Mother states she cannot contemplate being present in the court room whilst the Father is present and that she cannot contemplate being asked questions directly by him, and that as such she will be unable to give evidence or to prove her allegations unless a) there are special measures in the form of a video link in place and b) the father is able to cross examine through a professional advocate. It is therefore the Mother&#8217;s position that should the fact finding hearing proceed without the father having secured legal representation for the fact finding hearing the article 6 rights of the mother and child would be breached, and that should the mother be compelled to give evidence and be asked questions directly by the Father her article 3 rights not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment would be breached (notwithstanding any right to refuse to answer specific questions on the ground of self-incrimination).&#8221;</p>

The information was communicated to the parties by the PLP on 3 November 2014 in an email which said that the father had been offered exceptional case funding, subject to his agreeing to pay a monthly contribution. I was told at the hearing that he had agreed. In these circumstances the problems identified in my previous judgment fell away. There was, accordingly, no need for me to determine the issue referred to in paragraph 8 above. It is better that I say nothing more on the point. It should be determined, if it has to be, in a case where the matter has not been resolved, as here, by the grant of legal aid.</p>

I am immensely grateful to Mr Foster (and, in relation to the previous hearing, Ms Janet Bazley QC) as also to the Bar Pro Bono Unit, for everything they have done to assist the father and the court. They deserve recognition and praise, as also Ms Francesca Wiley who appeared for the father pro bono at an earlier stage in the proceedings.</p>

However, she is absolutely clear that she is unable to countenance the father directly questioning her through cross-examination in person. She does not feel able to give evidence in these circumstances. If she is unable to give evidence this would amount to a breach of Article 8 and 6 insofar as the mother is entitled to a fair trial of her allegations in order to protect her Article 8 rights and those of the child.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>If the mother were able to give evidence (or were compelled either by the court or force of circumstance to do so) she is clear that she would be unable to give her best evidence. This is particularly significant (as in so many instances of domestic / sexual abuse) where there is limited independent evidence and the burden is upon the mother as complainant. Placing the mother in a situation where she would be compelled to attempt to give evidence in order to protect herself and her child from the father&#8217;s future involvement would amount to a breach of Article 8 and 6 insofar as the mother is entitled to a fair trial of her allegations in order to protect her Article 8 rights and those of the child and a fair trial includes enabling a vulnerable witness to give her best evidence. Further, it would amount to a breach of Article 3 in that the cross examination of her as a victim of a serious sexual assault by the perpetrator of that assault would amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. Such an experience would be prohibited by statute for victims of such crimes in the context of criminal proceedings. Articles 6 and 3 are of course absolute rights.</p>

Those avenues have been exhaustively considered and discounted at previous hearings.&#8221;</p>
