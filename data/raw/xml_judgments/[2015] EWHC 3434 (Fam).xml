Firstly, she was fearful that she would be refused leave to enter the United Kingdom because of the irregularities in her immigration position, and would thus be separated from D at the airport.  On 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2015 she had flown into the United Kingdom alone by way of a trial run, presenting both her US and Israeli passports, and was refused leave to enter.  Secondly, she was fearful that if she were permitted to enter the United Kingdom she would be arrested because of the complaint which the father had made to the police about the abduction of D.  It is common ground that in spite of the agreement in the Jerusalem Family Court the father did not withdraw the criminal allegations against the mother until 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2015.  Thirdly, she was fearful that if permitted to enter this jurisdiction she would be ostracised within the Jewish community because she had been told that there were rumours being spread about her that she had committed adultery.  It is clear from the transcript of the evidence heard by the Jerusalem Family Court that the paternal grandmother had given evidence that the mother was having an affair with a taxi driver.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This final hearing has presented something of a forensic challenge in that there was clearly an urgent need for a final determination of the applications.  The mother was to be homeless again come the final day of the hearing and her leave to remain in the jurisdiction was to expire on 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2015.  However, there were fundamental gaps in the information before the court.  CAFCASS had not been directed to carry out safeguarding checks and the information about the mother&#8217;s immigration position and the enforceability in Israel of orders made in this jurisdiction was inadequate.  Doing the best that could be achieved in those difficult circumstances, I heard evidence over four days from both parents, the maternal and paternal grandmothers, and the father's fianc&#233;e, EF.  The case was then adjourned to enable the further information to be gathered.  It was hoped that this could be achieved expeditiously to permit a final judgement to be delivered before the mother&#8217;s visitor visa expired.  The case was adjourned to 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2015 to be heard by way of a video link with my principle court in York, with provision for counsel to file their final written submissions by 5th November 2015 subject to amplification on the 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2015.  </span></p>

To assist the parties, it had been my intention to deliver a final judgement on that day.  Unfortunately, I arrived at Court to be informed that CAFCASS had not allocated the case.  It was the joint submission of Ms. Scriven and Ms. Stone that, in the absence of safeguarding checks, I could not make Child Arrangements orders. As the mother&#8217;s permission to visit the United Kingdom will expire shortly, I will proceed to give a judgement in relation to the Application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s13</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, and return to the Applications pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> at another time.

Within their written and oral evidence, the witnesses raised a number of issues which were clearly of significance to them, some of which were pursued by counsel within their final submissions.  Some of those issues were not integral to my decision-making.  Within this judgment I have ignored those issues which I regard as peripheral and have concentrated upon those issues which, in my judgment, require determination to reach a final decision on the applications before the court.  However, at the conclusion of this judgment, I will give an opportunity for Ms. Scriven and Ms. Stone to identify any issues which I have not dealt with and which they would invite me to deal with.  </span></p>

Each of them had an orthodox Jewish upbringing - the father in London and in Israel, and the mother in Israel.  The father is a British citizen.  The mother has dual Israeli and US citizenship.  The couple entered into an arranged marriage in Israel, having met only twice.  In accordance with custom they spent no time alone together before their wedding.  In accordance with custom, following the marriage, the father moved to live in the mother's country of origin, and just 10 months after their marriage D was born.  She has dual UK and Israeli citizenship.  </span></p>

The father found it very difficult to secure permanent employment in Israel.  The parental sexual relationship was very problematic.  The mother's pregnancy was difficult.  She was forced to spend the last two weeks of that pregnancy in hospital.  She had to have an emergency caesarean.  D was born with a very low birth weight and had to spend the first three weeks of her life in the special care baby unit of the hospital.  The father had a difficult relationship with the maternal grandfather.  Although both orthodox Jews, each parent struggled with the other's style of religious observance.  </span></p>

The parents disagree as to whether the move was intended to be temporary or permanent, and also disagree as to which of them was the instigator of the move.  What is clear, however, is that before the move to the United Kingdom no application was made for the mother to enter this jurisdiction on a spousal visa.  It was unchallenged evidence that the mother can neither read nor write English.  She was reliant upon the father to submit the relevant application and supportive documentation to secure a spousal visa for her.  It was her evidence that she understood that no application was made because the move to the United Kingdom was intended to be a temporary one and a visa application would be expensive.  The father's position was that although the move was intended to be a permanent one, he thought, incorrectly, that an application for a spousal visa could not be made until the mother attained 21.  He failed to take any legal advice about this.</span></p>

The father asserts that the mother has completely twisted the events that occurred on the flight.  He recollects that they both tried to persuade D to go to sleep, that it was the mother who used force whilst all he did was to carry D to the front of the plane to attempt to soothe her.  The burden of proving their respective accounts rests upon each parent to the civil standard of proof.  Very sadly, as I have already highlighted in this judgment, both parents have demonstrated an ability to lie. The mother to the Jerusalem family court, the father to the Immigration authorities, and I find myself in a position of being unable to rely upon any uncorroborated or unsupported evidence from either of them.  However, I make it clear that, even if the mother's account were to be established on evidence which reached the civil standard of proof, it would establish a loss of control by a young father in the context of an arduous and stressful journey with a very young child.  That would not, in my judgment, lead to a finding that the father presented a risk of harm to D.  </span></p>

It is common ground that when they eventually arrived the mother went to the home of the paternal grandmother in a state of distress, described by the paternal grandmother as, &#8216;dishevelled, with D and suitcases&#8217;.  She told the paternal grandmother that she was frightened of the father who had hit D on the plane.  It is common ground that the reaction of the paternal grandmother to the mother's distress was to send the young woman off to read some Psalms and to refuse to permit her to sleep separately from the father under her roof, without advice from a Rabbi.  In my judgment this snapshot of the mother&#8217;s experience supports her account of feeling isolated and unsupported within the paternal family, as did the evidence from the father about the paternal family speaking in Yiddish which was not understood by the mother.</span></p>

What is the relevance of that finding?  Does it, as submitted by Ms. Scriven, demonstrate an attempt to interfere with the relationship between D and her father?  Judicial experience demonstrates that people lie for all sorts of different reasons.  It is clear that the mother's allegations were made at a time when she was feeling very vulnerable and angry.  Forced to return to this jurisdiction as a divorced woman, with temporary leave to remain, who had been reported to the police for child abduction, denounced to the Family Court in Jerusalem as an adulteress, worried that she would be separated from D.  Her lies are abhorrent to this court.  However, in my judgment they are as consistent with the actions of a frightened, and desperate young woman as those of a deliberate schemer intent on undermining the relationship between D and the father.  I note that there is no evidence from those who have observed D that she has anything other than a good relationship with her father, which leads this court to infer that, whatever her own views of the father, the mother has not sought to use her position as primary carer for the child to undermine the child's relationship with the father - sadly, a feature of many of the cases which come before the court.</span></p>

I agree with that description and I am satisfied and find that the mother's anxiety and distress about her situation, which was apparent during the course of the hearing, would be escalated by the knowledge that she was stuck in this jurisdiction against her will, forced to live a destitute lifestyle with no guarantee that she would be granted leave to remain here.  I would be very concerned, if that situation was to continue, that D's need would not be met by her mother, presenting a risk of harm to her, which would not be mitigated by contact with the paternal family, whom the mother might blame for her predicament and who, on my findings, are unsympathetic to the mother in any event.

The inability of the parents to agree about the most basic issues and the extreme contrasts in their lifestyle, would put this little girl in the middle of a conflict between parents who would not be able to agree about the most fundamental of lifestyle choices: dress, education, exposure to newspapers and television.

The fact is that since D's return to this jurisdiction, the father's arrangements have changed significantly.  Just one month after her return he met and formed a friendship with CD, a young divorced lady with two young children of her own.  Within a very short time of meeting, they became engaged, and intend to marry in the near future.  The arrangement which the father suggests to the court would present an enormous change of circumstance for D.  She would have to move from the care of her mother, who has been her primary carer throughout her life. She would move initially to live with the father at the home of the paternal grandmother.  She would then have to move again fairly quickly once the father married EF.  The relationship between the father and EF is itself in its infancy.  They have not yet spent any time alone together.  Each of them has had a failed marriage.  Once married the father will have to step into a paternal role for EF's two young children; that will be a new experience for him.

I&#160;note the proposals that the father has for contact and his offer to fund the cost of any contact in Israel if the mother were to return there.  I have referred already within this judgment to the disapproving, dismissive and unsympathetic attitude of the father towards the mother, which was so evident from his oral evidence.  I have also referred to the willingness of the paternal grandmother to denounce the mother as an adulteress in circumstances where she accepts she did not know whether that were true.  I have referred to the evidence from the paternal grandmother about her reaction to the pleas for help from her daughter in law in November 2014.  I found the tone of the oral evidence from the paternal grandmother particularly troubling.  She articulated empathy for the mother&#8217;s predicament but her tone and body language were palpably hostile towards her.  A line of cross-examination from Ms. Scriven was also of great concern to me.  It was put to the mother in cross-examination that there was something inappropriate about her relationship with her male cousin who had come over from Israel to support her during this difficult time.  The clear impression I gained from that line of cross-examination, which clearly was put on instructions, was that there was a belief in the paternal family that there was something sexually inappropriate between the mother and this cousin.  In his written evidence the father suggested that this cousin had been &#8220;&#8230; kicked out of the army after a month because of his mental health. He is well known in our family to have problems in this area and it worries me that my child is being looked after by him whenever her mother is not there. He is an individual who is very disconnected with society and reality and I worry about D being with him&#8221;. Ms. Stone produced a document that suggested that the cousin was in fact honourably discharged from the army with no mention of mental health problems.  I note that neither the suggestion of impropriety with the cousin nor his alleged mental health problems were advanced by Ms. Scriven in her final written submissions.  </span></p>

It is an area which remains highly volatile.  The father is further opposed to the relocation as he believes that the mother is hostile towards him, his family, and his orthodox faith and is unsupportive of his role in D's life.  Accordingly she is highly unlikely to support contact arrangements or his relationship with D.  In fact the father states that it is far more likely that the mother will seek to undermine that relationship, D's perception of the father, and her perception of the faith and community into which she was born, and frustrate any contact arrangements directed.  The mother has not offered or disclosed any measures which could be taken here or in Israel which could sufficiently reassure the court in this respect.  </span></p>

She now planned to live in an Israeli town on the West Bank in a three bedroomed house owned by her proposed employer.  The town is situated on the West Bank in an area of Arab settlement.  It is a troubled and dangerous area.  She says she has been offered work there by a Mr.&#160;T.  The only evidence provided in support of this offer is a letter from Aharon Hameiri, who described himself as Mr. T's attorney.  There is no evidence from Mr. T, and no evidence that Mr. Hameiri is authorised to act on his behalf.  No information is provided as to the duties the mother would be expected to undertake.  Significantly also the letter does not refer to the provision of housing for the mother, which the mother describes as '</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">part of the package</span><span style="font-size:14pt">'.  Nor is there any reference to the promise referred to by the mother that Mr.&#160;T will pay for her to take driving lessons.  </span></p>

She reverted to the proposal that she would live with her grandmother because of the concerns that the West Bank town is an unsafe area.  However she still proposes to work there on a daily basis (weekdays).  The town is some 98 kilometres away from the area of Jerusalem in which the grandmother lives.  This would involve the mother in substantial - and tiring - travel - two hours by public transport each way each day.  </span></p>

Although she went initially to stay with her mother in March 2015, she did not stay there.  She did not go on to stay then with her grandmother, or any other family member.  Instead she says she took D to friends in the West Bank town.  This would suggest her real inclination is not to live with her grandmother, as she now claims, but in fact to take D to that town again.  </span></p>

In the light of the evidence we have set out above, we submit that the Court must have grave doubts about this.  On her own case, she wants any contact by the father in Israel to be supervised and to be visiting contact for a few hours in a day only.  Moreover she has already made serious allegations of physical abuse by the father to the Israeli police and it is not known what if any intervention they may make should the father travel to Israel.  There is nothing to prevent her making serious allegations against him again.  A mirror order will do little to protect him in those circumstances."  </span></p>

I have some sympathy for Ms. Scriven's description of the arrangements as being inchoate.  However, Ms. Stone referred me to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re F and H (Children)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/692" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 692" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA (Civ) 692</ref>.  The comment was made in the light of a similar situation as facing the mother, a wish to go home.  The Court of Appeal said this:</span></p>

In this commonplace category of cross-border family creation, where the primary carer is returning to a completely familiar environment, the bar is obviously set considerably lower than in the case of an applicant who, in pursuit of some dream or ambition, is proposing to take the children to an unknown and untried environment.  The bar is set particularly low where the primary carer is returning to the completely familiar home life after such a brief absence.  In this instance the mother had only been in this country for six years in total."  </span></p>

There is nothing for her in this jurisdiction where she has no status nor support, is unable to work and has no recourse to public funds.  She wants to return to the country where she was born and raised, and the country in which D was born and has spent periods of time.  She has family and friends in Israel.  She has options for both accommodation and employment.  I do not find that the absence of a finely tuned, clear life plan in Israel should be given significant weight in this particular case.  </span></p>

I have heard no significant criticism of that care until her forced return to this jurisdiction in May 2015. The criticisms made since then relate to the mother&#8217;s enforced insecure lifestyle. I accept the submission of Ms. Scriven that if the mother were permitted to relocate with D, there is a risk that she might not promote contact between D, the father and the paternal family and seek to undermine Ts relationship with them.   Very sadly for D, that, in my judgment, is a risk whichever parent she is placed with.  However, I have formed the very clear view that this father is a very strong character.  In my judgment, he will not be put off; he will ensure that his rights are enforced.  He is much stronger than the mother.</span></p>

His concern that the mother's change of lifestyle might adversely affect his daughter is something which this court understands.  However, in Israel D would continue to have experience of her orthodox Jewish heritage through the maternal extended family, but that experience would continue in circumstances where they do not appear to be disapproving of the mother and her lifestyle in the same way as the paternal family are.  </span></p>

However, I have concluded that this risk is greater if D is placed with her father for the reasons which I have given.  D&#8217;s welfare needs for security with her primary carer and protection from a significant change of circumstance lead me to conclude that it is more consistent with D's welfare for her to live with her mother in Israel, and I have reached the firm conclusion that the move to Israel against the background of all the information to which I have referred in this judgment is a proportionate one for them.  Accordingly, I accede to the mother's application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.13</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and give her permission to remove D permanently from this jurisdiction to Israel. </span></p>
