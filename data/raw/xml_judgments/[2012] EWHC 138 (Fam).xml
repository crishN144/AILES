It is opposed &#8220;with the utmost resolve&#8221; by Michelle Young (&#8220;W&#8221;) who seeks a continuation of the impoundment until the final hearing of her claims for financial remedies following divorce which will be heard over 10 days on 12 November 2012 before Moor J. The effect of the current order has been, and will be unless discharged, to confine H to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. A British citizen does not need a passport to travel to the Republic. </p>

There has been no suggestion in this case that the passport order has restricted H&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">family life</span>. Mr Fitzgerald submits that the notion of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">private life</span> is a broad one. It is &#8220;primarily intended to ensure development, without outside interference, of the personality of each individual in his relations with other human beings&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Botta v Italy</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1998) 26 EHRR 241" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">(1998) 26 EHRR 241</ref>).

In that case, the British High Commission in Sri Lanka had failed to return the claimant&#8217;s passport, despite repeated requests for its return. The claimant claimed damages inter alia for breach of his right to respect for private life under article 8. His ability to work as a seaman was hampered, but there was no evidence that he was unable to work at all. This was relevant because article 8 does not give a right to choose one&#8217;s particular occupation. Nor was there any other evidence &#8220;that the withholding of his passport had any other particular effects on the ability of Mr. Atapattu to enjoy his private life, on his relations with other human beings or on his personal development&#8221; (para. 150). There was accordingly no interference with respect for his private life. </p>

This was on the basis that a passport is an intangible object with no marketable or monetary value and accordingly, on the authorities, is not a possession within the meaning of Article 1, Protocol 1 (paras 160-174).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before parting from the ECHR 1950 I want to make a basic point. Lord Bingham of Cornhill has written that &#8220;it would of course be a travesty to suggest that people living in this country enjoyed no rights until 2 October 2000 when <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> came into force throughout the UK&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Lives of the Law</span>, OUP 2011, p178). It is well known that the draftsman of the Convention sought to express in a straightforward code the rights already largely bestowed on the citizens of this country by common law, statute and Royal Charter. As was said during argument we like to think of ourselves as one of the freest peoples in the world. While our rights and freedoms were not all collected in one place, and were in many instances differently expressed from the language used in the Convention, we had them nonetheless. A high right is the liberty of the subject, which encompasses freedom of movement, and which was historically guaranteed by the judiciary by means of the ancient writ of habeas corpus. So the non-engagement of Arts 5 and 8 does not mean that when considering an application to impound a person&#8217;s passport, questions concerning the liberty of the subject do not loom large. Far from it. As will be seen this is, and always has been, as key question in deciding whether to grant relief of this nature. As long ago as 1628 Sir Edward Coke declared that &#8220;the law favours liberty&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Institutes of the Laws of England, First Part </span>(London, 1628) p124b.</p>

Before 1869 at law a litigant had available the power of arrest and in this way a defendant could be coerced into giving bail.

Authority binds me to this result, but even if it did not, I should reach the same conclusion myself. Today, if Parliament intends a statute to apply to some equitable right or remedy, one expects Parliament to say so. But in times past Parliament was frequently not so explicit, and equity often acted by analogy. Thus, in a number of instances equity acted by analogy with the Statutes of Limitation; but now the comprehensive scope of the Limitation Act, 1939, has removed virtually every need or possibility of this. In the present case, I am concerned with an Act nearly a century old; and it is the standards of those days, when the administration of law and equity was still separate, that must be applied for this purpose. <span style="font-style:italic">Colverson v Bloomfield</span> was, as counsel for the plaintiffs emphasised, a case of a future debt, rather than a present debt; but this does not affect the basis on which the Court of Appeal dealt with the case, namely, that equity acted by analogy.&#8221; </p>

In relation to the first he held that &#8220;in applying this to the writ ne exeat regno, what must be shown is that there exists the equitable equivalent of an action in which the plaintiff would previously have been liable to arrest at law&#8221;. He went on to point out that confinement of the writ to equitable debts and claims was always subject to two exceptions one of which was a claim for alimony, because before 1857 the matrimonial courts had no jurisdiction to exact security. I do not consider that the arrival of that power deprived the matrimonial court from issuing the writ, and on occasions it has done so: see for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Thaha v Thaha </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] 2 FLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] 2 FLR 142</ref> (although in the circumstances of that case the writ was incorrectly issued after judgment as an aid to enforcement). </p>

Pending the hearing of the action the plaintiffs applied to the High Court for a freezing injunction and a search order requiring (i) that the defendants disclose the whereabouts of documents relating to transactions worldwide in which the counterfeit insecticide had been supplied or offered for sale; (ii) that they swear an affidavit setting forth particulars of such transactions; and (iii) that they deliver up the relevant document to the claimants' solicitors. The claimants feared that the first defendant would evade the effect of such orders by leaving the jurisdiction. They accepted that the writ of ne exeat regno was not available as the defendant would not have been liable to arrest at law before 1869 and therefore sought further injunctive relief, namely (i) that the first defendant deliver up his passports and (ii) that he be restrained from leaving the jurisdiction until the search order had been executed. The judge granted the freezing and search orders but refused to grant the further relief. The claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the court had jurisdiction to grant the further relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supreme Court Act 1981</ref>, which provided that the court had jurisdiction to grant &#8216;an injunction &#8230; in all cases in which it appears &#8230; to be just and convenient to do so&#8217;.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a case with a lengthy history. It is only necessary for me to set out those facts which are needed to dispose of this application. H is now bankrupt, he says to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. W argues that he is lying on a massive scale and that he has secreted hundreds of millions of pounds and that his bankruptcy is fraudulent. Last year I conducted, but did not complete, an <span style="font-style:italic">OS v DS</span> hearing which certainly gave some interesting insights into H&#8217;s economic history. Unfortunately, while W was represented at that hearing her counsel did not have the material to hand to lead me to make any findings, even provisional findings, about the scale of H&#8217;s wealth, if any.  Late last year W secured funding for her case to be mounted properly. Earlier this month I vacated the dates then fixed for the completion of the <span style="font-style:italic">OS v DS</span> hearing as it was obvious that the professional enquiry that I judged that W needed to make would not be completed by then, and I allowed the final hearing to be re-fixed for November 2012.  It is W&#8217;s intention to send a fresh set of highly searching questions to H for information and documents. She argues that he needs to be here to answer them properly and that if he does not then she will seek to coerce replies by means of positive orders, if necessary enforced by committal proceedings. All this requires H to be here. Were he not to be here the prosecution of her claim would be materially prejudiced. </p>

He says that he has complied with all requests for information made of him. He says that he has attended all hearings hitherto and that if he had vast sums hidden abroad he would be able to afford representation for himself. He says that it is a breach of his human rights for his passport to be impounded by the Court.</p>

It is hardly an excuse for him to rely on his bankruptcy. I recall evidence at the <span style="font-style:italic">OS v DS</span> hearing to the effect that he continued to live at his Bayswater flat, Barrie House where the monthly rent of &#163;4,000 was paid for by his friend Justin Williams as were all the council tax and utility bills; that he carried around cash of &#163;3-400; and that he admitted to having received substantial cash gifts from &#8220;friends" citing amounts of &#163;10,000, &#163;7,000 and &#163;5,000. Moreover he positively asserted that in the early days of the separation his friends had paid &#163;1.2m for the maintenance of his wife and children.</p>

It is for him to show that he has fully complied with his disclosure obligations, not for W to show that he has not. A mantra that &#8220;I believe I have complied&#8221; does not amount to a clear demonstration of compliance. In any event Mr Fitzgerald has convincingly demonstrated that there remain many lacunae in the disclosure sought, largely admitted anyway by the correspondence of his then solicitors.</p>

Plainly, H is about to quit the jurisdiction. His asserted intention to travel to Africa to engage in charity work strikes me as highly implausible, and I consider that there must be some ulterior reason for his wish to leave the country. I am wholly satisfied that were H to depart W would be materially prejudiced in the prosecution of her claim for financial remedies.</p>

I believe that the period here is at the extremities of the court&#8217;s powers but I am satisfied that on the exceptional facts of this case it is justified, provided that it is accompanied by a liberty to H again to apply for a discharge.</p>
