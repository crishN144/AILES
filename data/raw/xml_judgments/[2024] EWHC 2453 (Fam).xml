	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The circumstances that bring this case to court are tragic. In June 2023, a young woman in her early 30&#8217;s, &#8216;N&#8217;, died from breast cancer. After receiving her diagnosis, but before she commenced chemotherapy, N arranged for 20 of her eggs to be harvested and frozen by a clinic registered under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 [&#8216;the clinic&#8217;]. The applicant before this court is the deceased&#8217;s mother, &#8216;G&#8217;. G seeks a declaration that it is lawful for the posthumous storage to continue and for the clinic to undertake fertility treatment using N&#8217;s gametes, donor sperm and surrogacy in the hope that this will result in the birth of a child, who would be brought up by G, their genetic maternal grandmother.</p>

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8220;HFEA&#8221;) and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (&#8220;the Secretary of State&#8221;) have each been given leave to intervene. The applicant G has been represented by counsel, Ms Deirdre Fottrell KC, Mr Andrew Powell and Mr Tom Wilson. The HFEA has been represented by Ms Claire Watson KC and the Secretary of State by Ms Jessica Boyd KC. I am extremely grateful to each counsel for their clear and insightful submissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has the benefit of a full witness statement from G, together with the clinic&#8217;s records and forms, and N&#8217;s medical records. No oral evidence was given, and the hearing was conducted on the basis that there was no challenge to G&#8217;s account. Much may turn on the few occasions that G reports that she and her daughter discussed these important matters. Everything that the court has read about G indicates that she is an upright individual who is respected in her community. There is no reason to doubt her recollection of these short conversations and I have approached the factual context within which this application falls to be determined on the basis that what she says is the truth and that her factual case can be taken at its highest.</p>

It is clear from the applicant&#8217;s evidence that N loved, and was loved by, the children with whom she worked. N was an active member in her local community having set up a charity in the hope of supporting young persons in the surrounding area. It was N&#8217;s wish to have a child and, on the applicant&#8217;s case, it was her last wish that a child should be born by surrogacy and brought up by G, following posthumous conception using her frozen eggs. </p>

Upon the advice of her treating team who advised that chemotherapy treatment would be likely to affect N&#8217;s fertility, she was referred to Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; Assisted Conception Unit [&#8216;the clinic&#8217;] on 1 December 2022. N was seen by Dr T, a specialty doctor in the clinic, on 7 December 2022 where she gave consent to egg collection, ovarian stimulation for egg freezing, cryopreservation of her eggs, disclosure of identifying information and egg storage. In his witness statement, Dr T honestly stated that he was not able to recall meeting with N but that it was standard protocol to review consent forms with patients. This would include, for example, when considering the HFEA Gametes Storage Form elucidating to patients the procedures and requirements that would need to be followed if the patient wanted their gametes to be used by a partner or another named individual in the event of death. Patients are specifically made aware that additional forms must be requested and signed to provide for such an eventuality. Dr T stated in his witness statement: &#8220;Moreover, I inform patients that further processes and tests may be necessitated to facilitate the utilisation of their gametes posthumously.&#8221; </p>

It was therefore legally permissible for N to have given written consent to the clinic, in a form and after a process that was compliant with the HFEA 1990, any regulations and guidance, for her frozen eggs to be used posthumously for the creation of an embryo and for that embryo to be implanted in a surrogate mother, just as her mother, G, now seeks to achieve. During submissions, this point was accepted without contention by both of the Intervenors.

In presenting their submissions on behalf of G, counsel acknowledged that the case raises factual and legal issues that have not previously been before the courts in England and Wales. The deceased had rights under ECHR, Art 8 (which it is accepted do not endure beyond her death). On the basis that G was engaged in a joint parenting project with N before her death, it is submitted that G thereby also had rights under Art 8 and that these continue to be engaged. The court is, therefore, being invited to read the HFEA legislation so as to give effect to G&#8217;s continuing Art 8 rights. To do so, Ms Fottrell submits that the court would have to accept that N&#8217;s consent did not have to be given in writing and/or that it is open to the court to conclude that it can read down an interpretation of the legislation which would permit it to be satisfied that the consent requirements are met, or that the court can dispense with written consent.</p>

Ms Fottrell, however, submitted that the evidence established that G and her daughter, N, were joined together in a parental project and that the facts were sufficient to put G in the position of N in asking for her eggs to be used to create a child. In that manner, Art 8 rights were engaged by the joint endeavour of N together with G. Ms Fottrell explained that she was using the phrase &#8216;parental project&#8217; because that was the phrase used by Gwynneth Knowles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Y v A NHS Healthcare Trust, The HFEA and Z</span> [2018] EWCOP 18, by Theis J in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings</span> and to some extent ECtHR in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Lanzmann v France (23038/19)</span>. It is, however, to be observed that, whilst the phrase &#8216;parental project&#8217; is used in some of the ECHR caselaw, and it may be a term in use more generally, it is not a phrase that appears in the judgments of Knowles or Theis JJ. I do, however, accept that in <span style="font-style:italic">Y </span>and in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings</span> the respective couples were engaged in a joint parenting endeavour and the label &#8216;parenting project&#8217; could properly have been applied.</p>

Firstly, <span style="font-style:italic">R(M) v HFEA </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 611. In that case eggs of a terminally ill woman had been harvested and were stored. After the woman&#8217;s death, her parents sought permission for the eggs to be taken abroad for an embryo to be created from donor sperm and for the deceased&#8217;s mother to act as the surrogate. A committee of the HFEA refused to grant permission. Ouseley J dismissed an application for judicial review of the HFEA decision. Ouseley J&#8217;s decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal [Sir James Munby P, Arden and Burnett LJJ] and the committee decision was set aside. Arden LJ (as she then was), in the lead judgment, identified consent as one of the &#8216;cornerstones&#8217; of the HFEA 1990. With reference to &#8216;effective consent&#8217;, as required by Sched 3, Arden LJ said [paragraph 21]:</p>

In proceedings before the Court of Protection, Knowles J directed that it was lawful for a relative to sign the consent forms necessary for his sperm to be collected, stored and used in the treatment of his wife. The couple had been actively engaged in the early stages of fertility treatment for at least 10 months prior to the husband&#8217;s tragic accident. There was ample evidence for Knowles J to hold that they had a long-held intention to achieve the conception and birth of a brother or sister for their existing child. As part of their treatment, they had been given a joint appointment with the obstetrician some 10 days after the day of the accident and they had expressly discussed the posthumous use of his sperm for the continued treatment of his wife should anything happen to him. It is to be noted that Knowles J&#8217;s primary decision was not made under either the HFEA 1990 or the HRA 1998 but was a decision about mental capacity and best interests within the scheme of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The relevance of the decision is therefore limited to providing an example, albeit in a different context, of the court carrying forward a joint course of action to achieve the birth of a child that had been embarked upon jointly by a married couple prior to the profound incapacity of one of the parties.</p>

Consent forms had been signed for the treatment to continue in the event of the death of Mr Jennings, but not the other way round if Ms Choya, his partner, were to die &#8211; which was, sadly, the circumstance that brought the case before the court. In particular there had been no consent given for an embryo created with his partner&#8217;s egg being used in a surrogate (as the plan had always been for Ms Choya to carry the pregnancy). Theis J was critical of a number of aspects of the HFEA scheme which failed to give an egg donor, in the position of Ms Choya, the opportunity to consider and consent to the posthumous use of any embryo created during the treatment in the event of her death.</p>

When he became seriously unwell, the couple were referred back to the clinic but, due to delay on the part of the clinic, he died before being seen by them.

The merits of this solution are not a matter for the House in its judicial capacity. It is, however, plain that while Parliament outlawed certain grotesque possibilities (such as placing a live animal embryo in a woman or a live human embryo in an animal), it otherwise opted for a strict regime of control.

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.&#8217;</p>

Respect for human dignity and free will, as well as a desire to ensure a fair balance between the parties to IVF treatment, underlay the legislature&#8217;s decision to enact provisions permitting of no exception to ensure that every person donating gametes for the purpose of IVF treatment would know in advance that no use could be made of his or her genetic material without his or her continuing consent. In addition to the principle at stake, the absolute nature of the rule served to promote legal certainty and to avoid the problems of arbitrariness and inconsistency inherent in weighing, on a case-by-case basis, what the Court of Appeal described as &#8216;entirely incommensurable&#8217; interests (see paras [25] and [26], above).

The applicant must therefore rely upon the HRA 1998 and the ECHR, but to do so Ms Boyd submitted that (a) it must be established that G&#8217;s rights under ECHR, Art 8 are engaged, that (b) the requirements of HFEA 1990, Sch 3 constitute a disproportionate interference with those rights and that (c) the provisions of Sch 3 can be read down so as to be dispensed with in order for G&#8217;s plan to proceed.

The court held that such rights under Art 8 that her son may have had with respect to the storage and use of his sperm died with him and were not transferable and the applicant could not claim to be a victim of a violation of Art 8 on behalf of her deceased son. Secondly, with respect to the applicant&#8217;s claim based on a breach of her own Art 8 rights, the judgment of the court was clear:</p>

This does not include the right to found a family and cannot include, in the state of its jurisprudence, the  right to descendants for grandparents. Consequently, this part of the complaint must be rejected as incompatible <span style="font-style:italic">ratione materiae</span> with the provisions of the Convention, in accordance with Article 35 &#167;&#167; 3(a) and 4 of the Convention.&#8217;</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Lanzmann,</span> evidence of the deceased&#8217;s dying wish and his long held desire to continue the family&#8217;s genetic line were plainly insufficient to afford Art 8 rights to the deceased&#8217;s mother. Although weight was put upon the existence of a parenting project in the course of G&#8217;s submissions, Ms Boyd observed that, save where a couple had been engaged in receiving fertility treatment together, there is no reported case where a court has recognised the establishment of Art 8 rights based upon a parenting project and the case law does not support that proposition. In any event, Ms Boyd submitted that the evidence of N&#8217;s short statements to her mother falls well short of establishing any joint parenting plan or project in this case; there was, for example, no discussion about who the genetic father would be, in circumstances where N was in a relationship with a male partner. Equally, there is no clarity within the reported statements of N about the role of G and whether she would be &#8216;grandmother&#8217; or &#8216;mother&#8217; to any child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moving on, Ms Boyd submitted that if, contrary to her primary case, the court held that G&#8217;s Art 8 rights were engaged, then the question of proportionality with respect to the impact of HFEA 1990, Sch 3 on those rights must be assessed on the basis that the 1990 Act is a general measure that applies to one and all in like manner, without consideration of individual circumstances. Whilst such general measures may result in individual hard cases, the proper approach is to consider the generality of the rule, rather than the individual consequences of its application. In this context, Ms Boyd relied upon the decision of the ECtHR Grand Chamber in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Animal Defenders International v UK (48876/08)</span> [judgment 22 April 2023]. At paragraph 106, the court recalled that it had previously held that &#8216;a State can, consistently with the Convention, adopt general measures which apply to pre-defined situations regardless of the individual facts of each case even if this might result in individual hard cases&#8217;, and at paragraph 107 an extensive list of previous occasions in which the use of general measures for a wide range of circumstances had been held to be consistent with the Convention.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8216;Where the interference is the result of an individual decision, the Court&#8217;s approach has been to examine the necessity and proportionality of the restriction in the particular circumstances of the case. Where, however, as here, the interference springs directly from a statutory provision which prohibits or restricts the exercise of the Convention right, the Court&#8217;s approach has tended to be different. In such a case, the Court&#8217;s focus is not on the circumstances of the individual applicant, although he must be affected by the legislation in order to claim to be a victim of its application; it is, instead, primarily on the question whether the legislature itself acted within its margin of appreciation and satisfied the requirements of necessity and proportionality when imposing the prohibition or restriction in question. There are, as the High Court and House of Lords pointed out, numerous examples in the Court&#8217;s case-law where the question of the necessity, proportionality and balance have been examined not in the context of the specific circumstances of the individual applicant but in the context of the legislation itself which was the source of the interference. Equally importantly, there are many cases where the Court has accepted the need for a &#8220;brightline&#8221; or general statutory rule and has found no violation of the Convention even though loyalty to the rule may involve apparent hardship to the applicant in the individual case. In such a case, the answer to the question of compatibility is not and cannot be determined by reference to the particular circumstances of the applicant caught by the statutory provision in question. As Lord Bingham put it, &#8220;the drawing of a line inevitably means that hard cases will arise falling on the wrong side of it, but that should not be held to invalidate the rule if, judged in the round, it is beneficial&#8221;, which I would in the context in which the word is used interpret to mean consistent with the Convention. Several examples of such cases are set out in paragraph 107 of the judgment. As is apparent from the short description in that paragraph, the cases dealt with a wide variety of different legislative measures, none of which concerned a prohibition of the present kind. However, this does not detract from the importance of the principle established in those cases, which is in my view directly applicable in the present case.&#8217;</p>

Where, as it is asserted is the case here, written consent on the above basis has not been given because of an unfair lack of opportunity to do so, then the court should nevertheless hold that the situation engages G&#8217;s Art 8 rights in the same way.</p>

There is a clear danger of conflating these two separate categories and reading across judicial decisions which have been taken outside the scheme as if they were taken as part of the statutory regime. The list of points drawn from the authorities by Ms Fottrell (set out at paragraph 38) demonstrates the danger of conflating, or failing to acknowledge, these two distinct routes to treatment. Insofar as, in previous reported cases, courts have taken the specific courses adumbrated in the five points in that list they have done so outside the HFEA 1990 scheme and have done so in the circumstances of a particular individual whose Art 8 rights have, on the facts of a specific case, been engaged to the extent that the court has used its power under the HRA 1998 to read down, or otherwise relax, the strict provisions in HFEA 1990, Sch 3. There is a danger in constructing such lists if it is suggested that they represent a general and accepted extension of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction for all cases, when they are no more than examples of specific approaches that a court has been prepared to take when evaluating and then, if justified, acting upon the need to avoid a breach of an individual&#8217;s rights under the ECHR in that case.</span></p>

Although the present claim is being made outside the scheme, it is nevertheless relevant, when assessing the quality of N&#8217;s recorded statements, that she was not exposed to any relevant information, or engaged in any conversation with professionals during which she discussed this issue. Ms Fottrell, who accepts that that is the case, argues that the fact that N was not offered any opportunity to consider these matters with professionals after December 2022 supports G&#8217;s case on the basis that N would have signed the necessary forms had she been given an opportunity to do so. I do not however accept that one can rely upon the absence of a process of delivery of information and counselling to reach a positive conclusion that, if N had had that opportunity, she would have consented or even that she would have said what she did say to her mother in May and June 2023. If the process of informing the person who may in due course consent is to have any value, then the potential for that individual not to consent after being given proper information must be contemplated.</span></p>

There is no reference in the note to N asking about her frozen eggs or the possibility of surrogacy.

Those medical notes have not been tested or clarified by any further evidence and it would be wrong to give them so much weight as to disregard G&#8217;s evidence of what N said on that date but, again, the notes certainly do not support a positive finding that N was in a position on that day to give informed and detailed consent to the posthumous use of her eggs.</span></p>

In the present case the evidence is of a wholly different order. N was not engaged in fertility treatment. There is no account of N discussing either the source of male gametes or how a surrogate might be chosen.

The manner proposed is for the creation of an embryo by the introduction of gametes from a known male donor (but not N&#8217;s partner) chosen from the local church community, with the embryo being carried by a surrogate chosen by G from that community, and for any child born thereby to be brought up by G through adoption, thereby making G, in law, the child&#8217;s mother.</span></p>

The statement that &#8216;we will need a surrogate&#8217;, rather than being the conclusion of a process of decision making is in reality only the start. Thereafter, further choices have to be made; how will a surrogate be chosen, will they be anonymous, disconnected with the family, or known; how will male gametes be obtained, will that be from her partner, or other donor, known or unknown; and who will bring up any child and on what legal basis?</span></p>

But, if, contrary to my finding, the evidence did establish that N&#8217;s wishes were as G asserts, then it does not follow that N would have gone on to sign the necessary HFEA forms. It is important to consider the potential impact of N being given the proper information by professionals, and to have the opportunity for counselling, before deciding whether to consent. During that process, N may have contemplated other options, for example gametes from an anonymous donor or from her partner, or a surrogate who was not part of the local community. The cornerstone of the statutory scheme is &#8216;informed&#8217; consent. Thus, even if in discussion with her mother N had been contemplating the detailed plan that is now put before the court, it cannot be a given that, after discussion with professionals and consideration of each of the available options, she would have held to that plan.</span></p>
