It is thought by her treating psychiatrist that she probably has paranoid schizophrenia. On its own that would be a challenge for any individual but, in addition, she has type II Diabetes Mellitus, which has become increasingly difficult to control during the course of her pregnancy. Her psychosis leads her to eat irregularly and inappropriately. Inevitably she has hugely varying blood glucose and electrolyte levels  When assessing capacity this ongoing metabolic instability must be factored into a wider range of evidence.</span></p>

I found Miss Tuck&#8217;s evidence to be of the highest calibre. Her evidence was reflective, entirely free from dogmatism.  It was charactised by a real willingness to engage in questioning and open-minded analysis. Miss Tuck also has the inestimable advantage of having a professional relationship with this patient.</span></p>

Miss Tuck stated that the pregnancy was jeopardizing the optimal care of AB&#8217;s serious psychotic illness, which was proving increasingly dangerous to her life.

Looking back at her medical history it is easy to see that she had not been able to address this issue until relatively late in pregnancy. To Miss Tuck&#8217;s surprise and relief AB expressed the wish to have a Caesarean Section. She took the view that she simply would not be able to tolerate the pain of labour and that was the core premise of her reasoning.</span></p>

I must also consider the wider picture, for a protected party&#8217;s best interests are very rarely or never grounded exclusively in the medical context. The assessment of best interests involves to some degree having an understanding of the individual, so far as one can. I have heard that AB, when her condition is not florid, is a lively, personable and very intelligent young woman. Historically in Sri Lanka her mental illness was effectively medicated, and she obtained an arts degree at university. When mentally stable she has an insightful and intelligent understanding of her own Diabetes Mellitus condition. In that context I must consider the possibility of a Caesarean Section. This enables me with some comfort to draw the conclusion that if she was rationally able to put herself in this position AB would want an elective Caesarean Section. </span></p>

That was the view of Miss Tuck, who knows her well, but the Trust wisely sought the opinion of a consultant psychiatrist, a Dr. Katz in order to help determine her capacity. Unfortunately somewhere along the line, the line of communication had broken down, and although Dr. Katz had gone to great pains to assess AB&#8217;s capacity to engage with her diabetes medication, he had not assessed her capacity to consent to a Caesarean Section. AB&#8217;s own consultant psychiatrist was unfortunately not available and I believe is out of this jurisdiction. </span></p>

Dr. Katz speculated that she might have been concealing her true motive &#8211; a covert, more subtle suicide attempt. There is no doubt that on an intellectual level she is quite capable of understanding what depriving herself of food and water will do. It is now 24 hours since she had anything to eat or drink and by this morning she was showing the consequences &#8211; in her levels of glucose, electrolytes, Sodium, Potassium, and Bicarbonate: the essential nutrients to the brain. When those nutrients reach a low level the brain is no longer being sufficiently nourished, resulting in disturbed consciousness and irrationality. It is only a matter of hours before AB&#8217;s brain would become insufficiently nourished, and she could die.  It is only by looking at this wider medical context that one can balance the decision about Caesarean Section.</span></p>

It is a course of action that the doctors do not embark on lightly.  The lawyers also take it very seriously indeed. The combination of the evidence of Dr Katz and Miss Tuck went some way to reassure me that AB lacked capacity to consent to a Caesarean Section but because the action is so draconian, and in the absence of a specific psychiatric assessment of this particular issue, it did not seem to me that I would be compliant with the statutory framework to proceed without  further evidence. </span></p>
