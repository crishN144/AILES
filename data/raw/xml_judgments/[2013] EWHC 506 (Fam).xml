However, to have to record that this litigation has cost a total of &#163;2.7 million is, to put it mildly, a stark reflection of the extent to which this case has been contested.  It is clear to me that this case has not been litigated in a manner which complies with the obligations imposed on parties pursuant to the overriding objective.  I regret to say that I also found the approach taken by both parties during the course of the hearing to be unhelpful.  Points have been pursued in a confused and confusing manner.  Each side seemed to be focused largely on forensic point scoring and both put forward offers that, in my view, paid little regard to the resources which are in fact currently available.  </p>

Also, like him, I do not propose to deal in this judgment with all the points canvassed before me but I have taken into account all the evidence and all the submissions when determining this application.  Given that many of the figures have been given in pounds and/or dollars I propose to use both during the course of the judgment.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.1in">Shares in a private company, called Confluence Technologies Inc (&#8220;Confluence&#8221;) which are estimated to have a net worth of &#163;32 million (on a very broad indicative valuation).  They are currently illiquid, in that they cannot be sold.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">The shares are in a company founded in the early years of the marriage.  The husband has always worked for the company and continues to do so.  The husband and wife currently own 34.7%.  The value of these shares is uncertain.  They have been the subject only of a preliminary valuation which gave a gross value of between $65 to $83 million.  This is no more than a very broad indication of their possible value.  Further, there is no firm date by which the value of the shares will be realised.  This is one of the issues which I will have to address in this judgment.  However, given the uncertainties the parties agree that the shares should be divided between the parties in kind.  The issue is the percentage which the wife should receive.</p>

The difference is largely accounted for by differences in tax, the wife contending that significant amounts will be payable on the realisation of certain investments and for the tax years 2011 and 2012.  The main issue appears to be the extent to which losses can be carried forward to reduce the tax which would otherwise be payable.  Given the costs incurred and the duration of these proceedings (approximately 2 years), it is extraordinary that this issue has not been resolved or even properly addressed during the hearing.  Following the conclusion of the hearing, I was provided with additional evidence on behalf of the husband in an attempt to address this point.  I have had a brief look at this new evidence but it is, in reality, far too late.</p>

This is the longer term outcome because she seeks an unequal division of the capital resources currently available to enable her to meet, principally, her housing need pending realisation of the Confluence shares.  At the start of the hearing it was submitted that the wife should receive &#163;6.1 million of these resources and the husband &#163;3.5 million.  At the conclusion of the hearing this had become respectively &#163;5.4 million and &#163;3.4 million (although these figures ignore the wife&#8217;s case that tax of approximately &#163;815,000 is or may be due as set out below).  In addition the wife seeks periodical payments at the total rate of &#163;30,000 per month for herself and one child until realisation of the Confluence shares.</p>

The proposed division is 2/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> to the husband and 1/3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> to the wife.  The husband additionally proposes that the non-business assets should be divided equally giving each party just under &#163;5 million (including chattels).  In order to provide the wife with greater current liquidity and with the ambition of achieving a clean break, in his closing submissions Mr Pointer indicated that the husband is willing to &#8220;countenance a solution&#8221; which provides more of the liquid wealth for the wife.</p>

When they married they had no money.  Indeed, it appears that the husband had substantial debts.  The parties worked in employment until 1991 when the husband set up Confluence.  Not long after, the wife embarked on qualifying as a lawyer and she received government loans which were used to support the family until the business began to generate sufficient income to pay the husband a salary.</p>

This resulted in part from Confluence&#8217;s decision to seek to expand its European business.  The husband obtained a three year residence visa for himself and the family.  The parties initially lived in rented accommodation before buying their last matrimonial home in April 2010 for just over &#163;10 million with a mortgage of approximately &#163;7.4 million.  For the period April to December 2010 Confluence contributed approximately &#163;9,500 per month gross towards the mortgage instalments totalling &#163;30,600 per month (of which approximately &#163;18,500 is interest).</p>

She took the children.  She discovered that the husband was there with his present wife.  It is not difficult to question the wisdom of this, unannounced, trip, although it is right to recognise that it took place whilst the marriage was unravelling.  The wife asserts that the husband repeatedly threatened to have her UK visa cancelled and to cancel her access to their joint credit cards.  She also says that he made other threats.  At the beginning of October her use of two cards was cancelled and she says that, for a period, she was unable to access the parties&#8217; PNC (bank) accounts because the password had been changed.  The wife also became aware that the husband had given or was proposing to give a ring, which she says was her replacement engagement ring, to his present wife as their engagement ring.</p>

This was fixed at a level lower than that fixed for the wife because of a number of points &#8211; namely, that the husband has very significant business expenses which, to some extent, reduce his own income needs; that the cost of living in San Francisco is less than in London; and that the husband&#8217;s partner had a significant income.  As is clear from his judgment, Mostyn J assessed the husband&#8217;s interim needs because the parties&#8217; respective interim needs were going to have to be met from capital.  The family&#8217;s income of approximately $100,000 per month broadly equalled a number of fixed expenses, principally in respect of their properties.  The Order specifically records that the provision made for the parties was intended to cover the entirety of their interim personal needs (save in respect of legal costs). </p>

This provision will only impact on the value realised by the other stockholders if the eventual sale price obtained for the company would result in Polaris receiving less than this guaranteed amount on a pro rata apportionment.  Currently the total which Polaris would be entitled to receive under this provision has been calculated by Mr Howard at just under $90 million.

In his Affidavit of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2011, the husband says that this arose because of the company&#8217;s failure to meet banking covenants.  This led to the company needing to re-finance its bank debt.  This was done by the husband and the wife lending the company a total of $6 million, $2.5 million in December 2008 and $3.5 million in July 2009.  There is an issue between the parties as to whose idea this was.  In my view, the origin of the idea is of little importance.  The significant fact is that the parties decided to support the company by lending a very significant amount of their own capital.  It was at a good rate of interest, for the parties and probably also for the company, and it helped the company at a critical time.</p>

It is to state the obvious that a great deal has happened in the financial services and banking industry since 2006.  However, it is clear from the husband&#8217;s evidence that the intention or goal remains to sell the company in the next few years.  During the course of his oral evidence he said he hopes the sale will take place in the next 30 months.  He also said that this depends on external factors, in particular the state of the banking industry.  In addition, the husband said that effecting a sale involves a &#8220;tremendous&#8221; amount of work.

Accordingly, any current valuation would be no more than theoretical.  Secondly, as referred to above, the parties expect the value of the shares to be established by a sale or otherwise within the near future, by which I mean within about 3 years.  The parties, therefore, agree that the method by which the value of the shares should be divided between them is by giving each a defined percentage of their total shareholding of 34.7% (and of the warrants).</p>

Given that Polaris&#8217; investment is in a 10 year fund from 2006, it seems unlikely that any realisation will be significantly longer than that, unless events compel further delay.  There is also no assurance as to what sum will be realised.  As the husband says in his evidence, Polaris could decide simply to recover its investment in which event the common shareholders would receive nothing.  Again, this appears unlikely, but it would also be trite to say that a great deal can happen even in three years.  There are, therefore, uncertainties as to when the value of Confluence will be realised and the amount which will be received by the parties.</p>

Notwithstanding this clear statement, made in response to a specific question following receipt of the valuations, Mr Pointer has submitted that &#8220;it can safely be concluded that the properties could be sold within another year&#8221;. This is, in part, based on a submission that the expert&#8217;s evidence &#8220;indicates that a marketing period of 18 months <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> March 2012 <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be required&#8221; (my emphasis).  In my view this submission is contrary to the only expert evidence on this issue.  First, the expert&#8217;s evidence is <span style="font-style:italic">would</span>, not <span style="font-style:italic">may</span>: to quote more fully, &#8220;a marketing period of between eighteen months and two years <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> be required&#8221; (my emphasis).  Secondly, although I suppose the period could be interpreted as being from the date of the expert&#8217;s letter, this is not expressly stated and in my view is not implicit from the evidence.  This might not seem a major point in the case but it provides an example of what I regard as being the unhelpful manner in which this case has been litigated.  Mr Pointer also seeks to rely on the &#8220;tenor&#8221; of the substantive valuations and that they provided the &#8220;current&#8221; market value.

This subject was not addressed at any length during the course of the hearing.  As for the cars, I consider it fair if the wife retains the car in London and the husband retains the other cars.  The wife should retain her jewellery and furs and the husband retain his watches, pens and jewellery.  As for the other items, namely the contents from the parties&#8217; former home in Pittsburgh, the London property and the San Francisco property, it is clearly appropriate (as appears to be proposed) that the husband retains what I will call the household chattels in California and the wife retains those in London.  It is not clear to me whether the disputed items remaining are confined to those listed in the valuations included in the bundles for this hearing or extend beyond these.  If necessary, I will have to resolve that issue.  However, I provisionally propose that the disputed items (wine, antiques, art, piano) should be divided equally by value between the parties leaving out of this account the other chattels divided as set out above.  I have excluded the other chattels from this exercise because I do not consider it necessary in order to effect a fair division for the value of these other items to be included.  In my judgment it is fair to divide them by reference to the nature of the asset such that, for example, the wife retains her jewellery and the husband retains his.  In value terms this results in an imbalance between the parties, but this is insignificant in the context of the case as a whole.</p>

I say, approximately, because the parties have not been able to agree what his net basic salary is: the wife says it is $423,000 whilst the husband says it is $410,000.  In the context of this case, this is not a significant difference but it would have been helpful if this had been agreed.  In addition the husband receives a number of benefits in kind, namely rent and a contribution towards utilities totalling $120,000 per year and a car.  It is said that tax will be payable on these benefits.  The husband is also entitled to a discretionary bonus.  For 2011 he received $130,000 gross and for 2010 $155,000.  No bonus was paid for the previous three years.  The husband says that he may get a bonus for 2012 but it will probably be less than last year.</p>

The company had previously been making a contribution to the cost of the family home in London.  In cross-examination, the husband was shown the Confluence document dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2011 setting out the terms and conditions of his posting to San Francisco.  The posting is for an initial term of up to 3 years, from 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2011, but may be extended by mutual agreement.  It also provides that &#8220;During your posting&#8221; the company will pay a housing stipend of $8,500 per month and a utilities stipend of $1,500 per month.  In response the husband said that he thought there was another document which superseded this and which contained a termination date.  No such document was produced during the hearing.  I will determine this case on the basis that the husband will continue to receive the current payments from Confluence until at least January 2014 and probably beyond.</p>

This states that the wife &#8220;will be more comfortable&#8221; if she has air conditioning which would have a &#8220;disease modifying effect&#8221;.

I also note that in his Affidavit of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2011 the husband acknowledges that, whilst an immediate sale of the property would &#8220;solve a lot of problems&#8221; given the expense of maintaining it, it &#8220;would cause difficulties&#8221;. </p>

Both parties were spending at a prodigious rate (including on the costs of these proceedings) and, on the evidence, it is not possible to carry out a proper comparison fully to determine whether the husband&#8217;s expenditure was wanton.  I appreciate that certain elements of his expenditure appear startling in their extravagance but this alone is not sufficient.  At its highest, I would accept that the husband&#8217;s expenditure on buying gifts for Dr Bramlette ($227,000) and on private jet flights ($198,000) would constitute extravagant expenditure of joint funds.  It may also be that part of the husband&#8217;s expenditure in the period April 2011 to February 2012 would qualify as wanton.</p>

Is it required in order to achieve an outcome which is fair?  Given that the assets in this case, to which I would be making a notional reattribution, are estimated, including the Confluence shares, in the region of &#163;40 million, I do not consider that the reattribution of approximately $425,000, or even, say, $700,000, is justified.  It is no more than about 1/2% of the total wealth which, if reattributed, would give the wife an extra 0.5/1%.  This degree of adjustment, in this case, is not necessary in order for a fair result to be achieved.  Even if I had concluded that a greater level of extravagance had been established, I would have been likely to come to the same conclusion.</p>

The company is not static.  As referred to above, I am satisfied that maintaining and developing the company and procuring its sale will continue to require a great deal of important work.  I am, accordingly, satisfied that the value in due course realised on the sale of Confluence will reflect, in part, the husband&#8217;s post-separation endeavours.

The extent to which the husband&#8217;s post-separation endeavour in respect of Confluence justifies a departure from equality depends in part on the duration of the period between the end of the marriage and the sale of Confluence.  On the evidence, it appears to me likely that Confluence will be realised, roughly, in two to three years&#8217; time.  On this basis, the period between creation and sale will be approximately 25 years, of which approximately five will be after the end of the marriage. However, I consider it would be too simplistic in this case to apply a purely arithmetical approach to this one factor when determining the outcome which is fair.  That requires an assessment of the weight properly to be given to all the circumstances of the case including that part of the wealth which is, to an unquantified extent, not marital property.</span></p>

I appreciate that this will not enable the husband to pay his debts until then but he will then have &#163;430/440,000.  I also appreciate this means that the wife will be unable immediately to purchase a property at what would otherwise be a reasonable level, but I do not consider it fair to give the wife all the liquid assets.

Although the valuation of the shares is indicative only, it is sufficient for the purposes of determining the distribution of the parties&#8217; capital resources.

The share which the wife receives of the available resources is to enable her to purchase a property.  Even if she decides not to purchase a property, the capital will, at best, only produce sufficient gross income to pay rent.  I do not consider it reasonable to require her to use her capital (save as an income resource) to meet her income needs pending the sale of Confluence.

The effect of the deduction of both parties&#8217; respective costs before division is costs neutral.  They will, in theory, each have paid half of the other&#8217;s costs.  This is on the assumption that there is no issue as to the level of one party&#8217;s costs as against the other&#8217;s, which there is not in this case.  Accordingly, the orders for costs will have the intended effect if they are implemented after the assets have been shared between the parties.  The wife&#8217;s assets will increase by the agreed or assessed amount and the husband&#8217;s will decrease by that amount.  If full recovery were not procured, the wife would in effect be paying part of the husband&#8217;s costs in respect of the events which led to him being ordered to pay her costs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">The next issue which has been raised relates to the number of warrants which the husband owns.  Throughout the hearing the husband adduced evidence that he owns 244,474 warrants (as referred to above).  Following the dissemination of my draft judgment, the husband said that this figure was wrong and he only owns 120,562 warrants.  I gave the husband permission to adduce evidence on this issue because it was said the earlier evidence was mistaken.  It seemed to me that he should have the opportunity to seek to demonstrate whether the earlier evidence was mistaken.  In my view it is self-evident that orders made under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> should be based on the true facts.  It will, of course, be rare for parties to be permitted to seek to re-open points but where it is asserted that a simple mistake has been made as to, for example, the number of shares or warrants it is clear to me that, in justice, a party should be permitted to seek to make good the point.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">It is certainly arguable that between 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 and 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2012 (the date of Wall P&#8217;s judgment) the husband had made open offers.  But after that date they ceased to be open offers (because they referred to inadmissible matters) and, in any event, they were withdrawn on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012.  However, even if they are open offers, I do not consider that this brief period has had any significant impact on the progress of the proceedings.  The first substantive hearing before me was on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2012.  Thereafter, both parties elected to continue the proceedings in the same manner as previously.  They continued to litigate in a manner which failed to comply with their obligations pursuant to the overriding objective, namely by failing to litigate proportionately and in a way which sought to save expense.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">I accept that the President&#8217;s Order expressly provides for the draft judgment to be considered.  I also accept that it was clear that a comparison would be made between my judgment and the draft judgment.  However, Mr Bishop is right additionally to point to the fact that the level of costs incurred in this case has now been said to be unacceptable and disproportionate by three judges.  This was a clear message which <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parties needed to heed.  The extent to which they heeded it is in my view determined by the way in which they have each acted in the proceedings.  They have acted, as described above, by failing to make substantive open offers and choosing to re-litigate the same issues.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">The court must have regard to all relevant matters when deciding whether to make an order for costs including the specific matters referred to in rule 28.3(7).  In the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the parties are both sufficiently responsible for the continuation of the proceedings to a re-hearing that the only fair substantive order is no order as to costs.  Both failed to abide by their obligations under the overriding objective.  They both pursued and contested issues which should not have been pursued or contested and both made open offers to settle which are significantly different from the terms of my judgment.  I agree with Mr Howard&#8217;s submission that the wife&#8217;s offer is closer than the husband&#8217;s but it was still some distance away.  I do not agree with him that neither party can say that the other is to blame.  In my judgment, they are both to blame and there is no sufficient discriminating feature to justify one paying the other&#8217;s costs (save in respect of the issues below).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in">I now turn to deal with the subsidiary points raised in respect of costs.  The evidence obtained by the wife from PWC was sufficiently relevant and material to justify the full amount being included within the costs deducted before division.  As half has already been included in the wife&#8217;s costs, the other half must be included in the husband&#8217;s costs.  Given the amount (&#163;16,000) and given the effect of the distribution of the assets as determined above, there is, in my judgment, no need to alter the effect of my judgment in the light of this modest adjustment.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.49in"> The final point I propose to determine is whether the husband should pay the costs incurred in dealing with the applications made in respect of the costs of the proceedings since May/July 2012.  The wife made an open offer on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2013, effectively, that there should be no order as to costs.  I say &#8220;effectively&#8221; because it was not couched in those terms but in my view that was its clear effect.  Further, there was no substantive response before the hearing before me on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2013 when the husband made plain that he was seeking his costs.</p>

As referred to above, in my judgment it should have been plain that there is no sufficient discriminating feature to justify one paying the other&#8217;s costs.</p>
