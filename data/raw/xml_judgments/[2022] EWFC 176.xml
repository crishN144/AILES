It is accepted that the former matrimonial home should be transferred into the sole name of the Wife and that the mortgage and sums charged against it should be paid. What is left is the accrued arrears on the Husband&#8217;s pension, which are now substantial, and the pension itself together with other pensions on either side.  It is also agreed that the Police pension should be taken after the maximum lump sum commutation, so I do not need to consider the alternative of taking the pension without deduction.</span></p>

The technology worked well, but until the hearing itself it had been difficult to exchange documents. In the Directions hearing in August, I had hoped that it would be possible for each party to draw down &#163;20,000 for costs so that the Husband could be represented. It appears that because the pension had to be in payment before any sums could be released this was not possible. I can see that this was difficult and frustrating for the Husband who thought that the wife&#8217;s solicitors were being difficult. He wrote a number of letters to the court complaining about the inequality of arms ad seeking an adjournment. Not all of these were seen by me before the hearing. I ruled that the hearing should go ahead. While I understood why the Husband wished for representation, this was not possible, and I was not prepared to adjourn the hearing yet again. I explained the role of the judge to ensure that a litigant in person had a fair hearing, and I have endeavoured to do so. Amongst other things, I put a series of questions to the Wife at his request, as I did not consider that he should be allowed to cross examine her himself. She sat in court throughout, out of screen from the Husband. He is an intelligent man, with experience in the police, but that is not the same as running a matrimonial case. In fairness, he was keen to co-operate and polite, though Ms Spence suggested that this was a cover for his continuing behaviour. He accepted when I suggested that some of his points were not relevant to the issues before me.</span></p>

Apart from the convictions, however, there were points in his evidence where I thought his behaviour was questionable. He reported the Wife to the police in respect of a legacy to the animal welfare charity she worked with. It was investigated and no action was taken. He asked her about this, and she said that the legacy was dealt with by her mother. His conduct seemed to be an attempt to obtain revenge. He also had to accept that he was spending money on legal advice and appeals while the Wife was unable to pay the mortgage on the matrimonial home; it struck me as difficult to then seek a share of her inheritance, which was in any event received after separation and clearly not a matrimonial asset. At other times he expressed his continuing love and affection and did concede the argument about the home.</span></p>

The children are all adult, though the youngest boy is still living with his mother. The Wife&#8217;s income is limited to her pensions and is not likely to increase save when she reaches pension age. Her only assets are her home and a car. She needs a secure home and an income. The Husband has accepted that the present house is suitable for her needs; in another case I might have considered whether she could trade down, but I do not do so in this case. The parties had a comfortable standard of living before the breakdown of the marriage. She is 61, he is 59.  It is a long marriage of over 35 years. Her MS, will be a continuing issue for her. She mentions lack of feeling in her hands and feet, vision impairment, lack of sleep and pain in her limbs. The Husband accepts that she has the condition, but says there is no evidence that his offences made it worse, and says she has not produced all the medical evidence. There are a number of medical reports in the Bundle. This is a progressive disease, and I did not think she was trying to exaggerate the effects. The Husband does not seek to rely on any suggestion of PSTD from his career. Both parties contributed in a conventional way, the Husband by his work, the Wife by running the home and working when she was able. In addition, the Wife received an inheritance of nearly &#163;100,000 and compensation of &#163;11,000, which cannot be considered to be matrimonial property. The conduct of the Husband, shown by his convictions, is clearly such that it would be inequitable to disregard it. The distribution of the pensions is clearly of great importance, and the Wife will lose her prospective benefits.</span></p>

I make it clear that there is no way that I consider that the facts of this case are less serious, because the charge was not attempted murder. The Husband was sentenced to 9 years in prison, which speaks for itself. The effect on the Wife&#8217;s life has been dramatic and comprehensive, and her stoicism does not reduce this. For example, her counselling has been suspended for financial reasons; I would wish her to be able to access such counselling as she may wish. I must look at the effect on the Wife and also her needs as a result of her age, medical condition and finances. </span></p>

She says that the deduction would have been 65%, and that part of the pension should not enter into the calculation, as he should not profit from his own wrong-doing. I can understand the logic of this, but I question whether the principle should be applied specifically to the pension share, as opposed to the total package, as the Wife will be receiving the whole house free of mortgage or charge. In practice, I consider that this point resolves itself when considering the figures.</span></p>

In addition, she will need &#163;65,502.47 to pay off the mortgage and charge; this will certainly increase before this can happen, and I will round this up to &#163;67,000. This reduces the capital for distribution from &#163;212,873 to &#163;145,873. I note that the Wife has spent a large part of her inheritance and compensation on meeting these costs. She has paid off &#163;20,047.03 of capital, not including interest payments, and &#163;20,725.17 paying arrears and council tax arrears and this has come from the non-matrimonial contribution of the inheritance received after the separation. This is at least &#163;40,772.20 that she should have reimbursed, and she has had to pay for the Mathieson Consulting Report in full (&#163;2,820, which should be a joint expense so &#163;1,410). I shall round this up to &#163;42,000, which should also be returned to her before I divide the balance, leaving &#163;103,873.

There have been some increases, including Council Tax, gym membership which will help with her condition, holiday costs, and provision for counselling.

I recognise the public policy argument, but I do not consider that I am bound to apply it rigidly, particularly given my decisions as to the capital.

The calculation is that for every 10% of pension share of CTV the Wife receives &#163;2,367 and the Husband loses &#163;2,114. The residual CTV after lump sums is &#163;466, 529, which would produce an income of &#163;21,140. If the wife receives 65% she will receive &#163;15,385 before tax. The Husband will receive &#163;7,399. With her existing income the Wife will have &#163;20,796 before tax in addition to PIP which is not taxable, which at 20% tax would leave her with &#163;17,486 in addition to her PIP of &#163;3,310. While not guaranteed, I consider that this is likely to continue, and she has a capital cushion if it does not.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">For purposes of comparison, I calculate that the Wife will retain about 85% of the capital, which includes the inheritance which was non matrimonial. The pensions divide about 66% to the Wife and 34% to the Husband (&#163;406,620 to &#163;206,611). This is a significant disparity, which is well justified by the Wife&#8217;s needs and the impact of the Husband&#8217;s conduct.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The issue of costs has to be determined after my findings, but has been the subject of preliminary submission by Ms Spence. I do not think that I should treat the delays as a result of the pension forfeiture as litigation conduct by the Husband. Indeed, he complains about the delays himself. I do not think that he has really been trying to delay the hearing. It was reasonable for him to want to be represented, and I can understand his frustration with the fact that this was not possible. Insofar as he has delayed or not provided information about his debts, I have taken this into account in my Judgment, and the fact that he was not represented has in fact reduced the total costs. I did not feel that his conduct in the hearing was reprehensible, and while he did not comply with the court direction to file a Statement this has not increased the costs. </span></p>

There will need to be separate orders for the arrears, the pension lump sums and the pension sharing order and annex. This Judgment remains in draft until it has been shown to the Pension Trustees, to check that it is capable of being implemented and my intentions can be put into effect. I do not believe that it is necessary for the division of the capital sums to be expressed as a percentage.</span></p>

These will include a direction for the husband to commute the maximum sum on his pension, the signing of necessary paperwork give the difficulty of the Husband being in prison, permission to apply for Decree absolute out of time and a clean break on capital and income.</span></p>
