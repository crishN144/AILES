Since the intervention of Turkish troops in 1974, the island of Cyprus has been effectively partitioned into a Greek Cypriot southern area and a Turkish Cypriot northern area. The Republic of Cyprus is recognised as a State in international law by the international community and although, <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span>, it represents Cyprus as a whole, <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> it controls only the southern area of the island.  In the northern area, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (hereafter &#8220;Northern Cyprus&#8221;), recognised only by Turkey, is in control.  K is currently in a children&#8217;s home in Northern Cyprus. D resides currently in a children&#8217;s home in the Republic of Cyprus.  Prior to the events which triggered these proceedings, both children had resided in Northern Cyprus since April 2012 and the local authority contends that both children are habitually resident in Northern Cyprus.</p>

She is currently in custody in the Republic of Cyprus, having been arrested pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant with respect to charges of child abduction.  She is due to be returned to the United Kingdom in police custody on 23 January 2017, the Cypriot Supreme Court having denied her appeal against extradition.    The children&#8217;s father is RT.  He has had no contact with the children for approximately 9 years.  There is evidence before the court that the mother has caused the children to become estranged from their father.  He is not seeking that the children be placed in his care at this time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority has a long history of involvement with the family, dating back to 2004.  The children were each subject to child protection plans between September 2007 and April 2008 under the category of neglect.  The concerns centred on the mother&#8217;s mental health.   Between 2011 and 2012 there were protracted proceedings in relation to the contact and residence arrangements for the children.  Within this context, the evidence currently before the court suggests that the mother had a long history of breaching non-molestation orders and probation orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In April 2012 the mother took the children to Northern Cyprus.  At the time the mother took the children to Northern Cyprus the children were the subject of child protection plans by reason of concerns regarding the mother&#8217;s mental health, her alleged emotional abuse of the children and her lack of compliance with court orders.  The mother contended that the trip to Cyprus was a temporary holiday.  The local authority contends that the mother&#8217;s departure to Northern Cyprus was part of an extreme effort to avoid the involvement of professionals with the family by taking the children to an area outside the province of the 1980 Hague Convention and the Brussels IIa regulation (hereafter BIIa). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear that, in any event, the mother failed to return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales and the children remained in the care of their mother in Northern Cyprus from 2012.  Between 2014 and 2016 concerns regarding the mother&#8217;s care of the children in Northern Cyprus were raised, including alleged physical abuse of the children by their mother and the expulsion of K from school. In August 2016 an assessment completed by authorities in Northern Cyprus found that the family home was dirty, with no flushing toilet and cat excrement covering the floor.  As I have already outlined, the mother was arrested pursuant to the European Arrest Warrant on 12 November 2016 whilst in the Republic of Cyprus.  The children were with her at the time of her arrest</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the mother&#8217;s arrest, initially both K and D were placed in children&#8217;s homes in the Republic of Cyprus.  However, K thereafter absconded from his children&#8217;s home in the Republic of Cyprus on 23 November 2016, allegedly on the instruction of his mother, and travelled back to Northern Cyprus where he was located on 24 November 2016.  K stayed temporarily with a friend of the mother in Northern Cyprus before being placed in a children&#8217;s home in Northern Cyprus when the placement with the family friend broke down on 9 December 2016.  It is understood that the children&#8217;s home in which he resides currently is not appropriate for K&#8217; age.  The children are thus separated from their mother and each other.  Further, there is no person in Cyprus who has parental responsibility for the children and no person currently able or willing to exercise parental responsibility for the children in either Cyprus or in England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the relevant authorities in Northern Cyprus and the relevant authorities in the Republic of Cyprus have now indicated in writing to the local authority that they will not be issuing proceedings in respect of the children and wish to facilitate their return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales following the arrest and extradition of the mother.  In this regard, the court has before it an email from the authorities in Northern Cyprus dated 18 January 2017 stating that they cannot provide K with long term care in circumstances where he is not a citizen in their jurisdiction and that the authorities wish to cooperate in effecting his return to this jurisdiction.  The email makes clear that the mechanism for returning K to England is likely to be one that first involves handing K over to the British High Commission in Nicosia, which handover will, in turn, require the authority of a return order from the High Court. The Court also has before it an email from the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance in the Republic of Cyprus dated 19 January 2017.   That email again makes clear that the competent authorities in the Republic of Cyprus have no intention of issuing legal proceedings in respect of D and consider that she should be returned to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In light of their respective ages, much work has been done to secure the wishes and feelings of K and D regarding a return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  On 18 November 2016 the British Vice Consul visited the children.  Both children asked about going to Northern Cyprus.  After being told that this was not possible and having been allowed to talk to each other alone, D said they would rather to go to family in England, although K later questioned this. Both K and D confirmed that their mother had been telephoning them from prison and the Vice Consul reported &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">grave concerns</span>&#8221; that the mother was manipulating the children and encouraging them to abscond to Northern Cyprus, as K subsequently did 5 days later on 23 November 2016.  </p>

D stated that she would prefer to be in Northern Cyprus but that if her mother was extradited then she would return to England and was accepting of the local authority plan to place her in foster care.  The social worker spoke again with D on 17 January 2017.  At this point, whilst still expressing a preference for being in Northern Cyprus she said that she was resigned to the fact that her only option was to return to England.  </p>

K stated that if his mother remained in Cyprus he would wish to remain there but, if she were extradited, he could see no other option than to return to England. The social worker spoke to K again on 18 January 2017.  On this occasion it was very difficult to separate K&#8217; views from those of his mother as he was awaiting a phone call from his mother &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to tell him what was next</span>&#8221; for him. When encouraged to think independently K said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I think I have to go back</span> [to England] <span style="font-style:italic">as well</span>&#8221;.</p>

The maternal grandfather has indicated that he is not in a position to care for the children and the children&#8217;s father accepts that he is not.  The mother is not presently in a position to make an application for an order for the return of the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales if she sought to.

The mother is accordingly in breach of her suspended sentence and a warrant without limit of time has been issued for her arrest.  That warrant will be executed immediately upon her being returned to this jurisdiction, meaning that it is likely she will remain in custody upon her return to England.</p>

Within this context, the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">acquis communautaire</span> (the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of European Union law) to the areas of the island over which the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise sovereign jurisdiction was suspended by a separate Protocol to the Treaty of Accession (see Art 1.1 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus annexed to the Act of Accession of 2003). </p>

She could hardly hope to demonstrate the necessary kind of parental, or in any event familial, relationship with P unless she were tolerably frank about the nature of her relationship with the respondent. But in that case, even if the Court evinced no actual hostility to the appellant, the evidence about societal attitudes strongly suggests that her consequent relationship with P would not be recognised as one which justified any legal protection. Thus, while we need reach no conclusion about the alleged &#8220;risks to all concerned&#8221;, what matters is that the appellant will have no realistic opportunity to advance her claim in the Pakistani courts.</p>

As a matter of principle, such a claim to jurisdiction sits most uncomfortably not merely with the long-established jurisprudence but more particularly with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(d)(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> and the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Habtoor v Fotheringham</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/186" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 186" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 186</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 951" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 951</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Abduction: Appeal) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1086" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1086" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1086</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 457</ref>.

However, we are satisfied that the present case does not approach the very high threshold necessary to justify the exercise of the jurisdiction. We are very willing to accept that the attenuation or even &#8211; if this is, regrettably, what happens &#8211; the ultimate loss of her relationship with the appellant will be a real detriment to P, quite apart from being a great grief to the appellant herself. But it has to be recognised that the respondent has always been P&#8217;s primary carer, that the appellant had not been part of the household for some time before P and the respondent left for Pakistan and that the appellant has never even in this country had any legal parental rights. The situation falls short of the exceptional gravity where it might indeed be necessary to consider the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

With apologies to the solicitors and counsel who, all unremunerated, have laboured to craft them, I decline to lengthen this judgment by addressing almost all of these submissions. I do, however, agree with Lady Hale and Lord Toulson when, in para 60 below, they reject the suggestion that the nationality-based jurisdiction falls for exercise only in cases "at the extreme end of the spectrum". I consider that, by asking, analogously, whether the circumstances were sufficiently "dire and exceptional" to justify exercise of the jurisdiction, Hogg J may have distracted herself from addressing the three main reasons for the court's usual inhibition about exercising it.&#8221;</p>

It is, however, one thing to approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection. It is another thing to conclude that the circumstances justifying its use must always be "dire and exceptional" or "at the very extreme end of the spectrum". There are three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction: first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders. It is, to say the least, arguable that none of those objections has much force in this case: there is no applicable treaty between the UK and Pakistan; it is highly unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would entertain an application from the appellant; and it is possible that there are steps which an English court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order.</p>

The real question is whether the circumstances are such that this British child requires that protection. For our part we do not consider that the inherent jurisdiction is to be confined by a classification which limits its exercise to "cases which are at the extreme end of the spectrum", per McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re N (Abduction: Appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1086" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1086" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1086</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 457</ref>, para 29. The judgment was ex tempore and it was not necessary to lay down a rule of general application, if indeed that was intended. It may be that McFarlane LJ did not so intend, because he did not attempt to define what he meant or to explain why an inherent jurisdiction to protect a child's welfare should be confined to extreme cases. The judge observed that "niceties as to quite where the existing extremity of the jurisdiction under the inherent jurisdiction may be do not come into the equation in this case" (para 31).</p>

In this sense, the old legal concept of 'comity' has assumed an expansive meaning. 'Comity' once referred simply to the need to ensure that domestic and foreign laws did not impose contradictory duties upon the same individual; it used to prevent the laws of different nations from stepping on one another's toes. Today it means something more. In applying it, our court has increasingly sought interpretations of domestic law that would allow it to work in harmony with related foreign laws, so that together they can more effectively achieve common objectives."</p>

It is based on the concept of a quasi-parental relationship between the sovereign and a child of British nationality. It enables the courts to make a British child a ward of court, even if the child is outside the jurisdiction when the order is made. The continued existence of an inherent jurisdiction in an age of detailed and comprehensive statutory provision is something of an anomaly. The basis of the jurisdiction is, moreover, difficult to reconcile with the content of the statutory rules about jurisdiction. It is based on nationality, whereas the statutory rules are based on habitual residence and presence. Nonetheless, its survival was implicitly recognised by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1(1)</ref>(d) and 2(3) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>, which prohibited the exercise of the jurisdiction so as to give care of a child to any person or provide for contact with or the education of a child, unless either the court had jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention or, if neither of these applied, the child is present or habitually resident in the United Kingdom. Its survival in other cases was acknowledged by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A,</span> supra, subject to the proviso that its exercise would call for "extreme circumspection" (paras 63, 65).

Such orders have been made in two classes of case, both of which can broadly be described as protective. The first comprises abduction cases before the enactment of a statutory jurisdiction to deal with them. The second comprises cases where the child is in need of protection against some personal danger, for example where she has been removed for the purpose of undergoing a forced marriage or female genital mutilation. All of the modern cases fall into this last category.</p>

The judge declined to exercise the jurisdiction because the appellant had been entitled to exercise her parental rights by taking the child to Pakistan and there was no reason to regard the child as being in danger there. In those circumstances, the admitted detriment to the child in being deprived of face to face contact with the appellant could not justify requiring the respondent to bring the child back. The Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion for substantially the same reason. The situation, they said (para 53), "falls short of the exceptional gravity where it might indeed be necessary to consider the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction". I agree with this, but on any view I think that it was a view that a judge could reasonably take.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the question of habitual residence, at the time the children were removed from the jurisdiction of England and Wales in 2012 the evidence currently before the court suggests that they were habitually resident in this jurisdiction for the purposes of Art 8 of BIIa.   The evidence currently available to the court also suggests that the removal of the children from the jurisdiction of England and Wales to Northern Cyprus by the mother amounted to a wrongful removal for the purposes of Art 10 of BIIa.   Further, on the evidence currently before the court, that wrongful removal was, for present purposes, to a non-Member State in circumstances where the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">acquis communautaire</span> to the areas of the island over which the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise sovereign jurisdiction is suspended by Art 1.1 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus annexed to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of Accession of 2003.  Finally, and within this context, the habitual residence that, on the evidence before the court, both children <span style="font-style:italic">appear</span> to have established in Northern Cyprus subsequent to their removal from the jurisdiction in England and Wales in 2012 is thus, for present purposes, habitual residence in a non-Member State.  Accordingly, and having regard to the interpretation placed on Art 10 by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Jurisdiction)</span>, on the evidence currently before the court it is arguable that the basis for the court&#8217;s jurisdiction in this case can be said to be the continued habitual residence of both children in England and Wales, they not having acquired habitual residence in another Member State for the purposes of Art 10 of BIIa.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All that said however, I am conscious of the principle that, for reasons that will be self-evident, the court must avoid reaching definitive conclusions as to habitual residence at a hearing that is proceeding without notice to the other party and before all parties have had a proper opportunity to adduce evidence and make submissions on that question of fact (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/789" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 789" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 789</ref> at [12]).  Further, whilst in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F </span>at [12] the Court of Appeal allowed for interim declarations as to habitual residence where necessary, it seems to me that the court should be cautious when considering an interim declaration before all parties have had a proper opportunity to adduce evidence and make submission in cases where what is sought from the court on the basis of any such interim declaration is an order for the summary return of a child to this jurisdiction.  These points apply with particular force in this case in circumstances where it is apparent on the face of the papers that there is a significant lack of clarity, and much dispute, with respect to the children&#8217;s whereabouts and circumstances since their removal from this jurisdiction in 2012.</p>

There is no dispute that both children are British citizens.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the exercise of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction based on the children&#8217;s nationality, as to their current situation the children are accommodated in children&#8217;s homes in Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus respectively.  They are accordingly separated from each other. There is no one in either area with parental responsibility for the children and neither parent is at present in a position to exercise parental responsibility for the children (the mother because she is in custody and the father because he is estranged from the children). The authorities in Northern Cyprus and in the Republic of Cyprus have each indicated that they are not in a position to take further protective measures in respect of the children or to provide services to them in the long term and wish the children to be returned to England. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, if this court does not exercise its jurisdiction to make orders for the summary return of D she will remain in a children&#8217;s home in the Republic of Cyprus without anyone in that jurisdiction to exercise parental responsibility for her in circumstances where she would be in administrative limbo and without access to services required to protect her welfare.  If this court does not exercise its jurisdiction to make orders for the summary return of K, he will remain in a children&#8217;s home in Northern Cyprus that is understood not to be suitable for his age and in circumstances where he does not speak Turkish. Again, given the communication received from the responsible agencies in Northern Cyprus, he would be in administrative limbo and without access to services required to protect his welfare.  I also note that neither child would be in a position to have direct contact with their mother pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings she faces on return to this jurisdiction and that indirect contact would be problematic.  Neither child would have a full opportunity to see whether a reconciliation could be effected with the father.  Finally, in circumstances where the children will have to be returned to the jurisdiction by social workers rather than those with parental responsibility, I am satisfied that making the children wards of court and making return orders under the inherent jurisdiction will serve to facilitate the lawful transit of the children from their current locations outside the jurisdiction into the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that the children require the protection of this court.  I am further satisfied that the appropriate means of conferring that protection on the children is to ensure that both children are returned to the jurisdiction where both parents now are and in which jurisdiction steps can be taken by the local authority to ensure their future welfare with the full involvement of those with parental responsibility for the children. Within this context, I am satisfied that it is in each child&#8217;s best interests to make orders under the inherent jurisdiction to secure their return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales forthwith.</p>

The orders that the court intends to make pursuant its inherent jurisdiction based on the children&#8217;s British nationality are purely protective in nature and do seek to prescribe matters concerning the care of the children or contact with them or to make provision for their education.</p>

This is not least because to do so will necessarily involve the court having either to reach an interim conclusion on the question of habitual residence as a precursor to making a return order (with the attendant difficulties inherent in basing the summary return of a child on a provisional view as to jurisdiction) or to exercise its jurisdiction based on the child&#8217;s nationality, which jurisdiction the Supreme Court has made tolerably clear is only to be exercised with great caution or circumspection for the protection of the child.  In the circumstances, the court will not routinely grant <span style="font-style:italic">without notice</span> applications under the inherent jurisdiction for the summary return of a child to the jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each case however, turns on its own facts.  There will be cases where it is appropriate for such an order to be made.  For the reasons I have set out in this judgment I am satisfied that this is one of those cases.  Accordingly, I grant permission to the local authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  Further, I make each of the children wards of court and order that the mother shall immediately co-operate with all relevant agencies to facilitate the return by the local authority of each child to the jurisdiction of England and Wales forthwith. I will make directions for this matter to return to court for an on notice hearing at on a date very shortly after the respective dates on which it is anticipated that the mother and the children will arrive back in this jurisdiction.</p>
