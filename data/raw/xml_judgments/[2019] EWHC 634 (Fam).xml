	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am concerned with an appeal in respect of an order made by His Honour Judge Meston QC on 6 November 2018. By that order he dismissed the mother&#8217;s application for a variation of an earlier order made by HHJ Pearl in January 2017 by which she had ordered that the child should live with her father. The appeal has taken a most unusual route to the hearing I held on 27 February which has been to determine a preliminary issue which I identified in an order dated 8 February 2019 and which I confirmed in a directions hearing on 13 February 2019. The preliminary issue was recorded in the order as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The appellant&#8217;s notice itself at paragraph 6 asserted that the appeal was against &#8216;all parts of the order&#8217; which contains provisions setting out who the child should live with (her father); the time that the child would spend with the mother in term times and during holidays; who would have carriage of the child&#8217;s passport; the discharge of earlier orders; requests by the child to see a solicitor; disclosure of papers to any legal representative acting or seeking to act on behalf of the child; and reservation of the case to HHJ Meston QC. I believe that the principal issue that the appellant&#8217;s notice addressed was the refusal of HHJ Meston QC to vary the order so as to provide for the child to live with her mother.   </p>

I hope the parties will forgive me if I refer to them throughout this judgment as the child, the mother and the father.

She had acted as the Children&#8217;s Guardian (&#8216;the Guardian) during proceedings which had taken place between 2015 and 2017. Shortly after the mother issued her application for a variation of the &#8216;live with&#8217; order in April 2018, a dispute arose over which solicitor should be appointed by the Guardian. On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>May 2018, the child was taken by her maternal grandparents to see Barbara Hopkin a well-known child law solicitor. The consultation was apparently funded by the maternal grandparents. Ms Hopkin assessed her as being competent to instruct a solicitor and wrote to the court asking that she be appointed as the child&#8217;s solicitor albeit with a </heading>
	  <paragraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Guardian. The Guardian however appointed Ms Laura Coyle, another well-known child law solicitor, who the Guardian had instructed throughout the earlier proceedings. At a hearing on 3 July 2018 HHJ Meston QC refused Ms Hopkin&#8217;s application for Ms Coyle&#8217;s appointment to be revoked and for her to be instructed and confirmed the appointment of Ms Coyle. No appeal was lodged by Ms Hopkin on the child&#8217;s behalf against this decision within the 21 (or perhaps 7 if it was a case management decision) days provided for and no appeal has been lodged subsequently. Ms Hopkin candidly accepts that she indicated to the child and to the maternal grandfather she thought that appealing against the decision was unnecessary [#9 of her statement]. Thus any application for an extension of time to appeal that order (had such an appeal been lodged) would probably have been doomed to fail having regard to the criteria applicable to relief from sanctions under FPR 4.6.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the course of the hearing HHJ Meston QC had asked Ms Coyle what she would do if the child indicated that she wanted Ms Hopkin to represent her. In response Ms Coyle had confirmed that she would contact Ms Hopkin and explain the position. Following the hearing Ms Coyle says that the child did not indicate that she wished Ms Hopkin to represent her but rather that she was content with Ms Coyle and the Guardian. It was not until 30 January 2019 that Ms Coyle received an email purporting to come from the child stating that she did not want her as her solicitor anymore and would like David Burrows and Barbara Hopkin. In that email she says she has tried to tell her this before. That email is copied into the mother and I believe the maternal grandmother. </p>

The child&#8217;s wishes were to live with her mother. Ms Coyle met the child separately from the Guardian on 16 October 2018 specifically to assess her competency. At that point the Guardian had not concluded her enquiries or made a recommendation and thus in order to ensure that were a conflict between the child and the Guardian to arise, Ms Coyle was able to determine whether she should continue to act for the child directly pursuant to FPR 16.29 (2) she needed to be able to determine whether her understanding was such that she could accept instruction directly from the child. Ms Coyle concluded that the child was not competent to instruct her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As matters transpired no conflict between the child and her Guardian arose.

Ms Hopkin told me that she received a call from the child and informed her that she was about to go on sick leave and could not undertake any work for her. She told the child that she might write to the court. My understanding was that she provided the maternal grandparents (who had been paying her fees) or the child with a list of other solicitors who might be able to assist.  </p>

I am not entirely clear on the chronology of the finalisation of the judgment and order but at paragraph 114 of the judgment HHJ Meston QC explored this and declined to make such an order given the child&#8217;s increasing competence. However he did make an order that no arrangement should be made for the child to consult a solicitor without prior notice being given to Ms Coyle.  An order was also made preventing the disclosure of papers in the case to any other legal representative. The note of the hearing on 9 January 2019 records that by that stage David Burrows had attended on behalf of the child. It seems he had been contacted by the mother and put in funds by her. At some stage he had a 10 minute telephone conversation with the child. He informed the court that he intended to lodge an appeal against the order of November 2018 and also an application to appeal out of time in respect of the earlier decision as to the appointment of a solicitor for the child made in July 2018. He also said he intended to apply to the High Court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10 (8)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on behalf of the child for leave to apply for a section 8 order and also indicated that he intended to make an application to replace the child&#8217;s solicitor.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">November 2018. The appellant&#8217;s notice identified the child as the appellant and the appellant&#8217;s notice was signed by David Burrows who identified himself as the appellant&#8217;s solicitor. In the course of the hearing before me, Ms Hopkin stated that she had had some contact with Mr Burrows about him acting as her agent but had made clear to him that she was not contemplating any work being undertaken by her or by him prior to her return from sick leave in early February. Mr Burrows appears to have been put in funds by the mother and the issue fee in respect of the appeal according to the receipt of the court file appears to have been paid by the mother. In an unsigned statement which accompanied the appellant&#8217;s notice, Mr Burrows said that he had had a 10 minute telephone conversation with the child and went on to say &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I would be naive if I suggested that enabled me to assess her understanding.&#8221; </span>The document identified factors which<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;suggest to me that this court should please enable me to see her.&#8217; </span>The statement refers to Ms Hopkin&#8217;s assessment as being sound; I assume that this is a reference to Ms Hopkin&#8217;s assessment of competence in May 2018 although at paragraph 24 the statement refers to her assessment of the age and understanding of the child in relation to making an application for permission under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10 (2)</ref> (b) and (8) [I think this must be a reference to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>]. As I referred to above the appellant&#8217;s notice was not completed but was accompanied by a host of other documents which made it hard to discern what was actually being sought. Quite why an application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10 (8)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for leave to make an application on behalf of a child for a section 8 order was referred to (or perhaps purportedly being made) within an appellant&#8217;s notice I have not been able to fathom.

For reasons which I do not understand, rather than complying with that direction, Mr Burrows filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal against that order. On 5 February 2019 Lord Justice Baker dismissed the proposed appeal as being misconceived and totally without merit. </p>

After hearing the parties and it appearing that all agreed that the only 2 routes by which Mr Burrows (and/or Ms Hopkin) might represent the child were those I had identified, I gave directions listing the preliminary issue for a one-day hearing. In the course of the hearing Mr Burrows indicated that Ms Hopkin would be resuming acting for the child, she having returned from sick leave. I made provision for statements to be filed specifically addressing the sufficiency of the child&#8217;s understanding to instruct her own solicitor on the appeal and for the filing of skeleton arguments limited to the preliminary issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Both Ms Hopkin and Ms Coyle filed the statements as directed. Ms Hopkin&#8217;s statement addresses the issue of the competence of the child as at May 2018 when she had seen her. It is implicit in her statement that her view has not altered but she does not address the issue of whether the child is competent to instruct her on the appeal as opposed to instruct her in respect of the issue of child arrangements. In submissions she told me that she had not seen the child  recently and indeed has not spoken to her recently. She said her understanding of the order of HHJ Meston QC was such as to prevent her seeing the child or communicating with her without the consent of the father. This came as something of a surprise to me as the issue had been raised at the directions hearing on 13 February 2019 and I had made clear that my interpretation of the order made by HHJ Meston QC was not such as to prevent the child and her solicitor meeting. I can only assume this view was not fed back to Ms Hopkin by Mr Burrows or that there was some other breakdown in communication. Ms Coyle filed a detailed statement setting out her involvement with the child and exhibiting various documents including email communications from the child and the guardians report. She made clear that she did not consider that the child was competent to instruct her own solicitor within the first instance proceedings. It is implicit she considers she is still not competent to pursue this appeal by instructing a solicitor directly. I believe the last meeting that Ms Coyle had with the child was on 17 December 2018 when they met to discuss the judgment of HHJ Meston QC. She was asked about the letter she had written to Sir Andrew McFarlane and Ms Coyle said she (the child) was uneasy about it and did not mention pursuing an appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Each of the represented parties filed skeleton arguments for the hearing. Regrettably the skeleton argument filed on behalf of the child which appears to have been drafted by Mr Burrows was not focussed on the preliminary issues but rather identified some pre-preliminary issues and asserted that they require disposal prior to the determination of the preliminary issue. Much of the skeleton argument related back to the circumstances of the appointment of Ms Coyle in July 2018 and the law which governed that appointment. In the skeleton argument Mr Burrows argued that the original appointment of Ms Coyle was unlawful and should be declared to be unlawful pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30 (2)</ref> with the knock-on effect being that the order of HHJ Meston QC would fall to be set aside without further consideration. Given that there was no appeal in respect of that appointment and the July order and no reference had been made to the possibility of such an appeal in the directions hearing on 13 February 2019, I refused to permit Ms Hopkin to pursue that line of argument. If the appointment had been wrongly made the appointment pursuant to the court order would remain valid unless and until such time as the order was set aside on appeal. Although the skeleton contained some relevant and useful material, overall I felt as if I had been presented with a box of Lego pieces but no instructions to construct the model.  It was only by a process of trial and error that one was able to ascertain which pieces were relevant to the model and which were for something else entirely.  </p>

Firstly, the appeal had been listed in open court but Ms Hopkin who had not instructed Mr Burrows or another advocate did not have higher rights of audience so I decided to hear the case in private. Secondly, and quite understandably, Ms Hopkin wished to explain the circumstances in which Mr Burrows had come to act. She explained that she was concerned about being funded by the mother and was thus acting pro bono on the appeal.  </p>

Ms Coyle and the Guardian were both of the opinion that the child did not have sufficient understanding to conduct proceedings. Mr Jarman and Mr Jones both submitted that the analysis of Ms Coyle and the Guardian was to be preferred to that of Ms Hopkin because it was reached after far greater and recent exposure to the child but also because it was an evaluation reached in full knowledge of all of the evidence in particular expert assessment and conclusions of judges. In contrast Ms Hopkins assessment was, they submitted, carried out in a vacuum; she not having had access to any of the evidence or the judgments. </p>

If Ms Hopkin were right in this analysis the provisions of FPR 16.6 (5) and (6) would not bite.

This submission is apt to address the position if the appeal is part of a continuum but does not really get to grips with the position if the appeal is new proceedings. If the appeal is new proceedings Ms Hopkin has accepted instructions from the child to act for her and is already in fact acting; albeit her doing so has not been sanctioned by the court and so would appear to meet the test. Ultimately the issue comes back to whether an appeal constitutes new proceedings or another stage of existing proceedings and what role the court plays in each situation in determining whether the child is competent to appear in the proceedings without a Guardian. Mr Jones makes a linked point. He submits if the appeal is fresh proceedings the provisions of FPR 16.2 and PD 16A would require the court to determine whether the child should be a party to the proceedings and that the issue of her representation could not arise unless and until the court had determined if she were to be a party. Thus as Ms Coyle remains acting for the child in accordance with the order of HHJ Meston QC, Mr Jones argues Ms Hopkin cannot be &#8216;already acting&#8217; for her within FPR16.6(3)(b)(ii).    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The rules do not specify how an application pursuant to FPR 16.6 (5) is to be made and thus the provisions of FPR 18.1 (2) (a) would appear to apply although the court can dispense with the requirement for an application notice. FPR PD 5A identifies form C2 as one of the forms that can be used to make a part 18 application. For an application made within an appeal I do not think it would be necessary to file a separate form but rather to complete part 10 of the appellant&#8217;s notice (FP161). No application was filed with the appellant&#8217;s notice nor was part 10 of the appellant&#8217;s notice completed to make such an application but I am prepared for the purposes of this preliminary issue to treat the submissions that have been made as such an application notwithstanding the failure of Mr Burrows to comply with my original order to identify what application they were making. FPR 16.29 (7) also provides a mechanism where a child wishes an appointment of a solicitor to be terminated to apply to the court for such an order, although no such application has been made and nor was such an application advanced either at the directions hearing on 13 February or at the hearing on 26 February 2019. Such an application would leave in place the Guardian whose view is that the child is not competent to give instructions to pursue an appeal. </p>

That decision of the Court of Appeal, albeit perhaps <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> on the facts of the case, and albeit concerning the forerunner to the current rules I consider a powerful guide to the proper interpretation of the current rules. The arguments set out by the then Mr Holman for the Official Solicitor remain as compelling now as they were then. I consider that interpretation is fortified by the interpretive assistance provided by Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the rights of the child requires that the best interests of a child be a primary consideration in any decision affecting a child: See Rayden and Jackson, Volume 2 &#8216;Children&#8217; Paragraph 30.58 and the cases cited there. It seems clear to me that it is in the best interests of a child that the court remain the ultimate arbiter of whether the child has understanding or sufficient understanding to act without a Guardian for the reasons identified by Mr Holman in Re CT as to the circumstances in which a solicitor&#8217;s view might not be reliable. The court may raise the issue of its own motion and make the determination under FPR16.6(10). </p>

The wording of FPR 16.6(6) refers to the court <span style="font-style:italic">considering that the child has sufficient understanding to conduct the proceedings concerned without a Guardian</span>. There is on the face of it therefore a difference in what the court is considering; on the one hand &#8216;able having regard to their understanding to give instructions&#8217; on the other &#8216;sufficient understanding to conduct the proceedings&#8217;.

However the expressions do tend to be used interchangeably. In Re W (representation of child) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 2 FLR 199" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 2 FLR 199</ref> the Court of Appeal refer to sufficient understanding interchangeably with understanding. It is also clear from the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in re CT (above) where they refer to &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">necessary ability having regard to his understanding</span>&#8217; that there is a parallel with &#8216;sufficiency&#8217;. If one considers what lies at the core of the issue it is whether the child has the understanding to deal with the legal proceedings in question having regard to the subject matter of them and the nature of the proceedings. Having regard to what the House of Lords concluded in relation to Gillick competence it seems to me that whether the court is considering the question of able to give instructions having regard to their understanding or has sufficient understanding to conduct proceedings under FPR16.6(3)(b)(i) or (6) or (10) or 16.29(2)(b) or (8)(b) that the core evaluation is whether the child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to be able to give instructions or conduct the proceedings. Whilst I would not rule out the possibility of a case arising where the different formulations might result in a difference in outcome, in most cases the application of an objective assessment by the court whether under 16.6(6) or under 16.6(10) or 16.29(2) is likely to result in the same answer to the question of the child&#8217;s competence.   </p>

If I conclude she has capacity she could, if the case is a 16.6(3)(i), instruct Ms Hopkin or if it is a 16.6 (5 and 6) one she could either continue with Ms Coyle or apply under 16.29(7) for Ms Coyle&#8217;s appointment to be terminated and then go on to appoint Ms Hopkin under 16.6(3). If I conclude she does not have sufficient understanding to instruct but the appeal is fresh proceedings I would have to consider appointing a Guardian pursuant to FPR 16.6 (10).  The rules are not entirely clear as to the position as between Ms Hopkin and the Guardian in such a situation but if I had concluded the child did not have sufficient understanding to instruct it seems self-evident that Ms Hopkin would have to take instructions from the Guardian. If I conclude she does not have sufficient understanding and the appeal is a continuation of proceedings then the Guardian remains appointed to represent the child and the solicitor would be obliged to accept instructions from the Guardian. </p>

In particular the seamless continuation of party status and the powers of the appeal court all point to an appeal being another stage of proceedings; albeit different in nature. I don&#8217;t consider that the use of an appellant&#8217;s notice, rather than a C2, shed much light on the issue. Applications in existing proceedings can also be made by the use of other forms under the part 18 procedure. Seems to me the appellant&#8217;s notice and the giving of a separate case number are administrative matters rather than affecting the substance of the proceedings. Nor do I consider the rules relating to the availability of legal aid shed much light on whether the proceedings are separate or part of a continuum.

The shorthands of &#8216;sufficient understanding&#8217; and &#8216;understanding&#8217; have been used interchangeably in the jurisprudence and in practice professionals often refer to whether the child is &#8216;competent&#8217; to instruct a solicitor without a Guardian or has &#8216;capacity&#8217; so to do.  All ultimately are referring to the same substantive issue.

In later proceedings a Guardian was appointed who appointed a solicitor.  The child wished to instruct her own solicitor directly.  There was a dispute between the view of the solicitor instructed by the child and the Guardian and the solicitor appointed by the Guardian as to whether the child was competent to instruct a solicitor directly.

The situation in which children are taken secretly by one parent (or grandparent) to see a solicitor either in advance of or in the course of an application or following an unsuccessful outcome is a matter which can cause profound concern. As HHJ Meston QC identified and as is emphasised by Ms Hopkin and Mr Burrows a competent child who wishes to instruct a solicitor has the same right to do so as any other individual. Orders directed at the child herself or a solicitor she wishes to instruct which have the effect of inhibiting or preventing that right raise very serious issues which do not call for determination in this case. Orders directed at the parents in the form of prohibited steps orders or specific issue orders and which are designed to inhibit or prevent them from assisting or encouraging a child to obtain legal advice are a different matter. In the course of the hearings on both 13 February 2019 and 26 February 2019 it was suggested that the order made by HHJ Meston QC on 6 November 2018 prohibited the child from seeing Ms Hopkin or Mr Burrows. Neither paragraph 11 nor paragraph 12 of the order had that effect and as is clear from paragraph 114 of HHJ Meston QC&#8217;s judgment they were not intended to do so. As I have referred to above Ms Hopkin appeared pro bono because she was concerned at the potential conflict or appearance thereof that being funded by the mother might create. Again it is not an issue that I need to determine in this judgment but I acknowledge that there is some debate about the issue of one parent (perhaps with their own agenda) funding the obtaining of legal advice by a child who they believe is aligned with their position. The significance of the S-v-S decision lies in the further recognition of the importance of the autonomy of the child. </p>

Given that lack of capacity for adults is linked to an inability to make decision in relation to a matter because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain it is hardly of direct relevance. However it is of note that in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> factors such as inability to understand the information relevant to a decision, inability to retain that information, inability to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or inability to communicate a decision are the components which determine whether an adult has capacity.  I note also that unwise decisions do not denote of themselves an inability to make a decision. Some of those factors are plainly identified by the family courts, as being relevant to the evaluation of understanding. </p>

What is clear is that there has been a shift away from a paternalistic approach in favour of an approach which gives significantly more weight to the autonomy of the child in the evaluation of whether they have sufficient understanding. Thus the earlier authorities need to be approached with a degree of caution in terms of the level at which they set the &#8216;bar&#8217; of understanding. The autonomy issue sounds both in pure &#8216;understanding&#8217; terms and in welfare terms.  </p>

The expression of a wish for an objectively &#8216;unwise&#8217; (or unsound) outcome might now not undermine the evaluation of sufficient understanding in the way it might have in 1993. It is perhaps also likely to hold the child to a somewhat lower expectation of understanding of the litigation process than emerges from Booth J&#8217;s judgment cited in Re N (above) which appeared to contemplate an ability to negotiate complexities of litigation which many adults might struggle with. </p>

An ability to understand that their solicitor put their case but also has duties of honesty to the court, an ability to understand that the judge makes a decision based on an overall evaluation of the best interests of the child which balances many competing factors; the ability to understand that they might attend court, could give and evidence, could read documents; the ability to recognise the stress of exposure to the court process and the arguments between others.

She said she did not consider that the child was merely parroting her mother&#8217;s position but she was able to explain why she wished to reverse the arrangements. Nor did she think that the child trivialised issues which would have been a contra indicator to sufficient understanding. She accepted that the child did not understand the reasons why the court had made the decision that she should live with her father which initially caused me some concern. However on further exploration it emerged that the reasons were to be explained to the child in therapy and as a result of the mother&#8217;s refusal to engage in the therapeutic process that explanation had not yet been given to the child. She said from her discussions she had assessed whether the child could understand an argument and understood what would happen in a court room and she had concluded she could. She emphasised that her understanding from the communications she had had with the child and those Mr Burrows had had with the child were that it was her clear desire to appeal the order. Although she had not spoken directly with the child since July 2018 she saw nothing that gave her any reason to alter her assessment of the child&#8217;s sufficiency of understanding. </p>

She acknowledged that her initial evaluation of the child&#8217;s competence was something which might have to be re-evaluated in the light of other evidence. She said that she had not found the decision on the child&#8217;s sufficiency of understanding to be difficult in this case. </p>

She was not proactive in pressing her wish to live with her mother. Emails from the child to her solicitor about the case mostly were written when she was with her mother. She interacts easily with adults and professionals.  She appeared clear in her desire to live with her mother. She blamed her father for not being able to live with her mother saying &#8216;he is the cause of this&#8217; and despite having had explanations and having gone through therapy and having experienced a positive relationship with her father she still is negative about her father in a way which the mother is also. The Guardian noted that the child had said she would not mind if her mother withdrew her application. She also expressed concerns about her being taken to a solicitor and the additional pressure this places on her.  Although the Guardian did recommend that the child should live with her mother if the mother could demonstrate that she would be able to give the child an overall positive view of her father, the tenor of the report overall is that the mother&#8217;s approach had changed little. Thus the probability of her demonstrating such change was limited. </p>

There is however an immediate and obvious difference between them. That is not the age and experience of the solicitor conducting the evaluation but rather the extent to which the evaluation is an informed evaluation. Ms Hopkin&#8217;s evaluation is based primarily on her meeting with the child supported by what she can glean from communications that she has had with the child or which she has been sent by the child and some other modest exposure to information. Although her evaluation has not taken place in a vacuum it is very much in a low pressure vessel in terms of the material that has been available to her to assist in the evaluation. Ms Coyle&#8217;s evaluation has been taken with exposure to the full atmosphere of information which bears upon the issue. As Ms Hopkin accepted in submissions, an initial evaluation of a child may very well have to be reassessed the light of further information that becomes available. This is far from a simple case given the history of it. Thus initial impressions almost certainly would have to be reassessed.  </p>

Whilst inevitably her reasons for wanting to have a solicitor and appeal will be mixed, arising at least in part from the fact that her solicitor and Guardian did not achieve the outcome she desired I consider that it is also likely that her position has been influenced by her mother and maternal family either directly or indirectly. Although every child is of course different the fact that this child has not been in direct contact with Mr Burrows or Ms Hopkin pushing for information, seeking answers or otherwise proactively pressing her case indicates to me that her desire to have her own solicitor in Ms Hopkin and to pursue the appeal is not particularly strong. Her acceptance of the possible withdrawal of proceedings in summer 2018 is further evidence of this. </p>

The child&#8217;s wish to live with her mother was accepted by the Guardian and HHJ Meston QC as a genuine one. Inevitably it is in part a product of influence (whether direct or indirect and see HHJ Pearl&#8217;s conclusion) but all our views are in part a product of influence of others views.

They emerge as very simplistic and unrealistic. Although neither Ms Hopkin or Ms Coyle specifically addressed the question of the child&#8217;s understanding of the appeal process, the nature of an appeal is in many ways harder to understand than the first instance process given it is a review of the judge&#8217;s decision rather than a rehearing of the application. </p>

Exposure to sensitive information to a child of this age and with this history will be harmful. Although her actual involvement in this appeal might be limited the process of challenging the judgment would inevitably involve detailed discussions with the child about the evidence. On the other hand, she has expressed a desire to have Ms Hopkin act for her and to appeal. This has endured since HHJ Meston QC&#8217;s adverse judgment. However it is not pressed proactively and the Guardian and Ms Coyle did not detect any real desire to appeal in any event. Thus preventing the child from engaging directly in this litigation with the effect that it would very probably bring the appeal to a juddering halt is not likely in my view to be perceived by the child as a significant insult to her autonomy as an individual.  </p>

Inevitably the evaluation is more an art than a science and the weight to be given to each component cannot be arithmetically totted up. The overall impression that clearly emerges is one of a child who does not have sufficient understanding to conduct the appeal without a children&#8217;s Guardian. That is not to say that Ms Hopkin&#8217;s initial evaluation was wrong; it has to be looked at in the light of the totality of the material available. The test in FPR 16.6 (6) is not met. My conclusion would be the same as if I were considering the test under 16.6 (3) as to whether the child is able having regard to her understanding to give instructions in relation to the appeal. </p>

The decision ultimately revolves around his assessment that the mother has demonstrated insufficient change to tilt the welfare balance in favour of a change in the living arrangements.

I accept of course that they might improve in elaboration but there is nothing obviously wrong with the decision reached by HHJ Meston QC; indeed  reading it as a whole it appears to right.  Thus in terms of cross checking any decision I make as to the sufficiency of the child&#8217;s understanding and the consequent impact that may have on the appeal I am reassured that the termination of the appeal through an adverse decision on the sufficiency of the child&#8217;s understanding may only be bringing forward the termination of the appeal.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>The effect of my decision is that the child cannot pursue this appeal without a children&#8217;s Guardian. The Guardian remains appointed for the child. Given my conclusions, Ms Coyle is not obliged to conduct the proceedings in accordance with instructions received from the child (FPR 16.29(2)) but rather in accordance with instructions received from the Guardian (FPR 16.291)).  Although I have not heard submissions from the parties on the precise impact it appears to me that means either that the Guardian would seek permission to withdraw the appeal or that the appeal would be struck out.  If the parties are unable to agree the form of order arising from this judgment the parties may lodge their competing versions and I will determine the issue on paper. Mr Jarman intimated a costs application might be made were I to determine the preliminary issue in this way. If that is pursued he will need, as I trailed during the hearing, to consider against whom such an order would be sought and the basis for it and to make any necessary applications. I would hope that further hearings could be avoided but if necessary we will re-convene to finalise matters.  </p>
