		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;RA has failed to comply with his duties as an attorney. The Mental Capacity Act stipulates that, where a person has the capacity to make a decision, they should be provided with support to do so. However, the Visitor reported that RA has not been consulting HS in decisions relating to her finances, even though she is able to advise him of her wishes. RA has also been unable to provide the OPG with any explanation regarding the expenditure from HS&#8217;s account as, by his own admission, he has not kept detailed records or receipts. In addition to this, RA has admitted to allowing the lines between his own and HS&#8217;s funds to become blurred. Consequently, this means that the OPG is unable to determine how RA has spent HS&#8217;s money and if it has been used in her best interests. RA also clearly states in his letter received on 5 November 2013, that he would be content for the OPG to take over managing HS&#8217;s finances and describes his role as attorney as an additional headache.&#8221; </p>

I do not think that Essex County Council are suitable to take over my mother&#8217;s affairs due to everything that has happened so far and I fail to see how they can possibly have her best interests at heart. I have been witness to so much that has happened with my mum and I can honestly say that, apart from family, the only people who have had my mother&#8217;s best interests at heart have been the majority of the paid carers. I also request this on the grounds that I have recently discovered that, while in hospital, my mum was asked who she wanted to be in charge of her finances, and was told that I couldn&#8217;t do it because I wasn&#8217;t eighteen. I was only about three weeks from being eighteen and I think that this is a negligible difference, and it could have been held in my place. However, I am now nineteen, and fully capable of taking over her finances as she wished.</p>

My mother has never wanted for anything and, when she has stated that she wants something, my dad provided as soon as he possibly could.

I am in no doubt that without my obstructive presence HS would have been moved into residential care years ago. However, none of the above statements allows for the abusive and sustained campaign against me that Essex County Council and their employees Active Assistance entered into last year. &#8230; It is against this background that this OPG investigation transpired.

HS didn&#8217;t work after CA&#8217;s birth in 1995 and she became ill soon afterwards. RA was the family&#8217;s sole breadwinner and the principal contributor to the joint account. There is no question of his having misappropriated funds nor is there any need for the deputy to pursue him for the recovery of funds.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;Like many children of parents with illness, CA is mature beyond his years, used to taking responsibility and is accountable for his actions. From a very young age CA has been aware of his mother&#8217;s needs and the role of the various carers and organisations coming into the house. For many years he was one of the few people able to understand his mother&#8217;s speech, and would always advocate on her behalf to her carers. He is of an extremely caring nature, and this was exampled to me last year when he refused to take a holiday in Australia, as his mum&#8217;s health had deteriorated and he did not feel happy to leave her at that time.</p>

He is organised and logical enough to keep receipts and assertive enough to remind carers to do the same. I would not expect him to have any problems at all with maintaining the financial records and budget for HS. </p>

He is capable of the role and has enormous commitment and love for his mum. I fully support his application.&#8221; </p>
