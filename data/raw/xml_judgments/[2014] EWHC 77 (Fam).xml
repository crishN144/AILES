It certainly is.  The essence for today's purposes is that as long ago as November 2009 a consent order was made by Mr Justice Moylan resolving financial matters between these parties.   Pursuant to that order a further potentially substantial sum remained due to the wife upon the sale by the husband of certain shares.  </span></p>

In fact, between then and now he has paid her nothing representative of those proceeds, although he says - and it may be the case - that he has made some relatively small payments to, or for, her.  </span></p>

He thus says that the amount due to the wife, far from being "in excess of &#8364;2 million", would "amount to not more than &#8364;100".  It is obvious that so vast a divergence between what the husband was saying as recently as July 2013 and what he is saying now requires not only very particular explanation, but also production of clear documentary evidence which fully accounts for the sale of the shares in question and any net amount truthfully received or receivable by, or on behalf of, the husband.  </span></p>

Paragraph 1 of that order provided that the husband "must not, whether by himself or by causing or permitting any other, in any way dispose of or deal with, or diminish the value of the proceeds of sale of" the shares in question.   Paragraph 2, which I will not lengthen this judgment by reading out in full, required the husband within twenty-one days to inform the solicitors for the wife of, and verify by affidavit,  all details surrounding the proposed or actual sale of the shares and to produce a quantity of very obvious required documentation in relation to the transaction and the destination of the proceeds.  That order was promptly served upon the husband in Singapore.  The husband has not supplied one single document in obedience to it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">If I may say so, that proposition by the respondent husband is completely misconceived.  The freezing order is made in proceedings no. FD08D00504.  Those are the original and still subsisting divorce proceedings between himself and his former wife which commenced, as I have said, in 2008.   The proceedings are still subsisting because, pursuant to the order for financial provision made in 2009, significant amounts are still owing by the husband to the wife, and unless and until that order is satisfied in full, the proceedings subsist.  Patently, the respondent husband submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court in 2008 or 2009, for an order could not otherwise have been made by consent.   Having so submitted himself, it is frankly nonsense to insert some caveat now about submitting himself to the jurisdiction of the court.   The "right" which was confirmed by paragraph 2 of the order itself had nothing to do with submission to the jurisdiction, but was a quite different right, namely, that he is entitled to refuse to provide information "on the grounds that it may incriminate him".  Nothing at all has been said in the statement of the respondent husband to indicate that there may be some basis for supposing that he might incriminate himself by supplying the documents and material referred to in paragraph 2 of the freezing order of 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013.   </span></p>

If those facts are all true, then of course I do accept and appreciate that it may take a little time for this respondent husband, who appears to live and be based in Singapore, to obtain and instruct suitable alternative representation in England and Wales.    </span></p>

Since that gaping divergence has not yet been adequately explained or evidenced, it is, to my mind, patent that good grounds exist for renewing or extending the freezing order which was made on 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Accordingly, since there has been such a lack of compliance by the respondent husband with the disclosure requirements of paragraph 2 of the order made on 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013, I will add provisions to the injunctive part of that order to the effect that the respondent husband must not in any way dispose of or deal with any of the funds held on his behalf by Memery Crystal or the library at Appleby Castle.  In order to give some teeth and substance to the order in relation to the funds at Memery Crystal, I will further require that firm to disclose the amounts, if any, actually held by them on behalf of the respondent husband in a solicitors' client account.   There is a text message from the respondent husband to the wife dated 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013 which makes some reference to funding Memery Crystal.  So I will require them to supply information as to the state of the account on that date and now, and any movements in between.  I stress, as will be made express on the face of the order itself, that Memery Crystal are not required to state the payer, payee or destination of any movements into or out of the relevant solicitors' client account.   They are only required to disclose the actual amounts standing in the account at any particular time and the amounts of any payments in or payments out.  Provisionally, it does not appear to me that an order limited in that way in any way offends against legal professional privilege.  However, there will, in any event, be a liberty to Memery Crystal to apply to vary or discharge that part of the order.</span></p>

He may, of course, also put in any other information, documents, or material which he may wish in relation to the exercise of calculating what further amounts are due from him to the wife.  She, of course, must have an opportunity to reply thereto.  The husband needs firmly to appreciate that in the absence of convincing documentary material and explanations from him, there is a likelihood, to put it no higher, that the court will place significant reliance on what he himself had told the wife as recently as last July she might expect to receive.</span></p>
