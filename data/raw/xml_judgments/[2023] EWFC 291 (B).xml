	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is a Factfinding Hearing in which the father is represented by Miss Rushworth, the mother represents herself, and Miss MacLeod represents the children, through their NYAS caseworker, Ms Scott. I want to say at the start of my judgment how grateful I am for the NYAS team who have compiled my bundle and for the assistance of both counsel, whose calm, clear and courteous presentation has assisted me immensely. I also particularly want to thank Miss Rushworth for the composite schedule, which is an incredibly helpful document and one on which she must have spent a considerable amount of time. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The reason we are in court for a Factfinding Hearing is because the father made an application, on 19 February 2021, to see the children. The mother then made a C2 application, on 26 March, to live with the children in [redacted country]. The matter came before Recorder Stevens on 11 August 2021, when he ordered that the father should see the children alternate weekends and Thursdays after school. He ordered a Section 7 report and a [redacted country] law expert. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Judge Sawetz saw the matter in January 2022. By that time, A had spoken to Cafcass and made allegations of sexual impropriety against her father. There were concerns at that time for A&#8217;s mental health and the girls&#8217; emotional wellbeing. The allegations that the father physical harmed the children are recorded on the face of that order. The judge on that occasion agreed the urgent assessment of a child psychiatrist to see A, a Section 37 report, and the police were asked to set out their investigation. The order of August 2021 remained in force insofar as child arrangements were concerned. The matter came before Judge Sawetz in May 2022, when she repeated her directions about the psychiatrist and the police. </p>

Still no psychiatrist had been found or agreed between the parties. </p>

We have had screens in court, separate waiting areas, an interpreter on hand for the mother. Parties were sworn in at the beginning of the proceedings so whatever they told me could be treated as evidence. This is a case that predates the qualified legal representation provisions, and so questions from the mother came through me to be put to the father. No one during the course of the hearing has alerted me to any unfairness or told me that I need to stop and do things differently. </p>

I am incredibly grateful for Miss Elsworth&#8217;s trying to distil it down, but it means that that is her summary that we have worked from, so to a certain extent it is slightly misleading. When she says some allegations are the mother&#8217;s allegations, for example, what they actually hinge on is what the children said, not necessarily what the mother has said. But I am going to use that incredibly helpful structure that Miss Rushworth has picked up in her table to begin to corral the evidence accordingly. </p>

There are various ways of interpreting the father&#8217;s report to the police. One interpretation, of course, is that what happened is as he said it was and that he has reflected carefully before involving the police. Another is to analyse his approach as being with a degree of planning and calculation to gain a tactical advantage against Mother after consulting a solicitor. </p>

At CPOMS J118, B does appear to have been very aware of the mother taken away by the police, and emotionally impacted by it. This theme is picked up in the Section 37 report, at D205, where both children describe their experience as traumatic. They have witnessed their mother being arrested by the police following arguments between their parents. A said she cannot forgive her father for this and stopped contact with him. </p>

It is not clear to me exactly what the mother has said to the police. You cannot hear what she is saying at the end of the phone. When the police first arrive, they ask if there is some kind of agreement that the father does not come to the property, so it seems more likely than not that that is what the mother had told them, which is broadly accurate when I look at the correspondence between solicitors that was going backwards and forwards about when he should pick up his belongings. </p>

She refers to having an undertaking for a Non-Molestation Order and an Occupation Order. Whether there is a breach of the undertaking, and there has been no application for committal, I think is debatable, but what is clear is that the mother is calling the police because she takes the view that the attendance of the paternal family at the house on very little notice is upsetting the children. Although one can debate the legal accuracy of what she says about the undertaking, having watched the body worn camera footage, I do not think she is knowingly making a false statement or seeking to deliberately mislead. Her reason for contacting the police is that she wants the father and the family to stop coming over. </p>

At D29, information received from the children has been very critical of their father, say the social work team in spring 2021. There does not seem to be a balance, from what they have said. The reference for that is D29. The mother instigates the referral to the police, I suppose, on behalf of A, she would say, after A&#8217;s allegations in November 2021. </p>

It could be, as that conference suggests, that things were stabilising at home, that was certainly the professional view, and that A felt able to share what troubled her, after a period of non-contact with her father.

Again, what is very interesting about this police referral is that the mother clearly provides to them the Cafcass letter, or if she does not provide it to them, they have got it somehow, because the first couple of paragraphs of the police report are a verbatim cut and paste of the Cafcass letter, complete with the spelling mistake of the word role L, O, L, E. The mother does not add any more details, save for B seeing naked people on Dad&#8217;s phone. Actually, B has already mentioned this herself to the social worker, in September 2021 (see page D139). So, in other words, when I look at this closely the mother has reported to the police what the girls have already told other people and does not appear to elaborate on what A has already told Cafcass, as you might expect her to do if she was the instigator of all of this. </p>

So it is not clear to me which solicitors&#8217; letters were seen by the parents at the time, when the solicitors&#8217; letters arrived at each other&#8217;s offices and what, if any, response was received to the letter of 27 April. It seems to me there may well have been some crossed wires or lack of shared understanding about what was going on. </p>

That position was replicated in their oral evidence.

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">It seems to me that, on other occasions, the father and his family attended to mark Christmas and birthdays, which was no doubt well meaning and done because they wanted to pass over presents. But insufficient thought was given by the father to whether this was the best way for the children to receive gifts from him. He did not consider the potential impact on them of the family or him coming around with little notice on a special occasion. It would have been better if he had used a courier or post. The trouble is, with turning up in person, you do not know what you are turning up to. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am satisfied that the girls find the father aggressive. Some of the descriptions the girls give can be explained as play or gymnastics, for example  child F being thrown on the bean bag. However, the girls do not describe being carried or dragged upstairs as playful but as a form of chastisement which hurt. I accept their evidence. I find that the father has been physically rough with them.  I am satisfied that he has placed them forcefully in the bathroom by holding their arms with the light off and locked the door.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am satisfied, and the father accepts, that he used A&#8217;s shower room. The evidence supports a finding that, on occasion, he would come in when A was showering and she did not want him to. I find that he came into her room without knocking, when she was changing, and he accepted that he stayed in her room in February 2021, when he was asked to leave. I find that he did not respect A&#8217;s personal space. </p>

I am satisfied on one occasion she said &#8220;what are you doing?&#8221;. I am satisfied that this made her uncomfortable and she viewed it as intrusive. </p>

I accept B was uncomfortable about this and did not like him touching her, just as she told the police officer, and that she would, on occasion, come back from her father&#8217;s having not showered. </p>

I am not satisfied that the mother has denigrated the father or spoken badly of him in earshot with the children or discussed adult issues with him. The father has on occasion done so, as set out at F171, D41 and J89. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am not satisfied that the mother placed the children under increasing emotional pressure and in the middle of a parental conflict. I find that their views are their own when they have expressed in their own words to different people at different times their reservations about seeing their father. The children have expressed a reluctance and a refusal to see their father, and, in my view, that is a result of their experience of his parenting, not because they are alienated by their mother. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Looking back at the whole picture, both parents allege controlling, coercive behaviour. Both appear very distressed, at times, in their interactions with me and with the police. But I remind myself of the specific definitions in the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 and PD12J of controlling and coercive behaviour and domestic abuse. Not all bad behaviour fits those definitions. The majority of the mother&#8217;s allegations which arose in this respect arose post separation and linked closely to travel to [redacted country] and family finances. The father&#8217;s allegations arise mainly from tensions between the mother, him and the paternal family, and this struck me as an immensely complex dynamic. His case is high on assertion but lacking in granularity and tainted by his motivation for calling the police in February 2021. So I do not find a pattern of abusive or controlling behaviour going either way but, rather, a tense and distrustful end to a long relationship. </p>
