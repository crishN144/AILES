It appears (from recordings in the notes of the results of the Edinburgh Post Natal Depression Scale) that the mother suffered a degree of post-natal depression for which she was advised to seek medical attention.  She did not.  The mother then took some part-time work (when A was about 20 months old), working 5.30pm-11.00pm three evenings per week.  It is agreed that when the mother worked the father looked after A. The parents had a social life, though the extent to which the mother had her own friends (through mother&#8217;s groups and otherwise) is disputed. </p>

The property is registered only in the father&#8217;s name, although the mother contributed financially to it; there is a dispute about the reason for this sole registration &#8211; the mother suggesting that it is evidence of the father&#8217;s controlling behaviour and financial abuse of her, the father ascribing this to the fact that when the paperwork was being completed the mother did not yet have her Australian permanent residency, and this was an impediment to co-ownership.  </p>

The mother and father hastened to obtain a passport for A, and then travelled together with A to the UK on 27 April 2022 to attend the funeral and for the mother to deal with all other associated arrangements; return flights were booked for the three of them for 25 May 2022.  </p>

It requires an evaluation of all relevant circumstances. It focuses on the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question. The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent. Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned.

This case concerned a mother with chronic mental health problems with acute, severe, episodes; she too suffered from ADHD.  This was a case in which the father sought the return of a child to Australia, and in that case too, expert evidence was given by Dr. Ratnam.  Moylan LJ (allowing the appeal and overturning the decision at first-instance to return) recited the evidence of Dr Ratnam (describing the mother&#8217;s mental ill-health) from [30] &#8211; [52].  While acknowledging that every case is different, and each must be determined on its own facts, it has been useful to have regard to <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> to provide a benchmark for the decision which I am required to make; while there are inevitably differences, there are also a number of striking similarities between the situation of this mother and the situation of the mother in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>.</p>

She alleges that he threw food at her on at least one occasion; on other occasions he was physically violent to her and on another occasion had sexual intercourse with her without her consent.  The mother describes the father throwing things at her and the wall in temper, and describes occasions when he has punched the wall.  She says that she attempted to end the relationship on a number of occasions, but failed to do so.  She complains that she became socially isolated while living in Australia, because of the father&#8217;s controlling behaviour, and in the end effectively had only one friend (L).  She asserts that the father &#8220;was extremely controlling, aggressive and intimidating&#8221; and alleges that the father abused alcohol and drugs.  The mother says that she &#8220;struggled&#8221; after January 2019 (before she conceived A) and that the relationship deteriorated during the pregnancy.  She said that after A&#8217;s birth &#8220;life became even harder. I now had a young child to care for and [the father] was no help at all &#8230;. He refused to help &#8230; He was never there to support me or [A].&#8221;   The mother alleges that the father :</p>

She contends that he showed very little empathy and was more interested in drinking and clubbing.  The mother&#8217;s uncle and cousin from Australia flew over, and assisted the father to clear the maternal grandmother&#8217;s house.

Dr Ratnam accepted that the mother&#8217;s mental state has been (objectively viewed) worse since she has been back in England, likely caused by a combination of her mother&#8217;s death (and her unresolved guilt about not seeing her before her death), and the current proceedings.  Dr Ratnam told me that the mother was &#8220;incredibly distressed&#8221; in interview, &#8220;severely anxious&#8221; and &#8220;severely depressed&#8221;; her mental health was &#8220;significantly impacted&#8221;.

The father currently lives in a small township more than 100 miles from Perth.  Dr Ratnam was reasonably emphatic that if the mother were to return, it would be important to identify who would be caring for her, and what the service would be.  She told Ms Chokowry that: &#8220;it would be really important to clarify services&#8230; who she would have access to, and what would be the pathways of care&#8221;.

He denies the mothers accusations of physical and sexual abuse and claims that he &#8220;never laid a hand on&#8221; the mother, nor has he thrown things at her as she alleges.  He denies calling her names, and being disparaging about her to other people as she has claimed. He accepts that they have argued with raised voices. He denies that he has ever smacked A, but accuses the mother of having done so, with such force as to leave a handprint; he exhibits to his statement a WhatsApp message which references this.

He denies taking any items to try and sell them without the mother&#8217;s knowledge or consent: &#8220;she was fully aware of everything that was sold and she kept all of the proceeds for herself&#8221;.</p>

On the contrary, he points to an entry which refers to the mother &#8220;getting a bit more help from dad&#8221; (albeit that &#8220;football season has started and it is a bit harder now&#8221;).

As I have said elsewhere, and I repeat here, no one can now be in any doubt about the deeply damaging impact of domestic abuse on children who are exposed to it (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/3/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref>). Accordingly, I must consider whether the protective measures offered by the father, coupled with the protections of which the mother may be able to avail herself through the Australian courts, and the supports which may be available from her friends in Australia, can mitigate that risk.  In my judgment, the protective measures offered by the father, together with the protective orders which would be available to the mother, diminish the risk sufficiently &#8211; providing the mother with adequate independence from the father &#8211; as to reduce to a sufficient extent the grave risk of harm to A of exposure to any ongoing domestic abuse.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I have been presented with more than the usual anxieties of the returning mother.  Far more.  This mother has a long history of mental ill-health stretching back twenty years to her early adolescence (and even before that).  Her GP records contain a number of entries of referrals for anxiety; she is recorded as having suffered from panic attacks from the ages of 17 to 25; she carries the legacy of an abusive traumatic experience.  On two recorded occasions in her adolescence she took an overdose of tablets, which - even if not intended as life-threatening &#8211; at the very least are a serious indicator of significant distress.  Following the birth of A she is recorded as having suffered &#8220;moderate&#8221; post-natal depression which for which the mother failed to access treatment.  The pattern of her mental health reflects serious downturns coincident with significant stressful life events &#8211; the divorce of her parents, the abusive trauma of her teenage years, the failure of a relationship, the death of her mother.   Alongside the expected feelings of her current grief, she feels guilt (at not being able to say goodbye) and regret (at not having seen her mother for 4 years).  To that list of adverse life events which have triggered a decline in her mental health, it is reasonable to add, in my judgment, a return to Australia at this stage, an outcome of which she says that she is &#8220;terrified&#8221;.</p>

By July 2023, when seen by Dr Ratnam, her depression was worse.

I was struck by the descriptions of how she was feeling in her communications with the father in the autumn of 2022, at a time when she was also saying that she would return to Australia (hence they were not self-serving).  </p>

The parents used to live, and the father currently lives, in relatively rural Western Australia, not in a city where Dr Ratnam expected that the relevant mental health services would be found.  She has no immediate means of financial support in Australia. I have doubts about the efficacy of the non-specific proposal of the father that the mother could benefit from the state &#8216;Medicare&#8217; services.  I see the risks to the mother&#8217;s mental health as very real, and the proposed protective measures insufficiently focused on her actual needs.  There are additional question marks over the extent of her social support network in Australia; she has apparently fallen out with her only family there, and I am satisfied that she will not wish to access support from the father&#8217;s parents who may well have contributed to problems which the mother experienced when she lived in Australia.  Her friendship group in Australia has largely fallen silent recently.  The father&#8217;s offer of support for CBT or other therapy is very much time-limited, whereas the mother plainly needs some reasonably long-term and intensive help.  On the information presented at this hearing, there is a real risk that the mother would fall between the cracks of mental health services.  </p>

Having regard to those matters in combination, I am left in no real doubt that a return of A to Australia at this point in his life would be likely to have a significant deleterious impact on the mental health of this mother, which would be likely in my judgment to impact on her ability to parent him.  In turn, this gives rise to the grave risk that A would be caused psychological harm.  Although A is, himself, a strong protective factor against rash action on the part of the mother (she told Dr Ratnam: &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t have him (A), I would not be here right now&#8221;), Dr Ratnam could not rule out that (if she is faced with a return) those passive feelings of hopelessness could escalate, as they did in the past, leading to suicidal ideation.  I further assess as &#8216;grave&#8217; the risk that a return would cause such a deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental state that she would find herself &#8211; as Dr Ratnam at least contemplated &#8211; hospitalised; this would place A in an &#8216;intolerable situation&#8217;.

I note that indirect contact has not been easy to achieve, perhaps particularly given A&#8217;s age and the parties&#8217; difficult relationship, and this needs to be addressed urgently; the onus is on the mother.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note that the mother had written to the father in September 2022 &#8220;I need him and he needs me. Doesn't take away from you, but you and him don't need one another like we do&#8221;, and I am concerned by the mother&#8217;s comment to her GP (reported to Dr Ratnam) in December 2022, that &#8220;she did not want her ex-partner to be part of her son&#8217;s life&#8221;.  I had wondered aloud during the course of submissions whether this is what the case is all about, but Ms Chokowry was emphatic (on specific instructions) that this is not so.  Miss Chokowry made clear, again on instructions, that the mother wishes the father to play as full a part in A&#8217;s life as possible.  I accept the mother&#8217;s assurance in this respect (indeed, I could see the mother nodding her confirmation of this assertion while her counsel was making these submissions), which I trust will be repeated in any substantive welfare hearing, and then acted on.</p>
