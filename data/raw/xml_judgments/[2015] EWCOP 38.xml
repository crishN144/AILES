	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This reserved judgment is delivered following a hearing of three cases in which the Health Service Executive of Ireland (&#8220;the HSE&#8221;) seeks orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> of and Schedule 3 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>&#8221;) recognising and enforcing orders by the Irish High Court for the detention of three young persons (&#8220;PA&#8221;, &#8220;PB&#8221;, and &#8220;PC&#8221;) at a special unit known as St Andrew&#8217;s in Northampton. The proceedings raise a number of issues about the scope and interpretation of Schedule 3. When it became known that applications in the cases of PA and PB were coming before the Court, raising very similar issues, a joint hearing was arranged, and directions given, including an invitation to the Official Solicitor to act as Advocate to the Court and to the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health to participate in the proceedings. The former invitation was accepted, the latter was declined, although the Ministry of Justice wrote a letter setting out some views on the legal and policy issues arising in the proceedings, to which I shall refer below. Subsequently the case of PC, in which I had earlier made an order under Schedule 3 without hearing extensive legal argument, was listed for review at the same hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PA was born on 24<span style="font-size:7pt">th </span>October 1996. He had an extremely troubled childhood and mental health difficulties which manifested themselves from an early age.<span style="font-size:7pt"/>On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2010, he was placed in emergency voluntary foster care and thereafter moved placements within Ireland on no less than twenty occasions. Each placement broke down due to his challenging behaviour. An Irish care order was granted in respect of him on 3<span style="font-size:7pt">rd </span>March 2011 because of his escalating problematic behaviour and criminal activity, as a result of which PA was considered to be a risk to himself and others, and he was placed in a special care unit. Continuing concerns were raised about his behaviour, including threats to harm others and himself and statements that he was bored of assaulting people and would like to see someone murdered. It was then decided to move PA to a privately run secure care unit in Scotland but that unit felt unable to work with him as a result of his levels of aggression and non-cooperation. Instead, he was referred to St Andrew&#8217;s Healthcare in Northampton.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2011, PA was transferred to St Andrew&#8217;s pursuant to an order granted by Birmingham J in the Irish Court on 30<span style="font-size:7pt">th </span>September 2011. Prior to the order being made, the procedure under Article 56 of Council Regulation 2201/2203 (&#8216;Brussels IIR&#8217;) was undertaken and the requisite consent obtained from Northamptonshire County Council. All parties to the ongoing proceedings before the Irish Court<span style="font-size:7pt"/>were in agreement that PA&#8217;s placement at St Andrew&#8217;s was in his best welfare interests. On arrival at St Andrew&#8217;s, he was admitted under the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>&#8217;). On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2011, his detention was reviewed by the First-Tier Tribunal (Mental Health). The tribunal discharged PA from section. Whilst noting that PA undoubtedly required assessment in hospital and declaring themselves satisfied that he would pose a risk to others were he not in hospital, the tribunal considered that detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> was neither warranted nor justified because, in essence, PA was detained at St Andrew&#8217;s by virtue of the Irish order.</p>

For a prolonged period thereafter, he remained extremely difficult to manage and engage in treatment and his behaviour was defiant and frequently violent. At one stage, he had to be secured and nursed on a 3:1 ratio in a separate ward from his peers to protect them from serious injury. He was also for a sustained period of time highly resistant to treatment and intervention.  In the course of 2014, however, PA became more open to intervention and treatment and thereafter he has managed to maintain himself on risk level 4. This allows him to have some escorted trips into the community. In particular, he has been able to return to Ireland for the first time since he went to Scotland in May 2011, and as a result attended the High Court in Ireland on 7<span style="font-size:7pt">th </span>October 2014 and visited his family home on 20<span style="font-size:7pt">th </span>October 2014.</p>

In the view of Dr Kelleher, the psychiatrist responsible for providing mental health services for people in his local area in Ireland, there are no facilities in the Republic of Ireland for PA which would replicate those available at St Andrew&#8217;s. It is therefore the view of the HSE that his interests are best served by him remaining in St Andrew's for another period of time, subject to regular reviews. The intention of the HSE is that PA will ultimately return to Ireland and his case will continue to be kept under review by the High Court in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst PA has expressed his willingness, in principle, to remaining at St Andrew&#8217;s for a further period of time, his compliance is of relatively recent standing. The orders made by Birmingham J when PA was a child expired upon his majority, as did the consequential &#8216;domesticated&#8217; order in England and Wales. The HSE therefore took steps to obtain an order from the High Court in Ireland under its inherent jurisdiction in respect of vulnerable adults providing for his continued placement and treatment at St Andrew&#8217;s for a period of time pending his return to Ireland. In that order, dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2014 (i.e. the day before his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday), the President of the Irish High Court recorded his findings, inter alia, that PA was suffering from a serious personality disorder accompanied by &#8216;bipolarism&#8217; which continued to require treatment at St Andrew&#8217;s; that his illness was of a kind and degree that was likely to continue after his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and require a period of compulsory treatment; that on the evidence of his treating clinician at St Andrew&#8217;s he met the criteria for detention in England under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>; and that PA &#8220;owing to an impairment of his personal faculties cannot protect his own interests&#8221;. The order recorded that the Court was satisfied that there was no suitable facility available within the jurisdiction of the Irish Court and that St Andrew&#8217;s was a suitable institution for the purposes of providing treatment to him.

At that hearing, the Court also received evidence from various clinicians treating PA in Ireland and England. Senior Counsel on his behalf argued that, on the evidence, PA had capacity to make material decisions as to his residence and care, including his medical treatment; that, if it was correct that he had bipolar affective disorder so as to warrant detention under the Irish Mental Health Act, he should be detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> and not at St Andrew&#8217;s; that on the medical evidence his condition did not warrant such detention; that the real reason why his detention was sought was because of his personality disorder; that Irish legislation had prohibited detention in such circumstances and that to use the inherent jurisdiction for such purposes would violate the doctrine of the separation of powers; and, in the alternative, if the inherent jurisdiction was available, it should only be used in exceptional circumstances and this case did not warrant such action. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her judgment dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015, however, Ms Justice O&#8217;Hanlon rejected these submissions made on PA&#8217;s behalf. She found that PA was, and had been at all material times, habitually resident in Ireland. While she accepted that PA had capacity to make decisions as to his residence, she found that he lacked the capacity to make material decisions as to his medical treatment and therapy, and specifically to weigh up the &#8220;therapeutic pros and cons&#8221; of staying at St Andrew&#8217;s versus therapy in an Irish treatment centre. She concluded that his best interests and personal rights under the Irish Constitution were endangered so that the intervention of the Court was necessitated. She therefore found that PA required in his own interests to be detained and treated at St Andrew&#8217;s for the purposes of overseeing an orderly transition to an appropriate placement in Ireland; recommended the formation of a committee of doctors to oversee his transition to Ireland and to advise how and when such transition is to be effected; provided that PA&#8217;s guardian ad litem in the Irish proceedings should remain involved in the case to assist PA in the transition back to Ireland; and held that the case should be reviewed  by the Irish High Court at least every month to assist PA&#8217;s transition back to that country. Following that judgment, O&#8217;Hanlon J made an order in similar terms to that made on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2014, reciting inter alia (a) that PA remained habitually resident in Ireland; (b) that he continued to suffer from a serious personality disorder accompanied by bipolarism which continued to require treatment at St Andrew&#8217;s; (c) that, owing to an impairment of his personal faculties, he cannot protect his own interests; (d) that on the evidence of his treating clinician at St Andrew&#8217;s he met the criteria for detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 3</ref> of the English <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>; (e) that his best interests and personal rights under the Irish Constitution were endangered and the intervention of the Court was necessary; (f) that his illness is of a kind and degree that continued to require a period of compulsory confinement for the purposes of alleviating his symptoms through therapeutic means in order to facilitate his transition back to Ireland; (g) that there was no suitable facility available within the jurisdiction of the Irish Court and (h) that St Andrew&#8217;s was a suitable institution for the purposes of providing treatment to him. The Court therefore authorised the HSE to continue to place PA at St Andrew&#8217;s until further order &#8220;for the purpose of receiving treatment there, together with any welfare and therapeutic services, for the purpose of ensuring an orderly transition to an appropriate placement in Ireland&#8221;, and adjourned the case to a further hearing on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. Subsequently, that order has been renewed in further orders, the current order being dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May which provides that the case be listed for review on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July.

She currently has a diagnosis of mixed disorder of conduct and emotions, and now she is an adult is thought likely to be diagnosable with a personality disorder. She first came into contact with mental health services in Ireland in December 2011 when she was admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt. There is evidence that she may have been abused by a member of her family. PB has been cared for in psychiatric institutions since 2012 and has required at least 1:1 supervision for much of that time, to prevent her from self-harming or attempting suicide. Between 15 October 2012 and 13 November 2013, she was detained in hospital in Ireland pursuant to Irish mental health legislation. As in the case of PA, it was subsequently decided that she should be placed at St Andrew&#8217;s in Northampton and orders of the Irish High Court authorising KW&#8217;s placement at St Andrew&#8217;s were made, and subsequently registered and recognised in this jurisdiction pursuant to Brussels IIR.</p>

Unfortunately, when she returned to St Andrew&#8217;s after that visit, there was a deterioration in her mental state which she said was triggered by her not being happy at home, and she made a number of serious attempts to take her life. The clinicians responsible for PB&#8217;s treatment at St Andrew&#8217;s considered that, on reaching 18, she should be transferred to a low secure unit which they manage. It was anticipated that she would continue to require treatment for at least another six months. As in PA&#8217;s case, it was the view of the clinicians that no similar facility was available in Ireland. </p>

At a hearing on 12 January 2015, the Court expressed the preliminary view that PB lacked capacity to make decisions about her care and treatment. At a hearing on 22 January 2015, at which PB was represented through her Guardian, Ms Justice O&#8217;Hanlon made a detailed order which included inter alia declarations that PB is habitually resident in Ireland and that she needed specialised care, therapeutic and welfare services, the effective provision of which require that she be detained temporarily in a secure place, and which were not currently available in that jurisdiction, and authorised PB&#8217;s continued detention at St Andrew&#8217;s Healthcare following her 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday for a period of three weeks, during which a full assessment of her capacity to make decisions about her care and treatment would be obtained.

Further interim orders were made in the Irish Court by Ms Justice O&#8217;Hanlon on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February. A psychiatrist expressed the opinion in evidence that PB had capacity to conduct litigation (and as a result before this Court has instructed her lawyers directly on the same basis as PA). On that latter day, a full hearing took place, after which the learned judge reserved judgment. Thus at the date of the hearing before me on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, the judgment from the Irish Court was outstanding, and furthermore at that point there had been no determination by the Irish Court on the issue of capacity. In the event, the judgment was delivered on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. O&#8217;Hanlon J held inter alia that PB failed to appreciate the seriousness of her condition; that she lacked the capacity to make material decisions as regards her medical treatment and therapy; that she is and remains habitually resident in Ireland; that her best interests required that she returned to Ireland in accordance with her wishes; that the transition should be managed in a safe and secure way, within a three-month time span or earlier if the medical teams so agreed, and to that end she should receive such therapeutic treatment and medication as advised by her treating psychiatrist at St Andrew&#8217;s; and that, upon her return, she should be detained under the inherent jurisdiction of the Irish Court as a psychiatric patient in a hospital in County Clare. The terms of that judgment were incorporated into an order dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. At the hearing on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, O&#8217;Hanlon J ordered that PB be returned to Ireland &#8220;as soon as possible having regard to medical advice and not later than 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015&#8221;, that upon her return she should be detained as a psychiatric patient in a hospital in County Clare and pending her return she should be detained at St Andrew&#8217;s. The matter was adjourned again until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April. I understand that the HSE, PB and PB&#8217;s guardian ad litem have filed notices of appeal against that order; that an application by the HSE for a stay of the order was refused on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, but that a further application for a stay has now been made on different grounds. Pending appeal, the order made following the judgment on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, perfected on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, remains in force.

He has a past history of ADHD,  substance misuse, difficulties with language comprehension, conduct disorders and aggressive unpredictable behaviour putting himself and others at risk. On occasions, he has also exhibited sexualised behaviour in public and in private. Until the end of 2012, he was a voluntary patient at a hospital in Dublin but his treating psychiatrist concluded that his demands were such that a transfer to St Andrew&#8217;s hospital in Northampton was necessary. On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2012, when PC was just 18 years old, the Irish High Court (Birmingham J) declared and ordered under its inherent jurisdiction that (a) he lacked the capacity to make proper and reasoned judgments as to his welfare; (b) he was a habitual resident of the Republic of Ireland; (c) he was in need of special care  therapeutic and welfare services, the effective provision of which required that he be detained on an interlocutory basis in a secure place and which were not currently available in Ireland; (d) that the HSE be permitted to remove PC from Ireland and  place him in the care of the director of St Andrew&#8217;s Northampton; and (e) that the director of St Andrew&#8217;s be permitted to detain PC at the unit pending further order. The learned judge made further orders to facilitate the transition of PC to St Andrew&#8217;s.

By the end of 2014, however, it was concluded that he had made sufficient progress to be moved into a low secure unit. The facilities at Northampton, however, did not include a suitable unit and the decision was therefore taken to apply to the Irish Court for an order permitting his transfer to a low secure unit run by St Andrew&#8217;s in Birmingham. On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2015, therefore, Abbott J in the Irish High Court made an order repeating the declarations as to capacity etc made by Birmingham J in 2012, and further ordering that the HSE be permitted to transfer him to the unit in Birmingham and detain him there temporarily pending further order of the Court. The order was adjourned until 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. At a hearing before me on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, I appointed PC&#8217;s guardian ad litem from the Irish proceedings to act as litigation friend in the English proceedings. I recognised Abbott J&#8217;s order and declared it enforceable. Knowing, however, of the issues that had arisen in the cases of PA and PB, I directed that PC&#8217;s case be listed for review at the hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, and gave ancillary directions including for service of the papers upon the Official Solicitor with a request that he consider whether he wished to appear as Advocate to the Court in the proceedings in respect of PC as well as in the other cases. Subsequently, PC was transferred to the facility in Birmingham on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February, and the Official Solicitor duly consented to act as Advocate to the Court in relation to PC&#8217;s case, as well as the other two cases already listed. At a subsequent hearing on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, the Irish Court adjourned the matter again, and provided that the order of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February should remain in force until 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June. In PC&#8217;s case, therefore, the order of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February remains in force but, having listed it for review at the hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>March, I have the power to review my decision to recognise and enforce that order having heard full argument on the wider issues.  </p>

PC indicated that he would prefer that his Irish guardian ad litem continues to act as his litigation friend, or perhaps in some other capacity as his advocate. In the light of the expert opinion as to PC&#8217;s capacity, however, I made an order at the conclusion of the hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March discharging the Irish guardian ad litem as PC&#8217;s litigation friend.

They submit that Parliament must be taken to have accepted that there will be circumstances in which the Court of Protection will be required to recognise and enforce protective measures taken by states which are not parties to the Convention but did not identify any additional steps that the Court is required to take in relation to such measures. They submit that the Court must therefore take care when considering any application for recognition and enforcement of a protective measure emanating from a non-Convention state so as to ensure that the construction of Schedule 3 which it adopts remains consistent with that required so as to continue to give effect to the Convention. It would not be permissible to identify one rule for 2000 Convention states and another for non-Convention states.</p>

Mr Rees submits that there is a clear distinction to be drawn between cases where sovereign states have both signed up to a regulation or convention based upon mutual recognition of agreed and accepted principles, and under which both enter into mutual and reciprocal obligations, and cases where the United Kingdom has unilaterally taken it upon itself to recognise orders from any foreign state. He submits that the Court of Protection should therefore take a more cautious approach generally to the recognition and enforcement of protective measures from states which have not  ratified the Convention. Such an approach is, he submits, not incompatible with the UK&#8217;s obligations under the Convention. Whilst the overall framework of Schedule 3 applies in both Convention and non-Convention cases, issues of public policy may lead the Court to reach different conclusions in the two types of cases, even if the underlying factual matrix in each case is superficially similar. </p>

I do not accept that the Courts of England and Wales should automatically adopt a more cautious approach when asked to recognise and enforce an order of a non-Convention state. Each case will turn on its own facts, to which this Court must apply the provisions of the Schedule, in particular the provisions as to recognition in paragraph 19 including the grounds on which recognition may be refused. Plainly the Courts of England and Wales will have proper regard to the general principles of comity in all cases, although a greater degree of caution may be required when considering orders made by certain countries. Given the close similarities between the legal systems of England and Wales and the Republic of Ireland, however, I anticipate that the circumstances in which the Court will find cause to exercise its discretion to refuse to recognise protective measures in orders of the Irish Courts will be rare, notwithstanding the fact that Ireland (like England and Wales) has yet to ratify the Convention.</p>

These are naturally those who need protection but, to make this need quite clear, the Commission purposefully avoided in this paragraph using juridical terms, such as &#8220;incapable party&#8221;, which have different meanings depending on the law being considered. It was therefore judged preferable to keep to a factual description of the adult in need of protection. The text contains two factual elements. The first is that of an &#8220;impairment or insufficiency of [the] personal faculties&#8221; of the adult&#8230; The [second is that the] [insufficiency or impairment of the personal faculties of the adult must be such that he or she is not &#8220;in a position to protect [his or her] interests&#8221;.

On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees submits that a finding that a person has been held to lack capacity under the law of one country does not mean that he should be held to lack capacity under the law of another because a finding as to capacity is not simply a finding of fact and thus is outwith Schedule 3 paragraph 21.  The Explanatory Report makes it clear, however, that the scheme of the Convention, reflected in the Schedule, is to focus on the factual description of the adult rather than any legal test as to capacity. </p>

In PA&#8217;s case, the order of the Irish Court was expressly made on the basis of a declaration that the subject was a person who, by reason of an impairment or insufficiency of their personal faculties, was not in the position to protect their interests. This is therefore a finding expressed in the terms almost identical to those of the Convention and Schedule 3 to the MCA. In the cases of PB and PC, the Irish Court has declared, on the basis of expert psychiatric evidence, that each lacks the capacity to make &#8220;material decisions&#8221; (in the case of PB) or &#8220;an informed decision&#8221; (in the case of PC) as regards their medical treatment. In each case, this amounts to a factual finding that each was a person who, by reason of an impairment or insufficiency of their personal faculties, was not in the position to protect their interests. Each of these findings, relied on by the Irish Courts when taking the protective measures, is binding on this Court by virtue of paragraph 21 of the Schedule. In this case, even if the finding was not binding, I would conclude, on the basis of all the information before the Court, that each comes within the scope of paragraph 4(1).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of PA, however, Ms Curtis invites this Court to look behind the decision of the Irish Court and carry out its own assessments as to habitual residence. That assessment must be carried out as at the date of the hearing, as confirmed by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re O (Court of Protection: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/3932" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 3932" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 3932 (COP)</ref>.  Ms Curtis submits that, for paragraph 19 to serve a legal purpose, this Court must be permitted to at least consider the situation as it appears on the face of the papers. Ms Curtis submits that the key fact is that PA has been physically present in England since October 2011 and that the Irish Court&#8217;s declaration does not therefore sit easily with the factual position as it is known to be at the date of hearing before me in March 2015. Ms Curtis accepts that PA wishes to return to Ireland but submits that the fact that he does not wish to be in England is not inconsistent with his being habitually resident here, nor has it prevented him, for example, meeting the test for habitual residence required for the purpose of receiving means-tested benefits in this country which he has apparently been claiming. Ms Curtis submits that the factual matrix of PA having been physically present in England for more than three years in a manner which is neither temporary nor intermittent is highly persuasive of the fact that he is habitually resident in this country. She argues that this should prompt examination of whether paragraph 21 of Schedule 3 can compel this Court to accept that PA is habitually resident in Ireland simply on the basis that the Irish Court has declared him so to be. She contends that paragraph 21 &#8220;should not operate as a blindfold to the Court&#8221;. In oral argument, she asked whether it could be right that this Court, tasked with the responsibility of recognising and enforcing an order which has the consequence of a deprivation of liberty, should be barred from looking at the facts relied on in the other jurisdiction in determining habitual residence. As I understood his oral submissions, Mr Rees seemed to give support to this proposition, notwithstanding what was said in his written document. He suggested that, even if the foreign Court has made an order on the basis that the individual was habitually resident there, it would not stop the English Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction concluding that the individual was habitually resident here.</p>

The measure &#8220;is to be recognised&#8221; if taken on the grounds that the individual was habitually resident in the country where the order containing the measure was made. The grounds on which a measure may be challenged may be procedural (paragraph 19(3)) or substantive (paragraph 19 (4). By reason of paragraph 21, however, which as stated above provides that for the purposes of paragraphs 19 and 20 any finding of fact relied on when the measure was taken is conclusive, there is no power to challenge the finding made in the foreign Court that the individual is habitually resident in that country. Accordingly, a finding of a foreign Court that the individual concerned was habitually resident in that country cannot be challenged in any process to recognise or enforce a measure in this country, although the process by which the measure was ordered may be challenged (for example, if the individual was not given an opportunity to be heard) and the measure itself may be challenged (for example, if inconsistent with a mandatory provision of law of this country). I therefore conclude that the finding of the Irish Court as to the habitual residence of PA, PB and PC cannot be challenged in this Court.</p>

PA, PB and PC are all in this country on a temporary basis for the purposes of treatment, each hoping to return to Ireland at the earliest opportunity, and their cases are subject to regular review by the Irish Court to determine whether the adult concerned should return or remain for the time being in this country. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3), quoted above, gives the Court a discretionary power to refuse to recognise a protective measure if certain procedural safeguards are not met. It is plain from the way in which Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3) is drafted that the Court only has a discretion to decline to recognise a foreign order if all three of the conditions in the subparagraph are satisfied. In other words, the Court only has a discretion to disapply a measure in a foreign order if it &#8220;thinks&#8221; that the case in which the measure was taken was not urgent <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> the adult was not given the opportunity to be heard <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice. On behalf of PB, Ms Weereratne QC underlines the use of the word &#8220;thinks&#8221; in paragraph 19(3) &#8211; and, indeed, in paragraph 19(4) &#8211; and submits that by using this word Parliament has set the bar relatively low. For my part, however, I interpret the word &#8220;thinks&#8221; as meaning &#8220;concludes on a balance of probabilities&#8221; rather than any lower standard such as &#8220;has reasonable grounds for believing&#8221;. </p>

On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees asks whether the provision of a guardian ad litem is sufficient in circumstances where the person in question is already subject to a placement in this country, and thus cannot travel to discuss his case or give evidence before the Court, a fortiori if there are language difficulties. He asks further whether the imposition of a guardian ad litem in the Irish proceedings was sufficient to give the individual in each case the necessary opportunity to be heard within those proceedings, given that there is no evidence before this Court as to the basis of proceedings on which a guardian ad litem is appointed for an adult in Ireland, or the role of such a guardian once appointed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No doubt, there may be cases in which the Court will wish to scrutinise carefully the extent to which the adult has been given the opportunity to be heard in proceedings in the foreign country. In this case, however, having read the documents filed in these proceedings emanating from the Irish Court, I see no grounds on which it could possibly be said that any of the three individuals was not given a full and proper opportunity to be heard in the Irish proceedings. The system in Ireland is very similar &#8211; indeed, in some ways almost identical &#8211; to that which is in operation in this country. Each adult was represented by a guardian ad litem and by Counsel. Furthermore, as Ms Curtis acknowledges, PA was given an opportunity to participate in the Irish case by video link. In all the circumstances, I am entirely satisfied that all three adults in these proceedings were given ample opportunity to be heard in the Irish proceedings.</p>

Both Mr Rees on behalf of the Official Solicitor and Ms Curtis on behalf of PA draw attention to the fact that the circumstances in which the order was made in respect of PA on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015 could not be described as &#8220;urgent&#8221; given that he has been in England since 2011. Mr Rees makes a similar point in respect of PB, given the length of time in which her proceedings have been continuing. It may be right that neither case could be described as &#8220;urgent&#8221;, but the fact that each was given the opportunity to be heard precludes the exercise of the discretionary power invested in this Court under paragraph 19(3). It is conceivable that circumstances may arise in another case in which the making of orders where no urgency exists could be open to challenge on public policy grounds under paragraph 19(4). It was not suggested, however, that those circumstances arise in this case.</p>

In addition, however, it is argued that there are further grounds upon which recognition of the measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy over and above the extent to which it is inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the law of England and Wales. It therefore makes sense to consider the impact of sub-sub-paragraph (b) before sub-sub-paragraph (a).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees observed that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.6</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Right Act 1998</ref> and the ECHR are mandatory provisions of the law of England and Wales. To satisfy Article 5(1) of the ECHR, any measure purporting to deprive PA, PB or PC of their liberty must meet the criteria established by the authorities of the European Court, in particular those identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Winterwerp v Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1979) 2 EHRR 387" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1979">(1979) 2 EHRR 387</ref>. In that decision, the European Court held that, except in emergencies, depriving the liberty of someone of unsound mind can only be lawful under Article 5(1)(e) if three minimal conditions are satisfied &#8211; (1) the authority responsible for the deprivation of liberty must establish through objective medical expertise that the person is of unsound mind; (2) it must be established that the mental disorder is a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; (3) the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of mental disorder. Mr Rees submits that at present there is no basis upon which this Court could assess whether the measure satisfied those criteria. Although, in this case, the HSE has disclosed the evidence that was placed before the Irish Court, there is no fixed procedure in statute or the rules of Court to require such evidence to be filed. Furthermore, paragraph 21 of Schedule 3 effectively prevents any review of whether the circumstances meet those criteria. The Court of Protection in this country will have no way of ensuring that the reviews of the person&#8217;s detention, which are an integral aspect of the regime required by Article 5(4), are in fact being carried out in the foreign jurisdiction, or that the person in question will be represented or supported through that process. The mere fact that the foreign order purports to provide for reviews would not be sufficient in any event. Even if a review by a foreign Court was potentially capable of satisfying the UK&#8217;s obligations under ECHR, the Court of Protection would need to go behind the face of the order and enquire as to the real substance of any review procedures in order to be satisfied that the mandatory provisions of the law of England and Wales are being followed. Mr Rees submits that, in most cases, it would therefore follow that the protections afforded to the person in question by Article 5, as interpreted and supplemented by the European and domestic case law, are not met. </p>

The lack of any provision within the Court of Protection Rules 2007 for cases under Schedule 3 means that there is no guarantee that persons who are the subject of such orders will be joined as parties to applications for recognition under the Schedule. The Official Solicitor submits that representation of the person who is the subject of such an order by a foreign guardian may raise issues as to whether the &#8220;demanding standards&#8221; required of a system of representation (as stipulated by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X and others (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/37" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 37</ref>) are satisfied.  Mr Rees further points out that, in so far as the Irish orders (in particular, the order in PB&#8217;s case) purport to confer on the HSE and St Andrew&#8217;s wide powers to consent to matters on  behalf of the detained person and to provide medical and other treatment, the order deprives the individual of a substantial amount of personal autonomy across a range of matters and may, therefore, infringe rights under Article 8. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the Court must consider whether the individual&#8217;s right to challenge their detention under Article 5(4) is effective. Two requirements of that provision arise in the context of a person detained on the basis of unsoundness of mind, namely (1) the right to take proceedings to challenge the basis upon which they are detained and (2) the right to regular reviews of their detention. The Court should consider whether it is satisfied that, in recognising and declaring enforceable only protective measures, it is acting compatibly with both aspects of this right under Article 5(4). If, and to the extent that, the Court considers that it needs to look &#8220;upstream&#8221; to the foreign jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the individual&#8217;s rights under Article 5(4) are secured, the Court may properly do so. In the present cases, the decisions have been made by judges of the Irish High Court in proceedings in which the individuals have each been represented by Senior Counsel instructed by a guardian ad litem. Extensive safeguards have in fact been included in the relevant Irish orders to ensure that the positions of all three adults are looked at on a very regular basis by the Irish High Court. They point out that these reviews will be much more frequent than that currently proposed under the regime for reviewing deprivations of liberty in this country; cf <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X and Others (Deprivation of Liberty)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/25" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 25" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 25</ref>.

Counsel for the HSE submits that for the purposes of Article 5, the English Court is &#8220;interjected&#8221; between the foreign order and the detention in this country. Mr Setright and his juniors submit that an individual detained on the basis of a &#8220;domesticated&#8221; foreign order would not therefore have to seek to challenge that detention in the foreign Court but could, instead, apply in the first instance to this Court.

Once again, however, they submit, in line with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">X v Latvia</span>, that the Court of Protection must be careful to approach this question on the basis that it is necessary to ensure the &#8220;combined and harmonious application&#8221; of the ECHR and the purposes of the 2000 Convention as set out in its preamble and reflected in Schedule 3 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.

She submits that this provision requires the Court to consider the effect of the foreign order which, she submits, is in effect that of a welfare order under section 16(2)(a) if it makes provision for care and treatment on behalf of an incapacitated person. She submits that this is the true point of connection between paragraph 19 and section 16(2)(a) and that Mostyn J was wrong to hold otherwise. If there is a clear inconsistency between the measure to be enforced under principle of English law, the Court must consider the use of its discretionary powers or the implementation of the placement must be governed by the English law. Thus, for example, the detention and compulsory treatment of the mental disorder of an objecting patient in a secure psychiatric institution in England is governed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>.

Secondly, this rather technical reason is justified as reflecting the policy of the  Schedule and of Part 4, namely ensuring the persons who lack capacity have their best interests and their affairs dealt with in the country of habitual residence; to decide otherwise would be to defeat that purpose. Thirdly, best interests in the implementation of an order clearly are relevant and dealt with by paragraph 12 which otherwise would not really be necessary.&#8221;</p>

Schedule 3 paragraph 19 operates beyond the scope of the 2000 Convention, placing a qualified obligation on the Court of Protection to recognise and enforce orders made by a foreign court irrespective of whether that foreign country has entered into a mutual or reciprocal obligation to recognise orders of this Court, or has signed up to the principles outlined in the preamble to the Convention.

He asks, rhetorically, that if such evidence is not admitted, how is the Court of Protection to distinguish between an order for detention that is &#8220;oppressive and tyrannical&#8221; and one that is not?</p>

Ms Weereratne argues that, as a broad proposition, a procedure such as that in part 4 of Schedule 3 which mandates the recognition and enforcement of such orders by foreign Courts by this Court, with limited powers of review or scrutiny, must be of concern, not only to this Court, but to the public as a whole. Any effective scrutiny process must enable the Court to hear or direct evidence on points of law, whether substantive or procedural, that are of concern. Mr Rees acknowledges, however, that the public policy grounds for recognising and enforcing a protective measure made by a foreign state are far stronger where there is an expectation that the Courts of that state will reciprocate in relation to protective measures emanating from the Courts of this country by reason of the fact that both countries are bound by their ratification of an international instrument, such as Brussels IIR.</p>

It is entirely possible on the facts of each matter that a domestic Court would have taken a different approach or even found itself to lack jurisdiction, given the difference in the scope of the &#8220;domestic&#8221; element of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (per <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref>) compared to Sch 3&#8230;That recognition is nevertheless possible despite differences between the domestic approach and the approach of foreign Courts and their laws seems to us to be precisely what Parliament must have intended in enacting Sch 3.</p>

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">Inevitably, there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But taking account of such concerns is surely the purpose of the public policy review and the mandatory law rule. Although there should be no general review of the merits of the case, as is usual in private international law instruments of this type, equally the Court <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> entitled to review merits <span style="font-style:italic">to the extent that it is necessary</span> to do so in order to establish whether the measure complies with Sch 3 (for example, the &#8220;fit&#8221; of the measure with the criteria in paragraph 19).</p>

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">We do not consider that the fact that detention may not be reviewable by a domestic Court is a public policy objection <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>. It is clear from the order of the Irish High Court that there is a very sophisticated and tightly drawn system for rapid review by that Court of PA&#8217;s situation on a regular basis, and in particular if his situation should change&#8230;That seems to us sufficient to meet the requirements for review under A.5 ECHR. That article, as of course those involved with this case will be entirely aware, requires that review of detention be available, adequate, undertaken by an independent tribunal to which the detained person has access, and speedy. In this case, a fresh order also seems to be required on a regular basis and would presumably require recognition in this jurisdiction on each occasion. Should PA wish to challenge the order placing him at St Andrew&#8217;s or any aspect of it, it seems to us that he not only has the opportunity to raise the matter with the Irish Court but also to challenge (or have challenged on his behalf if not litigation capacitous) recognition in this jurisdiction should the grounds to do so exist. In particular, given the likelihood that in many cases the impairment or insufficiency in the adult&#8217;s personal faculties will fluctuate, we would have thought that it should be possible for that adult to challenge an <span style="font-style:italic">existing</span> recognition order on the basis of such a change if that goes to the criteria for refusal of recognition, although normally we would expect the challenge to be to the underlying foreign order.</p>

This approach is specifically anticipated in the 2000 Convention (A.29(1), A.30(a), referring to the role of Central Authorities in promoting co-operation between &#8220;competent authorities&#8221; which in this context would of course be the Courts of England and Wales (not Ireland) but that does not seem to us to prevent such communication. Clearly, the content of the order will be a matter for the judge in the requesting jurisdiction, but discussion regarding concerns of the requested jurisdiction may lead to adjustment of the order to the satisfaction of all and thus consequent recognition.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, by including Schedule 3 in the MCA, Parliament authorised a system of recognition and enforcement of foreign orders notwithstanding the fact that the approach of the foreign courts and laws to these issues may be different to that of the domestic court. These differences may extend not only to the way in which the individual is treated but also to questions of jurisprudence and capacity. Thus the fact that there are provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that appear to conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state should not by itself lead to a refusal to recognise or enforce the foreign order. Given that Parliament has included <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> and Schedule 3 within the MCA, clearly intending to facilitate recognition and enforcement in such circumstances, it cannot be the case that those other provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that seemingly conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state are mandatory provisions of the laws of England and Wales so as to justify the English Court refusing to recognise the foreign order on grounds of such inconsistency. In such circumstances, it is only where the Court concludes that recognition of the foreign measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy that the discretionary ground to refuse recognition will arise. Furthermore, in conducting the public policy review, the Court must always bear in mind, in the words of Munby LJ that &#8220;the test is stringent, the bar is set high&#8221;. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, there is likely to be a wide variety in the decisions made under foreign laws that are put forward for recognition under Schedule 3. As the Ministry of Justice has observed, inevitably there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But as the Ministry also observes, taking account of such concerns is surely the purpose of the public policy review. Although no wide-ranging review as to the merits of the foreign measure is either necessary or appropriate, a limited review will always be required as indicated by the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pellegrini</span>. That will be sufficient to identify any cases where the content and form of the foreign measure, and the processes by which it was taken, are objectionable. It also seems to me that the circumstances in which Schedule 3 is likely to be invoked, and the number of countries whose orders are presented for recognition, are likely to be limited. In oral submissions, Mr Rees pointed out that, in theory, the Court could be faced with applications to recognise and enforce orders from any country in the world, including, for example, North Korea or Iran. That may be right in theory, but common sense suggests it is, to say the least, unlikely in practice, at least in the foreseeable future. And if such orders were to be presented for recognition, the public policy review would surely lead swiftly to identifying grounds on which recognition would be refused. It is much more likely that the orders presented for recognition will be those of foreign countries whose legal systems, laws and procedures are closely aligned to our own. Concerns of this nature can be addressed by admitting evidence of the process by which the foreign protective measures were made and general evidence relating to the legal system of the state that made the order. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, most orders presented for recognition are likely to be of short duration, and/or in respect of persons whose capacity may fluctuate, and/or who are in receipt of a progressive form of treatment. As a result, in such cases there is likely to be repeated requests to scrutinise a succession of orders. Recognition and enforcement is likely to require close co-operation, not only between the medical and social care authorities of the two countries, but also between the Courts and legal systems. The Convention provides a mechanism using the Central Authorities but, pending ratification of the Convention, there may well be the need for direct communication between judges of the two jurisdictions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning back to the facts of the present cases, I adopt the approach proposed by Mr Setright, Mr Ruck Keene and Ms Butler-Cole that this Court should conduct a limited review to satisfy itself that the Irish orders comply with the ECHR, and in doing so should strive to achieve a combined and harmonious application of the provisions of the two international instruments. I accept their submission that, when considering applications to recognise and enforce compulsory psychiatric placements under Schedule 3, the limited review should encompass the Court being satisfied that (1) the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Winterwerp</span> criteria are met and (2) that the individual&#8217;s right to challenge the detention under Article 5(4) is effective (i.e. that they have a right to take proceedings to challenge the detention and the right to regular reviews thereafter). </p>

Furthermore, as Mr Setright observes, the decisions in these cases have been made by judges of the Irish High Court in proceedings in which the individuals have each been represented by Senior Counsel instructed by a guardian ad litem, and extensive safeguards have been included in the Irish orders to ensure that regular reviews take place. Although the orders, in particular the order in PB&#8217;s case, does, as the Official Solicitor submits, vest in the HSE and St Andrew&#8217;s powers to consent and make arrangements for treatment, the fact that the Irish orders are subject to regular reviews by the Irish Court at which the individual will be represented ensures, to my mind, that Article 8 rights are not infringed. I therefore conclude that the Irish measures are not inconsistent with Articles 5, 6 and 8 of ECHR.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the alleged conflict with other provisions of the MCA, I conclude, as already stated, that, by including Schedule 3 in the MCA, Parliament must be assumed to have permitted orders to be recognised that did not comply with other laws and procedures under the statute. As the definition of &#8220;adult&#8221; in Schedule 3 para 4 plainly extends to persons who may not be incapacitated within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref>, it follows that the Court will be obliged to recognise and enforce orders of a foreign court in terms that could not be included in an order made under the domestic jurisdiction under the MCA. This is subject, however, to its discretion to refuse recognition and enforcement where that would be manifestly contrary to public policy. I agree and adopt Hedley J&#8217;s conclusion in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re MN</span> that a decision to recognise under paragraph 19(1) or to enforce under paragraph 22(2) is not a decision governed by the best interests of the individual so that those paragraphs are not disapplied by paragraph 19(4)(b) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Thus it follows that the Court will be obliged to recognise and enforce a measure in a foreign court order even where applying a best interests test it would not be included in an order made under the domestic jurisdiction under the MCA. Again, however, this is subject,  to its discretion to refuse recognition and enforcement where that would be manifestly contrary to public policy.  I agree with and adopt Mostyn J&#8217;s conclusion that an order recognising and enforcing a foreign measure under Schedule 3 is not a welfare order as defined in section 16A(4)(b). The rules as to ineligibility in section 16A therefore do not apply. This means that the Court will be obliged to recognise and enforce orders of a foreign court depriving an individual of his liberty in circumstances in which it would not able to do so under the domestic jurisdiction under the MCA on the grounds that the individual is being treated or is treatable under the MHA as defined in Schedule 1A of the MCA. Once again, however, this is subject,  to its discretion to refuse recognition and enforcement where that would be manifestly contrary to public policy. </p>

However, they may entitle the Court to refuse recognition and enforcement where, on the facts of the case, the Court concludes that the measure is manifestly contrary to public policy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this context I must address the specific point made by Ms Weereratne on the issue of ineligibility. Looking at the substance of the order in PB&#8217;s case, she raises the point that a person who under the domestic processes of the MCA would be ineligible to be deprived of their liberty under the MCA and therefore entitled to the benefit of the safeguards of the MHA may be deprived of their liberty under a foreign order recognised and enforced under Schedule 3 and thereby denied the benefit of the safeguards of the MHA. I agree that, looking at the substance as opposed to the form, it seems to me that it would be contrary to public policy for someone who is mentally ill and detained in hospital not to be allowed to make regular challenges to their detention. On the facts of these cases, however, the very regular reviews included in the Irish orders provides each individual with just such an opportunity. I therefore conclude on this point that the Irish orders are not manifestly contrary to public policy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the wider argument about public policy, I accept the submissions advanced on behalf of the HSE. In Munby LJ&#8217;s words, &#8220;the test is stringent, the bar is high&#8221;. I do not accept the thrust of Mr Rees&#8217; submissions that it is open to this Court to refuse recognition and enforcement of the foreign order simply because the individual may have the relevant decision-making capacity and objects to the order being recognised and enforced. I agree with Mr Setright that such an approach would undermine the whole purpose of Schedule 3. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, as to implementation of the order, I do not accept Mr Rees&#8217;s submission that the effect of paragraphs 12 and 17 of the Schedule is that, in respect of a person who is the subject of a protective measure in a foreign order, but who would be ineligible to be deprived of his liberty under the domestic provisions of the MCA by virtue of s.16A(4)(a) and Schedule 1A, is automatically entitled to all the statutory safeguards under the MHA. So far as paragraph 17 is concerned, for the reasons discussed above, the ineligibility provisions of the MCA are not mandatory in respect of such persons because Parliament has included Schedule 3 within the statute. In my judgment, the &#8220;conditions of implementation&#8221;  under paragraph 12 are that the requirements of the ECHR are met, in particular the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Winterwerp</span> criteria and reviews of sufficient regularity to satisfy Article 5(4). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the specific orders in these three cases. In each case, I conclude that the individual &#8211; PA, PB and PC &#8211; is an adult within the meaning of paragraph 4 of the Schedule. I conclude that each is habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland. Having considered the orders of the Irish Court, and the provisions in each order that amount to &#8220;protective measures&#8221; within the meaning of Schedule 3, (including, in each case, the provision that each individual shall be placed and detained at St Andrew&#8217;s and the various ancillary orders to facilitate and support the placement and detention), I conclude that there are no grounds for refusing to recognise the measures under paragraph 19(3) or (4). I conclude in each case that the individual was given a proper opportunity to be heard for the purposes of paragraph 19(3)(b); that in each case the individual &#8211; PA, PB and PC &#8211; satisfies the criteria for detention under Article 5(1)(e), namely the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Winterwerp</span> criteria; that the orders of the Irish Court demonstrate that each will be afforded a regular right of review of his or her detention so as to comply with the ongoing requirements of Article 5(4); that as a result recognising and enforcing the orders will not contravene the ECHR; that the measures in each case are not inconsistent with any other mandatory provision of the law of England and Wales; and that the measures cannot be said to be manifestly contrary to public policy.  I shall therefore make the orders declaring that the protective measures in the said orders shall be recognised in England and Wales and enforced in this jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Setright, Mr Ruck Keene and Ms Butler-Cole suggest that the Court may wish to use this opportunity (1) to give guidance as to the requirement that must be satisfied in relation to applications for recognition and enforcement of protective measures providing for compulsory psychiatric treatment of adults within the meaning of the 2000 Convention in institutions in this country and (2) to give guidance as to the allocation of such cases pending the coming into force of rules to support Schedule 3 which are going to be considered by the ad hoc Rules Committee as part of the second tranche of its work being undertaken later this year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the former, I do not propose to go beyond what I have said in the context of the facts of this case earlier in this judgment. As to the latter, there was insufficient time at the hearing to consider this proposal in more detail. It seems to me that guidance of the sort proposed by counsel requires careful thought and I hesitate therefore to embark upon that process without further analysis. If, however, counsel wish to pursue this course, I direct that they submit a joint document incorporating their proposals (if possible agreed) by the end of June 2015. I shall then consider, in consultation with the President, what course to take. I hope that the Court of Protection Rules will in due course be amended to incorporate comprehensive rules to support Schedule 3 as soon as possible, including rules as to allocation of applications under the Schedule. Pending the introduction of such rules, any application under Schedule 3 at this stage should be listed before a full High Court Judge in the first instance, and thereafter, all further hearings in connection with that application, and any further applications under the Schedule in respect of the same individual, should be listed before the same judge (if available) unless expressly released by him or her to another judge. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One issue which requires clarification by the ad hoc Rules Committee is whether a litigation friend should be appointed. Rule 141(2) of the Court of Protection Rules stipulates that where P is a party to proceedings he must have a litigation friend. Rule 6, in so far as relevant, defines &#8220;P&#8221; as &#8220;any person (other than a protected party) who lacks, or so far as consistent with the context, is alleged to lack capacity to make a decision or decisions in relation to any matter that is the subject of an application to the Court&#8221;.  In supplemental submissions in the case of PC, Mr Rees argues that this definition is not apt to cover the situation where the Court is dealing with the recognition and enforcement of a foreign order who may be an &#8220;adult&#8221; for the purposes of Schedule 3 paragraph 4(1) but who is not alleged to lack capacity to make the relevant decisions. I did not have the benefit of detailed argument on this matter, but my preliminary view is that someone who is the subject of a protective measure in a foreign order that is submitted for recognition and enforcement under Schedule 3 is, in &#8220;the context&#8221;, a person who is &#8220;alleged to lack capacity to make a decision or decisions in relation to any matter that is the subject of the application&#8221;. Pending consideration of this issue by the Rules Committee, I therefore consider that a litigation friend should be appointed to act for an individual who is the subject of an application for recognition and enforcement under Schedule 3 save in cases (such as the three cases before me) where the court is satisfied that the individual has <span style="font-size:11pt">capacity to conduct the litigation</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I should record that, in her submissions on behalf of St Andrew&#8217;s Healthcare, Miss Lee argues that, in the event that the Court declines to recognise and enforce the Irish orders, it should authorise the detention of PA and PB under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court for a short period pending their return to Ireland being implemented. This proposition was not accepted by the Official Solicitor or PB. On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees argued that any temporary detention pending return should instead be authorised under the MHA and an attempt to invoke the inherent jurisdiction would risk circumventing the statutory protections afforded to mentally ill persons under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>. As I have concluded that the Irish orders should be recognised and enforced, however, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue in this judgment. </p>
