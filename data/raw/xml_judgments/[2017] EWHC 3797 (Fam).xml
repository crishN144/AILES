	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must decide whether a little girl &#8216;L&#8217; aged two years and four months should be returned to Turkey pursuant to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980.  It is agreed by all that she was habitually resident in Turkey at the date of removal to this country in November 2016 when aged 18 months.   Her parents are both Libyan although her mother also has British nationality as she, herself, has a British mother.  Both parents were born in Libya and have, I assume, Libyan nationality as well.   The mother was brought up partly in Libya but her family is now in England.  There are various assertions made about the circumstances in which this happened which I do not need to consider.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is only 23 and was married just before her twentieth birthday in May 2014.  The father is a little older than her. He works for the Libyan National Airlines in Turkey.   The wedding was partly by proxy in that the father was not there but represented; that can provide a perfectly valid form of marriage. It is not suggested that this marriage is in any way to be impeached and the mother does not assert that she was forced into it.   The parties lived together in Turkey immediately after the marriage.  L, their daughter, was born there.</p>

	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that particularly after L&#8217;s birth she was subjected to domestic abuse, some of it very serious indeed, involving threats to her life and that of the child, and violence to the child as well as to herself.  The father denies that saying that they were a compatible, loving couple who had chosen to marry.  He cannot explain the mother&#8217;s departure when she was brought L to this jurisdiction on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2016.  It is conceded that this was a wrongful removal, that L was habitually resident in Turkey beforehand, that this was in breach of the father&#8217;s custody rights, and specifically that this was without his knowledge or consent and he knew nothing about the plan.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after the mother arrived she went to the police in Norfolk (where her mother lives) to make allegations of domestic abuse by the father.  In circumstances which I know little about, six weeks later, on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016, the mother was stopped at Heathrow Airport attempting to travel to Turkey via Germany with L and the mother&#8217;s father (L&#8217;s maternal grandfather).  I am told (although I have no direct evidence from the police about this) that because of concerns of honour-based violence to the mother, who was on a &#8220;watch&#8221; list, she was prevented from leaving.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At some point that day the police obtained a Police Protection Order in respect of L.  L was placed in a Local Authority emergency foster home overnight.  Mother and child were reunited shortly afterwards.  On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016 Norfolk County Council made an application, not on formal notice, in the Family Court sitting at Norwich for an interim care order, based on the risk alleged to be presented by the mother deliberately exposing the child to risk of harm from the father by taking her to Turkey, and asserted to be due to naivety on her part as to danger. </p>

	    <num>6.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although this was technically an ex parte application the mother was present and represented at court and I note is recorded as having agreed to these orders.  The father was not notified. The local authority ought to have contacted him in Turkey to inform him of the proceedings. This is in line with modern practice and no risk of harm could have been created by so doing.  There was no suggestion that he had left Turkey, the mother was in court and protected there, and the mother and child were living safely in unidentified local authority accommodation.  </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_7">
	    <num>7.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His Honour Judge Richards, a highly experienced section 9 Judge, declined to make an interim care order. It is not clear on the face of the orders he made, but I assume, as Mr. Setright, for the father, suggests, that he was immediately aware that this child was unlikely by then to be habitually resident in England or, in any event, was likely to be the subject of international proceedings.   Firstly he ordered that L be made and remain a ward until further order and then made a raft of orders under the private law provisions of the Children Act.  He noted that the child was a British citizen but found that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, which gives support to Mr. Setright&#8217;s suggestion.  He gave leave to the Local Authority to apply for orders under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s100</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and stated that the court was satisfied that the child was present in England and that the immediate exercise of its powers was necessary for her protection.  The order states that the court was satisfied that in the absence of these orders being put into effect, the child &#8220;is likely to suffer significant harm&#8221;, that the orders were in the best interests of the child, and therefore a proportionate interference.  After making various other orders and recording certain recitals he ordered that &#8220;L shall not be removed from England and Wales until further order&#8221; and directed that she should be placed with the mother in a Local Authority Mother and Baby Foster Placement until further order.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Richards also granted care and control of L to the Local Authority.  With the greatest respect to Judge Richards and to Moor J who later stayed the private law proceedings (but specifically did not stay the orders which arose under them), I doubt whether that was an effective order.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, to which Judge Richards was certainly referred (because he gave permission to the Local Authority to make their application under that statute) says in terms by paragraph (2) that: </p>

The case was to come back to court if there was a problem.   The care proceedings were disclosed into these proceedings to form part of the bundle.  This may be a matter of extreme technicality but I note that there was no order that the evidence in the Norwich proceedings was to stand as evidence in these proceedings.

The rules in themselves give no guidance, but suggest that the court should apply the overriding objective, and that it is particularly relevant if the applicant for joinder has an independent view to advance.  I was told that Moor J had taken the view that the test for joinder was a low one &#8211; see Family Procedure Rules 2010 r 12.3 and the notes to it in the Family Court Practice, and that I should would decide what part they should play.   Ms. Geddes referred me to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re B</span> (A Child) (1980 Hague Convention Proceedings) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/375" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 375" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 375</ref> in which she had submitted to Black J (as she was then) that where a Local Authority is involved or perhaps even before it has been formally involved, it ought to be made a party to Hague proceedings.  Black LJ plainly was not attracted by that general proposition although she did not rule on it one way or the other.  But she did say that there might be many ways in which a Local Authority could assist the court in a Hague return case, particularly in cases of older children where their personnel might have had contact with the children and know their wishes and feelings and perspective.  That of course is not a factor here.  I did not rule then since I wanted to think about the Local Authority&#8217;s role after considering Ms. Geddes&#8217; submissions. She also took the opportunity &#8211; or maybe this had already been intended, I do not know &#8211; to bring in leading counsel.  So I now have Mr. Setright QC and Mr. Edwards for the father, Mr. Momtaz QC and Ms. Harding for the mother and Mr. Twomey QC and Ms. Geddes for Norfolk County Council.  I am grateful for their submissions in the case, but this has all taken time.</p>

The fact that I have sat over five days, admittedly with a lot of spare time along the way and the luxury of engaging with submissions in a case which I have not found easy, does not justify the time estimate.

She set out in detail the Turkish laws in respect of protection of women from domestic violence and what the penalties are for breach.

No material evidence was produced to support the mother&#8217;s allegations of serious assault, including sexual assault.  It is her case that she was controlled and monitored domestically by her husband and therefore unable to make complaint or to seek medical attention.   She produced photocopied photographs of alleged injuries to herself and the child. They did seem to show discoloration to the mother&#8217;s limbs which resembled bruising but it was impossible for me to form any conclusion.  She also produced poor quality photographs of reddening to the child&#8217;s hands which she said had occurred when the father who was irritated with the child grabbing at items, smacked her very hard.   The photographs indicated some discoloration which may or may not have been bruising; and may have shown swelling, although this appearance may have been caused by the angle of the photograph.   The father said that the reddening was due to the child&#8217;s eczema with which the child had indeed been diagnosed.  It may or may not be relevant that the report that I have seen refers to the child having eczema on her arms and legs rather than her hands.  I have no medical evidence.</p>

The mother had complained that he had reacted very badly and had abused her because she had distributed a photograph online of herself wearing a Western-style dress.  To contradict that he produced a number of other photographs which she had sent to him wearing Westernised clothes.  He also produced a vast number of affectionate, loving and indeed passionate text messages between the two, each expressing their feelings for one another and their delight in one another&#8217;s company and appearance.

It may be, as is suggested particularly by the Local Authority, that she was inveigled into the journey by her own father. On the other hand, she and her father both told the police that they were intending to travel to &#8216;sort out&#8217; the divorce proceedings in Turkey.   The mother is keen to be divorced from the father and the jurisdiction to entertain her divorce proceedings here is as yet very uncertain.  The mother has said inconsistent things about the trip.  Her first account was that she was simply going to go to Germany to have medical treatment for hair loss.  She took some time to accept that in fact they were planning onward travel to Turkey.  She then said that they were intending to stay there for an indefinite period of time.   She has been very vague since then as to precisely what her motivation was.  The Local Authority suggests that the motivation of her father was to force a reconciliation, but she has never said that in terms herself.   She has said that her father had &#8216;duped&#8217; her but she has not said in respect of what.  She says that he has accepted that he could have caused her significant harm but she has not said how and why.  There is no other evidence that her father&#8217;s motivation was other than what he said, namely, to travel for the purposes of assisting his daughter to resolve her marital problems by ending the union.</p>

There also may be cases in which the court can safely take the view that an Article 13(b) defence is not made out; for instance, where what is said by the abducting parent just simply does not establish the first base for gravity risk or intolerability.  If what the mother says is true, certainly in respect of her husband, it establishes that she is at risk of domestic violence if she lives with him, as is the child either directly or indirectly from witnessing domestic violence.  On the other hand, no evidence is produced by the mother to suggest that she has experienced or is at serious risk from harassment or harm from third parties, although it may be possible to infer that a spouse who can behave in a highly destructive way to the family is capable of almost anything including inciting harm by others.  There is no evidence that L&#8217;s father has sought the mother out or tried to do so in this country.  They were in contact by text certainly at an early stage of these proceedings and there is no suggestion that he was anything other than civil to her or that he threatened her.  Unusually in a case of this nature has maintained the mother financially, reasonably generously, since separation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother does not make any allegation in these proceedings that she is at any risk from her own father if she returns to Turkey despite the Local Authority&#8217;s concerns.  The furthest she goes, on instructions relayed through counsel during this case, is to say that he might put pressure on her to reconcile.   Initially the Local Authority&#8217;s case, based upon what it had been told by the police, was that the maternal grandfather did present a very serious risk against the mother, even going so far as to extend to honour-based killing or certainly honour violence.   Thus, I received an application from Mr Twomey during the hearing to admit into evidence a risk assessment produced by the Norfolk Constabulary of which the Local Authority was aware and which they wanted to see to evaluate it.  Against Mr. Setright&#8217;s protestations, I agreed to its production.  Although a lengthy document, it consisted mainly of a typed form with tick boxes and added nothing to what was already known had been alleged by the mother (supported by her mother) as to domestic violence from the mother&#8217;s father towards her own sister when that sister&#8217;s marriage broke down. The mother&#8217;s case is not that she was forced to go to Turkey or to Germany (wherever she thought she was going in December 2016) nor that she was under physical or emotional pressure from any source.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When looking at whether the protective measures are sufficient, I note that the mother&#8217;s case is very different from the Local Authority&#8217;s.   Of course, a potential victim may not be aware of the risk to him or herself.  But on the evidence, particularly since it is now known that the maternal grandfather is very ill and confined to this jurisdiction, the risk of him travelling to Turkey to harm the mother must be very low.  The risk that he might employ a &#8216;hit man&#8217; to target her is very low as well, although I suppose I should not wholly ignore that possibility.   It is now proposed that on return until the Turkish court can fully assume charge of this case the mother&#8217;s location will be confidential (as is her present residence). Therefore, the risk that the child&#8217;s grandfather presents to her in England &#8211; which I must use as a comparator &#8211; is likely to be far higher than the risk that he may inflict harm on her or the child in Turkey.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although I decided not to hear oral evidence, counsel agreed that I am entitled to form at least some conclusion (relevant to any potential defence that the mother&#8217;s psychological reaction to return to Turkey would be so intense and so adverse to create the relevant degree of risk or intolerability on return) from the fact that she was prepared to travel back there with the child shortly after her original departure. The mother was with her father which may have given her a sense of security and a greater sense of being able to deal with the outside world than if she had been on her own.  But the fact that she was prepared to return to Turkey at all means that it cannot seriously be suggested that a return to Turkey in itself as such will be so psychologically harmful to her as to fall within the Article 13(b) criteria; nor indeed that physical proximity to the father by being in the same city, of 17 million inhabitants, would cause her such distress or that she would be so adversely affected as to give rise to the consequences required by Article 13(b).  Taking at face value the account of both the mother and her father that they were intending to go to Turkey in order to resolve the divorce proceedings, it is highly likely that the father would have known that she was there and she must have appreciated that.</p>

It is quite possible, without being fanciful, to imagine a case in which a parent or other person might come to this country claiming to seek refuge against harm and then seek to remove the child for purposes of trafficking, sexual abuse or perhaps some form of ritual injury or even homicide.  I agree with Mr. Twomey that it would make a nonsense of the legislation for a local authority not to be able to come to court and seek to prevent return.</p>

After discussion in court various potential refinements, have been added at my suggestion.  First, that the father should provide a sum of money to the mother so that she can instigate proceedings in Turkey and progress them for at least a time.  Second that any accommodation that she occupies must be kept entirely confidential and only made known to the father if the Turkish court specifically directs.  Third moneys for accommodation, or at least a down payment for accommodation and for maintenance, should be available before she leaves for Turkey.  Fourth that she herself should be made the subject of an order here preventing her from living with the father, bringing him into contact with L or permitting unsupervised contact without permission of the Turkish court.  And, lastly, that the Turkish proceedings should be commenced while she is in this country and interim protection be put in place before she departs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Giray set out the essentials of the relevant provisions of Turkish law in his report. Equality before the law for women and children is assured under the Turkish Constitution Guarantee of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.  Article 41 of the Turkish Constitution protects family and children&#8217;s rights and mandates the State to take necessary measures and establish the necessary organisation to protect the peace and welfare of the family especially of mother and children.   The Turkish Civil Code, since 2002, enables a judge to &#8216;interfere in family relationships&#8217; to protect against domestic violence, and provides for economic support to be ordered.  The law protects the family and prevents violence against women.  Protective measures can be put in place, which include financial aid, psychological, professional, legal and social guidance and counselling and provide temporary protection.  It contains legal guarantees to protect children.  The Family Court Act enables the Family Court Judge to &#8216;grant authorisation&#8217; to control domestic violence and violence against women.  The Turkish criminal jurisdiction applies even where an offence is only partially committed in Turkey.  Abuse for political, philosophical, racial or religious reasons is regarded as an offence against humanity and the Turkish Criminal Act includes punishment by way of imprisonment if there is a breach.  Kidnapping is a criminal offence.   Discrimination is prohibited.  Foreigners are both protected and subject to Turkish laws and Turkey is also a signatory to international conventions in respect of elimination of discrimination.  Turkey, although not part of the European Union, is a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights, thus the Strasbourg case to which I have referred.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Giray tells me that there is no reason, including nationality, for any of those measures not to be available to the mother. The applicable law is Turkish law not the law of Libya - save in respect of the actual obtaining of the divorce itself, which will not prejudice the mother.  English court orders will be recognised and enforced.  Save in respect of property rights of children, Turkey is a full participant in Hague 1996, pursuant to which recognition, enforcement and co-operation is effected.   Under Hague 96 undertakings given by the parents in this jurisdiction will be directly recognised and enforced in Turkey.  All the undertakings offered by the father are enforceable either pursuant to Article 23(1) Hague 1996 or the Criminal Code, or the specific laws which protect individuals.  Specifically the Turkish law which prevents violence against women provides a full repertoire of orders very familiar here (although using slightly different terminology), in the form of an order against molestation including not to approach friends, relatives and children of the protected person, not to damage belongings and goods, not to communicate in a way such as to cause distress, to hand over weapons to the Law Enforcement officials, not to use alcohol, drugs or stimulants in places where the protected people are present, and to apply to the Health Centre for examination or treatment and to ensure treatment.  The Turkish court can make a mirror order which reflects an undertaking. The mother will not be prosecuted for an offence of child abduction, unless the father himself brings a complaint, which he has undertaken not to do.  </p>

He denied that there were any problems in the Family Courts because of recent reported difficulties between the Government and Judges in Turkey.  In commenting upon the Home Office Country Report, he said that the examples of domestic abuse in that report were likely to be replicated in any other jurisdiction.  That I agree, but that does not in address whether there is institutional neglect of remedies in Turkey.   Professor Giray also expresses a perhaps contentious view that in Turkey violence against women arises most often from cultural differences, in marriage.  I do not share that last viewpoint which does not accord with my experience in this jurisdiction.  His own personal view is that the mother would not be at risk in this case because both parties are Libyan nationals.   These views do not undermine the general thrust of Professor Giray&#8217;s report.</p>

A reservation in a court order that a party does not accept the truth of the allegations does not undermine the effectiveness of the order or its enforceability.  The relief sought may be in a criminal, civil or child case, which may be combined.  The child always has a Guardian in children&#8217;s proceedings.  Social Services exist, as does a form of proceedings whereby children can be protected.  Orders are enforceable by the mother, the father, the child&#8217;s Guardian or the Public Prosecutor. </p>

Reports of individual incidents from informants do not indicate whether they have been tested for validity in any sense.  It is not clear what time period these complaints relate to.  From my perspective, many the complaints do not address the issues with which I am currently concerned, namely, domestic violence and protection of a vulnerable child.  For instance, employment statistics as to women generally are not particularly helpful, although I do note that the number of women judges in Turkey does not seem to compare particularly unfavourably to our record in this jurisdiction.</p>

It does not, for instance, provide what I would regard as the crucial information of how many applicants were, deliberately or by neglect, let down by the system, and in what circumstances.  Of course, within this kind of report also there is the concern, as one finds in looking at legal decisions generally, that when a court rejects an application it may well be because the application is unsustainable or not established as opposed to ignored without justification.   </p>

I observe that the parties did not regard the Advocate Hatemi who does have experience of the court as helpful (although I see nothing in her generalised conclusion as to the capacity of the Turkish to provide necessary protection inconsistent with Professor Giray&#8217;s report).   It is also significant, although this does not apply to every single specific area of complaint about the Turkish system in the Home Office report, that many of the problems which arise appear to do so in the rural South East of the country near the border with embattled territory, rather than in Istanbul which I am entitled to regard as likely to offer the best practice and the best service to individuals in a major urban centre.  Also, many of the complaints about investigation and handling of offences against women raised in the Home Office report and indeed some of the complaints about lack of action could also reasonably be levelled against authorities in this jurisdiction.

The mother has not sought the protection forced on her by the Local Authority and the Court. It must be unlikely that she will be compelled against her will to live indefinitely under the current regime impressed on her.  </p>

That would not be appropriate on the present information.   The measures which I make pursuant to Article 11(1) of Hague 1996 will lapse under Article 11(2) as soon as the Turkish authorities have taken the measures required by the situation and it would be wrong for me to second guess what their actions may be.  The farthest I should go is to place the mother under embargoes just as I place the father.</p>

The father says that he did not wish the mother to go outside the house in the immediate consequences of the Coup, but the mother does not suggest that it was or is unsafe for her to be outside.  In fact, her case is that she wished to be out and about far more than the father let her.</p>

In that context, some debate took place with counsel as to whether there was a burden of proof on either party to establish either that the protective measures were sufficient or that they were not.  These are not investigatory proceedings.  They are arm&#8217;s length proceedings between parties in the civil sphere and therefore not equivalent to the approach that a court might take when assessing welfare at the end of care proceedings.   </p>

So, I prefer to leave the question of burden of proof and whether there is a duty on the mother to show that they are insufficient or on the father to prove that they are insufficient, to another day and another case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have felt considerable unease at the extent to which I have been requested to scrutinise in such minute detail the provisions available in a contracting State, a State with a strong system of civil justice notwithstanding the recent political problems. Turkey should be regarded as entirely equivalent to our own in respect of effectiveness of its justice system and its ability, in the words of counsel, &#8220;to deliver&#8221;.  In my view &#8211; and this is the one piece of guidance that I might feel able to offer &#8211; Mr. Setright was broadly right when he submitted that an opinion of the depth and detail of Professor Giray&#8217;s, setting out what measures are available, tells the court as much as it needs to know; although it has, of course, been of assistance for me to know precisely how soon measures can be put in place in Turkey, because it helps with the fine tuning of the order and the undertakings.</p>

Also, since cases inevitably expand to fill the time available, it is best to provide for shorter not longer hearings.  </p>
