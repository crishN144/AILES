I made clear to the three of them that my role as a judge was to listen to what various people had to say, including their parents, Mrs Demery and themselves, and to find a solution which I considered best for them. </span></p>

Due to C&#8217;s diagnosis of ODD, he will purposely engage in negative and disruptive behaviours. [C] will be antisocial and aggressive towards those in authoritative positions. As a result of A&#8217;s ODD he may say things that [he does not] necessarily mean, but more to be spiteful or vindictive.

Ms Renton told me on behalf of the father that since 2021 A has been attending twice a week for 2 &#189; hours (increasing to 3 hours Monday to Friday in the week before examinations); before 2022 he was attending Monday to Friday for 3 hours a day; B and C were attending every day from Monday to Friday for 3-4 hours (with additional time on Saturday mornings when there were special assessments).  Mr Langford on behalf of the mother did not differ substantially from this timetable save that the mother&#8217;s case is that the children&#8217;s attendance was for up to 5 hours and that during examination times they would also attend on Saturdays and Sundays; additionally, B was given significant homework by the centre on Fridays.  On any view the regime of out of school tuition for the children was intensive.  Mrs Demery &#8216;absolutely&#8217; agreed with the proposition that four hours a day additional tuition is onerous for any child.  I also agree.</span></p>

She said that it always worries her when a child has nothing positive to say about one of their parents, although if their only experience of that parent is them being abusive it is perhaps not surprising.

I hope that it is abundantly clear that I do not intend this and that I discourage an over-prescriptive or over-intellectualised approach to what, if it is to work with proper despatch, has got to be a straightforward and robust process. I risk the following few examples of how things may play out at the gateway stage, trusting that they will be taken as just that, examples offered to illustrate possible practical applications of the principles. So, one can envisage a situation, for example, where it is apparent that the child is merely parroting the views of a parent and does not personally object at all; in such a case, a relevant objection will not be established. Sometimes, for instance because of age or stage of development, the child will have nowhere near the sort of understanding that would be looked for before reaching a conclusion that the child has a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views. Sometimes, the objection may not be an objection to the right thing. Sometimes, it may not be an objection at all, but rather a wish or a preference.&#160;</span></p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances."</span></p>

The specific allegations that the father hit A and B are six and four years old respectively.  It is notable that it was these two incidents that the children themselves alighted upon in particular in their discussions with Mrs Demery.  Ms Renton further points to the holiday in England in January 2023 as evidence that this was a functioning family unit at that time.

Absent any protective measures, the children would be returning to the family home where they would live with both parents.  They would be exposed to domestic abuse, both physical and verbal, against their mother.  They would also be living in a household with a strict disciplinarian father who on occasions has inflicted physical chastisement upon them.  They would be required to attend a regime of after school tuition so onerous as to place them under intolerable pressure, with limited opportunities for play.  The regime at the tuition centre is also strict and the children would be exposed to physical discipline.  Faced with the prospect of returning to such an environment, the children would react negatively, particularly when they have come to experience a less pressured form of education which they clearly enjoy and which affords them opportunities to enjoy ordinary play.  Absent appropriate protective measures, I consider that a return in those circumstances would give rise to a grave risk within the meaning of Article 13(b).</span></p>

This was a clandestine abduction which involved a significant amount of pre-planning.  The children were involved and placed in the position of having to keep secrets from their father.  Having arrived in this country the mother concealed her address from the father and was less than fulsome in facilitating contact.  Those circumstances mean that the policy objectives of the Convention such as the need for deterrence and to restore children speedily to their country of habitual residence carry a great deal of weight.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.15in;text-indent:0.23in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">First of all, as I have set out above in relation to Article 13(b), there are serious allegations that the children have been exposed to abusive behaviour.  These are relevant to the exercise of my discretion, albeit I need to consider them on the basis of the protective measures which will be in place in the event of a return.  As Mrs Demery said, the removal of a requirement to attend a tuition centre goes some way to meeting the children&#8217;s objections about a return.  Without the presence of the father in their home, they will be living in a very different climate from that which they previously experienced.</span></p>

Mr Langford goes further and submits that in England more suitable SEND provision will be made for the children than in Hong Kong but I do not consider this is a conclusion I can reach on the evidence, not least because the local authority has yet to undertake an assessment of the children&#8217;s needs.  I do, however, accept that the children will be upset at the prospect of changing schools.  Although the mother acted to their detriment in bringing them to England, this does not of course mean that they will benefit from having to change schools again.  It is, however, important not to attach too much weight to the fact that the children seem to be doing well in school.  They also received very good reports from their Hong Kong schools, where they appeared to be thriving.  They have only been in English schools for a term.  It is a wholly new curriculum for them and they are having to be educated in their second language.  Whilst they may be enjoying school at present, it will have something of a novelty factor for them which may in time wear off.  They are also inevitably enjoying the freedom of being able to play after school rather than attend a tuition centre.  On the basis of the protective measures that will be put in place, the children will not have to return to the same regime involving the tuition centre.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.15in;text-indent:0.23in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The third and, in my view, most significant welfare issue is that in coming to England the children have been separated not only from their father but also from their extended family on both sides and their home environment.  They have been abruptly cut off from their country of birth and nationality and brought to live in a country with which they have virtually no connections at all.  This has the potential in future to affect their sense of identity and their self-esteem.  The children were able to identify members of their family whom they miss and who will be missing them, in particular their maternal grandmother.  She is suffering from a terminal illness.  I do not know her precise prognosis, but were she to die without the children having been able to spend time with her, this has the potential to be profoundly upsetting for them.</span></p>

Whatever may have happened in the past, it is a relationship that needs to be restored and repaired.  Not to do so, risks causing emotional harm to the children in the medium and long term.  It will be difficult to repair the relationship while the children remain in a different jurisdiction from the father, especially as the mother has not been proactive at promoting contact.</span></p>

The children&#8217;s lives until last summer have been in Hong Kong and most of the evidence relevant to their welfare is in that jurisdiction.  Growing up in England would represent a major cultural change for them and the court will need to evaluate whether it is justified as being in their interests. </span></p>
