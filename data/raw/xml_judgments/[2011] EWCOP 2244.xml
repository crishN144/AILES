	    <p class="Normal0" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">About six years ago, GS moved from her home in TW to W. She purchased a ground floor flat in sheltered housing accommodation and she lived there with RS, who was her primary carer.  He looked after her needs at the time, although it appears that WCC, the Applicant in this case, were concerned about his care of GS. Those concerns included issues relating to the cleanliness of the flat, the fact that GS was found to be sleeping on a mattress, and problems with her medication and diet.</span></p>

	    <p class="Normal0" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Matters reached a head in March 2010 when GS was admitted to hospital.  She had cellulitis and sepsis due to a diabetic-related foot ulcer.  The hospital recorded her as having high blood pressure and a urinary infection.  During her stay at hospital a number of concerns were noted by the hospital about RS&#8217;s behaviour. For example, that he displayed little insight into appropriate visiting times arriving in the middle of the night and that he had followed a female nurse home.  He also brought his mother inappropriate items, such as cigarettes whilst she was in the respiratory ward and high sugar foods.  The hospital were also concerned that RS showed little awareness of dementia.</span></p>

However, the residential care home could not accommodate GS, first as they had no room for her and second, because they expressed concerns about RS&#8217;s behaviour. In the circumstances WCC identified FCH as a care home that could meet GS&#8217;s level of needs, which at that stage were regarded as high.  RS agreed to the placement but on the basis, it appears, that it would be a short-term placement only.  Thus, in May 2010, GS was discharged from hospital to FCH where she remains until this day.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Normal0" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">FCH was selected by WCC on the basis that it could care for her Alzheimer&#8217;s condition and it had the appropriate nursing support. Indeed, GS&#8217;s needs were not inconsiderable. The toe and ball of her foot have been amputated and she is therefore non-weight bearing. She requires full support with all transfers and when she is tired or confused, she needs the support of two people for transfer as her sequencing movement is affected by her dementia. GS mobilises with a wheelchair and the use of a Zimmer Frame. Her skin requires monitoring by a community nurse two or three times a week.  She also has hearing difficulties.  </span></p>

JS and the Official Solicitor support WCC&#8217;s plan for GS to remain at FCH but RS opposes it.  It is true to say that prior to the commencement of these proceedings all was not well between RS and the care home.  Matters reached a head in December 2010 when it appears that RS forced his way into the care home through a back door and trashed his mother&#8217;s room, emptying her belongings all over the floor.  I shall return to this later, save to say that contact between RS and GS was suspended and it was for this reason that a standard authorisation for GS&#8217;s detention was made under the deprivation of liberty provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  </span></p>

The first issue is whether or not GS lacks capacity to manage her finances, to decide where she should live, to make decisions about her care requirements and to consider whether or not to have contact with RS. The second issue is whether or not GS should live at FCH.  The third issue is how to manage contact between RS and GS.  </span></p>

However, on 13 July RS did not appear.  When these proceedings were commenced, District Judge Hilder gave directions transferring the case to Bristol where a case management conference was listed before a nominated judge.  The judge then transferred the final hearing to London on the basis that it would be easier for RS to travel to London. WCC gave RS train and underground tickets together with details as to the date, time and place of the hearing, but unfortunately it appears that RS arrived in London the day before the hearing only to return to Bristol or somewhere else on the day of the hearing. Thus he was not here and could not be contacted.  The hearing, therefore, on the first day was abandoned.  On the second day of the hearing, RS appeared.  </span></p>

Dr AB also noted that FCH is prepared to manage a &#8220;difficult relationship&#8221; with RS &#8220;which most care settings would find challenging&#8221;.

IGS said that the advantages of GS being at FCH is that she is in a consistent, supportive and caring environment that attends to her mental and physical wellbeing as well as addressing issues around social inclusion and provision of a stimulating environment where there is a choice of activities aimed at engaging GS.

He therefore concluded that it is in GS&#8217;s best interests to continue to reside at FCH, especially as she has stabilised with regards to her physical care and that it is not in her best interests to move to an alternative care home as there is nothing to indicate that the care she is receiving at FCH is inadequate.

However, RS does not. He wants GS to live in WY.  He says that she should go to a care home in WY that he has proposed, to which I shall return shortly, for a holiday first and then she should go to other care homes which he did not identify.  RS referred to his mother&#8217;s stay at FCH as her being imprisoned and on a number of occasions during the hearing, he referred to GS being &#8220;in prison for 484 days&#8221;.  He blames lack of social work assistance when GS lived at home and subsequent intervention by social services on his mother&#8217;s poor condition.  He refers to being harassed and neglected by social workers.  In particular, RS referred on a number of occasions and also in an email dated 9 May 2011, which has been treated as his statement in these proceedings, to his having worked with old people in hospital in the 1970s and the fact that he was intending at that stage to study medicine which demonstrated his ability to care for his mother.</span></p>

I have already referred to the fact that issues have arisen such that contact has not taken place face-to-face between RS and his mother since December 2010, although there has been telephone contact. There is a long list of complaints made against RS and his conduct.  It is said that when GS was in hospital he attended the ward late at night smelling of alcohol, that he brought alcohol and sugary foods to the hospital, and that he visited at inappropriate times, namely 2.30am in the morning on 9 August 2010 and 12.20am on 14 August, that he brought his mother cherryade when she is diabetic, and that he distressed GS by giving her a photograph of the deceased son, C, who committed suicide when he was 23 years old.  There are also a large number of other complaints such as refusing to pay for lunch at FCH, trying to make other frail residents stand, placing his hands on the shoulders of various female residents while walking them around the placement, upsetting visitors, turning the television channel over, getting into an ambulance with another resident, smoking in a bathroom at FCH, telephoning and requesting the staff to ask his mother to say that she wished to move to TW, and on one occasion barricading the door to his mother&#8217;s room preventing staff from entering. In addition, he has bought his mother electrical goods which he says will promote her independence but which due to her dementia it is said will cause her harm, alcohol and cigarettes when she was on a respiratory ward and a branch with unknown berries saying that it would bring her closer to nature.  He has apparently been seen lifting his mother from the wheelchair and unsuccessfully attempting to transfer her to his small car, placing her at risk of injury.</span></p>

He shouted and threatened staff with a walking stick before deliberately smashing a fire alarm and setting it off.  He was asked to leave but he shouted at the staff and blamed them for GS&#8217;s deterioration and said that he did not want her to be imprisoned.

The Official Solicitor in his statement before the court exhibits some photographs of GS undertaking activities at the home and she is quite clearly very happy in those photographs.  To move GS anywhere at this time of her life would be against her best interests and indeed, given her age and her physical and mental condition, it would probably be very dangerous to undertake such a move.</span></p>

I therefore order that GS shall live at FCH unless she is taken to hospital due to a deterioration of her health.</span></p>

Any consideration of GS&#8217;s best interests must start on the premise that GS is entitled to see her children and in particular RS. This is of course independent of any rights of RS under Article 8 to see his mother. Therefore, when considering contact, the starting point must always be that there should be full and unrestricted contact between a parent and his or her child and that conditions should only be imposed on that contact if GS&#8217;s best interests demand it.</span></p>

I am clear that this is a case where GS&#8217; best interests demand that contact have conditions attached to it. I reach this conclusion for these reasons. First, because of the admissions RS makes about his conduct. Second, in the context of this case and RS&#8217; admissions, the volume of complaints made by WCC cannot be put to one side and ignored and the court must conclude that there are real issues overall with RS&#8217; behavior which could affect contact. Third, although RS behaved properly during the hearing before me, his presentation nonetheless showed that he has the ability to be difficult in a different setting. </span></p>

In this case, I am dealing with contact in a care home where conditions are required to ensure that GS is safe and well. I also need to have in mind that to ensure that contact continues, any conditions must ensure that other residents of FCH as well as its staff are also protected during a contact session.</span></p>

	    <p class="Normal0" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">When considering the types of conditions to impose both generally and in this case, the court needs to have the following considerations in mind. First, that there should be appropriate reviews of the conditions. Nothing should be set in stone and either the court should review the conditions and/or there should be a review by the local authority.  Second, given the medical evidence, an end of life plan should be put in place. The health of elderly people can deteriorate quickly and it may come to a point when even members of a family who have been excluded from contact should be able to spend time with their parent or relative. Obviously there will be exceptional cases where the level of harm or potential for harm by a family member against a vulnerable person is such that even in an end of life scenario contact would not be appropriate, but these will be very exceptional and rare cases.  Third, the length to which the conditions should address each step of a contact session. Thus, in some cases there will be a need for conditions to manage every step of the way from the arranging of the visit to the arrival of the family member at the home until his departure. In other cases, a more general approach can be appropriate. Fourth, the dates and times of visits will need to be set out clearly in a contact schedule.  Fifth, whether a plan is needed to address problems, for example, the family member cannot get to the home on a particular day due to an emergency.  Sixth, whether it is appropriate for financial assistance to be made available by a local authority or other relevant third party to the relative for travelling to and from a care home. Seventh, if the visit is to be supervised, who is to supervise and what level of supervision is required.  In some cases the supervision may take the form of detailed note taking by an independent person; in other cases it may be a cursory check-up by a member of the care home staff; in yet other cases, the allocated social worker may attend to just keep a watching brief.  Eighth, a right for the home or contact supervisor to cancel the visit if circumstances deem it appropriate, either before the visit or during the visit.  Ninth, the ability to shorten or lengthen a visit if, for example, the visit is not going well or if the relative has become sick.  Tenth, regulation of behaviour.  Conditions may include provision that the family member not be rude to or harass staff or other residents, the point of entry and exit to and from the care home, the fact that other residents need to be left alone, that their care should not be interfered with, restrictions as to what food and drink can be brought into the home and the venue in the home for contact.  Eleventh, a record of the visit. The level of formality will depend on the situation.  In more serious cases every word may need to be recorded and in other cases a note will simply be taken that the visit passed without incident and everything went well.  </span></p>

I have already said that RS grudgingly accepts the provisions (including the restrictions and conditions) on the contact schedule on the basis that although he cannot understand the need for it, he will abide by it.  Both IGS and Dr Barker have also approved it.  They have made some amendments which I incorporated during the hearing.</span></p>

In the context of this case, I believe that its provisions are reasonable and proportionate and that they should achieve the aims required. I also take the view that contact should be reviewed by the court after three months.  Although WCC has included a review mechanism in the contact schedule, it seems to me that within the context of this case, a review by the court would be appropriate.  </span></p>
