As regards issue 3, the Applicant accepts if the Court finds in relation to 1 or 2 that the marriage was voidable or that the Respondent historically lacked the capacity to authorise a transfer of title in the former matrimonial home, the Court would be unlikely to make an Occupation Order. The Applicant, however, asserts that, subject to the Court&#8217;s finding on issues  (1) and (2)  it is open to the Court to make an Occupation Order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> notwithstanding the Respondent&#8217;s current lack of capacity. </p>

This was not the Court&#8217;s impression of the psychiatrist&#8217;s evidence,  which was that being unable to recollect a statement, for example, an address, or three random words given to the patient, two to three minutes later was an example and not a definition. For instance, it is striking that on the Addenbrooke's assessment in relation to being asked what day it was, the Respondent was only able to remember the season of the year and neither the day, the date nor the year.

He first met her on 13 May 2019 and very quickly competed the transfer on 21 May 2019. He agreed the Applicant had visited his offices with the Respondent and came with her again, but he had seen her separately. According to his written evidence, he told her that she did not need to transfer ownership of the property to the Applicant and he could prepare a will to protect his interests. She attended his offices on 21 May 2019 to sign the transfer.</p>

There was no further enquiry. That is not satisfactory when dealing with an elderly client in these circumstances. The solicitor also accepted he communicated with the Respondent via the Applicant&#8217;s email account and did not see this was unsatisfactory. It is clear that the Applicant chose the solicitors, and it is clear that the Respondent was communicating via the Applicant&#8217;s email address, and that he brought her to the solicitor&#8217;s offices.</p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Court notes the Respondent believed that the Applicant loved her and was happy and excited about it. The Court must ask itself why that means the marriage should be annulled as it was not a valid consent or is any way different to other marriages where an older woman has, in effect, been conned by a young man into marriage. To be misled by the bridegroom&#8217;s motivation is not necessarily to lack capacity. The Registrar&#8217;s evidence is that she was happy and knew she was going through a marriage ceremony.</p>

In her evidence to the police, it is clear she understood she was going for a marriage ceremony but did not understand the change in status, both to herself and the Applicant as a result of such a marriage. She never referred to him as her husband and appeared to think she is just helping him to establish himself in the UK.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is clear to the Court that her decision was heavily weighted towards agreeing to the marriage because of the Applicant&#8217;s position of power in relation to her. He was misusing a professional relationship, he was insisting upon secrecy so that she obtained no other opinions, and that formed part of the duress. That, coupled with the inability to weigh decisions caused by the dementia, amounts to an unsoundness of mind that led to the marriage. When asked about the secrecy of marriage she says:&#8220;It&#8217;s so unusual for me to do something like this, I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve done it.&#8221;</p>
