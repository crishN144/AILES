They are not related to her either genetically or legally but they undoubtedly have a hugely significant social and psychological relationship with K because they have cared for her since she was four days old.  K&#8217;s attachment to F and C is strong and deep and is reciprocated as strongly if not more so by them.  To F and C K has become as one of their family and although when she came to live with them she was expected to move on they have reached the point where their bond with her is not now one they could willingly accept being broken.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">K&#8217;s mother is M. K was M&#8217;s first child but M has subsequently given birth to a sibling who has a different father. M is a woman who has had a difficult and turbulent history.  It was because of that history and its relevance to M&#8217;s life back in 2020 that K was placed with F and C upon discharge from her maternity hospital. In 2021 I made care and placement orders in respect of K and dealt in some detail with the multiple problems which M presented to that Local Authority and which I found at that time to be entrenched.  However even then it was clear that M was more than simply a young woman with a problematic history which was affecting her present.  It was clear that M possessed determination, insight and, in the right circumstances, might offer a more positive version of herself than would then have been available to K. To a large extent this has been proved so.  K&#8217;s younger sibling was also the subject of care proceedings and whilst like in K&#8217;s proceedings a care order was made, unlike in K&#8217;s proceedings there was no placement order made as well.  That care order was supported by a plan of working towards a possible rehabilitation of the child to M.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">K&#8217;s plan was completely different. It was expected that within a short time after the conclusion of proceedings K would be matched with prospective adopters, be placed with them and so be go on to build her life with a new family. That plan has not progressed as anticipated. The care and placement orders are now approaching their second anniversary contrary to the expectations at the time. Despite the efforts of this local authority to promote and publicise K as a child suitable to be adopted this has not happened. Several times potential adoptive parents indicated their interest but for different reasons no match, let alone any placement, was ever made.  Instead time passed and as F and C continued to care for K they found themselves questioning whether they were still committed only to be K&#8217;s short term care. It was not that they did not wish to care for K, but that they did not want to stop doing so. The emotional ties they found were building between themselves and K were outgrowing the limitations of their fostering responsibilities.  Over a period of time F and C reflected upon what was happening and slowly came to the realisation that they did not want to move K on but to hold fast to her.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">For M that same period of failed potential placements combined with the progress she had made since 2021 caused her to consider that it was time to seek to renew her relationship with her daughter. That relationship had effectively stopped in January 2022 when a farewell contact had taken place and thereafter there had been little, if any, information about K provided to M, despite M being keen to learn of K&#8217;s situation, and nothing by way of contact.  That absence of any information proved critical and by May of 2023 M had decided that she needed to force the issue and made an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.34(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for a contact order with a child in care. However by virtue of the existence of the placement order that was technically the wrong application under the wrong statute. Upon issue that application was allocated to myself as the Judge who had made the original orders and at the initial hearing two things were clear. Firstly, that M had issued an application for contact under the wrong legislation but, and more importantly, contact, irrespective of under what statute it was being sought, was not what M wanted.  In her statement supporting her application M was clear that her real aim was not an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.34(3)</ref> of the Children Act nor even one under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.26</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> but under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>, namely one to secure the revocation of the placement order.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">At that first hearing the technical error was acknowledged and M&#8217;s case was re-shaped on the basis of her intention to pursue revocation.  The response of the Local Authority to M&#8217;s intended step was to assert that any such an application, whether for permission or substantively, could not be made because K had been placed for adoption with F and C in the earlier part of 2023 and an application for an adoption order, if not already with the court, was imminent. The Local Authority asserted that this being the case any application M sought to make for a revocation of the placement order was statute-barred by the operation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/24/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24(2)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

That search revealed that no application had yet been received. In order not to potentially prejudice any application M was intent on making I invited F and C not to issue any application pending the receipt of the further evidence to be filed by the Local Authority.  Following that hearing M duly submitted her application for permission to revoke the placement order.</p>

The first in time is an application for permission to revoke a placement order.  It is an application made by K&#8217;s mother and she seeks to demonstrate that life has now moved on so successfully that she should be considered as a parent who could now care for her daughter but in so doing enable a sibship to be created between K and her youngest child and so unify a separated family.  If it could be achieved it would undoubtedly offer much to K.  </p>

If such a smooth and seamless transition to permanency for K were to happen it would undoubtedly offer much for her.</p>

This is as it should be and the reasons for these differences are clear.  As will be discussed in more detail below a child who has been placed for adoption by an adoption agency is not only a child in respect of whom a court has made a placement order but also a child whose prospective adoptive parents have undergone a process of approval as persons suitable to adopt and thereafter been further approved as being suitable to be specifically matched with the child in question.  Both the making of a placement order and the approval of prospective adopters involve detailed, considered and rigorous processes which have proven to be robust in their application to the issue of adoption.</p>

As any local authority social worker can attest securing a placement order requires clear evidence and a thorough and robust evaluation of all of the available realistic options.  Judges are under no illusion that despite the frequency with which the word &#8216;Draconian&#8217; is casually flung around in courtrooms without any obvious thought as to its full effect and meaning, the starting point when considering whether to make a placement order is that it not only engages fundamental rights for the child and the parent but is seriously impactive upon them. When confronted with an application to make a placement order the starting point for the court is:  &#8216;why should I make this order? What is the <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> to do so?&#8217; and not &#8216;why should I not make this order.&#8217;  The onus, stemming from the landmark judgment of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref></span> is that such an order is justified &#8216;only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child&#8217;s welfare, in short, where nothing else will do.&#8217; (Re B, para. 198, per Baroness Hale). Given the life-changing nature which the making of a placement order and any subsequent order will have upon the child both in their own life and beyond it this is, of course, as it should be.</p>

That process of scrutiny involves the individual in a multi-factorial assessment including their personal history, their past and present relationships, their current circumstances regarding employment, their health and their financial state. It requires the collation of a broad range of information and its assessment by a trained social worker as well as consideration by an independent panel both as to the question of their suitability to adopt generally and their suitability to adopt a specific child.  The process is long, arduous, detailed, comprehensive and requires commitment and training.  As above, and for exactly the same reasons, that is exactly as it should be given what is involved.</p>

As directed the Local Authority have filed detailed statements identifying each of the steps taken to support F and C in their stated intention of adopting K.  Notwithstanding the care taken in the preparation of those statements nowhere within them is there any record of any panel having considered F and C whether as suitable candidates to adopt at all or as their being a suitable match for K as her prospective adopters.  This is important because at the initial hearing when the Local Authority made their assertion that K was already placed with F and C I indicated that this was a matter which only the Local Authority could evidence, it did not lie with F and C, let alone, M to establish the point or prove the negative.  Therefore in the absence of positive evidence as to what had happened I would infer that any absence of such evidence would automatically imply the negative, that it had not happened and would base any analysis of the factual position upon that assumption.  The Local Authority therefore were clear as to their obligation to set out everything in detail and aware of the consequences of not doing so.</p>

However for the reasons set out above those steps are mandatory and therefore whilst there was significant local authority involvement with F and C, all of which was positive and supportive of their aspiration to provide permanency within their family for K, there has not been compliance with the detailed requirements of Parts 4, 5 and 6 of the Regulations and that accordingly no formal and procedurally correct decision was made that K was now placed with F and C not as her foster carers but as her prospective adopters.</p>

In the alternative thr Local Authority asserted that the Regulations, should they be applicable, did not apply to their full extent and, in particular, did not apply in terms of the necessity for following the procedural process for securing approval of the specific placement of K and F and C as prospective adoptive parents due to their particular circumstances as approved foster carers.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">No written material has been provided by the Local Authority as to the basis upon which it has outsourced its statutory responsibilities in respect of adoption to ABC so I am unable to conclude as to the operational arrangements between the two organisations.  However I fully accept that I am dealing with a responsible local authority which would not deliberately nor even knowingly act in a manner which was outwith its responsibilities.  It is perfectly proper for a local authority to take steps to enable its duties to be dealt with by a specialist organisation but in doing so it must act in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2</ref>, 3 and 3ZA of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  Insofar as this Local Authority has done so and that ABC has, as a result, undertaken those responsibilities, that organisation must be acting either as an adoption agency or as a registered adoption society.  The inclusion of the words &#8216;on their behalf&#8217; in s.3ZA(1) (above underlined and emboldened) would suggest that by applying the ordinary meaning of such words whilst the local authority itself is not undertaking the work necessary to enable adoptions to take place the responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable statutory duties remains with the local authority and remains applicable to what is thereafter done in the name of the local authority.  I cannot read those sections of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as enabling a local authority to avoid the full impact of those duties by shifting its responsibilities to a third party organisation to which such obligations do not apply.  </p>

In such circumstances a local authority would be entitled to rely upon ABC&#8217;s determinations as to what constituted a placement and then assert all of the protective and facilitate consequences of such determination without further consideration.</p>

Whilst it is the case that the extent of the obligations under the Regulations is deliberately limited in the case of those already approved as foster carers it is clear from my reading of Part 4 and Schedule 4A as referenced above that those disapplications are limited and specific.

F and C are not applying to adopt K via the Local Authority as persons approved as prospective adopters with whom a specific child has been placed following approval of that match and placement but are applying to adopt K as individuals who qualify as applicants via a different route.  In the case of F and C their eligibility to apply for an adoption order was conditional upon the period of residence of the child with them and the period of prior notification they had to give to the Local Authority. Pursuant to s.42(4) F and C are foster carers with whom a child has been living for a period of one year prior to the application. That qualification was achieved in July 2022, over a year ago. Further there was a requirement that F and C had to give written notice to the local authority of their intention to apply to adopt and to do so no less than three months prior to their making their application. It is not disputed that notice was given on 15 March 2023 and therefore that condition was met by 15 June 2023.</p>

M has indicated that moving straight to a contested adoption application would inevitably pit her against F and C in a situation where she has made clear that if she is unable to care for K in the future there are no others that she would rather do so than F and C.  M seeks to avoid a direct contest with all its potential for upset, uncertainty and lingering turmoil. In so doing M not only demonstrates her generosity of heart but also her own child-centric thinking and her ability to prioritise what is least unhelpful to K. It has long been my view that one of the aims of the Family Court should always be to ensure that upon the conclusion of any litigation in this arena as much of the family, its resources, emotional as well as financial, and the relationships between its members should be intact and available for the benefit of that family in the future.</p>

That is both admirable and achievable.  In the circumstances I shall direct that the permission application is determined prior to any further steps being taken in any other application. Whilst this may not have been the conclusion I expected to be reaching when I initially heard argument I am confident that it is the correct one for this child.</p>
