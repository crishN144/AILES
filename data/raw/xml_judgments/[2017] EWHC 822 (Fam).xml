At that stage, I declined to make an &#8216;exclusion of the media&#8217; order, but made an interim reporting restriction order, and adjourned determination of the applications to today, to give the media proper opportunity to attend and/or make representations.  I specifically directed the listing of these applications for a discrete hearing so that there would be clarity about reporting and press attendance before the proceedings are listed for substantive determinations.  The husband&#8217;s solicitors have served media organisations with the order made on 20 January and with the Skeleton Arguments prepared for this hearing, as directed, but no media representative has chosen to submit representations (for which I made specific provision in my last order).</p>

I had made clear to Mr. Wagstaffe QC (appearing on behalf of the husband at the 20 January hearing) that the husband would have a not insignificant difficulty in persuading me of the merits of a blanket exclusion provision, given the ordinary expectation (which I tend to follow) that duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations should be permitted to attend financial remedy hearings: <span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010 rule 27.11(2)(f)</span>.

Secondly, by <span style="font-style:italic">section 12(4)(b)</span>, any court considering whether to grant either an interim or a permanent injunction has to have &#8220;particular regard&#8221; to &#8220;any relevant privacy code&#8221;. It is not disputed that the IPSO Code, which came into force in January, is a relevant Code for this purpose. This, as Lord Mance has explained, provides that &#8220;editors must demonstrate an exceptional public interest to over-ride the normally paramount interests of [children under 16].</p>

It is possible that the evidence will indicate that the children can be protected from any such risk, by a combination of the efforts of their parents, teachers and others who look after them and some voluntary restraint on the part of the media.</p>

That they are divorcing, and that their financial remedy proceedings are being pursued in the English Courts, are pieces of information already in the public domain, and the publication of that information cannot legitimately be restrained by order.  However, having regard to the matters outlined in paragraph [8](i)-(viii) above I have concluded that in these circumstances and at this stage:</p>
