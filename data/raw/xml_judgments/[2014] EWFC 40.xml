The application for a transfer request is made by the father of the older child, fully supported by the mother but opposed by both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, Carol Vicarage.</p>

Her order relates that she heard from Antonin Hradilek, Minister-Counsellor and Deputy Head of Mission at the Embassy of the Czech Republic. His views, as recorded, were that there was &#8220;no live issue as regards jurisdiction.&#8221; Judge Jakens&#8217; order reflects that she had given active consideration to the children&#8217;s habitual residence as well as the principles set out in Articles 8 and 15 of B2R. She decided the children were habitually resident in the UK and that she should accept jurisdiction.</p>

Be that as it may, X did not participate at any court hearing prior to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 although he wrote to the court with the assistance of the prison service in late May and at the beginning of August. On no fewer that four occasions, production orders failed to result in his presence. Eventually, towards the end of August, as the result of direct communication between Judge Jakens and the prison governor, X was able to secure legal representation. His application for consideration of an Article 15 transfer request was issued on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.</p>

The mother indicated that she, too, wished to apply for an Article 15 transfer request.

The local authority&#8217;s final evidence and care plans are unequivocal. They recommend placement of both children for adoption in England, without direct contact to any parent. That was the position in the period leading to this hearing according to both Mr Taylor&#8217;s Skeleton Argument dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and also the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October letter of Alison Newbold, Solicitor for East Sussex County Council to the Czech Embassy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Assessment of W, the children&#8217;s great grandmother, is dealt with in this way in the final statement evidence of Helen Osborne, the allocated social worker. She states that &#8220;CFAB (Children and Families Across Borders) was requested to undertake a viability assessment; that the great grandmother had only offered to care for the children with the assistance of the mother and only because she wants to prevent the children being in foster care. She would only care for them in the Czech Republic and would not move to the UK.&#8221; Ms Osborne relates that W &#8220;has no concerns for the children in their mother&#8217;s care and does not accept the concerns of the local authority. She is therefore unable to protect them from the risk posed to them by their mother.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the hearing, the local authority altered its position significantly and now suggests that a further focussed assessment of  W should be undertaken by CFAB. Inquiries over the lunchtime adjournment on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October revealed that such an assessment could be completed within 6 weeks of a letter of instruction. It would be similar in content, I was told, to a kinship assessment of the kind undertaken in English court proceedings.</p>

He supports the mother&#8217;s claim to be reunited with the children &#8220;in all respects.&#8221; She hopes to swiftly return to the Czech Republic where she has W&#8217;s support. She would intend to apply to the Czech court for the equivalent of a s.38(6) residential assessment &#8220;under the watchful eye of the maternal great grandmother.&#8221; Mr Vine realistically accepts &#8211; notwithstanding the more expansive possibilities contained within his Skeleton Argument &#8211; that X&#8217;s case is centred upon the need for proper exploration of (i) the potential for placing the children with their mother, supported by their  great grandmother and her partner, or with the great grandmother and her partner on their own; and, in the alternative (ii) the potential for finding suitable long term foster parents reflecting the children&#8217;s Roma heritage in the Czech Republic. </p>

But she also emphasised her willingness with her partner&#8217;s assistance to offer the children a home. In her most recent correspondence, dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October addressed to Judge Jakens, W asks for the children&#8217;s immediate return to her &#8220;care and upbringing where they will receive loving care.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, the legal department of the Office for International Legal Protection for Children (the Czech Central Authority) sent a translated report from Social Services in [specified town]. The opinion of the professionals then was that the great grandmother would not be able to look after the children without help. It was assumed that the best course would be to return the children to their mother but &#8220;the Social Service does not have complex information about the current care of the mother.&#8221; The letter concludes with this in relation to Article 15 &#8211; OILPC &#8220;is open to take all the steps to facilitate communications between courts. The decision whether to transfer the case depends at first on the Court of the habitual residence of the child. &#8230; in case the mother states that she would like to move with the children to the Czech Republic &#8230; the court can consider this as one of the reasons for the transfer of the case pursuant to Article 15 &#8230; Therefore, our Office can provide you with all assistance if needed with co operation of the competent Czech Court and the Social Service in the Czech Republic.&#8221;</p>

He indicated how to implement the request for transfer, should one be made. He suggested the children should stay in England until the Czech courts accept jurisdiction and issue a preliminary ruling as to how and with whom the children should return to the Czech Republic. The Director clarified that Czech law does not permit an English social worker to carry out assessments of the children&#8217;s relatives in the Czech Republic. However, there is the potential for additional assessments to be requested pursuant to Article 55 or the Taking of Evidence Regulation (EC) 1206 / 2001. It was also indicated that the court would primarily consider placing the children within their extended biological family. If there are no suitable family members, then the children would be placed in temporary foster care. Finally, the Director emphasised that because X did not declare paternity at the relevant office and he is not mentioned on A&#8217;s birth certificate, he is not regarded as A&#8217;s father, has no legal rights and no legal relationship with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first question is as to whether the children have a &#8216;particular connection&#8217; with another Member State within the meaning of Article 15(3). As to that there could be no dispute. A was formerly habitually resident in the Czech Republic; both children are Roma Czech nationals as are the mother, X and Z. It is true that a number of maternal family members are living in the UK currently but that does not detract from the irrefutable fact that both children have a &#8216;particular connection&#8217; with the Czech Republic as the result of nationality and in A&#8217;s case former habitual residence. It is also a relevant consideration that by order of a Czech court, legal guardianship in relation to A was conferred upon W at a time when the mother was herself a minor. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the second, as to whether the Courts in the Czech Republic are &#8216;better placed&#8217; to determine the issues, I start by considering the comparative involvements of the authorities in each Member State. In [the specified town], there was intervention with maternal family spanning some 13 years from 1998 until 2011 when the family fled to England. The local authority here is a relative newcomer having first received referrals in about January 2013. It is fair to assume there is a depth of knowledge and experience of the family dynamics in the Czech Republic, hinted at within the documents from the authorities there, which is very largely unavailable to the authorities here. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is relevant that the proceedings in the Brighton Family Court are still at the stage of case management. No judge has heard evidence still less made any finding of fact or resolved a disputed issue of any magnitude. Moreover, on any assessment of the likely issues, it is entirely straightforward to predict that there will be no need for any fact finding arising out of recent events. The mother and X either accept or do not admit much of what is alleged against them as to the threshold criteria &#8211; the way in which it is said the children have suffered significant harm attributable to parental care or failures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me to be of extremely limited relevance that the proceedings in Brighton have benefited from judicial continuity in circumstances where there has been nothing other than case management thus far. The same judges dealt with the hearings; but their exposure to the case has been restricted to listening to the advocates and observing the mother as well as, more recently, X across the court room. The situation here is markedly different to that which confronted Mostyn J and then the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic">Nottingham</span> case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, it does not impress me at all that objection is raised as to an Article 15 request on the basis that the issues which confront me now were dealt with in April. As a matter of natural justice, X was entitled to have a voice in the debate as to whether an Article 15 request should issue. His curiously unexplained absence in April, the subsequent intolerable difficulties in ensuring his participation at court and his prompt action so soon as he had the advice of an excellent legal team are more than sufficient reason for reconsideration of the issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The overwhelming likelihood is that the proceedings, wherever they occur, will centre upon assessments of the available long term possibilities for the children. On the basis of the material thus far available, the maternal great grandmother and her partner will be at the forefront either as a couple on their own or as supporters for the mother. Any assessment undertaken on behalf of the local authority here would suffer from at least two disadvantages. First it would be burdensome to transmit questions in as complete a form as the authority would wish, particularly if there were to be a need for follow up inquiries and further information. Second, the international procedures for obtaining such assessments may fail to achieve their stated aim to the satisfaction of the authority and possibly also the court.</p>

But there is no local authority proposal for any assessment of mother and great grandmother together; and the current geographical distance between them (and the children) would place almost insuperable obstacles in the way of any such evaluation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By contrast, the Czech authorities could initiate an assessment as to the viability of whichever placement proposals arise as between the mother and great grandmother without delay. There would be no language barrier; the individuals concerned would all be within a narrow geographical area; there would be complete understanding on the part of the assessor(s) as to events of significance arising from the history as well as knowledge of the available local agency support mechanisms, as considered necessary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I disagree with Mr Taylor&#8217;s submission that assessment of the children would be better undertaken here. How I ask myself would any professional from this jurisdiction be capable of observing the interactions between the great grandmother, mother and children? Such an evaluation would be quite simply impossible given the locations where those individuals are living and the legal constraints applying to social workers from foreign States in the Czech Republic. Assessment of that kind would only become possible if jurisdiction is accepted by the Czech court and the children as well as the mother travel there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It strikes me as singularly unimportant to suggest that because the mother and X are currently habitually resident in the UK, the courts here are better placed to retain jurisdiction. The bald reality is that X will be deported, in accordance with his own wishes, within a matter of months. Z may already be in the Czech Republic though his whereabouts are unknown. The mother only remains in this country because of the children. If they return to the Czech Republic so, too, will she.</p>

That material could be made available to the Czech court without delay. Mr Hradilek, unless I am mistaken, has already had access to some of the documents.</p>

The Article 15 request process is time limited. The Czech court has only 6 weeks in which to respond. Current indications suggest the response as well as interim placement proposals may come a good deal sooner than that. In relation to those matters, it has been immensely helpful that Mr Hradilek has maintained so close an interest in the proceedings, attending hearings in Brighton as well as here in the London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whether in this court or in the Czech Republic, final decision making would appear to be some way off. Of course there is an element of uncertainty as to what precisely would happen to the children if the Czech court accepted jurisdiction. Two distinct possibilities arise from the material supplied &#8211; either there will be a move into the home of the great grandmother or, if no family member is considered suitable, a temporary foster home will be found.</p>

A cursory consideration of the family finding potential as between the two Member States adds to the conclusion that it would be in the children&#8217;s best interests for a transfer request to be made. </p>
