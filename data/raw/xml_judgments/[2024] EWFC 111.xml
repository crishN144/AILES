On 15 November 2023, the Applicant applied in the Family Court in England and Wales for the dissolution of the parties&#8217; PACS, claiming that the Family Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application on the grounds that he was domiciled in England and Wales. The Respondent contends that the Applicant is domiciled by choice in France, that this Court does not have jurisdiction, and that even if it does it should decline to exercise that jurisdiction on the grounds that the courts in France provide the most appropriate forum for the dissolution of the PACS.  </p>

For example, by Schedule 7 -  &#8220;Financial Relief in England and Wales after Overseas Dissolution etc. of a Civil Partnership&#8221; &#8211; the court is given jurisdiction to entertain an application for financial relief if one or more conditions are satisfied. They include that either of the civil partners was domiciled in England and Wales on the date when the leave was applied for. However, Schedule 7 applies after &#8220;overseas dissolution&#8221;. Here, the Applicant is asking this Court to dissolve the PACS in this jurisdiction &#8211; there has been no overseas dissolution - and so Schedule 7 would not appear to apply. Schedules 11 and 17 apply in similar terms to financial relief sought in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively after dissolution overseas.</p>

Cumulatively, they refer to specific cases where (i) the overseas relationship in question was registered before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215</ref> came into force (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(3)</ref>), but (ii) when in such cases, again before the section came into force, a dissolution was obtained outside the UK (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(4)</ref>). In those cases, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(5)</ref> applies such that &#8220;the overseas relationship is not to be treated as having been a civil partnership&#8221; save for the defined purposes, including Sch 7 and those parts of Chapter 3 so far as necessary for the defined purposes. So <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(5)</ref> only applies to overseas relationships registered and dissolved outside the UK before the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CPA 2004</ref> came into force. The references to Schedules 7, 11, and 17 are inapposite to overseas relationships which are to be treated as civil partnerships which subsist at the time of an application for dissolution. I note the reference at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(1)</ref> is to two people who are to be treated as &#8220;having formed a civil partnership&#8221;, whereas at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s215(5)</ref> refers to an overseas relationship not being treated as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">having been</span> a civil partnership&#8221; (emphasis added). <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/215/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S215(5)</ref> refers to the civil partnership in the past tense &#8211; it has ceased to be.

A classic description of the concept is to be found in Lord Westbury's speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Udny v Udny</span> (1869) LR 1 Sc &amp; Div. 441. Two features of his description are of particular importance in the present case. First, that the domicile of origin prevails in the absence of a domicile of choice, i.e., if a domicile of choice has never been acquired or, if once acquired, has been abandoned. Secondly, that a domicile of choice is acquired when a man fixes voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place with an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time.&#8221;</p>

This is a description of the circumstances which create or constitute a domicil, and not a definition of the term. There must be a residence freely chosen, and not prescribed or dictated by any external necessity, such as the duties of office, the demands of creditors, or the relief from illness; and it must be residence fixed not for a limited period or particular purpose, but general and indefinite in its future contemplation. It is true that the residence originally temporary, or intended for a limited period, may afterwards become general and unlimited, and in such a case so soon as the change of purpose, or animus manendi, can be inferred the fact of domicil is established&#8221;</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Fuld</span>, having reviewed the authorities to that date, Scarman J held at 67F:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In the light of these cases, the law, so far as relevant to my task, may be stated as follows: (1) The domicile of origin adheres - unless displaced by satisfactory evidence of the acquisition and continuance of a domicile of choice; (2) a domicile of choice is acquired only if it be affirmatively shown that the propositus is resident within a territory subject to a distinctive legal system with the intention, formed independently of external pressures, of residing there indefinitely. If a man intends to return to the land of his birth upon a clearly foreseen and reasonably anticipated contingency, e.g., the end of his job, the intention required by law is lacking; but, if he has in mind only a vague possibility, such as making a fortune (a modern example might be winning a football pool), or some sentiment about dying in the land of his fathers, such a state of mind is consistent with the intention required by law. But no clear line can be drawn: the ultimate decision in each case is one of fact - of the weight to be attached to the various factors and future contingencies in the contemplation of the propositus, their importance to him, and the probability, in his assessment, of the contingencies he has in contemplation being transformed 'into actualities. (3) It follows that, though a man has left the territory of his domicile of origin with the intention of never returning, though he be resident in a new territory, yet if his mind be not made up or evidence be lacking or unsatisfactory as to what is his state of mind, his domicile of origin adheres.&#8221;</p>

If, on the basis of that inquiry, the court concludes that there is another available forum which, prima facie, is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] A.C. 460</ref>, 475-478.

However, the existence of such proceedings may, depending on the circumstances, be relevant to the inquiry. Sometimes they may be of no relevance at all, for example, if one party has commenced the proceedings for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competing jurisdiction, or the proceedings have not passed beyond the stage of the initiating process. But if, for example, genuine proceedings have been started and have not merely been started but have developed to the stage where they have had some impact upon the dispute between the parties, especially if such impact is likely to have a continuing effect, then this may be a relevant factor to be taken into account when considering whether the foreign jurisdiction provides the appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute between the parties.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The weight to be given to what has been called a "legitimate personal or juridical advantage" was considered by your Lordships' House in the <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] A.C. 460</ref>, 482-484. The conclusion there reached was that, having regard to the underlying principle, the court should not, as a general rule, be deterred from granting a stay of proceedings simply because the plaintiff in this country will be deprived of such an advantage, provided that the court is satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the appropriate forum overseas. Reference was made, in particular, to cases concerning discovery where, as is well known, there is a spectrum of systems of discovery applicable in various jurisdictions; and the opinion was expressed that, generally speaking, injustice cannot be said to be done if a party is compelled to accept one of these well recognised systems of discovery in another forum. If I follow that approach in the circumstances of the present case, I find that French matrimonial law contains provisions for "compensation" which, unlike our own, place emphasis upon the question whether the breakdown of the marriage was due to the exclusive fault of one of the parties, providing (subject to an important exception) that a party so at fault is deprived of the right to an award of compensation. Such an approach is no longer acceptable in this country, though it bears a close resemblance to the principles applicable here not so very long ago. But it is evidently still acceptable in a highly civilised country with which this country has very close ties of friendship, not least nowadays through our common membership of the European Community; and I find it impossible to conclude that, objectively speaking, justice would not be done if the wife was compelled to pursue her remedy for financial provision under such a regime in the courts of a country which provide, most plainly, the natural forum for the resolution of this matrimonial dispute.&#8221;</p>

In addition I heard oral evidence, given remotely by the parties. I was also provided with a helpful chronology which, with some revisions, was agreed by the time of closing submissions. The main differences between the parties are in relation to the weight to be given to the events and circumstances set out below and to what, if anything, they establish in terms of the Applicant&#8217;s intentions. The court has to be cautious before accepting a party&#8217;s assertion now as to what their intentions were in the past. Firstly, there is an inherent risk of interpreting past events in retrospect to fit a preferred narrative. Secondly, in this case there are significant financial incentives to characterise an event as evidence of certain intentions or the lack of certain intentions. Even if those incentives act sub-consciously they are liable to affect the interpretations now given. I am concerned with the Applicant&#8217;s intention permanently or indefinitely to live in France. I take into account what he says about his intentions over the time I am considering but I have to weigh what he says alongside all the circumstances and other evidence before me. </p>

I found the Applicant to be occasionally argumentative when cross-examined. Mostly he was frank, but he was so determined to keep to his position that he has always intended to return to England, that he would sometimes be evasive in his answers. It is not that he would refuse to answer but that he would give answers that were indirect or prolix. The Respondent was a calm and thoughtful witness who answered questions reasonably and openly. She was asked by Mr Lewis to accept that the Applicant &#8220;bumbled along&#8221; in life but she immediately rejected that characterisation as &#8220;too harsh&#8221; and that the Applicant had done well to set up and develop his business in France. I did not think that she gave that answer with a view to gaining an advantage in the case &#8211; she was being spontaneous and sincere.

She lived in the UK until moving to France after meeting the Applicant in Z in 2006. There is a dispute about the date when the Respondent moved to Z but I rely on the Respondent&#8217;s evidence in her first statement that she and the Applicant began to live together in one of his co-owned apartments in Z in late 2007. When she was much younger, the Respondent received a substantial inheritance. She has managed that inheritance with care and with the benefit of professional advice. She owned a three bedroom property in London but that was occupied by tenants after she moved to Z and until she sold it in 2010, then purchasing a two bedroom flat in London (&#8220;the London flat&#8221;) which, whilst smaller, was nevertheless of higher value than the property she had sold earlier that year. She describes this as a &#8220;lock up and leave&#8221; flat. She has an informal arrangement with a lodger who uses the London flat on weekdays. The Applicant describes the London flat as the family&#8217;s London home. I shall make my findings about that dispute later in this judgment. The London flat was purchased by the Respondent alone and is in her sole name.</p>

The Applicant and Respondent attended open days at a well-known girls&#8217; school and a French school in London. Ultimately, Y received offers from two other London schools. It is therefore possible that she would have attended a London school, as a day pupil not a boarder, from September 2024 but tragically in December 2023 she was diagnosed with a form of cancer that has required her to undergo prolonged chemotherapy which is likely to continue until early August 2024. The evidence I received indicates that Y wishes to remain in France rather than to start school in London when she is fit to do so. She has friends in Z and does not want to move. </p>

Mr Lewis asked the Respondent whether, when she first met the Applicant, he seemed to her to be English or French and he submitted to the Court that the Applicant comes across as English.

He refers to the Respondent&#8217;s London flat, and before that her other London property, as home, but the evidence suggests a very different arrangement. Firstly, the Respondent owned the other London property herself well before the parties met. She had tenants in that property once she had moved to Z. She sold it and purchased a smaller property &#8211; the London flat &#8211; in 2010. The parties had met then and were cohabiting in Z, but the Respondent&#8217;s transactions in selling the other London property and purchasing the London flat seem to me to have been her decisions, not joint decisions with the Applicant, and were motivated by the desire to have, as she has described it, a <span style="font-style:italic">pied &#224; terre</span> in London, and an investment. Even now, eleven years after Y&#8217;s birth, the family do not have a property in England where Y has a bedroom. There is an informal lodger at the London flat. The Respondent tried to sell the flat in 2020 and had an offer that later fell through. Again, the evidence satisfies me that the decision to try to sell the London flat was hers alone. It was not considered by either party to be the Applicant&#8217;s home in England, but rather as the Respondent&#8217;s property which could provide a useful base for both parties when visiting England.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant has set out a list of his trips to England since 2014. In fact, as became clear during oral evidence, these are the trips for which he has claimed travel expenses from his company. There have been additional family visits volunteered by the Respondent in her evidence for which she paid. The majority of the trips have been for fewer than 10 days. It was accepted during submissions that the trips set out by the Applicant, when added together, made up about 7% of his time over those ten years. Noticeably, however, the trips have diminished in number and duration in the last few years. Partly this was due to Covid, but even so, there were none on the Applicant&#8217;s list in 2023 prior to the issue of the application herein, and 36 days for the whole of 2018 and 2019 combined. These trips were for the purpose of the business even though, I accept, the Applicant will have seen friends and used his visits for non-business purposes as well. Some trips to London, it was accepted, were for the purpose of transit on to the USA. The evidence as a whole paints a picture of the London flat being a useful base for occasional, usually short, visits to England with very occasional longer stays which have been for a variety of reasons including accompanying the Respondent to another part of the UK to visit an ill relative. The Respondent has calculated that since 2016 the Applicant has travelled to England for pleasure for no more than 107 out of 2,555 days. She was not challenged on that evidence. </p>

It is possible for a person to be &#8220;buffeted by the winds&#8221; as Mr Lewis put it and not to apply their minds at all to matters such as their home country but the evidence overwhelmingly points to the Applicant having made up his mind, by the end of 2016 at the latest, to settle in France. The Respondent had herself made choices which were based on the Applicant&#8217;s intention to make his permanent home in France or which were at least compatible with the Applicant&#8217;s decision to remain there indefinitely. Later, when together they added Y to their family and put her in a French school, there can be no doubt that the Applicant had made a decision to maintain his and the family&#8217;s home in Z for an indefinite time. His partner and his daughter were putting down their roots in France with no plan to leave. He had made his own choice and was now part of a family which was staying put indefinitely. Y would regard France as her home, as subsequent events have demonstrated. It was of course possible that she might go to secondary school elsewhere, including in England, but her home was going to remain in France. There was no end point either planned or envisaged for the Applicant&#8217;s residence in France. There is no evidence of any arrangements made to facilitate him moving away at any particular time in the future or at all. In the absence of persuasive evidence of an intent to move your home to another jurisdiction at some identifiable point in the future, the fact that you and your life partner have chosen to plant your child firmly within family and societal life within a country is strong evidence that you, as their parents, intend to stay there indefinitely yourselves. That at least is where the evidence points in this particular case. The Applicant, being committed to his relationship with the Respondent, as well as to his daughter, planned to remain with them in the place they had chosen as their permanent home, and there was no end date for that plan or commitment.</p>

It is recorded on the agreement, as translated, that they each wished to enter the PACS to &#8220;organise [their] common life &#8230; in the jurisdiction of [their] joint residence.&#8221; They had to present themselves before the Civil registrar of the municipality &#8220;within which you fix your common residence&#8221;. I accept that this is not a statement of intent to live in the municipality indefinitely, but it is evidence that points strongly to a choice by the Applicant to submit his relationship to the jurisdiction of the municipality of Z and therefore to the jurisdiction of France. The Applicant says that this agreement was entered into to mark the fact that the parties had been through some very difficult times. However, he accepted that there was no celebration or event with friends to mark the occasion. I prefer the evidence of the Respondent that this was done for tax purposes. Nevertheless, it further demonstrates the fact that the parties had committed to life in France. I find that they had already done so some years earlier, by 2016 at the latest, but everything that happened after 2016 until the breakdown of the relationship, including the PACS, only supports the conclusion that they were continuing to intend to stay resident in France indefinitely and permanently.</p>

All the evidence points the other way &#8211; he intended to remain permanently in France. I do not doubt that the Applicant had sometimes thought about a possible return to England (or indeed moving to live elsewhere in the world) but the evidence is that he had not formed any intent or plan to do so, either imminently, on the happening of some future event, or at all. I stress that the possibility of Y going to secondary school in London would not, without more, have entailed a change in her home, let alone the Applicant&#8217;s home.

However, in case I am wrong on domicile, and given that I have received submissions on the issue, I shall briefly address <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>. I do so on the assumed basis that the Respondent fails to establish a change of domicile and that the Applicant&#8217;s domicile of origin in England persists. The Family Procedure (Civil Partnership: Staying of Proceedings) Rules 2010 (&#8220;FP(CPSP)R 2010&#8221;) apply to civil partnership proceedings, as defined by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CPA 2004</ref>, so far as they are for a dissolution order or other specified orders or declarations. The FP(CPSP)R 2010 provide for obligatory or discretionary stays of civil partnership proceedings in this jurisdiction in certain circumstances. By Rule 4, the court is given a discretion to stay proceedings, including dissolution proceedings, where &#8220;any relevant proceedings are continuing in another jurisdiction&#8221; (&#8220;another jurisdiction&#8221; being defined within the Rules) and &#8220;the balance of fairness (including convenience) as between the parties makes it appropriate for the proceedings in that jurisdiction to be disposed of before further steps are taken in the proceedings before the court&#8221;. Rule 4(3) requires the court &#8220;in considering the balance of fairness and convenience&#8221; to have regard to &#8220;all factors appearing to be relevant, including the convenience of witnesses and any delay or expense which may result from the proceedings being stayed or not being stayed.&#8221; Here, there are no continuing proceedings in France and so the Rules would not apply. It was not contended that the Court has no power to stay outside the FP(CPSP) R 2010. Nevertheless, the criteria for considering balance of fairness and convenience&#8221; are relevant to the consideration of the forum issue.</p>

Their family home is there, they pay their taxes there, and they entered into the PACS there. The Applicant&#8217;s only assets, other than the balance of his English bank account, are in France. The Respondent does have the London flat, but she also owns the chalet. Given Y&#8217;s illness, treatment, and preference to stay in France, it is likely that the parties will be living in France for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the partnership to be dissolved is the recently registered French PACS and those who entered into that partnership continue to reside in France. Both are habitually resident there.

I have the benefit of the opinion of Ms Mulon, Lawyer at the Paris Bar, to the effect that in French law there is no duty upon a partner to help the other partner financially after the dissolution of the PACS &#8211; the Applicant could not seek financial support from the Respondent on the basis of needs for example. As for the &#8220;undivided&#8221; assets agreed to be treated as shared assets after registration of the PACS, the law in France exempts the partners&#8217; gains and salaries, property created by a partner, the personal assets of each partner, assets acquired using funds received prior to the PACS, and property acquired with funds received by gift or inheritance. It was accepted at the hearing that the effect is that there would be no division of assets due upon dissolution of the PACS under French law.

Is it right to characterise the Applicant as seeking a mere advantage or would he be deprived of &#8220;substantial justice&#8221;? In that regard I am mindful that, as Ms Mulon advises, the provisions of the French Civil Code concerning a PACS are very different from those concerning a marriage. Hence, two people in a relationship in France can choose to regulate their affairs in very different ways. In England and Wales, financial provision for partners on the dissolution of a civil partnership is much closer to that for partners following the end of a marriage. The French Republic has decided to take a different approach. It is not unfair to the Applicant that he has chosen to enter a PACS in France rather than to do nothing (or to remain under the &#8220;concubinage&#8221; declaration only, or to marry, had the Respondent so agreed). There has been no suggestion of any misunderstanding, mistake, or misrepresentation leading to the registration of the PACS. The system in France is not obviously substantially unjust. The fact that in this particular case, the French Civil Code would not afford the Applicant any financial relief arising out of his partnership with the Respondent, does not of itself lead me to conclude that substantial justice would not be done in the appropriate forum overseas even given that it is very unlikely that within that forum the Applicant will be able to obtain any financial relief following dissolution of the PACS. It is a consequence of the facts of this particular case, the parties&#8217; respective financial positions, their relationship, and the choices that this couple have made. I would not be persuaded to find, even had the Applicant invited me to do so, that the legal system governing PACS in France is inherently unjust. There is a clear difference of approach between the legal regime in England and Wales governing the dissolution of a civil partnership and the legal regime in France governing the dissolution of a PACS, but that difference does not persuade me to find as unsuitable what would otherwise be the more appropriate forum. There is certainly a financial disadvantage to the Applicant, and advantage to the Respondent, of ceding forum to France, but that is not a sufficient reason not to do so when convenience and close connection makes France the appropriate forum.</p>
