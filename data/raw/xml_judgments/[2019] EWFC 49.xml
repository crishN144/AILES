Within this context, where the grounds relied on in support of an application to terminate the appointment of the children&#8217;s guardian concern the methodology adopted by the guardian, the court may terminate the appointment where the guardian acts manifestly contrary to the child&#8217;s best interests or, but only in very rare circumstances, where the guardian has engaged in conduct that the court would ordinarily be invited simply to take into account when deciding whether to accept or reject the guardian&#8217;s evidence or recommendations.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">The local authority social services department became involved with the family in 2016, at a time when the mother was pregnant with R and living with the father.  In 2017, W, the mother&#8217;s oldest child, was taken into police protection due to concerns regarding the mother&#8217;s care of her and possible sexual risk to W.  At that time the mother signed a s.20 agreement for W and agreed to the other conditions sought by the local authority.  In fact, W absconded from the placement she had and returned to her mother&#8217;s care.  The local authority conducted a s.47 investigation, the result of which was to recommend that W and R should be subject to child protection plans and K and O to child in need plans.  Sadly, W continued to abscond from home and was then placed in a therapeutic residential placement following which she revealed the extent of sexual contact she had with a number of men.   </p>

An interim care order was made in relation to W and interim supervision orders in relating to the three younger children.  W absconded and in October was placed in secure accommodation.  In late October, the mother removed K and O from their school.  The local authority became concerned as to their whereabouts and, as a result, sought and obtained orders to enable the police to secure the return of the children.  Unfortunately, the two older children, K and O, had already been taken out of the jurisdiction by the maternal grandmother on 30 November 2017.  R had not been removed as she did not have a passport and was recovered from an address in West London. She was placed with LR, where she remains.  The local authority sought orders under the Hague Convention for the return of K and O, who had been taken to Poland. In June 2018, they were returned to this jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">Following further assessments, the local authority care plan on 9 April 2018 was to seek full care orders in relation to the three older children - W, K and O -  for W to be placed in a residential placement and for K and O to be placed with long term foster carers.  For R, the plan was to place her for adoption and in support of that, the local authority issued an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.21</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> seeking a placement order.  In their statement dated 22 April, the local authority&#8217;s evidence set out that R would stay with LR until a suitable adoptive placement was found.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">On 11 June, just prior to the final hearing, the guardian&#8217;s report was filed.  It recommended that W should remain in the residential placement under a care order and that both K and O should remain with long term foster parents under a care order. She supported R being placed for adoption, which, at that time, was understood to be being placed with a family that had not yet been identified.  No consideration was given in that report, as I understand it, to any placement of the children in Poland.   </p>

On 27 June (the penultimate date of the final hearing) the local authority filed a statement from the family finding team about the steps that had been taken by the local authority to search for and/or secure an adoptive placement for R.  It reported that LR had expressed an interest to adopt R.  The guardian gave evidence the following day, on 28 June 2018.  At the end of the hearing on 28 June, the judge made directions relating to questions addressed to the Polish Central Authority and written closing submissions, with the intention of giving judgment on 2 August.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">In her judgment on 2 August the judge concluded the threshold criteria were satisfied and then went on to consider welfare and what orders should be made. At that stage she indicated it was not her understanding that K, O or R could stay in their current placements. She expressly stated at para.126 that R must move.  No-one corrected that, even when she asked at the end of giving that judgment whether there were any errors or omissions.  At this stage, the judge indicated she could not make final decisions because she had insufficient evidence regarding the position in Poland. She adjourned the matter to 20 September.  At the adjourned hearing evidence had been obtained as to the availability of foster placements in Poland near to where the extended family lived, although it was indicated in that information that R, because of her young age, would be placed separately from her older half siblings.   </p>

It identified the five realistic options for placement of the children.  The first was for all children to remain in the UK in their current placements with R being placed for adoption.  The second was K and O to go to foster care in Poland and W and R to remain in the UK with the girls being placed for adoption.  The third was for all four children to be placed in foster care in Poland.  The fourth was for W to remain in </p>

The fifth was for R to be placed for adoption here with the other three children being placed in foster care in Poland.  The statement had a full analysis of the pros and cons of these options, including if R remained here that she may not have to move because LR had put herself forward as a prospective adoptive placement for her.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0in">The local authority concluded it supported option one; that all children would remain in this jurisdiction. No evidence was given at the hearing on 20 September.  The parents strongly supported all four children being placed in Poland.  The guardian (who had not provided a supplemental report, nor carried out any further enquiries of her own) supported W remaining here in her current placement and the three younger children being placed in Poland. This change was set out in a position statement dated 18 September. There was no further position statement on behalf of the guardian following the receipt of the local authority evidence on 19 September.   </p>

Directions were made for the local authority to file an amended care plan and a skeleton argument regarding the legal framework for the children to move to Poland. Judgment was reserved until 18 October.   </p>

Given the distressed nature of the message, the guardian returned the call, although it was a non-working day for her.  There is a summary of the call in the chronology.  </p>

Also, LR indicated she wanted to speak to the judge directly in order that the judge could change her mind.  The guardian explained that that was not easy.  The judge had made her decision after careful consideration.  The guardian provided the name of the judge and advised the foster carer to write a letter to the judge and that she may wish to discuss the matter further with her link worker, so the letter could be sent via the local authority lawyer.  In her own summary of that discussion, the guardian notes as follows: </p>

Given the care she evidently devoted to this difficult case, and the thorough way in which she crafted her judgment dated 2 August, it is obvious from her assertion that "R must move" that she was unaware of the fact that that the local authority was contemplating that the child would remain with LR. Although there was evidence about this in ZC's statement, it clearly did not feature prominently in the local authority's presentation at the hearing in July. There is no reference to it in the social worker's statement or the care plan, nor is it mentioned in the guardian's analysis. The closing submissions filed by the local authority deal predominantly with the issues of threshold. The relatively brief submissions concerning welfare options do not allude to the possibility of R remaining in her current placement. It is to my mind surprising that counsel for the local authority did not apparently correct the judge's error at the conclusion of her judgment.  </span></p>

Although the second judgment of 18 October referred to the fact that the local authority plan was for R to be adopted by her current carer, it did not take into account the specific circumstances of her current placement, the strengths of that placement, the fact that R would avoid any move at all if she remained where she currently is, and the security of that placement.  </span></p>

It may be that the lack of continuity of counsel was a contributing factor. I also note the judge listed the case at 10am at Barnet, whereas the earlier hearing had taken place at West London.

In her report dated 11 June, she had recommended that R be adopted in this country with no contact with her half-siblings and family members. Her report included an assessment of the factors in the welfare checklist and an "early permanence analysis" in which she considered the advantages and disadvantages of the various options for the children. Under the heading "adoption", she wrote: "Placement for adoption would sever the tie between R and her birth family. It could provide a stable family life throughout the remaining of her minority and beyond." At that stage, the guardian was unaware that LR had put herself forward as a prospective adopter. So far as the other children were concerned, the recommendation in the guardian's written analysis was that all three should be placed under full care orders, with W remaining in the residential unit and K and O placed in long-term foster care. At no point in her report did the guardian address the possibility of placement in Poland for any of the children.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.92in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">By the time of the adjourned hearing in September, however, the guardian's position had changed. She was now recommending that the three younger children should be placed in foster care in Poland. Despite these important developments, she did not prepare an addendum analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the options for the children, which were completely different from those identified in her report. This morning, we received a copy of written submissions made by counsel on behalf of the guardian dated 18 September which informed the court that the guardian had changed her mind and was now supporting placement of the three younger children in Poland, with W to move there once her therapeutic work was completed. In the document, counsel sets out the advantages for R perceived by the guardian in the proposed move to Poland. He did not, however, address any disadvantages. The document added that the guardian had not seen the amended care plans and reserved the right to amend her recommendations once they had been received. It is plain, therefore, that this document was filed before the guardian had read the team manager's statement dated the following day. I am concerned that the guardian reached a definitive recommendation before she had seen the local authority evidence. I am also concerned that nowhere in this position statement, nor in any other document filed on behalf of the guardian, was there any reference to the possibility of R being adopted by LR. Indeed, the document, in summarising the judgment of 2 August, repeated without comment the error that "R must move".  </span></p>

She had failed to consider the child&#8217;s attachment to her current carer with whom she had been since November 2017, and the benefits of family life with her current carer as against a childhood in a residential home with intermittent contact to her siblings.   </p>

Some concern was expressed by the Court of Appeal that the guardian&#8217;s position was reached prior to seeing the local authority&#8217;s evidence in September and the Court of Appeal was critical of the failure to factor in at all LR&#8217;s position in relation to R.   </p>

She would be content to have meetings with LR and LR&#8217;s link worker and consider the adoption assessment.  Mr Rawcliffe submits that the guardian&#8217;s wider knowledge of the case and, in particular, her dealings with the older children and the parents, would be of specific benefit to this case where the court would be considering the welfare criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children  Act 2002</ref>, including matters such as R&#8217;s relationship with relatives.  He submits this guardian has experience over the last 15 months of the parents and the older children which would be of benefit to retain.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>It is perhaps important when considering what the court&#8217;s decision should be in this case to look at the obligations imposed on those who represent a child in certain specified proceedings, as these are (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/41/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 41 (6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>). The guardian is required to safeguard the interests of the child in the manner prescribed by the rules under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/41/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.41(2)</ref>(b).  The relevant rules are set out in Practice Direction 16A Part 3 entitled &#8220;Children&#8217;s Guardian Appointed under Rule 16.3&#8221;, with a subheading, &#8220;How the children&#8217;s guardian exercises duties - investigations and appointment of solicitor&#8221;. At para.6.1 provides as follows:   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">It then goes on to set out the appointment of a solicitor etc.  The rules are clear that the obligations on the guardian are as set out under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/41/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.41(2)</ref>(b):  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">It goes without saying these are important obligations that require active investigation and assessment by the guardian before conducting a <span style="font-style:italic">B-S</span> analysis and reaching a conclusion as to what is recommended to the court.  These proceedings concern an application by the State to remove children from the care of their birth parents.  The Article 6 and 8 rights of the adults and children are engaged and require the court to undertake a careful balancing exercise in determining what order should be made.  That can only be done having considered all the evidence, including, importantly, the views on behalf of the guardian who is tasked by the primary legislation to safeguard the interests of the child in the manner prescribed by such rules in the way I have set out.  The child is a party to the proceedings for a reason; so, their position can be properly protected and, in appropriate circumstances, seek directions from the court and make applications, for example, an application for an expert under Part 25 FPR 2010.  It is not a passive role, just receiving requests or directions from others.  The need for the guardian to undertake a proactive role in appropriate cases is wholly in accordance with the rules and their obligation to &#8216;safeguard the interest of the child&#8217;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">First, while accepting this was a complex case with many competing considerations, that fact alone does not remove from the children&#8217;s guardian the obligations I have set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.41</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and PD 16A FPR 2010.  An explanation may be due to the lack of continuity of representation and other commitments, but the responsibilities imposed on the guardian remain the same.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">Secondly, Mr Rawcliffe places emphasis on the fact that there is no criticism made of the analysis undertaken in June 2018, but that, if I may say so, misses the point.  The history shows that in June 2018, the guardian&#8217;s recommendation was for R to be adopted with no continuing contact with her birth family.  That position changed dramatically to recommending placement of R in a foster placement in the same country as her siblings in Poland on the basis, it was said, of the importance of maintaining the relationship with the birth family.  On any view, that was a significant change in recommendation.  There were, in my judgment, at least three missed opportunities, to give any explanation for that change: firstly, on 2 August; secondly, on 18 September; and thirdly, on 20 September after the local authority&#8217;s evidence had been received.  It has been accepted practice for some time the need for a full <span style="font-style:italic">B-S</span> analysis prior to any decision being made, not just from the local authority, but also from the guardian who has such an important position to safeguard the welfare of the child.  This was not done and, in my judgment, amounts to an abdication of the responsibility on the s guardian as outlined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.41</ref> and PD 16A. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">The third matter I have carefully weighed in the balance is the knowledge this guardian has of the background of this case. Whilst important it would, in my judgment, be available from other sources, such as the local authority.  In any event, the facts in this case are largely self-evident in terms of the amount of face-to-face contact time there has been between the children, as between themselves and with the parents.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">Fourthly, in a case where there have been delays in deciding R&#8217;s future, it is important those involved in R&#8217;s life now have confidence in the reports the court is going to be asked to consider and, potentially, rely on in reaching a decision. That is confidence in their conclusions and preparation.  It is of note looking at the plans put before this court in relation to this guardian going forward, there is a potential defensive element in them, for example suggesting somebody else should be present when LR is seen by the guardian.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">Fifthly, the failure to provide the analysis that was required on 2 August, 20 September and 18 October was, in my judgment, contrary to R&#8217;s interests. It is in the exceptional circumstances this case presents, that I grant the application.  I am satisfied that in granting the application this will not result in additional delay and it will benefit R in that matters will be looked at afresh without the burden of the failings and criticisms made by the Court of Appeal at the hearing in January and endorsed by this court today. </p>
