	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a very sad case concerning a woman, BN, who is a lady in her mid 40&#8217;s and has no relevant medical history before events of March of this year. Due to the events set out below, North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust made a Part 8 claim dated 11 March 2022 for a declaration that BN has died due to an irreversible absence of brain-stem functioning, and, as a consequence, sought authority for mechanical ventilation and all ancillary care and treatment to be withdrawn. The application was made as BN&#8217;s foster mother, PS, at that time, disagreed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background is that on 2 March 2022 BN went to the hospital operated by the Applicant Trust, in an ambulance, suffering from migraine type headaches. She was seen in the emergency department and was returned home. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the following morning, 3 March, she was again taken to hospital by ambulance and whilst in hospital awaiting investigation, she had what was plainly a collapse and became unresponsive and had seizure like activity while being resuscitated.  She was intubated and taken to the intensive care unit for management.   She was seen initially by Dr B, and then when she reached the intensive care unit by Dr A. They are both consultants in anaesthetics and intensive care and they between them have been responsible for BN&#8217;s treatment over the course of the last fortnight. I have heard from Dr A today, and I am very grateful to him for his assistance to this court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">BN was initially the subject of a CT scan and the images were reviewed by a vascular consultant on call at Addenbrookes, which is part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The diagnosis suggested an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage and possible tonsillar herniation. To put this into slightly different words, the human brain has several layers and BN had suffered from a very severe bleed between the layers and there was a subarachnoid haemorrhage. So severe was the haemorrhage that the brain swelled and the swelling filled the narrow hole between the skull and the spinal canal. That sort of injury brings with it the high possibility of brain damage and irreversible damage of the brain-stem, and damage to BN&#8217;s ability to react, be conscious and to breathe. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The clinical picture seen by the doctors confirmed the CT scan. BN was unresponsive and she could not breathe on her own. She did not react to light or respond to any verbal or physical stimuli. The Glasgow Coma Scale tests were carried out on 3 March 2022, and have been repeated at least twice a day since then. The Glasgow test comprises of 3 elements, (i) whether or not the patient will open his or her eyes, either voluntarily or with stimuli; (ii) whether limb responses can be obtained voluntarily or to stimuli; and (iii) whether a verbal response can be obtained. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each of the tests is marked with the lowest mark of 1 and the highest of 4, 5, or 6, depending on the nature of the test. It follows therefore that the lowest possible response is 3. BN very sadly was completely unresponsive. There was no opening of her eyes, no responsiveness of her limbs, and no verbal response, and thus it was that she scored 3/15. She has remained in the intensive care unit and there has been no improvement of any sort. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The treating team took a second opinion, from, first of all, the consultant neurosurgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The response received was that surgical intervention was futile. The doctor who gave that advice had seen the CT scan and the Glasgow Coma Scales Scores and had carried out discussions with the medical team. Normally the treating team would go no further than that, but, at the family&#8217;s behest, as they wanted a further opinion, the treating team consulted with a neighbouring trust and spoke to the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, and were in communication with a consultant neurosurgeon there. The response received from him was the same as that as had been received from Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. </p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;First, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness does not by itself entail individual death. Patients in the vegetative state (VS) have also lost this capacity (see section 6.9). The difference between them and patients who are declared dead by virtue of irreversible cessation of brain-stem function is that the latter cannot continue to breathe unaided without respiratory support, along with other life- sustaining biological interventions. This also means that even if the body of the deceased remains on respiratory support, the loss of integrated biological function will inevitably lead to deterioration and organ necrosis within a short time. </span></p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Second, the diagnosis of death because of cessation of brain-stem function does not entail the cessation of all neurological activity in the brain. What does follow from such a diagnosis is that none of these potential activities indicates any form of consciousness associated with human life, particularly the ability to feel, to be aware of, or to do, anything. Where such residual activity exists, it will not do so for long due to the rapid breakdown of other bodily functions. </span></p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Third, there may also be some residual reflex movement of the limbs after such a diagnosis. However, as this movement is independent of the brain and is controlled through the spinal cord, it is neither indicative of the ability to feel, be aware of, or to respond to, any stimulus, nor to sustain respiration or allow other bodily functions to continue.</span></p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">In short, while there are some ways in which parts of the body may continue to show signs of biological activity after a diagnosis of irreversible cessation of brain-stem function, these have no moral relevance to the declaration of death for the purpose of the immediate withdrawal of all forms of supportive therapy. It is for this reason that patients with such activity can no longer benefit from supportive treatment and legal certification of their death is appropriate&#8221;. </span></p>

Its purpose is for the confirmation or otherwise of the cessation of brain-stem function by neurological testing of brain-stem reflexes. The tests that were carried out by the two doctors I have already named (Dr A and Dr B) are described in slightly, although not significantly, different terms to those as mentioned in Re M (Declaration of Death of Child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/164" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 164" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 164</ref>.

The tests are also carried out after excluding any reversible signs or causes of coma, and they involve therefore establishing certain pre-conditions before the tests are carried out. It is important, and the template sets out in bold, that there is exclusion of reversible causes of coma and apnoea, and that attempts should be made to maintain relatively normal cardiovascular and respiratory physiological parameters in the preceding hours prior to testing. That means, for example, that the mean arterial pressure at the time of testing needs to be consistently greater than the measurement that is set out in the guidelines, and in addition, the carbon dioxide levels and oxygen levels again need to be as prescribed, as do the PH levels. </p>

That requires raising in the pressures of the blood of carbon dioxide as that is the main stimulator in the body to start breathing. The patient is disconnected from the ventilator, carbon dioxide is raised, but for the duration of the test of in excess of 5 minutes, there was no sign of BN spontaneously breathing. </p>

In short, there is nothing that the medical profession can carry out that would assist in any way, and the 2008 Code is clear that death can be diagnosed by establishing the cessation of brain-stem function and that no additional tests are required.</p>

Her foster-carer, PS, has been present throughout the hearing today, has been made a party to these proceedings by me, and has cross examined Dr A, and has addressed me with dignity, common sense and realism. By the end of the hearing, she did not oppose the finding that is sought by the Trust, but made the understandable and proper request that she would like to be at the hospital when the systems are turned off and have the chance, with her daughter, to say a proper farewell to BN. I am grateful to Dr A for agreeing, notwithstanding whatever his preference might be, that the hospital would not seek to turn off the machines before 12 noon on Friday 18 March 2022 in order to allow PS and her daughter the opportunity she seeks. </p>
