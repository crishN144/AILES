This was cut short in 2019, and so the family returned to UK to rented accommodation in London.</p>

This practice is becoming commonplace and should be stopped in its tracks in the interests of efficiency and the conservation of the resources of the court. Suggested corrections should be confined to typographical or plain numerical errors, or to obvious mistakes of fact.

There is obviously a significant overlap here with the effects of change and so within this, what may be the impact on the child of the change of their relationship with the left behind parent?  How secure is that relationship now and how likely is it to endure and thrive if the child moves?  How realistic are the proposals for maintaining contact?  What will be the impact on the removing party of having to remain in England, contrary to their wishes?  What will be the consequent impact on the child?  What will be the impact on the left behind parent of the child moving?  Will the ability of either parent to provide care for the child be adversely affected by the refusal or grant of the application and if so to what extent?  To what extent will loss of contact with the left behind family be made up for by extension of contact with the family in the new country.</span></p>

It was obvious from both the report and her evidence that RO was concerned about this, although RO did not consider that M&#8217;s upset had tipped over into any sinister attempt to exclude F from M&#8217;s life. She was simply upset by the situation in which she found herself, and therefore found it difficult to accept help from F. RO had a considerable amount of sympathy with M: she hoped that she would not feel that her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fate had been sealed</span>&#8221; or that previous decision making about moving to London was in any way contractual.

I do not consider that RO&#8217;s report started from the wrong point, in particular because RO picked up from the outset on the need for stability and continuity in what has been a time of change for S. By the time of the report, the arrangements had been endorsed by the Court and had been in place for a significant period of time. In my view it would be artificial to treat the previous arrangements when the parties were (at least) living under the same roof as the starting point as this in no way reflected S&#8217;s lived experience at the time of the assessment. S had adjusted to life in this way. It would be wholly artificial. </p>

It was said that this diminished the quality of RO&#8217;s evidence as there was no first-hand, objective account of F&#8217;s relationship with S. In a case where conflict is rife, I am disappointed that RO did not also meet F in person, and observe S in his care. It is obvious to me that there is a need to approach both parents equally and, although I do not consider that an experienced social worker would allow the medium to skew her analysis, it is clear that this perception of inequality has made things worse, and not better. I do not consider, however, this to be a point of any great relevance, on the facts of this case, because I have nothing but praise offered from both parents and RO in respect of S&#8217;s bond and relationship with F. In my view, the formulation of their relationship by RO accords with the canvass of evidence in this case that I have, and I therefore do not consider that RO&#8217;s evidence is diminished on its own by a failure to meet with F. </p>

There is much to rely upon, in particular the need to promote stability for a young girl whom has borne much change. I found her analysis of the relationship between the parents to be compelling. RO brought to life the poor state of the parental relationship, and the drivers for this: the mistrust between them, M&#8217;s sense of emotional depletion and abandonment, F&#8217;s sense of injustice with the family justice system viewing M as the &#8216;primary carer&#8217; and his preoccupation with equality of time leading F to reject time with S as he wanted &#8216;all or nothing&#8217;. I find her analysis in respect of &#8216;shared care&#8217; requiring practical and emotional alignment between the parents to be compelling. I reject the suggestion that this is legally wrong: the law requires me to look at S&#8217;s welfare and assess practically whether any proposal is workable. RO&#8217;s view was not based on a hard and fast legal rule: it was a case specific observation about this family and this child. I have no reason to consider that RO hasn&#8217;t taken this seriously. </p>

What is missing is a comparative analysis of what S&#8217;s life in Eastern Europe would be like, or how she may find threads of stability in Eastern Europe with M. There is no consideration of the ways that life in London may be destabilising for her now, or in the future, save for an acknowledgment that F&#8217;s suggested solution was not a panacea for instability. It is clear from Miss Ramsahoye&#8217;s cross examination that RO regarded the education and living arrangements in Eastern Europe favourably, but this was regrettably missing from the report RO provided. Likewise, RO referred to M as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;emotionally depleted&#8217;</span> and painted a bleak picture were M to remain in UK with S, which did not factor into her analysis in terms of welfare. This is important as I cannot simply separate S and M artificially: their interests are relational and inextricably linked. RO has in my view not given any consideration to the relational effect on S of one of the two most important people to S being in such a state for a prolonged period. This would undoubtably be damaging for S.</p>

This was the focus of the analysis, and the concerns about the impracticality of M&#8217;s proposal that F visit Eastern Europe every few weeks was one of the significant tenets of RO&#8217;s analysis.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment this is a superficial analysis of why the relationship would be in any way harmed. First, there is no consideration of F&#8217;s work commitments and pattern, and how spending time with F around these considerable pressures &#8211; and in large part in wraparound care &#8211; would impact the relationship. F&#8217;s support network is no more extensive than M&#8217;s in UK, and his parents remain a flight away in Europe. This is as opposed to intensive periods of holiday contact where S would have F&#8217;s undivided attention. Second, there is no recognition of the capability of M to promote the relationship between F and S. In the past 16 months, S has continued to build an excellent relationship with F despite a reduction in the time they spent together, and despite of M&#8217;s feelings towards F. This simply would not have happened without the support of M. It is inherently unlikely in my judgment that M is anything other than highly supportive of the relationship between S and F. S adores her father; she speaks highly of him, and enjoys the time they spend together. S has a vivid and well established picture of who her father is, and I see no reason why this would not continue. There is no evidence in my view to support the proposition that distance leads to fracture, on the facts of this case, where M is supportive of S and F&#8217;s bond. Although the time they would spend together would be less frequent, it would be of no less quality. I am satisfied that the relationship meets the condition set down by RO herself of being &#8220;solid.&#8221; </p>

However, in my judgment, the report in respect of M&#8217;s relocation proposal contains a poverty of analysis of the options available to me, and fails to unpick F&#8217;s suggestion that a move to Eastern Europe would be damaging to his relationship with S. The weight I can therefore place on this analysis is diminished. </p>

M raised no issue with F&#8217;s ability to parent S, and acknowledged that S and F&#8217;s relationship was an important one. M told me that she always promoted the relationship between S and F, but was frustrated because she did the &#8220;lion share&#8221; of caring. She pointed to the fact that M was responsible for looking after S whilst she was sick. M explained the background when she was asked about using the word &#8216;limiting&#8217; in her application, when describing F and S&#8217;s relationship. Much time was spent exploring the suggestion that M&#8217;s choice of words in her application were evidence of malintent, but I do not consider this to be a good point. The application was prepared in M&#8217;s second language, against a context where S was spending less and less time with F. The passage of time has shown the opposite to be true &#8211; M has promoted F&#8217;s relationship and ensured that S has spent plenty of time with F. This is against a high-conflict background where the parties and their lawyers have been at odds about a seemingly endless list of issues. In addition, M suggested in response that S was unsure and uncertain about her new environment. I find it inherently likely that this is correct &#8211; S was a very young child, dealing with the fracture of her care givers&#8217; relationship that she was unable to understand. It is credible that S&#8217;s reactions were unpredictable and that she may have been resistant to visits away from M. </p>

M told me that &#8220;all that was discussed were care arrangements in this country.&#8221; It was put to her that there was no suggestion within mediation that she may wish to move to Eastern Europe. M told me that she had had conversations previously. Given that the mediation was taking place concurrently with the preparation of the location pack, I have some sympathy with F&#8217;s unhappiness. I do not accept that M has been malicious in making her application, and there is not enough evidence for me to find that the application was reactive; it is clear that M has put a great deal of thought into relocation and her suggestions. However, it is unfortunate that such an important issue was not transparently aired during an important flashpoint in the parents&#8217; relationship. As M rightly criticises F for his &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; attitude to shared care from the outset of the separation, F can properly criticise M for her coyness at this stage.  </p>

Mr Evans put to M that she was misleading the Court by presenting me with a family that is not really her family; I do not accept this. I see no reason why the concept of the &#8216;psychological parent&#8217; cannot apply to the family. The people M described are important attachment figures in M&#8217;s life; they are not a disparate collection of strangers. To suggest that important figures are outwith a family because of a lack of direct biological connection is in my view a retrograde conception of the family. I reject that submission in its entirety.

M explained how the group came to be, and the organic way that the parents were added. It was put to M that she was exclusionary in the way this was discussed, and she made comments on the group that could have led to a negative perception of F. Those comments were that S could not attend a birthday party because she was spending time with F.

That S not only sees F regularly but holds him in the warmest of affection has happened, in my view, because of and not in spite of M. F and S&#8217;s relationship has blossomed post-separation. There is no evidence that M has repeatedly made such comments to S, nor sought in any meaningful way to limit F and S&#8217;s relationship once a post separation rhythm was established.

This relationship has blossomed of late. In my view, this is because M has tried to promote this relationship, even though she feels abandoned by him and clearly found parenting S alone to be a difficult experience with little respite. An example of this insight was the way she adapted the proposal for F&#8217;s accommodation in Eastern Europe &#8211; she has moved to an expensive but sensible solution of hiring out an apartment, at her own expense, to host F in Eastern Europe. This will enable S to have consistency of environment, and for F to be a part of S&#8217;s life in Eastern Europe for the time he is there. I was impressed by this. </p>

There were occasions where F made claims to fortify his position that weren&#8217;t true. In his evidence, F told me that M has ensured that S did not see her paternal grandmother and uncle. It became clear very quickly that this was not true, and such visits had happened and been promoted several times in UK by M. S saw her grandmother in February 2023 and summer 2022 with M&#8217;s agreement. Likewise, in his statement, he described being marginalised from the outset of separation. In fact, contact was happening from the off, and F was visiting M and S at their home. I accept that contact stuttered at the start, but I found the gloss which F put on this throughout his evidence to be confusing and unhelpful. When it was put to him that he did not have good words to say about M, and this was clouding his recollection, he replied &#8220;I don&#8217;t say things positively, I am just describing facts.&#8221; This was a disappointing level of insight.</p>

When describing the situation post-separation in 2022, and collecting S from nursery, F gave suspicious evidence about S&#8217;s behaviour and words. He interpreted her reticence and nervousness during a time of immense change and instability as part of a subterfuge against him. He described her behaviour for the first time in oral evidence as &#8220;really scary&#8221; and suggested that M was unsettling her. He presented this as a situation cultivated by M, but conceded that he had taken S home three times from overnight visits because she was so confused and unsettled. He rejected video calls because they were &#8220;not meaningful.&#8221; F&#8217;s evidence on these points firstly showed an inability to situate himself with S and understand her experiences at this time, and secondly showed me that during this time he allowed his own perceptions and wishes to vitiate his judgement where S&#8217;s needs were concerned. </p>

His intense mistrust of M shone through and he spent his evidence largely venting about M, making fresh allegations and launching into speeches. It was obvious that the breakdown of the relationship was raw to him, and his desire to control the evidence according to this narrative was clear. This unfortunately diminished my assessment of him as somebody who could provide me with an objective assessment of what he thought best for S, and whose negative view of M and the situation ultimately clouded his views. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, I do not think that F&#8217;s manner is informed by malice or a desire to be obstructive, but out of frustration that nobody has listened to him. At the end of his evidence, F thanked me in a fulsome way for my time and for listening to what he had to say. This makes perfect sense when one considers the background: M has taken on the primary caring role for S, which has caused F to feel relegated. The prospect of S moving to Eastern Europe has left F feeling hoodwinked that such things were not discussed in mediation, and left out of the loop when a significant amount of preparatory work has been done by M. I have criticised a lack of transparency and what I consider to be a carelessness with M&#8217;s approach to F, and I have the resounding feeling having listened carefully to his evidence that this carelessness has made it worse. Carelessness when it takes place in high octane litigation breeds mistrust. I found F to be a witness whose evidence was laced with the sadness of this feeling, but regrettably has let it cloud his assessment of where S&#8217;s interests lie. </p>

On the contrary, however, I do consider that M&#8217;s relationship with S would be undermined by S spending long periods of her week with F, whilst F remains swamped in conflict and a feeling of injustice. I do not consider that at present F has shown an ability to extract his own ill feeling from his evidence and outlook. In all likelihood, I find that this would affect his parenting. I am concerned that there is a real risk that F may allow this ill feeling to permeate his interactions with S. I am concerned that F would continue to put pressure on M, if I maintain the status quo, to progress contact, and is showing no signs of understanding how his protestations of equality harms, and does not help S. </p>

In addition, the success of such a plan requires skilled co-parenting. This is not something in my view that the parents in this case are capable of. In my view, were I to order an equal division of time, I would be ordering future conflict and instability to be present in S&#8217;s life. RO&#8217;s evidence that S is simply too young to bear this change, and the parents&#8217; relationship too poor, resonates firmly with me. </p>

It was said that the timing of a move, being effectively in three weeks&#8217; time, would be too soon and surprising for S, who is unaware of the proceedings. In my view, for the plan to be realistic and for S&#8217;s welfare interests to be protected, the move should take place as soon as possible. I do not consider that it would be satisfactory for S to start school in UK, and deal with the upheaval and routine changes this brings, and then have this disrupted with a bigger life change. S&#8217;s long term stability and ability to invest in her new home and environment are contingent upon this move being completed in a timely way. In so far as this may be difficult for S, it will be for both parents to manage this process with S, and it is not for me to micro-manage two capable parents in how they do this. </p>

The answer to this is an unequivocal yes. The strength of the M&#8217;s unhappiness at present is palpable; that RO described M as &#8216;desolate&#8217; is a significant cause of concern. I note that M described life in England as a little more bearable in her evidence &#8211; she described being integrated in S&#8217;s school life, and happier because of the routine with S&#8217;s care. That M has adjusted as a necessity is laudable, but my impression through M&#8217;s evidence was that she was still largely unhappy in UK.

I have already outlined that S&#8217;s needs require an arrangement where consistency is promoted as much as possible. This means allowing S to embed in her home and school, see her new friends and family, and take part in the full ambit of community and school life. It would be harmful to S&#8217;s sense of permanency to permit such a long time away from home, where she would be unable to attend clubs with her friends, playdates and embark on the sort of capers with friends that the long holiday is for. In my view, the best balance would be a half and half arrangement, with the first three, and then the last two, weeks being spent with F in UK, Eastern Europe or Central Europe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The &#8216;expert&#8217; (as it is headed &#8211; this report was not directed or is in any way compliant with FPR25) report dated 23 January 2023 outlines the position in respect of this, and F argues that this means that once M moves, his position is brittle and at the whim of the Eastern European Jurisdiction. This is echoed vividly in Mr Evans&#8217; preliminary document. However, as I have set out I have no concern that M would attempt to vary the Order. On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that M will safeguard the relationship between F and S, even if the law in Eastern Europe is perhaps &#8216;concerning&#8217; (to quote Mr Evans) with regards to its obligations under the treaties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Tying these threads together, it is, in my judgment, overwhelming in S&#8217;s welfare interests to move to Eastern Europe with her mother. This will best give her the stability that she needs, and insulate her from harm, which I have found that the alternatives do not. The balance firmly and wholly falls on the side of a move to Eastern Europe. I have no doubt that she will continue to thrive in M&#8217;s capable care. I have no doubt that she will have a wonderful relationship with F through direct and indirect contact. I have every faith that the certainty that this Order brings to the future will reduce S&#8217;s exposure to parental conflict, and allow the parents to adjust to the future as it has now crystalised. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I am of the view that contact between F and S must be regular, and both direct and indirect. I am of the view that both M and F must ensure that this happens, and I will share the responsibility for travel. S needs to know that both of her parents support the relationship with F, and see that promotion in action. That contact must follow the significant events in the calendar and S&#8217;s parents&#8217; lives. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">This will be a significant change for S. The parents must work together to break this news to S in a child focussed and sensitive way. I have explained that I consider it in her best interests for this move to happen as soon as possible. The benefits of this for S&#8217;s long-term stability outweighs any concerns about such a move taking place abruptly. </p>
