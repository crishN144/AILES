Consequently, she would be likely to expect her child to accept and accede to wishes and demands.

As a consequence, I would have concerns that a child in that environment could experience emotional harm and have their lived experience misrepresented/denied. Consequently, I would have concerns the mother may struggle to recognise and respond to her child&#8217;s emotional needs and have difficulties prioritizing those needs above her own.

The child&#8217;s presentation is in line with this formulation as his mother is of the primary emotional importance to him and he is in my opinion well aware of mother&#8217;s feelings towards father and well aware of his sister&#8217;s feelings towards his father and may not be able to hold on to any positives he may feel or remember&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">(page 285)</span></p>
