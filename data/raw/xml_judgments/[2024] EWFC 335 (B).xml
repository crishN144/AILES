	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I have had significant involvement in the life of Jane and Peter over the last three years or so. (i) Previous proceedings commenced in October 2021 and in August 2022 I held a fact finding hearing in which I made findings against Simon summarised at the end of the associated judgment as including: partner abuse (of Sally and another); neglect by Simon of an older daughter non-subject to these proceedings (Olivia), and; physical and verbal abuse of Olivia. I was asked to, but did not, make findings of sexual abuse of Olivia by Simon. In September 2024 at a criminal re-trial Simon was convicted of sexually abusing Olivia in terms which I understand mirror, or largely mirror, the allegations previously placed before me. At a first trial he had been convicted of child neglect of a manner which I believe fits within my earlier findings. He is now awaiting sentence but the indications are that he will face a custodial sentence in excess of 10 years. (ii) At a subsequent welfare hearing in December 2022 I approved the continuing placement of both children with Sally under a 12-month Supervision Order. (iii) The current proceedings commenced in September 2023 with the local authority seeking to extend the supervision order. In February 2024 the local authority issued a new application for a care order with respect to the children. This became the lead application. There has been very substantial judicial continuity throughout the proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The heart of this debate before me is as to what the Court should do on the basis of the threshold being crossed. The issue is whether the children&#8217;s welfare supports a placement with their grandmother or remaining with their mother. This requires a balancing exercise to be conducted and an analysis of the various positives and negative of each option to inform the welfare conclusions. In this regard there is no presumption in favour of Sally as a biological parent. Tied in with this question is recognition of the fact that any order will amount to an interference in the family life of the various individuals including the children and that such interference has to be justified to be authorised.</span></p>

I will approach this on the basis the local authority have to prove the allegations made with there being no duty on either of Sally or Simon to disprove what is said (although their response is very important). The local authority will prove the allegation if the evidence persuades me, it is more likely than not what is said to have happened did happen. It will then become a fact in the proceedings. In considering these issue I have regard to all the evidence and particularly that of Simon and Sally. If I find either have lied to me then I should approach that finding with care before concluding they cannot be trusted generally. I would need to assess the motivations behind any lie before giving wider application.</span></p>

The outcome of the last proceedings was that Simon posed a risk of emotional harm to the children were they to once again witness domestic abuse of Sally within their home. This was complicated by Simon&#8217;s struggle with drink and drugs and the impact this had on his impulsivity and ability to regulate his emotions and actions when impacted by the same. On the basis of the findings with respect to Olivia one could not be confident the children themselves would not suffer direct harm from Simon.

But she limited this to occasional calls and messages which were restricted to simply updating him as to Peter&#8217;s progress and matters of that sort. She denied the relationship had continued or resumed. She disputed being with him when allegedly sighted in May 2023. She did not know whether he had caused the criminal damage to her home in January 2023 but noted he was arrested close by. As regards the Spain trip she gave an account of Simon&#8217;s sister being due to travel as part of a &#8216;girls trip&#8217; with her and other friends but she had then pulled out and sold her plane ticket to her brother. But this was as far as the matter went, Simon had not been involved in the holiday. As regards the telephone calls these arose in circumstances in which an ex-partner of Simon&#8217;s (who is also a friend of Sally&#8217;s) had use or ownership of the phone in question and had been the participant in the messaging which caused concern. Simon&#8217;s account was in essentially similar terms. In relation to the incident when he called the social worker, he claimed he was with a friend who had a child also called Peter and that is the child he was speaking to. Both the local authority and guardian probed this evidence and were evidentially suspicious as to the reality of the events in question. The guardian put her level of suspicion as being 8-10 out of 10.</span></p>

I have regard to the disclosure of similar messaging within the fact-finding process and there is a strong similarity in play. Having regard to the timing of the messaging I am in little doubt this reflects a relationship beyond that described by the parents.

The sense is of the two being enmeshed. In her evidence she showed insight as to her vulnerability (with which I agree) and the basis for this being previous abandonment. She was open in her evidence as to her vulnerability to Simon&#8217;s emotions and responsive to her sense of his needs. In the fact finding it was clear she minimised the risk to herself from domestic violence and there was a sense in which she felt she could make this work and repair the situation, that she could perhaps change Simon. I appreciate few relationships are one-dimensional and it is likely for all the justified criticisms of Simon that there would have been points in time when the relationship was positive. It is likely a combination of this and Sally&#8217;s own vulnerabilities have caused her to poorly calibrate the balance that should be struck between the risk of harm and the benefits of continuing. My previous judgments should have been a wakeup call for her. During this hearing Simon expressed himself in very clear and positive terms as to her qualities as a mother. I watched her with care at that point and could see this was hard for her to hear. I agree with her that change for her is a &#8216;work in process&#8217;. My concern is that she has lowered defences so far as Simon is concerned and whereas I do not suggest he actively seeks to exploit this, it seems likely his presentational manner to her has this impact. He has the tendency to present as something of a victim and a person who is suffering and I consider this is something Sally struggles to walk away from.</span></p>

Taken together these would have a significant negative impact on the children.

I have noted the previous challenged in her presentation and I have regard to the risk that further change may now upset this progress.

There is evidence of previous abuse and Sally&#8217;s vulnerability extends beyond this relationship. Yet a significant focus in this case is Sally and Simon&#8217;s enmeshed relationship. I agree with the guardian when she speaks of Olivia intervening in this case to provide a lifeline for Sally to make change. I agree this is a real opportunity that can and must be taken. I appreciate that in approaching this question there is a worry over transparency on the part of Sally. There can be no doubt that Simon&#8217;s likely lengthy incarceration places this analysis in a very different context. Whilst I am not entirely persuaded Sally has fully digested the implications of Simon&#8217;s conviction, I accept her evidence to me that this conviction is one which genuinely disturbs her and will likely impact on the way in which she views Simon. It is important for me to bear in mind that my findings set out above all arose in circumstances following my contrary finding. Sally was then entitled to proceed on the basis Simon did not abuse Olivia, she now knows he did.

In the case of Sally, it is accepted that she provides the children with good care. The improvements in Jane&#8217;s presentation are testament to this. I also recognise her willingness to seek to make change. I acknowledge the evidence of the guardian in this regard. In my assessment she presents as an intelligent person who genuinely wants the best for her children and can provide this for them if not distracted. She appears to be interested in work to improve herself and I have little doubt she will fully engage. She did so in previous assessments and has sought out the Freedom Programme herself. I also accept she is driven to make changes and I am impressed by the efforts she has made off her own back in this regard. She deserves credit for this.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I do not subscribe to the notion Sally must now be celibate. This is an unrealistic suggestion. The key for this case is her ability to consider and enter such relationship from an informed position and mindful of signs which might cause a concern as to potential abuse. There are of course many partners who will not pose this risk. My concern is that Sally is vulnerable to individuals who pose a risk not that she is inherently attracted to them as a result of this characteristic. As a result, this is not a case in which Sally leaves proceedings believing the judicial view is that any relationship </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">is</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> (not might be) a risky relationship and that she would avoid entering any relationship as a result. I fear that state of mind would increase the risk of concealment and with it increase the chance of repetition. Rather, I would hope she actions what she told me in evidence. She would not jump into a relationship and would first use the resources available (Claire and Sarah&#8217;s law) to understand whether such an individual has a known risky history. There is no reason why she should fear notifying the local authority in such a case. If the individual has a clean bill of health, then she might proceed with the normal caution all people take when testing a new relationship. However, if the individual has issues of note then she is informed and can step away before she becomes entwined. She has told me she will act in this way and frankly if her children remain with her, they deserve nothing less.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I consider the undoubted risks in this case cannot determine the outcome in isolation. I must balance against this risk the counter risk to the children of removal from the care of their mother. I assess it as being very likely the children will suffer significant emotional harm arising out of the same notwithstanding the positives Felicity can bring. It concerns me that Jane has only recently obtained some stability and appears to be looking forward to the next stage of her life with Sally. It concerns me that the children will find it very hard to make sense of their removal in such circumstances. The evidence of the guardian in this regard was impressive and highly persuasive.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I am therefore balancing a likely significant risk against a lower and possible level of risk. I must also have regard to the potential to mitigate or ameliorate the second risk by providing support to Sally through appropriate domestic violence work. I am of course engaged in a proportionality exercise if I am to justify removal as suggested. I have no doubt the children will receive good and loving care whether with Sally or Felicity. But will they suffer more if they are removed and to an extent unwarranted by the actual current risks present when seen in the light of the opportunity to ameliorate the same by active work which I judge Sally will engage in given the chance?</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">In my assessment the balance comes down in favour of non-removal. In my judgment the right answer for these children and the one that best accords with their welfare interests is to remain in the care of their mother under a supervision order and with the surrounding support that Felicity, Bob and other family members can offer. This needs to have support of the orders the Court can make and a written agreement with clear expectation. Whilst this does not remove all risk it is the right answer.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The expert evidence from DV Act recommends Sally engage in a bespoke piece of DV work. The guardian supports this wholeheartedly and explained why a generic piece of support as is currently offered by the Freedom Programme &#8211; whilst worthy in its own right &#8211; falls short of what is needed. I agree entirely with this view. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I do not want to see these children before me again and I consider it would be failure of the highest order were that to occur through a shortsighted failure to now provide a piece of work that might successfully remove the very risks the local authority fears.</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> As I noted the costs of the same are not far from the costs of a new set of proceedings and far below the costs arising were proceedings to repeat. This local authority must immediately apply its mind to this judgment. I appreciate the supervision plan will now pass to authority X, there must be a supervision order for 12 months, but I fear unless this is grappled with by this local authority nothing but the Freedom Programme will occur. As I suggested I want confirmation from the local authority that this is their revised plan of action or alternatively a clear letter explaining why they differ from my opinion (and that of the guardian). This letter must come from a senior manager within the team and must be copied to the parties and held on the file. If this is not done and the worst occurs then they will no doubt be asked to account for their failures. I would want this letter within 14 days.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I turn my mind to the relationship between Simon and Peter. Simon does not seek face to face indirect contact or direct contact. He seeks the opportunity to send a limited amount of indirect contact each year and a regular update as to Peter&#8217;s welfare. The concern I share is that contact has the potential to undermine work being undertaken by Sally and once again lower her defences. For these reasons I take a cautious approach to contact. I am assisted by Simon&#8217;s concessions in this regular and I give him credit for the same. In my judgment the balance must favour security for the children above all else. Anything which undermines their placement must be avoided. In my judgment this contact comes close to but is not the same as the identity contact found following a placement order and adoption. In my assessment the balance is as follows:</span></p>

I do not want to draw sally into direct communication with Simon and would hope a structure can be set to avoid this going forward.</span></p>
