	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an exceptionally difficult case. It involves allegations that a small baby, E, sustained a series of unusual injuries inflicted by one of her parents in January 2013. Some of those injuries are said to have occurred while the child was in hospital. The child has an older sister, I, who at the age of 5 months sustained a fractured finger. At the time that was attributed to an unwitnessed accident but, following the injuries sustained by E, further scrutiny has now been directed at that incident. The local authority has therefore started care proceedings in respect of both children, seeking findings that the injuries sustained by both children were inflicted by one of their parents. It is said that the perpetrator was seeking to induce symptoms of illness or injury in the child. Furthermore, it is said that the other parent is culpable of failure to protect the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has been transferred to the High Court and reserved to me. The proceedings have been bedevilled by difficulties about disclosure by the police and a hospital trust, and as a result the hearing has been adjourned several times and greatly delayed. It started on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, and this judgment is now being delivered today, 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014, three and a half months later. Fortunately, the girls are placed under interim care orders with their paternal grandparents with whom they are plainly thriving. Nevertheless, the delay, and the reasons for the delay discussed below, are matters of great concern to this court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the mother&#8217;s childhood and adolescence, she had a number of issues with behavioural and emotional difficulties. She was referred to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (&#8220;CAMHS&#8221;) on several occasions. In 2006, aged 14, she went missing from home for several days. Her medical and CAMHS records revealed that she had issues about anger and was prone to extreme mood swings and violent outbursts at home. There were reports that she had been bullied at school. On two occasions, in June 2007 and November 2008, she took an overdose of Paracetamol. There were other occasions when she harmed herself, as demonstrated by scars seen on her arms. Her GP described her as having suspected obsessive compulsive traits. Matters deteriorated in 2009 to the point where the mother was received into local authority care for a period of 18 months. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By comparison, the father&#8217;s childhood and adolescence were uneventful. He met the mother in mid 2010 and they started a relationship. In August 2010, the mother suffered a miscarriage. She became pregnant again almost immediately afterwards. In the course of the later police investigation in 2013, it was revealed that in the early stages of this pregnancy, the mother made various searches on her computer using criteria such as &#8220;is 19 too young to have a baby&#8221;, &#8220;giving a child up for adoption&#8221; and &#8220;painless ways to kill yourself&#8221;. </p>

Mother and baby were discharged from hospital five days later. At around this time, the family moved into a flat, having previously lived with the father&#8217;s parents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011, the father consulted his GP, inquiring about the possibility of relationship and anger management counselling for himself and the mother. Subsequently in police interview, the father denied that there had been any difficulties other than a &#8216;rough patch&#8217; in the relationship. On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, the mother was seen by her GP and diagnosed with suffering from significant post natal depression, scoring 28 out of 30 on the Edinburgh scale. She was prescribed one month&#8217;s supply of antidepressants, but thereafter did not seek medical attention for this condition again. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the months following her birth, I was taken to the doctor on a number of occasions. On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, her parents reported to the GP that she was showing signs of gastro-oesophageal reflux, with projectile vomiting 2-3 times a day. In a phone call on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, the mother told the GP that I &#8220; has vomited a bit of blood&#8221;. When I was examined again at the surgery, the diagnosis of reflux was repeated. I was admitted to hospital overnight. The mother told the hospital that I had blood-stains and mucous in her vomit. The conclusion reached by medical staff at hospital was that I&#8217;s problems were caused by over feeding. It was thought that the red blood in the vomit had been probably due to a &#8220;Mallory-Weiss tear&#8221;. The parents were advised to observe carefully for further episodes of blood in her vomit. </p>

The mother reported that this had been sustained in an unwitnessed fall while the father was at work. I had fallen from a swing chair one foot off the floor. There were no complications and I was discharged. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012, I was taken by mother to the GP with concerns about her little finger. The medical record states that her left little finger was &#8220;slightly warm and swollen&#8221; but fully mobile. There was no history of trauma and no specific tenderness when it was touched. The GP thought that it had possibly been sprained. Later that day, the mother took I to the GP again. The GP recorded that the finger had a &#8220;miniscule blister medially? inside&#8221;. I was observed to be still using the finger tip with a toy and the doctor concluded that a fracture was unlikely. The medical notes record that I was &#8220;well in herself when here&#8221; and that &#8220;mother is very caring towards her baby&#8221;. The doctors thought that I had a soft tissue infection and prescribed antibiotics. They were unable to convince the mother that it was an infection and recorded that she was &#8220;very anxious&#8221;. She was advised to call the duty doctor or to take the child to Accident and Emergency if the condition worsened. Later that evening, the mother called the out of hours service and reported that the finger was now looking worse and was &#8220;very painful&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the following afternoon, I was taken to hospital where she was found to have a minimally displaced fracture to the proximal phalanx of her left little finger. Dr Adcock, the consultant paediatrician who examined I, felt that it was an &#8220;unusual injury&#8221;. As this was I&#8217;s second attendance at hospital with an unwitnessed injury, and having regard to the mother&#8217;s history of social and emotional problems, Dr Adcock decided to admit I and carry out a skeletal survey which revealed no further fractures. The mother was said to be resistant to the proposal to carry out such a survey. Initially, the parents gave no history of trauma but two days later recalled that I had been left briefly playing with a toy with wooden beads on elastic and that she had cried and been in discomfort on their return to the room. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although there was no clear mechanism of injury, the doctors concluded that I had sustained an unwitnessed accidental fracture to her left little finger. A plan was therefore made for a social care assessment and follow up. A social worker thereafter visited the family for a period of about 6 months, on occasions visiting jointly with the health visitor. On one occasion, the mother was challenging to the professionals, and was reported as being aggressive when they raised issues about her past, asserting that she felt &#8220;victimised&#8221;. She asked the professionals &#8211; social worker and health visitor &#8211; to leave the house. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In early May 2012, the mother discovered that she was pregnant again. Initially, she requested a termination. She and the father visited an abortion clinic on one occasion but thereafter decided not to continue with that procedure. In September 2012, when the mother was about 4 months pregnant, she fell down the stairs. There was no adverse consequence of this incident observed at that stage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, however, the mother gave birth to her baby, E, by emergency Caesarean section. E was at that stage only 28 weeks gestation. She suffered from problems associated with that degree of prematurity, including chronic lung disease and reflux. E remained in the neonatal unit at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth for eight weeks, under the care of Dr Julia Lilley, consultant neonatologist. Initially, she suffered from mild respiratory distress and was maintained on intravenous fluids and ventilator support. Her condition improved in a few days and she was moved on to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and then to high flow oxygen via nasal prongs, before being weaned off all support a few days later. During her stay in the neonatal unit, E suffered from some chronic lung disease of prematurity and received a low dose of supplemental oxygen. Her progress was further complicated by problems with impaired renal function, jaundice and a soft cardiac murmur. Routine screening for metabolic disorders was negative and X-rays carried out during her stay showed no abnormality of bone mineralisation. In a later police statement, Dr Lilley explained how E had shown the expected changes in her routine blood test caused by bone disease of prematurity. She was therefore started on phosphate supplements during her period as an inpatient, although these were discontinued before discharge as her blood test results had normalised. Dr Lilley also described how the mother and father presented as &#8220;normal concerned parents&#8221;. She recalled them visiting the hospital and being &#8220;very appropriate&#8221; with a young baby. It was noted that the mother presented as more anxious, whereas the father was &#8220;very much the calming factor&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the age of eight weeks on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012, E was discharged home in the care of her parents with a very low dose of supplemental oxygen. In her police statement, Dr Lilley explained that a thorough discharge process takes place with parents whenever a baby leaves hospital on oxygen therapy. In her statement in these proceedings, she reported that both parents engaged well with the discharge process, observing that &#8220;when E was discharged, she was breathing well, feeding well and her parents appeared confident with her care&#8221;. Thereafter, E was seen at home regularly with her parents by the neonatal outreach team and by Janet Wren, a children&#8217;s community specialist nurse. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, the nurse reported that there was slight subcostal recession, although no other work of breathing. From time to time, the parents were asked to record E&#8217;s progress by attaching her to an oxygen monitor for a 24 hour period and completing oxygen download forms. One such period was 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> &#8211; 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, although as Janet Wren was at that stage unwell, the machinery was left by another care worker. According to the parents, they duly completed the oxygen download monitoring over the next 24 hours. The following day on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, I was taken to the GP with a history of coughing and being off her food and was prescribed antibiotics. </p>

She telephoned the mother in the morning to arrange a visit at lunchtime in order to pick up the oxygen monitor and download form. When Janet Wren arrived at 13.00, the mother told her that she was concerned about E who had been vomiting on the previous night. In oral evidence, the mother said that she did not recall E vomiting. In particular, the mother was concerned about her breathing. She showed Ms Wren a video recording on her mobile phone showing E&#8217;s breathing being laboured and fast. It appeared that E had sub-costal recession. Ms Wren described this video film as &#8220;quite concerning&#8221;. She examined E and noticed that she indeed had sub-costal recession, together with some nasal flaring. E was still on the oxygen therapy and had a nasal cannula inserted. Her breathing rate was somewhat higher than normal and her oxygen saturation level was dipping below 95%, the level at which she should be seen by a doctor. Her heart rate was also raised. Ms Wren advised that E needed to be seen in hospital. She was told by the mother that the oxygen download had been completed. However, the recording log for the period 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>-28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December was missing and has never been produced. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to the diary compiled later by the parents, between 20.00 and 21.00 that evening, the mother noticed when E was lying down that she was frothing at the mouth with a small amount of blood. Both parents said later in police interviews that the mother had been alone with the girls when the blood was first noticed, although in oral evidence the mother said that she could not recall being on her own. At 20.45 the same evening, the parents took E back to Derriford Hospital. They reported that she had been seen retching and frothing at the mouth with blood-tinged saliva. Staff Nurse Fisher observed &#8220;tiny specks of bright red fresh blood&#8221; in her saliva. E was therefore admitted to hospital overnight. The following morning, the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>, she appeared more settled. There were no further observations of frothing or bleeding from the mouth. In the medical notes of an examination at 19.30, however, it is recorded that she had a &#8220;congested red spot on the hard palate&#8221;. Curiously, this note was not referred to by any of the professionals involved in the case, medical or legal, until the consultant ENT surgeon instructed as an expert witness, Mr. Kuo, noticed it during his oral evidence. A diagnosis of reflux was made and E was commenced on ranitidine. She was discharged home at 19.30. </p>

In oral evidence, he said that when he left E had been asleep on the sofa. The mother said that, while he was out, she noticed secretions with blood in them coming from E&#8217;s mouth. In oral evidence, she said that E had been lying on a cushion on the sofa. She was not crying, and did not appear to be in pain, but the mother was very worried because of the blood. The father said that, when he returned, the mother was upstairs with both children. He later told the police that the mother had called him upstairs and he saw that E was frothing at the mouth again, but on this occasion with more blood. In interview, the father described its appearance &#8220;as if&#8230;you had a cut in the back of your mouth and you were spitting&#8221;. The father telephoned the hospital to say that E had had a recurrence of the bleeding in her saliva. E was then taken to hospital by her father, the mother staying at home with I. On arrival, the father showed the nurses a muslin cloth with fresh blood on it. Nurse Hazel Ferris examined E on admission and saw fresh blood in her mouth with secretions. A consultant, Dr Bouquet, examined E and noticed that her throat was red. E was admitted to hospital. In the early hours of the following morning, 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, a nasogastric tube was inserted, after an initial failed attempt. E was noted to have a croupy cough and wheezy chest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 09.45 that morning, E was reviewed by Dr Lilley. There had been no bleeding reported over night, and the medical notes recorded that the reported signs and symptoms were considered to be consistent with infection. At about midday the mother arrived at the hospital. During the afternoon, there was a serious deterioration in E&#8217;s condition. At about 14.30, further blood was observed in her mouth. There is some uncertainty about whether it was the mother or father who reported the bleeding. A medical note suggests it was the father, but in her police interview the mother stated that it had happened while the father was out of the room. Previously, a doctor had observed E to be settled but within 20 minutes she was seen to be suffering from respiratory distress, stridor breathing and fresh blood in the mouth. An attempt at flexible nasendoscopy failed due to the presence of secretions. An ENT registrar was called to attend shortly before 16.00 hours. At this point, E was described as &#8220;mottled and cyanosed&#8221; with apnoeic laboured breathing, a severe reduction of saturation to 75% on nasal oxygen and a &#8220;see-saw breathing pattern&#8221;, as a result of which she was treated by a jaw thrust manoeuvre, in which the angle of the jaw is pushed forward so as to open the oropharyngeal space. After the jaw thrust was performed, her saturations returned to 100%, indicating (as I was later told in evidence by Professor Fleming, the paediatric expert witness) that the obstruction to her breathing was in the oropharynx. The registrar did not observe any fresh blood but did observe some dark brown colouring. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 16.25, E was examined by the ENT consultant who concluded that she needed airway support. The decision was taken to take her to theatre for further assessment. Once there, she was intubated and ventilated and then subjected to an upper airway laryngoscopy. In this examination, her larynx and hypopharynx were described as showing a &#8220;normal appearance&#8221;. The report of the intubation process stated: &#8220;Size three endotracheal tube passed successfully with slight resistance. Rigid laryngoscopy used with tube in place show normal appearance of larynx and hypopharynx. Subglotic area and trachea could not be assessed.&#8221; In oral evidence, Professor Fleming told me that this examination would not have included the posterior pharyngeal wall because that is not possible with a rigid laryngoscope. Subsequently, she underwent a chest x-ray which revealed that the ET tube and NG tube were satisfactorily in place but also that there was &#8220;persistent right upper lobe collapse&#8221;. E was moved to the high dependency unit at the hospital, but in view of her serious condition, it was decided to transfer her to the specialist unit at the Southampton General Hospital. She travelled there in the early hours of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

I have been supplied with a number of photographs of this unit and have had an opportunity to inspect it during my visit to the hospital on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014. The unit contains 14 stations at which a bed or cot can be placed. At all points during her stay in the unit, E was either in a cot next to the nurse&#8217;s station or in a cot in the section of the unit reserved for respiratory cases (beds 11-14). The protocol in the unit is for 1:1 care &#8211; that is to say a nurse is allocated to care exclusively for a patient during her shift and is present at the side of the patient at all times, except when carrying out necessary functions such as collecting medications or during brief breaks, in which case he or she asks another nurse attending to a neighbouring patient to keep an eye on her patient. The unit is a busy place with a significant number of medical professionals present at all times. There are residential rooms available for parents to occupy while their child is on the PICU. The practice is for babies to remain in their cots at all times save when being attended to by the nurses and when being cuddled by the parents under the supervision of nursing staff.</p>

The consultant radiologist Dr Fairhurst reported: &#8220;The tip of the ET tube lies at the carina. The tip of the enteric tube lies in the stomach. Consolidation persists in the right mid-zone [ie of the right lung]. The left lung is clear.&#8221; Later that morning, the parents arrived from Plymouth. During the day E&#8217;s condition settled. At 15.20, the oral endotracheal tube was changed to a nasotracheal tube. A further chest X-ray carried out at 17.58 was reported by Dr Fairhurst in the following terms (inter alia): &#8220;There is now significant volume loss in the right upper lobe and overall aeration is generally reduced as compared with the day&#8217;s earlier film&#8221;. </p>

At one stage she was noted to be arching her back and distressed with a tracheal tug and subcostal recession. In the early evening, she was noticed to have an irregular breathing pattern with thick bubbly secretions. There was one episode of fresh blood from the mouth during the evening which the reviewing doctor felt was most likely to be caused by trauma from the extubation, although it was noted that this was also how she had presented in Plymouth.

At 10.10 she was noted to have an inspiratory stridor with lower costal and subcostal recession. Doctors concluded that her upper airway was swollen and she was treated with increased medication and optiflow. At 17.50, a ward round was conducted by a group of doctors including Dr Baldock and Dr. Hyde, consultants in paediatric intensive care medicine. The note of their examination includes: &#8220;blood streaking on nasal suctioning.&#8221; The note added that she had a strong cry and decreased work of breathing and that there was no stridor. In passing, I note that in a subsequent retrospective note prepared on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January Dr Hyde recorded that on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January at 10.10 &#8220;E developed a rapid onset stridor with subcostal recession and blood secretions.&#8221; This is repeated in a subsequent report prepared for the court. As set out above, however, the contemporaneous medical notes suggest that there was no blood seen at the time of the stridor recession at 10.10 that morning but rather that blood streaking was seen on nasal suctioning at 17.50 at a time when there was no stridor and a decreased work of breathing. </p>

Following the bronchoscopy, Dr Walker recommended a change of medication and, as a broncho-alveolar lavage had previously grown bacteria, he prescribed a course of antibiotics.

Later that morning, a further episode of blood-stained secretions occurred at a point when the parents were alone by E&#8217;s cot while the nurse was away photographing records at a time when there was only one other child in that section of the unit.  The secretions were suctioned by an SHO, Dr. Knight, using a suction catheter. There is no contemporaneous note of this incident in the medical records, but Dr. Knight made a retrospective note about it on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and subsequently made a police statement and gave evidence before me. She said that it is not the practice to record every occasion when a child is suctioned and on this occasion the secretions were similar to those that had been observed earlier and there was nothing significant. Dr. Knight described how the father had come to the doctors&#8217; desk on the unit to alert her about the bleeding. At that point, there was no increased work of breathing and she was observed to be stable. E was not crying and not in obvious distress. The retrospective note added that the parents &#8220;appeared appropriate during this time&#8221;, although she described them as anxious about the plan to move E from the PICU onto a normal ward.

She was admitted to a section (which I inspected on my visit) with a number of other beds. On this ward, there was a lower level of nursing supervision than on the PICU. At that stage, E was receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal prong. According to the letter on discharge from the PICU,  the diagnosis was &#8220;RUL [right upper lung] pneumonia&#8221;. When examined at 19.30, she was found to have &#8220;widespread crackles&#8221; and occasional expiratory stridor. In a later police statement (dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013), Nurse Tatnall said that on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January after the handover meeting at the start of the evening shift, the buzzer was operated from next to E&#8217;s cot, and when she went to see her she found the mother holding E who was bleeding from the nose and mouth. Parents of other children were also present in the bay of the ward at this time. The father had left earlier to stay with a friend, and text messages passing between the parents provide a contemporaneous account of E&#8217;s deterioration during the evening, with the father asking questions and expressing sympathy and the mother reporting on E&#8217;s condition and the actions of the medical staff. At 22.10, doctors were asked to review because of the increased blood-stained secretions. The notes of the examinations record that the mother was present, that blood had run down onto E&#8217;s chest and clothing, that there was moderate subcostal recession, bilateral crackles and moderately hard work of breathing. The nursing notes record that she was &#8220;vomiting blood + +&#8221; and requiring continuous suctioning. E was prescribed adrenaline and put back onto optiflow and moved into the adjacent high dependency unit (&#8220;HDU&#8221;) where the level of nursing care was higher than on the main ward. This unit, also inspected by me on my visit, contains 6 bed spaces, and, according to one of the nurses who gave oral evidence, Nurse Roberts, is &#8220;pretty much always full&#8221;. There is a nursing station by the door looking into the room, and medication is kept in the room. E&#8217;s cot was placed in the corner at the opposite end of the room.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 15.00, there was a further episode of noisy breathing which settled. The level of oxygen provided to E was increased. In a later police statement dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013, Nurse Roberts said that she had been allocated to care for E that day, that she had a student nurse working with her, that as E was &#8220;quite poorly&#8221; most of her time was spent with her that day, and &#8220;throughout the day we continued to observe her&#8221;, although in oral evidence she said that they would not be with the patient all the time. In her statement, she also described how, in order to deal with the increased wind caused by CPAP, she and the student nurse tried to place an orogastric tube but were unable to do so, although &#8220;this is not normally a problem&#8221;. In oral evidence, Nurse Roberts said that she had never experienced a problem passing an orogastric tube before. She then inserted a nasogastric tube for this purpose and succeeded without any problem. Curiously, neither I nor counsel have been able to find in the medical records any contemporaneous nursing note about these matters described by Nurse Roberts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At some point that afternoon or early evening, there was a further episode of blood in E&#8217;s mouth and recession. In a retrospective note prepared on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, Dr. Hyde recorded that an incident of bleeding had occurred at 15.00 on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, but I can find no contemporaneous record to confirm this timing. The examining doctor, Dr. Singh, a paediatric registrar, noted that someone said it was &#8220;just like always&#8221; and that the nurse did not see the beginning of this episode. His note is not timed, but in a statement he said that it must have been between 17.00 and 20.00 which were the times of his shift. This timing also tallies with Nurse Roberts&#8217; statement in which she also confirms that it was the mother who drew attention to the bleeding. Capillary blood gas tests at 19.00 suggested some improvement, but at 20.00 there was a further episode of respiratory distress with sternal recession. There was no evidence of pneumothorax but some concern about aspiration. A further chest X-ray was carried out and the consultant radiologist reported: &#8220;there remains increased density in the right upper lobe, with elevation of the right horizontal fissure, consistent with right upper lobe collapse. There is now increased airspace opacification adjacent to the left heart border, consistent with consolidation. The appearances are consistent with evolving infection.&#8221;</p>

She was intubated and ventilated by Dr. Baldock, the consultant intensivist, who noted that her upper airway was very swollen and inflamed. He was only able to pass a 3.0 mm uncuffed tube through her vocal cords &#8211; he was unable to pass a 3.5 mm tube. The medical notes record the doctors&#8217; impression as &#8220;most likely ongoing respiratory infection with acute deterioration secondary to upper airway obstruction. Still have not excluded H-type fistula.&#8221; A further chest X-ray noted that appearances were unchanged from the earlier film. E settled with the assistance of the ventilation and sedatives.</p>

Most recent episode occurred when parents not on ward so less likely than organic pathology.&#8221; He discussed the case with Dr. Roe, the lead paediatric consultant for child protection, and with the hospital&#8217;s child protection team.

While performing the endoscopy, Dr. Afzal found a foreign body in the oesophagus, later found to be cotton wool. An area of rawness was observed at the site where the cotton wool had been located. Below that point, the oesophagus looked normal and Dr. Afzal has stated that this effectively excluded erosive reflux as a cause of intestinal bleeding. The ENT surgeons then performed the bronchoscopy and microlaryngoscopy. In accordance with normal practice, part of this procedure was photographed, and late in the day (in circumstances described below) the pictures have been produced for the hearing before me. In this procedure, the doctors found a tear on the posterior pharyngeal wall, surrounded by sloughy material. The tear is clearly visible on the photographs and was described by Miss Burgess as &#8220;crescent-shaped&#8221;. The left-hand crico-arytenoid joint was stiff. Her left vocal cord was not moving and there was an area of oedema and erythema in the subglottis. There was sloughing of the anterior tracheal wall, said to be consistent with pressure from the ETT being pushed forward. In theatre, she was extubated because of trauma to the larynx and fitted with nasal CPAP.</p>

They said that they did not have cotton wool in the house. Dr. Hyde noted that the parents were &#8220;visibly shocked that anyone could consider putting objects in a child&#8217;s mouth&#8221;. According to Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record, Dr. Connett told the strategy meeting the following day that the parents had been &#8220;genuinely shocked&#8221; when he introduced the possibility of NAI. At 16.00, Dr. Connett spoke to Dr. Steele about his conversation with the parents. He said that &#8220;family appear quite a genuine couple&#8221; who had not thought of NAI until he put it to them but had &#8220;then blamed their local hospital&#8221;.

There is no reference to the finding of a fracture in any other note made that day, in particular in the very full notes of the strategy meeting (see further below). The first note on the PICU records alerting staff to the presence of fractures is the note of Dr. Fairhurst timed at 09.30 on the following day, the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> (also see below).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the meeting, Dr. Connett and Dr. Hyde, accompanied by a nurse but not the police, spoke to the parents and told them about the decisions of the strategy meeting. The parents were &#8220;appropriately distraught about the process of child protection investigations.&#8221; Later that evening, Dr. Steele spoke to a nurse on PICU, Nurse Du Preez, who was assigned to care for E that evening. According to Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record, the nurse told her that the mother had been upset and cross, that she had seen tension between the parents, that whereas the father had been appropriate on the ward, with hindsight the mother had asked odd questions and &#8220;had seemed to enjoy the whole situation on PICU&#8221;. When Nurse Du Preez gave evidence before me, however, she gave a different version of this conversation. Although she had observed the mother being upset and cross, she thought she had been &#8220;appropriate in the circumstances&#8221;. She recalled the mother asking what they expected to find in the bronchoscopy but at the time thought this seemed like a normal question any anxious parent would ask. More significantly, she did not recall saying that the mother seemed to be enjoying the whole situation on the PICU. Nurse Du Preez said that she would never have said this. Dr. Steele advised her to document very fully and contemporaneously all contacts and interactions involving the parents. During the evening, the father was by E&#8217;s cot, but the mother spent much of the time in the parents&#8217; accommodation with a headache. There is no evidence that the mother was ever alone with E on this evening. Nurse Du Preez said in evidence that by this stage everyone on the unit was aware that there were concerns about child protection. She was present for all save 15 minutes when she left to photocopy some notes, at the request of Dr. Steele who was also on the unit for some time that evening. Nurse Du Preez asked two colleagues to keep an eye on E while she was away. In a retrospective note on the medical records made on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, she said that those nurses had been &#8220;unable to have constant supervision of E&#8221;, but in a later police statement she said that those colleagues had told her that they had &#8220;never taken their eyes off&#8221; the parents while she was away. She told me in evidence that her colleagues had told her this after she had compiled the retrospective note. When she returned, both parents were by the cot. The mother was very distressed. The parents left the unit between 22.00 and 23.00. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the night, E showed signs of increased work of breathing, although her capillary blood gas measurements were reassuring. There were copious clear oral secretions, and by 06.30 she appeared to be increasingly distressed with her breathing with nasal flaring. At this stage she was still on a nasal cannula. A further chest X-ray was carried out at 08.22 and showed partial re-expansion of the right upper lobe but also fractures of the lateral aspects of the left fifth and sixth ribs. Dr. Fairhurst&#8217;s report continues: &#8220;there is increasing pleural reaction in relation to these fractures as compared with the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> &#8230; This suggests that these are acute injuries.&#8221; In the PICU notes, Dr. Fairhurst is noted as saying there was no evidence of periosteal reaction in the films, and the fractures were not visible on the x-rays taken on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, and further: &#8220;concern raised that timing of these fractures may have occurred in hospital setting&#8221;. A skeletal survey was performed. The parents visited E briefly for about fifteen minutes. The mother stroked E&#8217;s cheek but was asked not to do so by one of the nurses. At 10.30, Dr. Steele spoke to Dr. Hyde over the telephone (at a point when Dr. Connett was said to be on the ward). She noted that the concern again was non-accidental injury, and that it had &#8220;happened on our site here at UHS and therefore staff as well as parents are in the timeframe (therefore implications for child, staff, Trust)&#8221;. Dr. Steele was told that Dr. Connett was going to examine the airway now with a bronchoscope. She also noted: &#8220;the big worry he [it is not clear if this is Dr. Hyde or Dr. Connett] wants to discuss with me is (1) how to keep baby safe (NB) (2) how to protect/monitor staff (3) who to alert&#8221;. Dr. Steele&#8217;s notes include a detailed further plan including alerting social services, reconvening the strategy meeting, obtaining a list of all staff who had had any contact with the baby, preparing them for the fact that the police would need to take statements, keeping &#8220;very full and contemporaneous documentation&#8221;, and not leaving the parents alone with the baby. Dr. Steele then rang Devon social services and also spoke to DS Kingdon, who told her inter alia that the parents had made a formal complaint to the Derriford Hospital about the presence of the foreign body found in the oesophagus. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 13.05, Dr. Steele spoke again to Drs Hyde and Connett. There is a detailed note of their conversation in Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record. Dr. Connett told her that they are &#8220;becoming increasingly anxious and worried&#8221; as &#8220;on our watch the baby has been attacked multiple times&#8221; and they &#8220;fear for her life&#8221;. Staff have &#8220;been observing and monitoring but the baby has been harmed here, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">they</span> think it is the parents&#8221;. Therefore, they &#8220;want the parents to leave the hospital asap&#8221; as they are &#8220;worried the parents may kill the baby&#8221;. Dr. Steele responded: &#8220;we <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">must</span> keep an open mind as baby ?could have been harmed by staff as there is no definitive evidence that parents did it. We must <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> make any assumptions.&#8221; Dr. Connett replied that his &#8220;anxiety is heightened because there is a disconnect between the actions and behaviour of the parents i.e. appropriate on ward, which is completely at odds with what is in front of them on the ward re the baby&#8221;. He was concerned that the baby had been repeatedly assaulted and believed that this would &#8220;continue and possibly escalate unless the parents are removed&#8221;. He pointed out that the child had had symptoms in three settings &#8211; home, Derriford and UHS &#8211; and that the common link was the parents. Dr. Connett also expressed concern that I should be kept safe. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 13.30, Dr. Connett carried out a fibre-optic bronchoscopy of E with Dr. Hyde in attendance. Dr Connett&#8217;s note in the medical records read as follows: &#8220;There were a large number of secretions in the nasopharynx and the laryngeal inlet. There was an area of sloughing white material in the oropharynx posteriorly and adjacent to the laryngeal inlet on the right. The larynx was generally hyperanaemic and there was obvious swelling of the right arytenoid (posterior part of the entrance to the larynx). This was bright red and appearances suggested that there had been traumatic injury to the airway in this area. I was able to visualise the vocal cords which moved normally. I was able to pass the bronchoscope through the vocal cords and had good views of the sub-glottis, trachea and the left and right bronchus during spontaneous breathing. There was no airways inflammation, no collapse and no other lesions seen.  The appearances of the laryngeal inlet are different to those characterised by the airway evaluation that occurred on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. Whilst the area of slough overlying the mucosa on the posterior tear was seen, the marked oedema and redness of the arytenoids was not seen previously. The sub-glottic oedema and inflammation seen previously in the airway and consistent with previous intubation had resolved and the sub-glottis now appeared normal. The new appearances of redness and swelling of the laryngeal inlet is the only identifiable cause of the recent deterioration in respiratory status and looks to have arisen as a result of traumatic injury, (in the absence of any alternative explanation for these findings).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, this procedure was not recorded on film, either on video or still photographs. Dr Connett&#8217;s explanation for this omission in oral evidence was that the procedure had to be done as a matter of urgency on the ward and the machinery for recording was only available in the operating threatre. Dr. Hyde, on the other hand, said in evidence that the recording equipment is normally available as part of the machinery used in the bronchoscopy and it was only during the procedure on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> that it was discovered that there was no recording facility available in the machinery being used on this occasion. The consequence is that, whereas there is photographic evidence of the procedure on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, which has been available for inspection by expert witnesses and the court, there is no such evidence of the procedure on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>and the two doctors who were present during the procedure disagree as to the reason for this omission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Connett updated Dr. Steele on the outcome of the bronchoscopy. Meanwhile, Dr. Fairhurst had reviewed the skeletal survey. There was no evidence of other bony injury and she had been unable to see the fractures observed on the earlier chest X-rays. She therefore arranged a further X-ray, together with CT scans and MR imaging. At 14.20 a further strategy meeting took place.  According to Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record, Dr. Connett advised the meeting that the most likely cause of his latest findings was &#8220;direct trauma to the larynx, like a finger down the throat.&#8221; The meeting discussed further plans for safeguarding both E and I. Social services indicated that they would start care proceedings, and the police started their investigation. There was much discussion of the need to prepare full notes. At 18.28, Dr. Fairhurst reported on the CT scan of the chest which revealed multiple bilateral anterior and lateral rib fractures, with no evidence of periosteal new bone formation, suggesting that the fractures were acute and had &#8220;probably occurred in the last three to four days&#8221;. After being updated on developments, the parents left the hospital at 19.00 and did not thereafter return. Later that evening, medical staff experienced great difficulty passing a nasogastric tube. A series of nurses and junior doctors tried and failed, and the procedure was eventually carried out successfully by a consultant. E had previously been re-intubated and remained ventilated overnight to allow the swelling of her airways to settle.</p>

There was one episode of respiratory distress noted with increased work of breathing. Another multidisciplinary meeting took place to discuss the plan. According to Dr. Steele, Dr. Connett reiterated his opinion that E has sustained five events in three different settings with the common denominator being the parents. In addition, he said that the parents were within the timeframe of the episodes of bleeding, although Dr. Steele&#8217;s notes added: &#8220;(?apart from one occasion)&#8221;. At 06.20 on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, E coughed profusely with copious secretions, and then vomited dark blood-stained vomit. There were some episodes of bradycardia, but overall she was settled and alert. On the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, she was extubated onto optiflow, but remained with a nasogastric tube, although the tube was replaced when a hole was discovered. </p>

The arytenoids were still rather more prominent and some inflammation was still visible, although the consensus of expert opinion at the hearing before me was that the inflammation was much less marked than that reported by Dr. Connett as having been seen on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, and of a degree that would be compatible with reflux. </p>

At the outset of the hearing, I was informed that the police had produced a CD containing still photographs of the endoscopy, bronchoscopy and microlaryngoscopy procedure carried out on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. Plainly these photographs were of the utmost relevance, in particular for the expert witnesses. As a result, plans to call one of the expert witnesses, Mr. Kuo, by video link that afternoon had to be postponed. I expressed my great concern about this late disclosure to counsel who attended on behalf of the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, and he agreed at my request to conduct a review of the police files to identify any further material that had not been disclosed in accordance with the court directions. Oral evidence was then given over two days by several witnesses (including Dr. Connett and Professor Fleming, whose evidence was not completed) and the court then adjourned because of other commitments until the following Tuesday.</p>

Of particular importance was Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record, the existence of which had been unknown to the parties and the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was also informed that counsel for the police had discovered a number of other documents which had not been disclosed in compliance with the earlier orders. Counsel for all parties understandably asked for time to study the new material from the hospital. It was already clear that the case would overrun its time estimate, and that the number of witnesses might increase. Later that day, at counsel&#8217;s request I adjourned the case for a further day to allow the parties to digest the new material. On the following afternoon, the hospital Trust indicated that it wished to renew its application for leave to intervene, on the grounds that there was a likelihood that one or other party might seek to argue that (1) an employee of the trust was responsible for one or more of the injuries sustained by E and/or (2) the actions of the Trust&#8217;s employees had undermined the forensic process. I authorised disclosure of some documents from the care proceedings to the Trust to facilitate that application. On the next morning, the Trust&#8217;s application was granted unopposed. The evidence resumed for the rest of that day. On the following morning, Friday 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, counsel for the police (Mr. Godfrey) attended again. He accepted that the order for disclosure made on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July &#8220;could not have been clearer&#8221; as to the police obligations concerning disclosure, and that this had been supplemented by the order of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October. He said he was concerned that the police had failed to comply with the order, and had therefore devoted several hours seeking to identify material that had not been disclosed.  On behalf of the father, Mr Storey QC listed a number of categories of documents in respect of which he now sought a disclosure order.  Counsel for the police agreed to such an order. I proceeded to hear further oral evidence for the rest of the day.</p>

Later that day, I was informed that several hundred of pages of further documents had been disclosed by the police. At that stage, the documents were only available electronically and had not been analysed fully. Some of the documents had been disclosed previously, others not.  It was agreed that the case would again have to be adjourned until the following day so that the parties could digest the latest material. This was particularly unfortunate as Professor Fleming had returned to resume his evidence. After further discussion, it was agreed that the case would resume on the following day. On the next morning, 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, there was yet a further development. I was told that there were further documents which the Trust had not disclosed, namely documents that had been generated in the course of discussions between counsel and some of the hospital staff, including staff who were witnesses in the proceedings. Counsel was concerned that these documents were relevant in particular to the use of cotton wool. After further discussion in court, the Trust agreed to disclose these documents. In addition, I was told that the police were now proposing to interview a number of other potential witnesses, and in some cases re-interview hospital staff. On behalf of the local authority, Miss Cook QC suggested that the court should invite the police to desist from re-interviewing witnesses until the conclusion of the fact-finding hearing. Mr. Storey expressed concern about the possibility of witnesses being re-interviewed and discussing with the police matters that had been raised when they had been questioned in this court. </p>

The police agreed to &#8220;pause&#8221; the inquiry. The hearing then continued until the end of the week which was the end of the eleven days originally allocated for the hearing. I was able to find eight further days in November and December, which was sufficient to complete the evidence but regrettably not submissions. Counsel therefore prepared written submissions over the Christmas period, and during the first week of January (still in the court vacation) I heard oral submissions and on a further day conducted a view of the relevant wards &#8211; PICU, G3 and its associated HDU &#8211; at the hospital in Southampton. I reserved judgment, a process which has been further delayed because of the need to re-analyse the history in careful detail. </p>

It is fair to say that the case came close at times to being completely derailed as a result. Attempts made by counsel on behalf of the police in written closing submissions (not Mr. Godfrey) to explain and excuse these failings were conspicuously unattractive. The fact is that the police repeatedly failed to comply with orders for disclosure, failed to take advantage of the provisions contained in the disclosure orders giving them liberty to apply, and then disclosed a substantial volume of material after the hearing had started, thereby necessitating a series of adjournments. </p>

To coin a phrase, this must now cease. Unless there is full compliance with orders for disclosure, there is a danger that the family court will be unable to fulfil its role of protecting children. I agree that one way of tackling this problem is to identify one individual in the police force who will be responsible for facilitating disclosure in these circumstances. Most importantly, all police forces must comply with the new Protocol on Disclosure.</p>

In particular, Dr. Steele&#8217;s running record was highly relevant and obviously disclosable. Its existence seems to have come as a surprise to those representing the hospital in this case. Mr Hand contended that this reflected the difficulties that exist running a very large corporate structure, but this does not seem to me to be any excuse. I am concerned that hospitals need to develop better practices to ensure that all relevant material is identified and disclosed promptly, and I am assured by Mr. Hand that this hospital has learned lessons and is changing its practice, so that the running record will become a more formal, electronic document. I acknowledge the assistance that the Trust and its legal representatives have given to the court since it was joined as an intervenor. </p>

It is interesting to consider how the proposed new Bundles Practice Direction would have impinged on the preparation and filing of documents in this case.  I record that I was greatly assisted by the availability of a core bundle in which many of the documents referred to during the hearing were stored. The 24 files of documents comprised: statements by the parties prepared for these proceedings;  expert reports, in particular from Professor Peter Fleming, consultant paediatrician, Mr Michael Kuo, consultant paediatric otolaryngologist, and Dr. Andrew Watt, consultant paediatric radiologist; medical records from the Derriford and Southampton Hospitals, plus GP and health visitor records for the family members; social services records, and the disclosure by the police which eventually exceeded over 2,500 pages. At the hearing the following 26 witnesses gave evidence: (1) primary health care &#8211; Dr. Born (GP), Janet Wren (community specialist children&#8217;s nurse) and Janet Carter (health visitor); (2) from the Derriford Hospital &#8211; Dr. Adcock and Dr. Lilley ; (3) from UHS &#8211; Dr. Connett, Miss Burgess, Miss Ismail-Koch, Dr. Baldock, Dr. Walker, Dr. Afzal, Dr. Knight, Dr. Hyde, Matron Purcell, Nurses Tatnell, Roberts, Du Preez, Jenkins, Stranaghan, and Dr. Steele ; (4) police &#8211; DS Kingdon ; (5) experts &#8211; Professor Fleming, Dr. Watt and Mr. Kuo; (6) family members &#8211; the mother and father. In addition, I had the benefit of a number of documents from counsel at various stages in the proceedings, culminating in voluminous closing submissions and appendices, totalling over 150,000 words. I pay tribute to the outstanding contribution made by the parties&#8217; lawyers &#8211; counsel and solicitors in this case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have mentioned elsewhere the crucial importance of experienced legal representation in these difficult public family law cases. This case presented special challenges, in particular (1) the highly unusual nature of E&#8217;s symptoms, injuries and medical history; (2) the voluminous history, and (3) the deplorable failure of the police and UHS to disclose substantial numbers of documents until after the start of the proceedings. It would have been impossible for this court to have coped without the assistance of all the solicitors and counsel for the parties, including those instructed to represent the Trust. I hope I may be forgiven for singling out counsel for the local authority. Miss Cook demonstrated the vital importance in these very difficult public law cases of the local authority being represented by leading counsel experienced in grappling with these types of problems, and of marshalling the case to be put before the court, and crucially in cross-examination, in particular of the experts and the parents. She was ably assisted by Miss Phillips who stoically but successfully took on the burden of keeping control of the ever-expanding documentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One consequence of the late disclosure of material by the hospital and police was that the parties&#8217; preparation of the case was unavoidably incomplete. Chronologies and case summaries prepared for the start of the hearing did not include information supplied in the several hundred pages of undisclosed documentation. Although all counsel sought to remedy this in their final submissions, I have thought it necessary to go through the medical notes myself to track E&#8217;s course through hospital. This has greatly added to the time taken for preparation of this judgment but was unavoidable, in particular given the fact that the local authority&#8217;s case in part turns on an interpretation of the pattern of E&#8217;s symptoms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject any insinuation that Dr Connett&#8217;s overall approach was unprofessional. It is important to note, as pointed out by Mr Hand on behalf of the Hospital Trust, that before Dr Connett became involved in the case, the clinicians involved, and in particular Professor Roberts, were increasingly of the view that this was or might be a case of factitious or induced illness. Dr Connett did not become involved until after the procedure on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January in which the cotton wool and pharyngeal tear were discovered. At that stage, any responsible clinician would have been considering the possibility of non-accidental injury and Dr Connett and his colleagues would have been failing in their duty if they had not taken urgent steps to address this possibility. Furthermore, given the possibility that the injuries had been sustained at hospital &#8211; a possibility increased following the discovery of the rib fractures &#8211; it is perfectly understandable that Dr Connett took a very serious view of the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do, however, think there is force in the criticism made of Dr Connett as to both the way in which he expressed his view and as to his apparent reluctance to consider any alternative cause.  It is striking that Dr Steele&#8217;s running record shows that it is she who on several occasions has to remind the doctors, and in particular Dr. Connett, of the importance of keeping an open mind. In his oral evidence, Dr Connett eventually conceded that in some respects his language &#8220;may not have been entirely professional or appropriate&#8221;. I think he was right to make that concession. Furthermore, it is plain to me that his strong views strongly expressed as they were must have influenced the attitude of other staff and the general atmosphere on the wards concerned. I think there is a risk that some nurses and doctors may have been influenced in their evidence by Dr Connett&#8217;s forceful exposition of his views. </p>

It is surprising that Dr Connett and Dr Hyde gave different excuses for the fact that the procedure was not recorded. Having considered this aspect of the evidence carefully, I do not conclude that either doctor has deliberately misled the court on this issue. I find that each doctor has honestly provided their differing recollections of the reasons why the procedure was not recorded. The significance of the absence of any recording to my mind is not the reason for the failure to record but rather the fact that no recording is available. Had it been recorded photographically, there would have been direct evidence available for inspection by the expert witnesses, Professor Fleming and Mr Kuo. I do, of course, have the consistent descriptions of the findings from the two clinicians. On such an important part of the case, however, it is unfortunate that the best evidence that would have been provided by recording of the procedure is not available for interpretation by the independent experts.</p>

On behalf of the Trust, Mr Hand makes a number of points in vigorous defence of Dr Connett. He points out that doctors work on a system of peer review and that there is also a need to prevent any past mistakes from happening again. This learning from past experience cannot entirely await the outcome of court proceedings. He contends that Dr Connett was not seeking to influence the views of others by giving this lecture, but rather simply providing his opinion from the perspective of his own involvement in E&#8217;s care and treatment. He points out that hardly any of those who have given evidence in this case actually attended the lecture. In any event, the original medical notes, and their interpretation by the independent experts, were obviously unaffected by the lecture.</p>

It is, however, a concrete example of the point I had already made, namely as to Dr Connett&#8217;s overall influence upon the views and attitudes of other hospital professionals concerned in the case. As to the general point, whilst accepting Mr Hand&#8217;s submission as to the importance of peer review and learning lessons from cases, I think it is singularly unwise for any professional, doctor or lawyer, to give a lecture upon an ongoing case before that case is concluded. Manifestly, there is a risk that such a lecture may contaminate the investigation and proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Fleming&#8217;s interpretation of the history in the period before E&#8217;s admission to Southampton evolved during the proceedings. In his written report, guided no doubt by the questions asked in the letter of instruction sent to him by the parties, he focussed on the later signs &#8211; the cotton wool, the pharyngeal tear, the rib fractures and the swollen arytenoids seen on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. There was comparatively little in his report about the period before the admission to Southampton, although he did suggest that the pharyngeal tear might have occurred before E&#8217;s presentation to hospital on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January. In the experts&#8217; meeting, he was asked for the first time specifically about the cause of E&#8217;s initial respiratory distress and haemoptysis. As discussed below, Mr Kuo had expressed the view that pneumonia and aspiration was the probable cause. Professor Fleming disagreed. He pointed out that the initial presentation to hospital was not with the haemoptysis but rather because of signs of respiratory distress &#8211; increased nasal flaring, high rate of breathing and subcostal recession. These could well have represented signs of an infection but thereafter her condition seemed to improve. Later that day there was the first incident involving bleeding &#8211; apparently while she was sitting quietly with her mother &#8211; but, again, when she arrived at hospital, the respiratory distress had abated. Professor Fleming summarised this as &#8220;a very mild underlying respiratory illness that&#8217;s been seen twice by the doctors who didn&#8217;t feel that it was actually a serious issue &#8211; but then this acute episode in between&#8221;. At the experts&#8217; meeting Professor Fleming also disagreed that acute aspiration is a common phenomenon in young infants. He thought it was extremely uncommon. He added: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Then in his oral evidence in answer to Miss Cook, his position evolved again. He said that haemoptysis is very rare in infants, &#8220;except within the setting of trauma&#8221;. He then ruled out all other explanations. He had never seen such bleeding as a primary event in aspirative pneumonia. His accepted that bleeding in secretions in bronchial pneumonia was &#8220;uncommon but not rare&#8221;, but there was no evidence of severe bronchial pneumonia in this case because E recovered quickly. &#8220;So this was not a single, severe episode that got progressively worse with bleeding at the worse stage of the episode, this was mildly unwell baby who had a number of quite acute episodes superimposed on that.&#8221; This did not fit the pattern of a severe pneumonia sufficient to cause haemoptysis. Although bleeding in reflux was not rare, he had never come across bleeding from the upper airway as a result of reflux without inflammation of the oesophagus, but this could be ruled out in this case because Dr Afzal, after removing the cotton wool from the oesophagus in the endoscopy of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, had found no evidence of reflux oesophagitis below the site at which cotton wool had been located. Professor Fleming thought that, given that the symptomatology had continued in the intervening period between the first bleeding episode and the procedure on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, if the bleeding was due to reflux and damage to the mucosa, it was unlikely that the oesophagus would have been normal in Dr Afzal&#8217;s examination. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Cook then took Professor Fleming through the medical notes for the first two admissions to the Derriford Hospital in the first week of January. He noted that at the time of the second admission, on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, the father had brought in a muslin cloth with blood on it. Professor Fleming thought it hard to imagine how this could have been caused by any of the postulated natural causes. He accepted the possibility that one explanation for the difficulty experienced by the nurses in passing the nasal gastric tube on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January might have been that the pharyngeal tear was already present. He further accepted that ,if there had been bloody secretions caused by trauma, leading to swelling, that would explain the respiratory difficulties seen in hospital on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and also might explain the noises heard by nurses in the early hours of that day &#8211; a croupy cough and wheezy chest. Professor Fleming thought that the description of how the jaw thrust manoeuvre carried out on the afternoon of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January had increased E&#8217;s saturations indicating significant swelling or obstruction of some sort behind her oral cavity and specifically in the oropharynx, &#8220;because the jaw thrust does not do anything for the larynx or the nasopharynx&#8221;. For Professor Fleming, this established &#8220;for certain the obstruction was in the oropharynx&#8221;. Although E had been examined by a rigid laryngoscope at Derriford, that examination would not have enabled the doctor to see the posterior pharyngeal wall. These factors led Professor Fleming to reflect again on the possibility that the pharyngeal tear was present on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

On the contrary, it demonstrates the very great care which Professor Fleming devoted to his work in this case.

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;On the balance of probability, the initial respiratory difficulty and haemoptysis which necessitated admission to Derriford Hospital were attributable to aspiration pneumonitis. In essence, I agree with the diagnosis proposed by the doctors in Derriford Hospital. Haemoptysis is uncommon in infants and neonates and is often associated with pneumonia or pneumonitis. Trauma to the pharynx and epistaxes (nose bleeding) causing contamination of the upper aerodigestive tract with blood can give a similar picture but there would not be the associated breathing difficulties. &#8221;</p>

She demonstrated, and he agreed, that there were no observation of significant breathing difficulty associated with the early incidents of bleeding &#8211; as she put it, by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January &#8220;there is not the slightest hint of any breathing difficulties but we have had blood in the sputum at this point for 48 hours&#8221;. She put it to him that with aspirative pneumonia you would have the breathing difficulties first and then the blood. Mr Kuo deferred to Professor Fleming on this issue. Ultimately, Mr Kuo agreed in cross-examination that it was not a pneumonitis case, and that, if it had been, the quality of the bleeding would have been different from that seen, for example, on the muslin cloth brought in by the father.

There is force in Miss Branigan&#8217;s submission that E&#8217;s presentation during the entirety of her stay at hospital in Southampton is one which is not capable of any clear explanation. Here again, one striking feature is the pattern identified by Professor Fleming in which E&#8217;s respiratory condition fluctuated in a way which is not consistent with lung disease, and the episodes of bleeding, taken alongside the fluctuating pattern of respiratory difficulties, did not fit any naturally occurring pathology, as Dr Baldock, for example, observed in evidence. The father himself observed during his police interview that E &#8220;kept getting better and getting worse and getting better and getting worse&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Another striking aspect of E&#8217;s progress in Southampton, of course, was the sheer number of interventions that this small baby received from a large number of nurses and doctors, involving intubations, to assist with both her breathing and feeding, and examinations. In answer to a question from me, Professor Fleming described the level of intervention as &#8220;extremely uncommon&#8221;. There is no reason to doubt the dedication or professionalism of the hospital staff. But the fact is they were struggling to come to terms with identifying the diagnosis of this worrying problem, and were submitting E to a high number of interventions. It is the Local Authority&#8217;s case that some of the bleeding during the Southampton admission must have been attributable to further acts of abuse committed in the hospital. They have slightly shifted their ground on this point, initially asserting that the bleeding on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was traumatic but then amending the schedule of findings to assert that the bleeding on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was a traumatic injury inflicted by one or other of the parents. Plainly, however, if, prior to the admission to Southampton, there was already a traumatic wound or lesion (such as a pharyngeal tear) it is likely that at least some of the bleeding seen at Southampton was caused by the re-opening of that wound. A basis of the Local Authority&#8217;s assertion that the bleeding on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was attributable to further episodes of trauma is that Professor Fleming and Mr Kuo thought that the gap between the proceeding interventions on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and the onset of bleeding on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was too great to be attributable to those interventions.</p>

In my judgment, on the PICU and HDU it would be very difficult for a parent to inflict injuries as postulated by the local authority on a child without being detected &#8211; not impossible, but certainly very difficult. The sheer improbability of this weighs heavily in the balance when assessing the local authority&#8217;s allegation that further assaults took place in hospital.</p>

Some of them led to complications, for example, the difficulties experienced inserting an orogastric tube on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. But in most cases, the procedures were carried out without any complication by experienced medical staff. Several doctors who gave evidence &#8211; Dr Baldock, Dr Walker, Dr Hyde &#8211; were specifically asked whether the procedures they carried out might have caused the tear. They all deny that this was possible. I bear in mind that all medical staff are carefully trained in these procedures and that the tubes and equipment used by them (which I have inspected) are specifically designed to avoid this type of injury. On balance I think it very unlikely that the pharyngeal tear was solely attributable to any medical procedures. If, however, the tear was already present, it is possible, as both Professor Fleming and Mr Kuo accepted, that in the course of such a procedure (for example the passing of the nasogastric tube) the tear may have been reopened or enlarged.</p>

The one consistent feature as to the timing from each professional was that this was not a new or recent injury.

The success of the jaw thrust procedure carried out on that date suggests that the obstruction causing the breathing difficulties was in the oropharynx. Furthermore, as pointed out by Professor Fleming in his oral evidence, it is possible that the tear could have been missed during the bronchoscopy carried out on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, since, as he said, the posterior pharyngeal wall is not one of the main places you are trying to look at during such procedures. In his evidence, Dr. Walker, who carried out the procedure, said that this was not an area that he would be particularly looking at during the procedure. I also accept the evidence, in particular of Mr Kuo, that it was possible that the pharyngeal tear could have been missed during the flexible nasal endoscopy carried out on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. As Mr Kuo pointed out, the reason why such a tear might have been missed in such examinations is that it is an unusual finding so the operator would not be looking for it, but also because the mouth was not stented open on the procedures on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January in contrast with the procedure carried out on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.

The two nurses who accepted that this had indeed happened while they were on duty were Nurse Du Preez and Nurse Jenkins. Nurse Du Preez thought it had been gauze rather than cotton wool that had been used inside the teat and that the back of the teat had been partially sealed by tape. Nurse Jenkins, on the other hand, accepted that, at least on the day when she was on duty, cotton wool had been used and packed firmly in place in the teat, but that the back of the teat had not been sealed by tape. She accepted that the teat had been used as a comforter for several hours on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. What happened to it is unclear.

The hole in the teat is far too small to allow cotton wool to pass through it except for the occasional strand. In order for a piece of cotton wool of the size identified in E to get into her oropharynx, it would, by necessity, have had to come from the back of the teat and unless a large piece of cotton wool was extremely loosely inserted into the back of the teat such that it was in danger of falling out spontaneously, it is very hard to imagine how a very small baby could obtain such a piece of cotton wool in their mouth without it being placed there by an older individual. &#8221;</p>

In the circumstances, I agree with the submission made by Miss Cook and Miss Phillips that the fractures occurred between 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

Dr Watt advises that the mechanism of injury for this type of fracture is a compressive force to the chest from front to back. Dr Watt advises that rib fractures are identified in the literature as a type of injury that has a high specificity for non-accidental injury, although this is especially so for posterior fractures whereas the fractures in this case were anterolateral. In oral evidence, Professor Fleming described the distribution of these fractures as &#8220;very unusual&#8221; it was not a pattern that he had seen either in the context of accidental or non-accidental injury and he was unable to speculate as to the mechanism which could explain the fractures</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The x-rays demonstrated that E suffered a mild degree of osteopaenia. As she was born at 28 weeks, E was at risk of suffering from bone disease of prematurity and Dr Watt concluded on the basis of the radiographic evidcnce alone that it was probable that she was suffering from this condition to a degree. In oral evidence, he confirmed that it had been shown that there has to be between 25 and 40 per cent of bone loss before osteopaenia is detected radiologically, but it is not possible to say how that translates to bone strength. He agreed with Mr Storey in cross-examination that the more premature a baby is the more likely it is that she would suffer from bone disease of prematurity. He further agreed that the literature showed that fractures caused by such diseases particularly occurred between the ages of 10 weeks and 6 months. Rib fractures in particular are associated with premature birth but often go undetected. Dr Watt therefore included osteopaenia as a potential mitigating explanation for the presence of the rib fractures in E&#8217;s case. Osteopaenia is known to result in weakened bone strength which could predispose a baby to fractures occurring with otherwise normal handling, such as chest physiotherapy. As recorded above, E was given chest physiotherapy on a number of occasions during her stay in Southampton to alleviate the problem of respiratory arrest and secretions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further expert opinion was provided on this topic by Professor Fleming, who addressed in particular the issue of osteopaenia in prematurity. He advised in his report that it has for many years been recognised that babies born extremely prematurely are at high risk of poor bone mineralisation as the ability to ingest, absorb and lay down the mineral content of normal bone is severely compromised by the difficulty in providing adequate calcium and phosphate nutrition in the post-natal period. The prevalence and severity of osteopaenia of prematurity can be reduced substantially by the early introduction of routine phosphate supplements in the feeds and by the use of supplemented feeds specifically developed for the pre-term infants. In this case, E was provided with routine phosphate supplements and special supplemented feeds. Research has attempted to quantify the relationship between related bio-chemical parameters such as blood alkaline phosphatase levels, and the risk of infants developing osteopaenia. In this case, Professor Fleming notes that E did not have extremely high levels of alkaline phosphatase at any time, nor did she have significantly low levels of phosphate during the early neonatal period. Research has shown, however, that, even in the absence of gross elevation of alkaline phosphatase or severly low levels of organic phosphate, some infants nevertheless had features of osteopaenia and developed rib fractures. Thus in this case Professor Fleming advises that the &#8220;relatively mild&#8221; radiological and biochemical indicators of potential osteopaenia must be considered alongside the rib fractures. </p>

The lack of correlation is one of the difficulties faced in clinics in assessing bones in growing ex-premature infants. Overall, there was nothing to rule out osteopaenia but there was nothing to suggest that E was at high risk. He added, however, that whilst it seemed unlikely to him that physiotherapy could cause a fracture even the presence of mild osteopaenia &#8220;we have too many gaps in our knowledge and understanding of bone strength and how it works for me to be able to say categorically that I am confident it wouldn&#8217;t have happened.&#8221; However, whilst he had seen fractures in children with osteopaenia that had been attributed to chest physiotherapy, he added:</p>

This is of particular significance because E was being repeatedly handled by a number of nurses and other professionals in hospital during the window when the fractures occurred. For some of this period, she was sedated and/or intubated and therefore might not have demonstrated any symptoms of pain or distress. Nonetheless, for significant periods during the time window, she was not sedated and nothing was seen. When she was on PICU, the vast majority of the handling of E, including all routine cares and physiotherapy, was undertaken by nursing or medical staff. In reply, Miss Cook points to the fact that, during the period when E was on ward G3, the degree of nursing supervision was much less, and the parents were able to handle her more freely. So far as the lack of distress is concerned, Miss Cook simply points to the fact that it is beyond doubt that these fractures were sustained so that the court is not assisted by the lack of pain response as an indicator of the timing or causation of the rib fractures.</p>

Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the court, in the interests of the children, to analyse the evidence and, if possible, make a finding.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the E&#8217;s pharyngeal tear was inflicted by the mother. Both parents agreed that the mother was alone with the children when the evidence of blood was first noticed on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January. Importantly, the father was clearly absent from the home on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, albeit for a short period, when E started bleeding from the mouth. I agree with Mr. Storey that it is therefore so unlikely to have been the father who was responsible so as to enable the court to exclude him as a perpetrator. As stated above, I found the father to be an essentially truthful witness, and I believed him when he said that he did not injure his child.  In contrast, I found the mother to be less than frank in her cross-examination about the events of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset, it was the local authority&#8217;s case that the pattern of injuries sustained by the children indicated that this was a case of induced illness or injury. In closing submissions, Miss Cook and Miss Phillips identified a number of features from the history in support of this contention. I have considered all of these points. They rely in particular on the observation made by Professor Fleming that &#8220;the combination of observations which were not all available at the same time, and putting them together one raises the possibility of the fabricated or induced illness&#8221;. They also cite the evidence of Professor Roberts, who was the first clinician to raise the possibility of induced illness. They point to the mother&#8217;s unsettled history, including incidents of self harm, and her anxiety. They also cite some odd incidents in the history such as the fact that the parents had lost the record of the oxygen download carried out 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, and the video-recording of E&#8217;s breathing difficulties on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Crucially, however, the local authority&#8217;s case on this issue turned on the interpretation of a pattern of behaviour. Given my findings on the individual allegations of abuse, which though serious are substantially fewer than sought by the local authority, I do not think that the allegation of induced illness is proved on a balance of probabilities. It is possible that the mother may have inflicted the pharyngeal tear in order to mimic the symptoms of illness, but equally there may be other interpretations. I apprehend that there will be further assessments in which the issue of the mother&#8217;s motivation for this behaviour will be fully analysed. In the circumstances, it is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage for the court to make a finding as to why this injury was inflicted.</p>

Specifically so far as the father is concerned, Miss Cook and Miss Phillips submit that he minimises, is protective of the mother, and was unwilling to be open or honest. </p>

Given the complexity of the evidence, the unusual nature of the injuries, the difficulties which the clinicians and experts found in piecing together the picture, the fact that this hearing has taken so long to investigate the matter, the twists and turns in the evidence, he submits that it is impossible to find that the father either knew of or ought to have known that his children were at risk or that the mother might be a threat to their safety. I agree.</p>

At no point during his evidence did I have any sense that he was either covering up for the mother or turning a blind eye to her behaviour. I find that he genuinely had no idea that she had injured E, nor in the circumstances can he be criticised for not raising any suspicions. The fact that he has stood by his partner up to now does not mean that he has up to this point failed to protect them. It remains to be seen what will now happen in the light of this judgment.</p>
