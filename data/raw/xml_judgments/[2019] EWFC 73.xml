	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the morning of 11 July 2017 baby J, who was almost 4 months old was discovered lifeless in his cot by his mother.  He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.  A subsequent skeletal survey discovered a number of rib fractures of different ages.  Yet further investigation identified subdural bleeding.  The cause of death was, and remains, unknown.  Over a protracted period, the local authority, whilst aware that it was thought that J may be the victim of inflicted injury, maintained the care of the other children in the family by their parents.  An early assessment, a later s.47 Assessment, as well as earlier instigation of the Public Law Outline, led to considerable enquiry into the family&#8217;s circumstances and functioning, and yet it was not until 2019 that proceedings were finally commenced.   </p>

At the PLO meeting, held in August, forensic psychological assessment was sought, the report being available in December.  A subsequent legal planning meeting (now almost 18 months after the death of J) decided that there was no immediate risk to the children, although the service manager appears to have directed that court proceedings should be implemented, I think because the mother was about to have another child, giving birth on 3 January 2019; it seems it was the pregnancy which finally galvanised the local authority into action.  In the application the authority sought an interim supervision order.  The matter came before the Designated Family Judge for Essex, HHJ Roberts, on 18 January 2019.  When listed for a further (contested) interim hearing on 23 January 2019, because of the unusual history, Judge Roberts transferred the case to me. </p>

I agree with Professor Mangham that based on the findings there is evidence of at least two separate episodes of trauma, one within a period of 2-5 days prior to death and the other significantly earlier and timed at 10 days to 4 weeks prior to death. I also agree with the opinion that the various rib fractures identified in this case are indicative of side to side compression of the chest typical of forceful squeezing. In my opinion this would be at a level of force significantly in excess of what might be termed rough handling considering that there was no evidence of any underlying bone disease.  As well as obvious healing fractures there were other more subtle changes that may represent further signs of rib trauma.  There is no pathological evidence of any abnormality of the spine in spite of the suggestions from radiological examination.  I have encountered this problem before and would regard the detailed histopathological appraisal of the bones as being the &#8220;gold standard&#8221;.   </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0in">Although Dr Du Plessis has not identified any signs of acute head or spinal cord injury in the period leading up to death, he has identified healing bilateral subdural haemorrhage timed as occurring around 2-4 weeks prior to death and not felt to be a residual sign of birth trauma.  Whilst the eyes showed no evidence in support of head trauma around that time, this does not exclude it.  It is noteworthy that the evidence of previous subdural haemorrhage overlaps with the timing of the older rib fractures. In my opinion on the balance of probabilities the deceased suffered a trauma in the 2-4 weeks prior to death characterised by side to side squeezing of the chest and bilateral thin film subdural haemorrhage. Such findings would typically be the result of shaking/impact trauma.  I note that shaking is admitted to on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> of May in association with apparent respiratory arrest.  Of course, from a pathological point of view an episode of shaking would providence an explanation for respiratory arrest as well as rib fracturing and subdural haemorrhage.  However, the shaking episode described, if it occurred, was said to have been significantly longer ago than the upper limit of timing for either the older rib fractures or the subdural haemorrhage.  This, together with the finding of more recent rib fractures, raises the possibility that the deceased was gripped/shaken on more than one occasion previously.&#8221; </p>

J had a twin, as well as older siblings, and at about the time of Dr Cary&#8217;s statement, the mother again fell pregnant.  In such cases it can never be appropriate for the local authority to simply decide not to issue proceedings, it was a misguided abrogation of their statutory duty.  It defies common sense. </p>

What is clear however, is that those enquiries should have happened at the outset, and at the very latest by Spring 2018.  I have been especially impressed by the helpful and dignified conduct of the family, counsel and solicitors in the case.  The approach of the lawyers has yet again emphasised the absolute imperative of the Court having the benefit of the very best specialists in this field.  But for their careful examination of the evidence, it would have been so easy for a really major miscarriage of justice to have occurred. </p>

It is the Local Authority which brings the proceedings and identifies the findings that they invite the Court to make. The burden of proving the assertions rests with them.  I bear in mind at all times that the burden is fairly and squarely placed on the Local Authority, and not on either parent. Other case law (such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>2013 UKSC and <span style="font-style:italic">Re BS </span>2013 EWCA 1146) reinforces the importance of proper findings based on proper facts; the principles are the same for whatever the proposed outcome. Here there is, as in many cases, a risk of a shift in the burden to the parents to explain occasions when injuries might have occurred. Whilst that can be an important component for the medical experts, it is not for the parents to explain but for the local authority to establish. There is no pseudo burden as Mostyn J put in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">VR</span> 2013 EWHC 3064 (fam). As HHJ Bellamy said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re FM (A Clinical Fractures: Bone Density):</span> [2015] EWFC B26. </p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities&#8230; a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a professional or forensic failure. It simply recognises that we still have much to learn and&#8230;it is dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury merely from the absence of any other understood mechanism&#8221; </p>

More worryingly, from the Court&#8217;s perspective, was that there were clear factual inaccuracies, not unfortunately remedied by the absences of notes of the examination, or record of the step by step process of the assessment and observations of J&#8217;s rib cage.

He considered  that the bilateral subdural neo-membranes should be measured in a matter of weeks, but did not go back as far as birth. No bleeding was present on the imaging at the Royal London. Therefore, the onset of the subdural bleeding both radiologically and pathologically was after the occurrence of the venous thrombosis.  Raised pressure can cause a back filling of the veins within the dural plexus, but this by itself would not necessarily be expected to cause subdural bleeding, more it is associated in clinical experience with hydrocephalus caused by a lack of drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid. However, the combination bilateral neck vein thrombosis, plus Dalteparin (causing a relative decrease in the blood&#8217;s ability to clot), could have contributed to subdural bleeding, either by spontaneous mechanism (although he had not encountered this combination before), or made J more prone to subdural bleeding after trauma.  He considered Dalteparin, even on its own, could predispose a subdural bleed from minor trauma during normal handling.  He said that it is hard to gauge the spectrum that might be required in such a sick child to cause subdural bleeding, it was difficult to be definitive.  </p>

Heparin increases the risk of bleeding, due to direct inhibition of blood clotting factors, and this extends to intracranial haemorrhaging.  Not all blood clotting disorders have been tested for in this case. However, of the ones that were (tested for), an underlying blood clotting disorder was not identified.  Heparin therapy when prolonged can cause thinning of the bones and increased risk of fractures. This is only significant with very prolonged administration over many months.  Heparin, with one of the identified blood disorders, presents a much higher risk of bleeding (depending on the blood disorder).

However, having regard to the chasm between the clinical evidence and evidence of pathology, it was vital.  His evidence was especially powerful because when he reported he had not seen the advices of Drs Cartlidge, Saggar and Watt.  So, for example, whilst he could see no evidence of bone disease which would render the bones more susceptible to fracture, he raised whether a diagnosis of osteopenia could be excluded when the examined bone material subject to examination has been decalcified.  He highlighted that prematurity and osteopenia are commonly linked.  Given the history, together with the administration of Dalteparin, he was being cautious about attributing the injuries to trauma.  He counselled caution also in relation to predisposition to fractures, ageing of fractures and increased excretion of minerals due to the administration of Frusemide.  He deferred to Dr Cartlidge in relation to propensity to fractures, the force required to cause those fractures, and the difficulty in assessing healing rates in a child with osteopenia. </p>

More affectingly, I gained a real sense of J himself, and of their relationship over his very short life.  Much of the detail now eluded her, which was no surprise, since we are talking of 2 years ago.  Mr Twomey QC, in his closing submissions, has marshalled and prayed in aid the very considerable body of evidence from many sources supporting the mother&#8217;s first rate capabilities.

In particular I was struck by the close attentive, empathetic bond the mother had with J, and recorded by everyone whom they encountered.  The father&#8217;s evidence was less satisfactory in a number of areas, but evidential difficulties (of which there were a number), do not assist this enquiry without the foundation facts being established first.  It is a danger which I think the local authority has misunderstood; the absence of a plausible explanation does not equate to a conclusion that the injuries are nonaccidental &#8211; that after all would throw the burden of proof onto the parents.   </p>

Here the early witnesses in the immediate post mortem enquiry brought together the two areas of injury, concluding, as it were, that each supported the other.

Most were willing to acknowledge the perspectives of the others.  I bear in mind the danger of looking at each piece of evidence in isolation, a linear approach, as opposed to looking at the wider canvass.

I conclude that it is overwhelmingly more likely that J had osteopenia before he became very unwell and was admitted to hospital.  I conclude that it is more likely that his treatment with Dalteparin and Frusemide would have aggravated that condition.  I conclude that each of J&#8217;s fractures occurred at a point when he was suffering from gracile and/or osteopenic bones, and could have been caused unnoticed by anyone during normal handling.  I am unable to date the age of the fractures. </p>

I conclude that the subdural bleed was more likely to have been caused by a combination of raised venous pressure, and/or the administration of Dalteparin.  I conclude that I am unable to age the bleed because of the individual and combined effects of the effect of Dalteparin and the bleeding process, the difficulty of relying on a relatively small thin bleed as evidence of there being no earlier bleed at the date of the scan, and the commencement of membrane organisation, and the time required to give rise to this type of membrane formation.  Even if I were wrong about the above, I could not rule out (and therefore the local authority fails to establish) a combination of blood disorder and Dalteparin and/or enlarged extra-axial spaces as causative.   </p>

Accordingly I discharge the proceedings.   </p>
