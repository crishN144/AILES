This was in the full knowledge of the father having issued the proceedings in Africa in July 2011 in circumstances where he was, in these proceedings, asking for an adjournment; and, unbeknown to those advising the parties in this jurisdiction, that application was being issued.&#160; The letters that Mr. Cayford QC has taken me to leading up to the first dispute appointment and the transcript of that hearing make that abundantly clear.&#160; </p>

Firstly, in relation to a comparison between the hours incurred by the father's solicitors and the hours incurred by the mother's solicitors during the breakdown of the bills.&#160; During the first period, the mother's solicitors incurred approximately 63 hours at senior partner or partner level, whereas the father is said to have incurred 40 hours.&#160; At the next stage leading up to the FDR, the figures become more stark.&#160; The mother's team incurred 101 hours, whereas the father's team incurred 58 hours.&#160; Secondly, the point made by Mr Francis QC is when you look at the difference between the costs schedule that was prepared on behalf of the mother's team on 19th February 2012 and the one that was distributed on 1st May 2012 in relation to the estimate of a partner's hours dealing with this application the difference is notable.&#160; The estimate was 35 hours in the estimate on 19th February, but it is said that the actual hours incurred were 93 hours, nearly three times the original estimate, which seems to be excessively high.&#160; </p>

If you look at the overall figures in relation to historical costs there is very little difference between the two sides (I think about &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 looking at the total figure).&#160; I, of course, acknowledge that, generally speaking, those acting for the applicant have to do a bit more of the running around in order to be able to get the application formulated and to provide the evidential basis for the case.&#160; But the worry in this case is that, despite having spent (as I have said) nearly &#163;270,000 in total, it is agreed that this is a relatively simple factual case.&#160; As I have said, it is a staggering amount of money.&#160; </p>
