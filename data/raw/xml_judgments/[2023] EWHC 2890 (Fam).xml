Dr Kolkiewicz was clear in answer to questions that a key element of the treatment plan while M undergoes treatment is to have family support and that could not be easily replicated in Germany.  It was a factor on which she placed some importance.  She warned that if M became overwhelmed by events in the early stages of her treatment such as would occur with a return to Germany or separation from D then she could be at risk of worsening depression and inpatient admission.  She could become suicidal which would make it harder for her to respond to the treatment because of the presence of what she terms &#8216;additional stressors&#8217;.

M required intervention by way of counselling as early as 2012 when she was in her early 20&#8217;s.  Around the same time, she was referred for CBT and she was reported to be struggling with depression. A year later she was prescribed temazepam for sleep issues which seem to be related to an abusive incident involving a stranger. In 2015 she was again noted to be depressed, suffering from insomnia and having a range of issues which led to a further prescription for diazepam and she was warned to contact her GP if she had any suicidal thoughts.  She had low mood again later in 2015.  In 2016 her father went to see her GP with some concerns about her. She was referred to a psychologist in 2017. In January 2020 around the time she married F she visited her GP reporting panic attacks and anxiety and was referred again for support.  In January 2023 M was reported to have a range of symptoms which were indicative of PTSD and the CBT therapist to whom she was referred noted that she agreed that &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">this is not the right time for trauma work and reliving&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

As to that, there are compelling reasons why the removing parent must be aware of whether or not consent exists. The first is that as a matter of ordinary language the word &#8220;consent&#8221; denotes the giving of permission to another person to do something. For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb (&#8220;avait consenti/had consented&#8221;): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention&#8217;s purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.&#8221;</span></p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified. It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.</span></p>

As was the fact that it took place with F&#8217;s oversight and involvement.   There was a high level of activity over a few days when belongings were packed and shipped by M.    I note that she had only taken two cases to London in May 2022 when she went for 23 days (a holiday which she thought was indefinite) where as on this occasion she packed 7 pieces of luggage, some of which she shipped in advance and she packed up a box to be sent on to her.  On any view the amount of luggage which M packed and then shipped was more than she would need for a 2 or a 4 week holiday.  It was more than she had previously packed for a similar trip.  Further it seems to me that this exercise was of an obviously different character because she was also shipping over books and her certificates, which she had brought to Germany when she relocated.</span></p>

She told F on the holiday that the marriage was over and she wanted to go back to London.    She began to action that immediately on her return.    Further and of more relevance is the fact that F was fully aware of the packing, the labelling of boxes and agreed to send material to her after she left.  F&#8217;s conduct around all of M&#8217;s packing and planning suggested that he agreed to her removing D to live in London.

However, I do consider it significant that in the weeks after M had travelled to London, and in particular when four weeks had passed, that being the point at which he had expected her return, F did not travel to London, as he had done in May 2022 to escort her and D back to Germany.  That seems to support the view that he was not expecting her to return.</span></p>

The fact that he made efforts to reconcile does not point to an absence of consent as is suggested.  His wish to reconcile with her and repair his marriage after she and D were in London points away from the suggestion that M had merely gone on her holidays for 4 weeks.   Indeed it is clear from his conversation with his psychiatrist in mid August that he knew M and D had left and gone to live in London but he was still holding a desire to reconcile.</span></p>

In assessing the nature of the risk to D under Article 13(b) it is highly relevant that Dr Kolkiewicz&#8217;s evidence was that the risk of deterioration of M&#8217;s illness is real and it must be carefully managed.

If D returned to Germany without M, this would have a similar impact on M&#8217;s mental ill health in England.

Further the loss of the day-to-day support of her family on which she is very reliant both for herself and for D could increase the risk of that deterioration being more severe.    Separation from her family would exacerbate her mental ill health and impede any recovery from it.  She would also experience the social isolation as a result of not speaking the language and not working.  She would be living on her own.

I pressed Mr Basi on whether his client was pursuing that suggestion and he confirmed to me that F was inviting the Court to order D&#8217;s return with or without her mother.  By his own admission F has never had the day-to-day care of D.  He has seen her once in 15 months.

The Court cannot accept that those proposals meet the risk in this case.  The prognosis of Dr Kolkiewicz is that M&#8217;s recovery could take 6-12 months at least and there is no guarantee that it can happen in that timescale.</span></p>

As noted above being in close proximity to F would be potentially triggering for her according to Dr Kolkiewicz given the domestic abuse which she has suffered which has caused her to have PTSD.  Returning to the home or in the alternative being in another flat would increase her isolation socially in circumstances where she is not working and does not have a support network. Being away from her own support network and her family is something she simply cannot manage at present.
