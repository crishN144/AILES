	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This matter concerns an application by the biological father, (&#8216;Z&#8217;), under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to revoke an adoption order made on 5 September 2017 in relation to X, now aged 4 years. The other parties to the application, namely the local authority, the adopters (Mr and Mrs A) and the children&#8217;s guardian all oppose the application. The birth mother, (&#8216;Y&#8217;), although a party to the application, has taken no active part in the proceedings. In the event the application to revoke is successful, Z has also applied for parental responsibility.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">These applications have been the subject of protracted proceedings due to a number of factors. A previous hearing on 4 June 2020 considered Z&#8217;s application for a declaration that the adoption order was void ab initio due to what was said to be invalid consent to adoption being given by Y. Judgment was given on 24 June dismissing that application<span style="font-weight:bold"/>and permission to appeal was refused by Baker LJ on 29 July 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The matter was first listed for substantive hearing on 6 August 2020 for 3 days. That hearing was adjourned due to the court&#8217;s concern as to whether Y should be given a further opportunity to engage in the proceedings. The adjourned hearing listed on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October started, but had to be adjourned when it became apparent during the evidence of one of the witnesses on the first day significant relevant evidence had not been disclosed. A hearing in November 2020 had to be adjourned due to the unavailability of Z&#8217;s counsel and the hearing finally took place on 22 &#8211; 24 February 2021. Written closing submissions were directed and a hearing took place for oral submissions on 19 March 2021. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Irrespective of the outcome of these applications, the court recognises the impact of these delays on both Z and Mr and Mrs A. For each of them it has meant a significant period of uncertainty that has no doubt been very difficult for them. Whilst the court&#8217;s role is to determine the applications it does not do so unaware of the people who lay behind it, and the impact of any conclusions reached by the court. </p>

Whilst Z had some understanding of English he has required an interpreter in the hearings and during his oral evidence.

As a consequence, he had to leave that accommodation and went to stay at Wellwood Road, Goodmayes in about September/October 2016. At some point during 2016 Z said Y had moved to Uxbridge, due to it being more convenient for her work particularly as her pregnancy advanced. Z described visiting there from time to time, staying overnight on three occasions, and was able to give some details about the address and accommodation. </p>

The first picture of Y showing she was pregnant Z said was taken in Poland and sent to him in April/May 2016. The later photographs were at Dereham Road and the 4 photos of them en route to Uxbridge he said were on 30 September 2016. By that stage he described Y living in Uxbridge but still visiting Dereham Road, suggesting this was part of Y&#8217;s plan that he would not see her on a daily basis. Z said Y refused to give him the delivery date for the birth. One of the photos he produced he said shows them on 21 October 2016 at Y&#8217;s address in Uxbridge. Z said Y was aware at the time of X&#8217;s birth he was living at Wellwood Road. He described Y ringing him in tears in the early hours of the morning saying the baby had died. When he said he would come to the hospital to help she resisted this, saying if he did he would be asked for his identity. He described trying to call her again when she didn&#8217;t pick up. When she did she said she had been under medical treatment and would come home. Z said he sought the advice of Mr O, who </p>

The Children&#8217;s Guardian had been able to hear Z&#8217;s evidence and acknowledged the reflective content, including the thought Z had given to X in the context where Z says Y did not give a truthful account, the reality of the time X has been with Mr and Mrs A and the impact on X of being moved from them. The Children&#8217;s Guardian noted Z acknowledged he wanted to be helped by support and guidance, which she supported, and she saw the benefits for X in that being made available for Z. The Children&#8217;s Guardian acknowledged that there had been no assessment of Z as a parent, as he had not been able to participate in the earlier care and adoption proceedings. Looking at the position now and going forward through these proceedings there is now more information about Z, which would benefit X. Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian supported the idea of some form of mediation/support that was not in the context of adjourning any proceedings, due to the detriment of ongoing proceedings, or with it having any stated outcome. She acknowledged what she saw as Z&#8217;s better appreciation of X&#8217;s position in his oral evidence. The Children&#8217;s Guardian considered Mr and Mrs A are best able to assess when X would be ready for any contact with Z, focussed on X&#8217;s best interests and there is not a definitive timescale. The Children&#8217;s Guardian saw the value of work with Z if the applications were refused to assist Z understand the legal framework, that he would not have a role in X&#8217;s life but that did not erase Z&#8217;s position from X&#8217;s life. In addition, whilst Z feels aggrieved about what Y did the Children&#8217;s Guardian considers Z needs to be assisted in coming to terms with what happened. The Children&#8217;s Guardian understood the concerns about wider knowledge about X&#8217;s circumstances by those who are providing support for Z. The Children&#8217;s Guardian confirmed her view that if the order was revoked it would have a huge impact on X, which is increased by the complexities of the history. </p>

MacDonald J noted that there was a marked lack of rigour and urgency in those proceedings in taking steps to identify the whereabouts of the birth father. The birth father subsequently notified the court that he sought to care for the child and he was given notice of the adoption proceedings in June 2019. Four months later the court made an adoption order, with steps having been taken to seek to engage the father. During that four month period the father did not seek to make any of the applications available to him to oppose the making of that adoption order and made no application until his application to revoke the order 3 months after the adoption order was made.

In his second statement he refers to Y visiting him for a short time the day after the birth and returning to Poland (which he said he funded), Y returning for 2 weeks in December and then going back to Poland. In his second statement Z states he was in communication with Y every day by Facebook messenger. In that statement Z describes opening the bag Y had left in his accommodation in October 2017 and, for the first time, seeing documents that suggested X was still alive and that Y had entered into a marriage in Turkey. In that statement he says <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I was mortified that she had lied to me about my son dying and furious at how I had been deceived by her throughout&#8230;.I immediately approached a firm of solicitors called Okafor &amp; Co to assist with my case.

It became clear during the evidence at the hearing in October that other material had not been disclosed, despite the clear directions of the court in previous orders. The statements that followed that hearing seek to provide an account of the material Z had sent to his solicitors. A confusing schedule of the 165 photos attached to Z&#8217;s statement dated 9 November 2020 make it clear material that was in the possession of Z&#8217;s solicitors in August 2020 had not been disclosed. This included photographs of Z in different locations (such as the accommodation in Uxbridge, central London and a dinner following the meeting on 10 December), as well as at least 40 photos of the documents that were found in Y&#8217;s suitcase that had been sent to Z&#8217;s solicitor in October 2019. </p>

Whilst it is right the court must factor in that Y has chosen not to engage with these proceedings, her account has consequently not been tested and that impacts on the weight her account is given.

Z&#8217;s actions and inconsistent accounts in 2017 in relation to Y&#8217;s possessions left in the accommodation he was living in do not make sense. He first referred to the message exchanges between him and Y about them as taking place in May 2017, that was then changed to October 2017. Unfortunately the messages do not have any contemporaneous information on them regarding the date. Y leaving such critical documents in Z&#8217;s possession in the circumstances where she gave the account she did to Z about X&#8217;s birth make no sense either. </p>

First, the inconsistency between what she informed the local authority at the meetings in the period after X&#8217;s birth about her lack of contact or knowledge about Z&#8217;s circumstances and what appears to have been her contact with Z after the birth, her attendance at the event on 10 December and her continuing contact with Z. Second, how the evidence about the marriage in Turkey in August 2016 fits into the picture. Third, why she would leave a number of important and detailed documents in Z&#8217;s possession for such a long period of time. Fourth, why she has not taken any continuing part in these proceedings bearing in mind the implications for X. </p>

As was set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O &#8216;The fact that the circumstances are highly exceptional does not of itself justify revoking the adoption order&#8217;.</span> Where, for example, there has been a failure of natural justice, and a party with a right to be heard on the application for the adoption order has not been notified of the hearing or has not for some other reason been heard, the court has jurisdiction to set aside the order and so make good the failure of natural justice, but that can&#8217;t be in a vacuum. As Sir Thomas Bingham MR stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B &#8216; I would also have little hesitation in holding that the court </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> set aside an adoption order which was shown to have been obtained by fraud&#8217;[emphasis added].</span> Ms Obi-Ezekpazu has sought to suggest that this is as of right, which is not supported by the authorities. It is of note that <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> states it <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> be set aside, not that it will. </p>

I accept the evidence of Ms L and Ms W that they had nothing to suggest Y or the information she was giving was other than genuine. The information the court was given was addressed with orders, such as disclosure orders. Within the adoption proceedings suitable enquiries were made through CFAB regarding the position in Poland and whether Y&#8217;s mother would be in a position to care for the child. At each stage the local authority and the court took such further steps it could to seek to find and inform X&#8217;s birth father. </p>

Y was living in Uxbridge, had been there for some time with only periodic visits from Z, there was a short period they lived intermittently together at Dereham Road and Wellwood Road, although Y did not give up her accommodation in Uxbridge. Z reports Y was angry at the time of her pregnancy, did not want to marry Z and married another person in August 2016. </p>

He had the name of the hospital, the date of birth and Y&#8217;s name. Those around Z at the time did not believe what Y said and told Z to question X&#8217;s claimed death. Y informing Z not to attend the hospital and Z&#8217;s reasons for not doing so lend support to what Y has said is Z&#8217;s primary concern, namely his ability to stay in the UK. The longer Z took no action to enquire about the circumstances of X it becomes increasingly clear that his primary focus is his own position. </p>

Z had the support of his church and Mr O. I agree with Ms Cronin the claim by Z of fraud and breach of natural justice have to be looked at in the context of all the information the court has, including the steps taken by Z and any reasons that may lay behind them. I am satisfied that Z deliberately refrained from investigating the report of X&#8217;s death driven by his own position and when he learned of the deception a further 15 months passed before he made the application the court is considering today. Each of those actions by Z do not stand up to close analysis. In my judgment Z could and should have taken steps earlier than he did. </p>

Whilst this situation is very different on the facts it is relevant that Z did not have parental responsibility, a potential family life with Y or family support here. </p>

The court cannot ignore the consequences for X. The revocation of the adoption order would restore the status quo ante. It would re-instate Y&#8217;s parental responsibility. As she appears to have no wish to assume X&#8217;s care there would need to be further court proceedings, including consideration as whether an adoption order should be made in favour of Mr and Mrs A. Such a position on the evidence the court has would place X at real risk of significant harm due to the uncertainty regarding his identity, the undermining of his secure legal relationship with Mr and Mrs A and close family relatives and what Ms Cronin refers to as his <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;lived and secure identity&#8217;.</span> Such fundamental changes are beyond X&#8217;s current understanding and would very likely have long term adverse consequences for his welfare needs, as the Children&#8217;s Guardian has set out. </p>
