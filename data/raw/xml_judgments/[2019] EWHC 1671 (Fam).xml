Specifically, this court is required to decide on an urgent basis whether it is in T&#8217;s best interests to be treated by way of blood transfusion in circumstances where consent for such treatment is not forthcoming from his mother, who is a committed and conscientious Jehovah&#8217;s Witness.  The mother has instructed solicitors and those solicitors have been given short notice that this urgent application is being made. </p>

I am also acutely aware that T is not himself represented.  However, against this, the court is faced with evidence that, having this morning suffered one cardiac arrest, treatment for T in the form of a blood transfusion in order to manage his cardiac failure and seek to prevent further arrests is now <span style="font-style:italic">extremely</span> urgent.  For those reasons I am content it is right to deal with the application this afternoon on what is, in effect, a without notice basis, albeit the order I make will be of only short duration in the first instance, it being my intention that the matter will return to Court on Tuesday morning. </p>

Upon being advised by Dr C on 17 June 2019 that T would likely need blood transfusion in the near future, the mother spoke with the Jehovah&#8217;s Witness Hospital Liaison Committee.  Dr C&#8217;s statement makes clear that a representative of that Committee asked doctors to consider alternative, non-blood based, products to treat T.  The evidence of the Board is that, in the current circumstances and given T&#8217;s particular difficulties, treatments alternative to that of blood transfusion, and capable of providing the same relief, are not available.  Dr C states that this was relayed to the representative of the Jehovah&#8217;s Witness Hospital Liaison Committee. </p>

The clear medical consensus at that meeting was that it was in T&#8217;s best interests to have a blood transfusion and that this should not be further delayed.  In her statement of 21 June 2019 Dr C relates that at a subsequent meeting the mother stated that she was not refusing a blood transfusion and was intending to consider completing a form of understanding.  This has not yet been done. </p>

Dr C opines that this may well have been the result of his cardiac failure.  Within this context, Dr C is now of the view that T <span style="font-style:italic">urgently</span> requires a blood transfusion to be administered as a means of managing his cardiac failure and preventing further cardiac arrests.   In her statement Dr C reiterates that alternative non-blood based products will not suffice to achieve this outcome and that commencement of an iron preparation has not been successful in addressing these issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr C relates in her statement that the mother contends that she has been informed by a cardiologist that T does not require a blood transfusion.  Dr C believes that this may be a reference to advice given to the mother by Dr L at the MDT on 20 June 2019 that one of the operations being contemplated for T in due course can be undertaken without the benefit of a blood transfusion.  This afternoon Mr Davidson has handed to the court an attendance note recording a conversation his instructing solicitor has had with Dr L.  Dr L confirmed that he had told the mother that should a surgical closure of T&#8217;s cardiac abnormality be undertaken by way of open heart surgery a blood transfusion would not usually be used as part of that procedure.  Dr L confirmed that the different question of whether a blood transfusion should be in T&#8217;s best interests given his current acute situation was one taken by the MDT as a whole. </p>

No consent has been given by T&#8217;s father.  In the circumstances, where it is plain that T lacks the capacity to consent or refuse medical treatment, at present there is no consent to the urgent course of action that T&#8217;s treating team now consider to be in his best interests.  Within the foregoing context, and in the absence of parental consent, the Board now seeks the permission of this court to administer blood products to T. </p>

In making the objective best interests decision it is required to in cases of this nature, the court subordinates the views and wishes of the parents to the best interests of the child solely by reason of the fact that responsibility for arriving at that objective assessment of the child&#8217;s best interests lies exclusively with the court, in which assessment the child&#8217;s best interests are the court&#8217;s paramount concern. </p>
