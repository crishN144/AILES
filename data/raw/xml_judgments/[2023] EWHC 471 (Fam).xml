	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The purpose of this judgment is to provide guidance upon the practice to be adopted when court orders need to be served upon a person who is thought to be residing at a women&#8217;s refuge. In such cases a tension exists between, on the one hand, the need for the court&#8217;s orders to be served and, on the other, the need to ensure confidentiality of the address of a refuge for the protection of the vulnerable individuals who have sought protection there. The Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;] do not make any express provision for these circumstances and there is not thought to be any previous reported authority or other guidance on the approach to be taken.</p>

In addition to receiving submissions from the two parties to the proceedings, who are the parents of a 21 month old boy, the court has been assisted by submissions from counsel on behalf of (a) the Secretary of State for Justice and (b) Latin America Women&#8217;s Aid  [&#8216;LAWA&#8217;], Refuge, and the Women&#8217;s Aid Foundation of England [&#8216;WAFE&#8217;], as interveners.</p>

F will be identified as female in this judgment. The respondent mother [&#8216;M&#8217;] is Bolivian. They married on 15 August 2020. M left her home in Bolivia and the parties have lived in England and Wales since the wedding. Their son, J, was born in May 2021.</p>

F subsequently applied for a Prohibited Steps Order (&#8220;PSO&#8221;) against removal, that application was served on M the following day. Shortly after that, M and J moved into a refuge in London. F then applied for the return of J to her care, a PSO against removal and the handing over of any and all travel documents, passports or applications for the same. That application was served on M by email. On the same day, M obtained a without notice non-molestation order against F.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">LAWA subsequently wrote to Morgan J detailing their concerns over the orders that had been made. They highlighted that the service of similar orders in previous cases had resulted in significant harm. LAWA explained that service of the court order on the mother would result in her having to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;immediately taken to another refuge with the child. The refuge will no longer consider it safe for her to remain at that location when the address has been compromised. It also leaves&#8217; other women and children at risk&#8221;</span>. Additionally, they raised concerns about the process of without notice location orders being used to continue abusive behaviour.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 30 June, the matter was heard before Mrs Justice Knowles. Knowles J discharged the location order, save for ordering that travel documents should be given to the Tipstaff.  A child arrangements order was made providing for indirect contact between F and J via photographs and a video. The court ordered F to set out her proposals for contact and living arrangements. Further directions were made and the proceedings themselves were transferred back to the Central Family Court. The High Court, however, retained consideration of the issue of service at a refuge and directions were made for the position of LAWA, the IMECE Women&#8217;s Centre and Islington LBC Refuge (and their respective employees) to be considered at a further hearing. Women&#8217;s Aid and Refuge were invited to intervene. The court also invited the Secretary of State for Justice to intervene to assist the court and the other parties to consider the following three issues of principle:</p>

These submissions were largely accepted by all parties and by LAWA and WAFE as providing common ground upon which guidance might be based. In the circumstances, there was no need for Mr Pobjoy to attend and the hearing proceeded on the basis of the other parties making submissions in order to develop certain points. The court is most grateful to the Secretary of State, and to Mr Pobjoy on his behalf, for the obvious care taken in assisting the court in this important matter and for doing so in a manner which has achieved the agreement of all parties.</p>

This is obviously right and I will make a formal request for the Rule Committee to take the issue up. The focus of the SoS&#8217; submissions was therefore upon what provision may be made in the interim, under the existing rules. By the end of the hearing it was, however, largely accepted that the current rules go a long way to providing a workable solution and that the proposed interim measures may, once considered by the Rule Committee, provide the basis for practice in the longer term.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the detail of any interim arrangements, Dr Proudman reminded the court of the important role refuges play by protecting the security of women through the provision of confidential addresses and rigorous security measures. Safety measures include the use of a PO Box, keeping doors and ground floor windows locked at all times, checking the identity of visitors, turning off location settings on phones, and taking other steps to ensure security. In addition to the provision of a physically safe haven, refuges provide an environment which is staffed by individuals who are psychologically well informed and, in particular, trauma aware.</p>

Disclosure of the address to third parties risks that safety for all residents. All residents sign an agreement with the refuge that they will not disclose the address at risk of being evicted from the refuge. All refuges provide a PO Box or office address for correspondence with residents of the refuge.</span></p>

The additional discrimination they face makes them particularly vulnerable. The mere fact of being a migrant woman with historic links in another country, insecure immigration status or having no recourse to public funds is not sufficient to show there is a risk of abduction. The act of seeking refuge mitigates against any risk that might exist. Refuge staff should never be expected to act as translator of court documents for a resident in the refuge&#8221;.</span></p>

Where a respondent is residing in a refuge there must be a presumption that they are a complainant, if not a victim, of domestic abuse and must therefore be regarded as a vulnerable party by the court. In those circumstances the court is under a duty to consider what participation directions are required. Participation directions, it was submitted, are not limited to the giving of evidence, but extend to participation throughout the proceedings and should include questions of service.</p>

In each case the named staff member was required by the order to disclose information about the whereabouts of the respondent and child. The order required the staff member to state the address of the location where the child was residing, and thus give out the address of the refuge. In email correspondence, the applicant&#8217;s solicitors had stated that the refuge staff would be at risk of being imprisoned for contempt of court. It was submitted that individual staff members should never be named in a court order.</p>

The judgment provides guidance upon the practice to be adopted when court orders need to be served upon a person who is thought to be residing at a women&#8217;s refuge.
