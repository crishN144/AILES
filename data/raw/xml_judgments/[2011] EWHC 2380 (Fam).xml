Having been made aware of various queries raised in regard to my cut and paste consolidation of the travelling draft Deed, I took the opportunity of an existing 5 day fixture in my diary at the PRFD to direct a 1 hour hearing  before me on 7 February 2011. I circulated an accompanying Note stating my intention to put this litigation to an end if at all possible.</p>

She asked for summary Orders to put into the hands of her camp the purchase of a property she had found which met the parties&#8217; agreed criteria including price and location. The father and Dr Pelling, his continuing representative on paper and now nominated presumptive Trustee were, she said, dragging their feet in putting in place everything required to buy the property on the Trust terms ordered by the Court. </p>

I considered that it would be unprincipled to make an Order without hearing the father and adjourned over to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th,</span> February. I drafted a short Order putting the father and Dr Pelling on notice of what was sought. Both he and father were already well aware of the purchase proposal, the property having been identified to them on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. A copy of the survey was already in their hands and Dr Pelling, as I was told,  had made his own plans to visit that very day.   </p>

The father kept an existing appointment in connection with a charitable activity in Poland. He sent in a note composed the night before but was represented as he has been since July 2005 by his McKenzie friend Dr Pelling.  About 2 hours was taken up in further discussion. I considered that the issues raised required the attendance of the father to put his case fully and provide up to date information and so adjourned the application to Friday 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. The providential collapse of my list allowed that hearing to extend from 10 am to 3.30 pm sitting through the lunch adjournment. </p>

I wish the parties to have as full an explanation as possible of my analysis and where it guides me which may be of further use if the matter returns to be considered by another judge of the Division and, of course, if either party is minded to take my Order to the Court of Appeal.</p>

That pattern continues. Shared residence was not recommended by the Cafcass officer who reported that the mother was worn down by disputes with the father and the litigation. The DJ referred to documentation put before the Family Division Judge(s) in his application for adjournment which she said contained misrepresentations of the law, was unnecessarily lengthy and repetitive and was full of &#8220;uncorroborated and extremely nasty statements&#8221; all of which led her to conclude that a shared residence order would be unworkable and by putting the mother under even more stress be detrimental to N&#8217; welfare.</p>

This utterly unprofessional and luridly expressed report (which I have read) unsurprisingly led to a complaint to her professional body as Dr M, later the jointly instructed psychiatrist, records, with what result I do not know.</p>

While he found it difficult to access the mother&#8217;s history, he noted her history of post-natal depression (for which she was prescribed antidepressants by another psychiatrist) which abated on the separation. He diagnosed varying episodes of anxiety of long standing but neither a sustained nor a generalized anxiety disorder. While noting the presence of histrionic and impulsive traits he detected no personality disorder within the DSM IV Manual classification. She was not a risk. Her personality traits and vulnerability interacted unhelpfully with traits he observed in the father. She was more fragile than average and more sensitive to criticism and adversity. The effect of the proceedings he noted (in 2008) was to reduce her sense of stability. </p>

From these causes came 6 months of endless cross fire in drafting but not agreeing the Deed between two amateur draftsmen. Dr Pelling says it was the fault and neglect of Mr Holden and the mother. But Mr Holden was outgunned by the intensity and elaboration of his opposite number and nothing brought to my attention demonstrated his own want of good will to settle and finalise the work endlessly in progress.</p>

I pointed out that no such time lag had ever been suggested at any stage. While I now note that DJ Roberts provided payment from the absent payer party 19 weeks after her Order that was 6 years ago. This newly declared interval seemed inconsistent with the father&#8217;s vigorous complaint on 9 December 2010 of what he said was the mother&#8217;s intolerable delay in lining up mortgage finance so that the Order could be implemented. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Friday 11 February father told me he needed 6 weeks not 4. I asked so that I could understand his case and evaluate what I considered an indulgence sought from the Court, how the money was to be found. Dr Pelling interjected to say I had no authority to pursue such line of inquiry. I said &#8211; I consider correctly &#8211; that I had. Father became visibly agitated and said he would give no details. Mr Holden asked me to examine the father on oath or have him cross-examined. I declined &#8211; my unspoken reason being chiefly that without disclosure and documentation the exercise was almost pointless.</p>

At the end of the hearing, Dr Pelling carefully acknowledged that in principle it was but subject to the Trustees carrying out their duties and a report from the roofer whose inspection the previous Friday had been aborted through illness. I asked whether Dr Pelling was minded to adopt the surveyor&#8217;s report. I received no clear answer.</p>

He said I needed to understand the dynamics of parenting and he would send me an American paper by a leading psychiatrist which I told him I would read with interest. He then told me that all he wanted was proper procedure while the mother had told lies and jumped outside the Deed unforgivably. He assured me the money would be available in 6 weeks without allowing any further particulars. Neither he nor Dr Pelling on his behalf were prepared to take urgent steps to keep the purchase. </p>

He said he required an undertaking or assurance that Mr Holden would not interfere in Trust business or pursue the instruction of his selected solicitor. I said Mr Holden could not be prevented from advising the wife but declined to enjoin. Dr Pelling pointed out that a direction under s39 of 1990 Act bound him as if he had signed so that he would be contractually liable together with his co-trustee in the event of default in providing money by his own client or by the mother or both. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the contention of Dr Pelling that I have no power or alternatively should not exercise my discretion to order payment. In my judgment, unless the father&#8217;s obligation is anchored to a fixed obligation in time, there is every risk of drift. Further delay is in my judgment unconscionable, detrimental to N&#8217; welfare and would be a breach of the duty of the Court to ensure that its Orders are performed. A fixed date avoids what I can describe as Dr Pelling&#8217;s chicken/egg suggestion that the Deed cannot be executed until the money is in. I am not prepared to countenance anything less than a binding obligation which will provide a platform if necessary for enforcement or, if necessary, exercise of the Court&#8217;s powers under TOLATA to ensure performance of this Trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I wish to make it clear that if there is unreasonable further delay or obstruction by either party the Court must consider more radical surgery including Orders under TOLATA directing performance of the Trust as the Court thinks fit or otherwise under its inherent powers. In my judgment, the primary obligation is the performance of an Order made for the benefit of the child and the mechanism of the Trust in the form of this Deed is in the last analysis only a device for the performance of the Court&#8217;s objective. I do not exclude the possibility that a court may come to the view if appropriate that adjustment may have to be made to the quantum of the lump sum to have the same effect as the Order made in May 2005. </p>
