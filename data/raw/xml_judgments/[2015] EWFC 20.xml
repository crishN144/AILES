The back ground to the case, the reasons why there was a retrial and the reasons why the case has taken so long to come to a conclusion are set out in a judgment given by Her Honour Judge Hudson on 29 August 2014 which I shall take as read: <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Child) </span>[2014] EWFC B154. </p>

A letter to F informing him of the proposed placement was not hand delivered because of what the local authority described as &#8216;safety concerns for professionals&#8217; and it was considered too sensitive to post. In these circumstances, the letter was still with the local authority at the time of an email exchange between the solicitors on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014.&#8221;</p>

Referring to the situation in which the parents, the adopters and S now found themselves, she said:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This difficult and anxious situation could have been avoided. Firstly, the four month delay in lodging the appeal notice was, in my judgment, unacceptable. In my experience, appeal notices are lodged, if needs be, by the proposed appellant acting in person, while applications for Legal Aid are pursued and where reasons (or a transcript of judgment) are awaited. This has the obvious good sense that the parties and the court are aware of the appeal and can manage the situation accordingly. Secondly, communication between the respective solicitors could easily have avoided this situation. There should have been further correspondence from F&#8217;s solicitor to the local authority, confirming that the appeal was still being pursued, bearing in mind the time that had elapsed since the decision and long after the time for lodging an appeal had expired. Where the local authority had been notified of a proposed appeal, it should have acknowledged receipt of the letter informing them of that proposed appeal and acted upon it. Most importantly, before proceeding to place a child for adoption in such circumstances, it is in my judgment incumbent on the local authority to check the position in relation to a proposed appeal of which it has been notified. They should have notified F&#8217;s solicitor of the proposed placement in advance. I very much regret these failures, with their inevitable impact on the prospective adopters (who bear no responsibility whatsoever for the unfortunate situation in which S is now placed). I do not under estimate the potential impact on S.&#8221;</p>

As Judge Hudson pointed out, all this could have been avoided if only the solicitors had &#8216;chased&#8217; the local authority for an answer to their letter of 24 April 2014 and, more especially, if the local authority&#8217;s legal department had checked the position with the father&#8217;s solicitors before giving their advice on 23 May 2014.</p>

By then, of course, S had already been placed. The same day there was a discussion between the social worker, her team manager and the permanence team manager: &#8220;Agreed not to inform Adopters until we know outcome.&#8221; On 31 July 2014 there was a statutory LAC visit to S and the adopters: &#8220;Adopters remain positive about their future with S and spoke of making a formal application to adopt at the earliest opportunity.&#8221; They were told nothing about the appeal. On 7 August 2014 there was a LAC Review: &#8220;the carers were discussing their intention to formally adopt S at the 10 week stage.&#8221; Again, they were told nothing about the appeal. On 28 August 2014 there was a statutory LAC visit: &#8220;Adopters plan to lodge application asap.&#8221; Again, they were told nothing about the appeal, which had by then been heard by Judge Hudson. Judgment, allowing the father&#8217;s appeal, was given on 29 August 2014. There was a discussion the same day between the social worker, her team manager, the permanence team manager, H, and a lawyer from the local authority&#8217;s legal department:</p>

No doubt the initial decision not to tell the adopters what was going on was taken with the best of motives, even if the thinking which underlay it was na&#239;ve and fraught with problems. But the all too foreseeable consequence was that the local authority was gradually enmeshed in a series of dealings with the adopters which passed imperceptibly from non-disclosure to something more serious. Complete frankness was surely called for from the outset.</p>

Addressing what Judge Hudson had required, it contains the profoundly unsatisfactory information that &#8220;Northumberland would need to have discussions with Newcastle &#8230;&#8221; and again that &#8220;There would need to be discussion with Newcastle &#8230;&#8221; This was not a proper compliance with Judge Hudson&#8217;s very clear order. The local authority was required to address its mind to the &#8220;practical support &#8230; needed to assist the father&#8221; and the &#8220;practical support [it] can provide&#8221;.  You do not identify what is needed by saying that you are going to discuss it with someone.</p>
