	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">  The Hospital Trust has brought the proceedings in the High Court in respect of S who is a patient of the Hospital. S is 18, having been born on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1984.  He was born with the genetic condition, velo-cardiac facial syndrome, which is the result of a deletion of chromosome 22. He has a number of major problems, principally severe global developmental delay and bilateral renal dysplasia.   In May 2000 he was admitted to the Hospital for emergency treatment for acute renal failure and has been on haemodialysis ever since. His medical treatment is seriously complicated by his severe learning disability with  problems arising from his limited understanding of the medical treatment he is receiving. He has been diagnosed as autistic. He suffers from epilepsy, a tendency to blood clotting, for which he takes warfarin, and has a moderate immuno-deficiency. His mental capacity has been assessed by a clinical psychologist as about 5 to 6 years old with even more limitations on his verbal communication skills. He clearly does not have capacity to make decisions about his medical treatment.  The issues which bring this matter to court at the instigation of the Hospital Trust revolve around his future treatment and management of his end stage renal failure.  The High Court is invited to give declaratory relief in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction based upon a judicial assessment of the best interests of S.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the pleadings, the Hospital Trust sought a declaration that it should be permitted not to perform a kidney transplantation on S since it would not be in S&#8217;s best interests. It also sought a declaration that S should not undergo peritoneal dialysis. It has always been the intention of the Hospital Trust that haemodialysis should continue for the foreseeable future but that, in the event that haemodialysis could no longer be provided, no other form of dialysis should be attempted and there should be provision for palliative care. The parents opposed the granting of the declarations and wanted the Hospital Trust to carry out a kidney transplantation on S. His mother who is his devoted carer offered to donate one of her kidneys which, from initial tests, might be compatible. Although there has been some question mark over her intellectual capacity, there is no suggestion in these proceedings that she is not competent to make that offer.  The Official Solicitor acts on behalf of S. His initial stance had been that all forms of dialysis should be considered and he reserved his position on the suitability of a kidney transplantation. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the case progressed, the areas of disagreement diminished substantially. On the basis of the medical evidence to which I shall turn below, there is general agreement that S should continue on haemodialysis as long as he is able to do so. The parties have agreed that, when haemodialysis can no longer be given, S should be put on to peritoneal dialysis. It is further agreed that a kidney transplantation is not in S&#8217;s best interests at the present time. There remain two outstanding areas of disagreement:</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Underlying these two issues is the conflicting evidence as to the extent to which S would be able to understand the purpose of any treatment or surgery, be prepared for it, be able to cope with it and be managed by the hospital staff without undue distress to him and without undue difficulty for the Hospital staff. The differing perceptions of the witnesses as to the severity of S&#8217;s learning disability, his ability to cope with change and the ability of others to cope with the interference to his routine, lies at the root of the opposition of the Hospital Trust to a kidney transplantation or to attempting the use of an AV fistula as an alternative to the present method of haemodialysis.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">S first came to the attention of the Hospital Trust as a small baby when he was admitted for investigation for a variety of medical problems, including bilateral dysplastic/hypoplastic kidneys with reduced renal function. He was thereafter seen regularly in the paediatric outpatient department of his local hospital and it was apparent from blood tests that he had progressive renal failure. He was on medical treatment for epilepsy and low calcium. In January 1998, in a specialist paediatric department of another hospital, he was diagnosed as suffering from velo-cardiac-facial syndrome. He was also seen by a consultant immunologist and tests revealed a mild problem with his immune system.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2000, S was admitted to the local hospital and transferred to the Hospital Trust for emergency treatment. He was diagnosed with end stage renal failure with severe fluid overload and respiratory failure.  Two consultants counselled the family about the severe difficulty of undertaking dialysis treatment with such a developmentally delayed child and raised the question whether dialysis was appropriate. The family wished everything possible to be done for S and the Hospital Trust decided to treat him.  He underwent emergency dialysis that night and has been stabilised on regular maintenance haemodialysis ever since. During the emergency treatment which included giving a general anaesthetic, the hospital staff found him difficult to manage. He was very distressed on emerging from the anaesthetic and difficult to control. During May and on his readmission in June 2000, he was sometimes aggressive and violent towards his mother and the nursing staff. Several times he pulled out tubes or lines and he had to be physically restrained. He was treated with antidepressant medication and on occasions sedated before dialysis. From the records it can be seen that he then settled down and became more manageable.</p>

According to the investigations of the Official Solicitor, he can interact with others, his powers of communication are increasing and he is becoming more spontaneous.

Since he is autistic, routine is important for him but over two and a half years he has become accustomed to a routine and he generally sits in the same chair. During dialysis he can move about to some extent. He is provided with toys and plays on the hospital computer which is brought to him on a trolley.  A teacher assigned to the paediatric unit works with him during dialysis. There are problems for the Hospital Trust in communication with him since they have only attempted speech and have not used any forms of facilitation, but S is normally patient and co-operative with the process of dialysis. He is settled in the paediatric unit, and has become accustomed to its routine in which he clearly receives a high degree of personal medical and nursing care and where his problems are well understood.</p>

His previous lines have failed due either to infection or blockage. The current line was inserted in October 2000 and has been effective for an unusually long period. It became affected by a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterium which caused S to have intermittent bouts of fever over a period of 6 weeks at the end of last year. The failure initially to control the bacterium led to the present proceedings being initiated by the Hospital Trust since it feared there might be no further venous entry points available if the current line had to be removed.  The bacterium is now controlled and the urgency of the medical situation has receded, although S is likely to have recurrent bouts of fever every three to four months.  In any event it is clear that decisions should be taken now to plan his future treatment and deal with the issues in dispute.</p>

He was, however, very well behaved and compliant with her colleagues. Her conclusion was that he had severe learning difficulties and social impairment which was most marked with peer interaction. He had good relationships with adults. Combined with his somewhat rigid expectation of events, and his severe learning disorder he also had a more pervasive developmental disorder that was within the autistic spectrum. She wrote</p>

Provided he attends for dialysis regularly, provided he sits in the same seat in the dialysis room, provided he has access to his usual toys and games, and so on, then he can cope. However any deviation from this produces great distress in S and his behaviour becomes aggressive and violent. He has hit, punched and kicked his mother and also physically attacked the nursing staff. S has required sedative medication in order to allow us and his mother to manage him.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"Dialysis and transplantation treatment is very unpredictable and prone to sudden and dramatic changes and unexpected need for medical intervention. Transplantation itself poses a huge stress on all families.  There are no guarantees of success. The out patient follow up after transplantation in the Paediatric Transplant Clinic is very intense with daily visits for the first 6 weeks, three times a week visits for the next 2 weeks, twice weekly visits for the next month and then weekly visits until 6 months.  Following that the visits become slightly less frequent. In a transplant that is completely straightforward with no complications there are some 200 out patient visits in the first year. At each of these visits a blood test is required, blood pressure measurements must be made and so on. S has great fear of needles and venepuncture and we believe he would find this extremely distressing. One of the immunosuppressive drugs that we routinely use, prednisolone, can have profound effect on mood and behaviour in patients, including increased aggression and temperamental behaviour. We are concerned that this would further aggravate S&#8217;s behavioural problems.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is certain that S will find this extremely difficult and of course our concern is that he does not understand why this is being &#8220;inflicted&#8221; on him. By some assessments, S has the mental age of a young child. It might be argued that if we put a normal young child through such difficult treatment, then why would it not be reasonable for S? However, the difference is that children of 3 or 4 years have the capacity for normal intellectual and emotional development, and they will then be able to understand the rationale for their treatment and hopefully appreciate that this has given them a better quality of life. S, however, has got no real future potential for intellectual development, based on the assessments performed, and we firmly believe he will never be able to grasp why he is receiving treatment which he finds so distressing.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">" Although transplantation is the most appropriate treatment for suitable patients, it is a complex procedure with a recognised morbidity and mortality. The commonest type of donor kidney is from a cadaver source. The likely timing of transplantation from such a source is therefore unpredictable and patients are often called in with little warning. In the adult ESRD programme, once on the transplant waiting list, suitable patients usually wait for 1-5 years on dialysis before a kidney can be found for them. Factors that influence the time on dialysis to transplantation include recipient factors such as blood group and immune sensitivity and donor factors including tissue type match and availability. Once admitted for transplantation patients proceed rapidly to theatre for an operation that requires an incision in the pelvis and placement of the transplant kidney. On return to the ward it is vitally important that patients are closely monitored usually with a central intravenous catheter, a bladder catheter and a variety of drips and infusions. A complex regimen of immunosuppressive drugs is administered following transplantation, including high dose steroids. Daily, or often more frequent, blood tests are required as are investigations such as ultrasound or more complex imaging procedures such as CT scanning or magnetic resonance scanning. Because of the danger of infection, the frequent blood tests are taken from arm veins and it would not be possible to leave a line in circulation for monitoring purposes.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">A proportion of transplants (approximately 20-30%) do not function from the outset and in this setting patients require continued dialysis and may require frequent renal transplant biopsies at approximately 5-7 day intervals. Renal transplant biopsy is an important tool in the successful management of renal transplantation and is an important method for the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction. A large gauge needle is placed in the kidney usually under ultrasound guidance using local anaesthetic and sedation. The major complication of this procedure is bleeding and therefore patients need to remain still in bed after this procedure. In uncomplicated patients, after a 7-14 day hospital stay, patients can be discharged home but there is an absolute requirement for frequent monitoring of transplant function and immunosuppressive drug levels. For the first 3 months this requires a visit 3 times per week to the transplant unit with blood tests and a fairly frequent requirement for urgent re-admission during this period, usually for a renal biopsy to exclude rejection. The frequency of visits and of blood tests does diminish after the first 3 months but there is an absolute and continuing requirement to monitor graft function and there is no way of doing this other than by blood testing. The transplant procedure and the schedule for post-transplant monitoring are gruelling but, for suitable patients, it does offer a better quality of life and therefore the associated morbidity is acceptable and understood by those patients who are transplanted. Were a patient unable to comprehend and to be distressed by the interventions required during and after the procedure and in the post-transplant period and had no capacity to develop such understanding, then transplantation could not be deemed to be in a patient&#8217;s best interest. In consultation with our paediatric colleagues and in discussion with a panel of clinicians not linked to either the adult or paediatric renal units, there is a clear view that transplantation would not be in S&#8217;s best interests now and that no change is likely in the future to alter this view. In this case our opinion is that transplantation could not be deemed to be in S's best interests."</p>

He gave an account of the situation in the adult renal unit. He pointed out that once S attends the adult clinic (which may be in the Hospital or at a local clinic), the facilities will be more limited, as will be the individual care to which he has become accustomed. There are far more patients and less opportunity for individual attention to each patient. Clearly the adult clinics have other patients with mental disabilities but S&#8217;s mental and physical disabilities present greater problems than the normal. Everyone agrees that there will be a major disruption of his present routine and it will take him some time to adapt both to his new surroundings and to the different regime. The move to the adult clinic will be a very difficult experience for him and for those around him.</p>

They did not feel that one could be certain how S would react if a fistula was surgically created and dialysis using needles via the fistula started and the central venous catheter removed. They were particularly concerned that no-one could predict S&#8217;s reaction to the use of large needles and there was a danger that to attempt to create a fistula might have the effect of putting S off going to hospital and taking advantage of the current successful treatment and thereby endangering any form of dialysis. They were also concerned that, if S had a fistula, he might accept needles for some dialysis sessions but not others and he might, therefore, require sedation and restraint with an unacceptable risk to him and nursing staff. The use of sedation would mask warning signs of any adverse effects of treatment which could be observed in a patient who was awake and alert. The medical and nursing team had great reservations about S&#8217;s ability to understand any of the steps required to create a fistula. Dr R and Dr A also felt that it was unlikely that S would maintain his arm in a stable position for the required time and that this was a further reason for not using  a fistula as a method of dialysis access for him. It was the strongly held view of all those engaged in the care of S that an AV fistula should not be attempted. They did not believe it to be a good method of treatment and were concerned that, with the experience of S&#8217;s reaction to previous general anaesthesia, it would be necessary for him to have a general anaesthetic. If he pulled the needle out of his arm there would be copious bleeding and this would be distressing to S. They pointed out that the experts suggesting the use of an AV fistula did not have the two and a half years experience of dealing with S as an inpatient and outpatient. In their view it was not in S&#8217;s best interests to have an AV fistula created and used.</p>

Such support would be provided. She had not observed any aggressive behaviour by S and she had seen him about once a month. S would continue to be provided with an advocate, but the advocate would change since he was now an adult.

He felt that S might be able to use haemodialysis for about 10 years, although he recognised it might be as short a period as two years. It was not immediately necessary to consider peritoneal dialysis. He supported the views of the Hospital Trust that a kidney transplantation was not suitable.  He set out his reasons and concluded</p>

Compliance with medication is not likely to be a problem with S as it would be entrusted to others. However, clinic attendances, frequent blood tests and sudden decisions to perform further investigations, to admit him or to perform a renal biopsy are likely to be more difficult and not immediately accepted by him. This could result in delayed decisions and less satisfactory care.&#8221;</p>

The benefits of freedom from dialysis and improved general health are greatest when the dialysis is preventing the patient from, for example, working, travelling or caring for children. This is not  the case with S and therefore I do not feel that a successful transplant would be associated with a dramatic improvement in his quality of life compared with that he is experiencing on haemodialysis."</p>

The necessary delay resulting from the use of warfarin could have adverse effects upon the kidney. He was concerned both about the transplant and the renal biopsy. His general views of the prospects of success of kidney transplantation were more optimistic than those of Dr R. I have not set out the comparative statistics offered by Dr R and Dr C since a renal transplant is not an immediate option and the risks and prospects may well change in the next few years.</p>

Usually the fistula could be used for haemodialysis after 6 to 8 weeks. The delay was to allow the blood flow through the vein to increase and for the vein to become thicker walled, &#8216;arterialised&#8217;. A local anaesthetic was used before the needles were inserted in the vein and once in, the patient should experience little discomfort. It was unusual for needles to come out during dialysis. The risk of any blood loss would be minimal since there is a high level of supervision. It was possible for the patient to use the arm to a limited extent during dialysis.</p>

Such a programme of graded exposure accompanied by relaxation should be supervised by a psychologist or behaviour nurse therapist experienced in working with people with learning difficulties.</p>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit. In the present case an instance would be the acquisition of foolproof contraception. Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension of risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221;</p>

To act in any other way would be contrary to the rights of a mentally incapacitated patient both under our domestic law and under the European Convention. Miss Harry Thomas expressed concern that the failure of S to understand the rationale behind surgery was a deciding factor in the decision not to operate. On behalf of the Official Solicitor representing S she submitted that inability to understand treatment should not preclude life saving treatment. The inability to understand must make the treatment intolerable.

But the approach of the medical and nursing team, both in the paediatric unit and in the adult unit, has been coloured by their real difficulties in the lack of verbal communication with S and their vivid recollections of how difficult he was to manage in the hospital after he was admitted for emergency lifesaving treatment in May 2000.

His autism makes a settled routine very important to him.  The emergency admission to hospital in May 2000 must have been a most distressing and confusing experience for him and his reaction was not surprising.  He was looked after by strangers and was unable to comprehend what was going on.  His very limited ability to communicate verbally was a particular obstacle.

It is worth pointing out that none of the nursing staff or treating clinicians has tried to communicate with him other than by ordinary speech.  S has also managed to cope with further admissions to hospital and several minor operations as well as the regular visits to the hospital.  Ms C felt that he ought to be made to cope with some degree of change. I found Ms C&#8217;s evidence to be most impressive. I therefore accept the evidence of Dr H and of Ms C that there are procedures which can be followed with expert help. Miss H and Miss R made it clear that help could be provided to S and that there were suitable people to call upon who would be available in the area to carry out those procedures.

His present haemodialysis access via a tunnelled haemodialysis catheter would be able to continue for some time even if the lines had to be changed. It was at present providing him with a satisfactory and stable quality of life.  There is therefore no issue surrounding those two methods of dialysis. Haemodialysis by the present method might last from 2 years to 10 years. Peritoneal dialysis is unlikely to last beyond 5 years because of the adverse effect on the lining of the abdomen after about 5 years. It would then be possible to return to haemodialysis if a suitable vein was available. I have no doubt that it is in the best interests of S that each method is used to its fullest extent in order to provide him with the best possible life sustaining treatment through the agreed forms of dialysis. In the light of the agreement of the medical experts and of the Official Solicitor representing S, I consider that it is in S&#8217;s best interests for him to continue to receive dialysis as long as some form of dialysis is working and is providing S with a reasonable quality of life.</p>

However, in the past S has not made it impossible for blood tests to be taken with the use of needles nor for the use of needles on occasions when general anaesthesia has been needed in connection with minor operations.  It is not at all clear that he is seriously afraid of needles and I am satisfied from the evidence of Dr H that he does not have a needle phobia.

I recognise the concerns of the Hospital team that to attempt to use needles might imperil his dialysis treatment. That is a risk, but from the evidence of Dr C and Dr H, supported as it is by the evidence of Ms C I am satisfied that the benefits of an alternative method of dialysis with less fear of infection and with advantages to S&#8217;s enjoyment of life, make  the attempt one  worth making.  In my view, an AV fistula should be seriously considered when S has had time to settle down in the adult renal unit and time to accustom himself to the other inevitable changes in his life, such as a change of educational establishment. Clearly it must be approached with considerable care and in consultation with learning disability experts. It should not, however, be ruled out as an option.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consultant nephrologists agreed that it would not be in S&#8217;s best interests to have a kidney transplantation in the immediate future. This approach was supported by the Official Solicitor and the parents did not seek to argue against it. The evidence on kidney transplantation has taken up a considerable part of the court hearing and I have set out above in some detail the views of the clinicians. This is for two reasons. First I must satisfy myself that it is in the best interests of S that a kidney transplantation should not now be carried out.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr C agreed in his evidence with Dr R and Dr A. Dr H considered that S should have the operation but on this issue I prefer the evidence of Dr C. It is not, on the facts, at all clear that a kidney transplantation would be the best option for S at this stage, even if he did not have severe global developmental delay. His condition is stabilised by haemodialysis which he is tolerating well. If the current central venous catheter becomes ineffective as a result of uncontrollable infection or blockage, it may be possible to try other veins and to move sooner or later to peritoneal dialysis. There is also the option of the AV fistula. Nonetheless, Dr R expressed the view that, if S were able to understand the purpose of the kidney transplantation and treatment involved he would recommend that the operation be performed. Dr C was less certain but probably would come to the same conclusion for a patient without the medical and developmental problems of S.  A donated kidney, if successfully introduced to a patient, may have a period of usefulness of up to 10 years. The present use of haemodialysis might continue for up to 10 years. The other forms of dialysis might prolong S's life even further, by which time there may be advances in medical science from which S at that time might be able to benefit. The likelihood is therefore that dialysis may give S a life span similar or indeed longer than the average usefulness of a donated kidney.   In the light of this evidence and, in particular, the support by Dr C of the strongly held opinion of the Hospital Trust not to operate, I am entirely satisfied that the agreement of the parties, including the Official Solicitor, is in accord with S's best interests.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of kidney transplantation may, therefore, never arise and is potentially hypothetical. If, however, all methods of dialysis were to fail in the relatively near future, the issue would then become acute. I am therefore asked to advise as to the way in which this difficult question should be approached. I do not consider that I could, at this stage, possibly advise what the answer should be since there are too many imponderables.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of the Hospital Trust is that it still seeks a declaration to the effect that on the present state of medical knowledge kidney transplantation should not be contemplated. The only circumstance in which a transplant might be appropriate would be a change in medical science.  Mr Moon, on its behalf, submitted that the medical risks would not improve and looking broadly at the best interests of S a shorter life which was more comfortable was preferable to a longer painful life. In summary he submitted that it would not be in the best interests of S to have a kidney transplantation  in the future. The inability of S even to understand the purpose of the operation; the distress it would cause him; the enormous management problems associated with his post-operative care led the Hospital Trust to this conclusion.  Mr Moon modified the approach of the Hospital Trust to the extent that if there were to be a significant change in S&#8217;s behaviour and tolerance to treatment and a sea change in S&#8217;s physical condition, the result of which was that he would receive greater benefit from a transplant than a burden, then there should be a reassessment of the position.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Morris for the parents and Miss Harry Thomas for the Official Solicitor submitted that the possibility of a kidney transplantation should not be excluded on such a narrow basis as proposed by the Hospital Trust. There should in the future be a reassessment of the benefits and risks of a transplant and his medical condition at that time, as well as his then ability to understand and cope with the proposed treatment. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question is, therefore, whether it would ever be appropriate to engage in this major surgery for S.  The prospects of success from a kidney donated by his mother would be far higher than a cadaver donor kidney, which would be more likely to be rejected. Although the success rate of such an operation from a medical perspective was lower for someone with S's medical problems (and Dr R was far more pessimistic than Dr C on this point) if S's mother was the donor, he probably would now have a reasonable chance of success.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There would, however, be a number of obstacles. I take first the medical difficulties. The mother has only gone through preliminary tests, although so far they are encouraging. It is not certain that she would be compatible. It is an operation that carries risks for the donor. If the prospects of success were good at the time that the kidney transplantation were to be seriously considered, no doubt the mother would wish it to be carried out as she did at the beginning of this hearing. If however the prospects of success were poor on medical grounds, the risk to the mother would assume far greater importance and I have no doubt that the mother's health should not be put at risk in a forlorn hope attempt to save her son's life. That might be in the future a difficult balance to achieve but it is important to bear it in mind.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consultant nephrologists agree that in normal circumstances a kidney transplantation should be performed as soon as possible after the end stage end kidney failure is diagnosed. Since there is a grave shortage of kidney donors, many patients may, nonetheless, wait some years for the operation and will be on dialysis until a kidney is available. In the present instance, a decision to defer the kidney transplantation has been made because the existing situation is working reasonably well. It follows from this position that a kidney transplantation is unlikely to be considered unless all other available treatment has been exhausted. It is quite likely, therefore, that S's state of health may by then have deteriorated and the prospects of success from carrying out the operation seen from a purely medical perspective, might be outweighed by the risks, pain and discomfort to be suffered by the patient. At that point, it would not be worthwhile for the patient to undergo the operation. There might have to be a difficult and delicate balancing exercise undertaken in order to arrive at a medical decision as to whether it would be at that time in the best interests of S to undergo a kidney transplantation.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical situation cannot, of course, be considered in isolation. There is no doubt that S's severe learning disability militates against explanations other than the simplest. I recognise the complexity of the operation and the probability of emergency recall to hospital on more than one occasion. I recognise the real concerns about the risk of infection and the likely need for one, or possibly even several, biopsies and the added difficulties for S to have an immediate biopsy, since he is on warfarin. The very real concerns of the Hospital Trust are, however, mainly based upon the consequences of emergency surgery on an autistic boy without any preparation of any kind. However, an emergency admission to hospital followed by lifesaving surgery and treatment would be a traumatic experience for anyone. For an autistic boy, as I have set out above, it must have been extremely distressing and he reacted accordingly. I have little doubt from the evidence of Dr H as to how to manage someone suffering from autism in the hospital surroundings, supported by the evidence of Ms C that a lot could be done to prepare S for the more practical and concrete elements of a major operation. He is accustomed to having minor operations. Post-operatively, the presence of someone he knows who is able to talk to him by facilitated methods would probably help considerably. With some preparation and with the support of a person or people in whom he had trust, in my view, and despite the opposite conclusions of the medical and nursing team at the Hospital Trust, S ought to be manageable post operation. The need for blood tests, the use of needles and the likelihood of several returns to hospital post operation, do not seem to me to be insuperable obstacles. On balance, however, if the medical reasons for a kidney transplantation are in his favour, and alternative methods of dialysis are no longer viable, in my judgment, a kidney transplantation ought not to be rejected on the grounds of his inability to understand the purpose and consequences of the operation or concerns about his management.   </p>
