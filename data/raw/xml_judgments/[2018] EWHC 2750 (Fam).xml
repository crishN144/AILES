	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with the medical treatment of an infant &#8220;C&#8221; who is just two months old. He is the much loved first child of his parents &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondents). Antenatal ultrasound scans detected evidence of severe brain abnormality or malformation of his brain and confirmed the presence of a severe cortical migration defect consistent with lissencephaly/pachygyria. He was in poor condition at birth with Apgar scores of 2 at 1 minute, 3 at 5 minutes and 5 at 10 minutes; he was noted to be very oedematous, he had a low heart rate of around 60bmp with no respiratory effort, he was extremely floppy. He was intubated and placed on Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU); he has since been transferred to the high dependency unit (HDU). In addition, C has dysmorphic features including microcephaly, rectal prolapse, a form of diaphragmatic hernia, bilateral fixed talipes with &#8220;rocker bottom feet&#8221; and overlapping 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> and 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> fingers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since his transfer to the HDU hospital records suggest that C&#8217;s seizures have deteriorated and become more frequent and prolonged and associated with more profound episodes of apnoea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation. In a concerted effort to reduce his seizures C has been given trials with multiple anti-epileptic drugs including phenobarbitone, phenytoin, midazolam, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, levetiracetam and topiramate. This latter medication was tried following the recommendation of Dr Rittey (Consultant Paediatric Neurologist) who had given a second opinion to the Trust (report dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018). C is currently on treatment with carbamazepine, vigabatrin and pyridoxal-5-phosphate. He is artificially fed through a naso-jejunal tube; but has had two tubes introduced, one through each nostril, the other being a naso-gastric tube.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no medical dispute as to C&#8217;s condition, he is a profoundly disabled child with severe lissencephaly. There is no available treatment for his underlying brain abnormality and his life-expectancy is less than one year; as Dr Rittey said in his report death for C is inevitable. His death can be imminent, or it can be delayed. His treating physicians Dr E (Consultant Paediatrician) and Dr F (Consultant Paediatric Neurologist) who both gave oral evidence, along with Dr S (Consultant Paediatrician) and Dr N (Consultant in Paediatric Intensive Care Medicine) also of the NHS Trust and both Dr Rittey and Dr Playfor, who are both independent of the Trust all concur that to continue repeated bag and mask ventilation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to delay death does not confer any overall benefit as there is no reasonable prospect of seizure control.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The NHS Trust (the applicant) responsible for his treatment has made an application for a declaration that it would be lawful and in the best interests of the infant C for him a) not to be treated with intubation or mechanical ventilation; and b) not be to treated with any resuscitative measures including cardiac massage and bag and mask ventilation, and that treatment be limited to palliative care; limiting therapeutic interventions to those that make him more comfortable and relieve his stress and pain. His parents, entirely understandably, wish to prolong C&#8217;s life and to continue with bag-valve-mask ventilation and CPR with chest compression. They want him to be given an alternative medication, zonisamide, to attempt to treat his epilepsy and had sought that adrenaline be administered by the insertion of intra-osseous needles but, during the currency of the trial they withdrew their insistence on the use of adrenaline.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The severity of this infant&#8217;s brain abnormality was apparent immediately at birth; within the first few hours of life C failed to demonstrate any spontaneous movements and began to show abnormal movements of his limbs with increased muscle tone. He developed myoclonic jerks, spasms and eye twitching episodes which were associated with oxygen desaturation. On cerebral function monitoring these abnormal movements were seen to be associated with abnormalities suggestive of epileptic seizures. He commenced treatment with phenobarbitone and a midazolam infusion. What was recorded on his initial electroencephalogram (EEG), which was carried out when C was 2 days old, was of extremely low amplitude, with some extremely low amplitude rhythmic activity seen along with almost continuous right frontal repetitive discharges which continued throughout the entire recording. </p>

Following treatment for a chest infection he was finally extubated on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018 onto Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for one day after which he was managed on high flow humidified oxygen via the Vapotherm device; which continues as C still has a significant oxygen requirement: 7 litres/min via the Vapotherm device with 45-50% inspired oxygen. His latest chest x- ray demonstrates widespread patchy consolidation throughout both lung fields, especially the right.</p>

No discernible myelin within the posterior limb of the internal capsules. Clear delineation of the basal ganglia structures is limited. The midbrain is thinned. There is a modest volume pontine eminence. Slight kinking of the cervico-medullary junction. There is a midline pituitary and infundibulum. There is a corpus callosum. Ventriculomegaly although without overt hydrocephalus. Hypertelorism. Normal appearances of the orbital globes per se. Cortical high T1 signal within the parietal occipital regions bilaterally &#8211; possible micro-haemorrhagic or micro-calcific change - although this is not convincingly represented on the SWI imaging. No diffusion abnormality. I do wonder whether there may be cerebellar polymicrogyria. Preserved vermian volume. Comment: Microcephaly with a cobblestone lissencephaly. Aetiological considerations include a congenital muscular dystrophy or tubulinopathy. RELN [sic] mutation (eg Norman-Roberts) although clearly other genetic mutations associated with lissencephaly should be considered&#8221;</span>.</p>

The EEG remained of extremely low amplitude with moderate artefact. Frequent episodes comprising build-up of rhythmic activity with periodic and repetitive sharp discharges were seen over the frontal and central channels bilaterally. These were self-terminating and were not associated clinical changes. On stimulation he became unsettled and his face turned red with some upper limb movements seen. No significant EEG abnormality was seen during the mouth twitching episodes. The EEG was felt to be consistent with a diffuse and severe cortical pathology and it was noted that there were frequent electrographic seizures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third EEG was performed on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018; it recorded frequent mouth, head and limb twitching movements, sometimes associated with oxygen desaturation. His background EEG remained of low amplitude with mixed frequency rhythms. There was frequent sharp/spikier activity that appeared to be quasi-periodic (often followed by brief periods of attenuation). These were seen bilaterally and independently over either hemisphere. On a couple of occasions, the pattern appeared to evolve becoming faster and sharper, particularly over the right side suggestive of an epileptic seizure. The opinion was that he was having frequent generalised epileptic discharges associated with twitching movements of his head and mouth. At the time he was found to have focal periodic lateralised discharges on either the left or the right side, with several brief electrographic seizures recorded in the right hemisphere. The findings were reported to be indicative of frequent epileptic seizures some of which were subclinical. In plain words the baby was, and is, suffering virtually continuous seizures some of which are not apparent clinically.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Dr F explained in her oral evidence to the court, these were very abnormal EEGs and that although EEGs can be difficult to interpret in babies, there was no evidence of normal activity. What was seen was evidence of continuous abnormal activity from different areas, and both sides of C&#8217;s brain and that, when clinically observed, C appears to be almost continually fitting. C has continuous focal seizures, observed in his eyes, face and hands which stop for a few seconds and then continue. C also suffers atonic seizures during which his there is a stiffening of all his limbs and a resulting low level of oxygen affecting his heart rate; his whole body is stiff and he goes red in the face. As set out above, the EEGs show signs of electronic seizures or sub-clinical seizures which are not observed clinically but appear to be continuous. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C was transferred to the HDU on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018, since when the medical records (according to Dr Playfor) suggest that his seizures have deteriorated and are becoming more frequent, more prolonged and associated with more profound episodes of apnoea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation. C can desaturate very frequently, several times in each hour, and requires airway positioning, or jaw thrust, performed manually by medical staff (where the jaw is manually and forcefully pushed forward) which is likely to cause discomfort at best and pain at worst, along with supplementary oxygen administration. Around 10 to 20 seizures episodes are typically documented each day and around 2 to 20 episodes are associated with severe bradycardia and oxygen desaturation which requires bag-valve-mask ventilation and jaw thrust, usually for a period of 2 to 3 minutes. A period of 7 minutes of bag-valve-mask ventilation was required at around on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018. C has also required several periods of full CPR, with chest compressions during these episodes; the last episode was around 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018 and an asystolic cardiac arrest was documented in the medical records on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2018 requiring one and a half minutes of CPR.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court was told that CPR necessitates the forceful compression of C&#8217;s rib-cage to one to two thirds of its depth. Dr E said, and I accept, that the force required to perform CPR on an adult can often lead to the fracture of one or more ribs, and, that while a baby&#8217;s rib cage is much more flexible it must cause trauma and considerable pain. CPR usually administered when a person is in cardiac arrest and therefore unable to feel the pain associated with compression; C is, however, conscious. Dr E, as C&#8217;s consultant paediatrician, told the court about C&#8217;s current condition. C had continued to fit in the twenty-four hours prior to the hearing, on at least three occasions he had required bag and mask ventilation, and the evening before had required chest compression (CPR). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was told that C had been given antibiotics the previous day as the medical staff were concerned he might have developed a chest infection, but thankfully, his chest had since appeared clear and he did not have the high temperatures associated with infection. As previously referred to C remains on high-flow oxygen at the lowest setting and is, for the most part breathing spontaneously, so it would be possible, Dr E said, for C to be transferred to low-flow oxygen which could be administered at home or in a hospice. C has had to have a tube inserted through each nostril; one into the stomach and the second into the small bowel; this is because his diaphragm is compromised and his stomach is abnormally placed, there is a likelihood that if he were fed through his stomach he could aspirate, so he is fed directly to the small bowel to avoid regurgitation; and, because of the need to assist and better facilitate bag and mask ventilation, the contents of his stomach are aspirated through the N-G tube. C has had to be moved frequently to perform jaw-thrust, bag and mask and/or CPR; this has led to the tubes becoming dislodged, which would cause the baby discomfort and pain, additional pain and distress is caused when he has had to have the tubes replaced under x-ray. This had been required once or twice a day for the past few days.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr E told the court that when the bag and mask ventilation is performed it requires the mask to be placed very tightly firmly over the baby&#8217;s mouth and nose at the same time as his jaw is pushed forward forcefully to allow for oxygen to be forced into the baby. The procedure will involve at least one or two medical staff and is uncomfortable and painful. To illustrate the extent of C&#8217;s seizures numerically over the past week, it was reported by Dr E and Dr F, C had had 22 seizures on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018 three of which had required bag and mask ventilation of between 2 and 4 minutes. On the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October he had 12 seizures, three of which required bag and mask ventilation (for around one minute). On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October he had 11 seizures, four requiring bag and mask ventilation of around 2 minutes. On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October he had 13 seizures, only one of which required bag and mask ventilation. On the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> he had 12 seizures four of which required bag and mask of 2 minutes each.

On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> until 12:00 hours C had had 11 seizures three of which required bag and mask ventilation of between 1 and 6 minutes. Since then and the hearing on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October C has had further seizures including one that required CPR and had required bag and mask ventilation on at least three occasions.

This is at the most severe end of this spectrum of disorders. As a consequence of this [C] will have profound developmental impairment with profound learning disability, a four-limb motor disorder and cortical visual impairment. In addition, he is at risk of significant medical complications such as epilepsy, recurrent respiratory infection, gut dysmotility etc. [C] also has associated somatic malformations with rectal prolapse and diaphragmatic hernia&#8230;The key issue, however, is the nature and severity of [C&#8217;s] epilepsy. This is characterised by extremely serious epileptic seizures which are associated with severe apnoea, desaturation and bradycardia. I have witnessed one of these seizures and was impressed by the severity of the seizure and the difficulty of managing it. These seizures have proved resistant to multiple appropriate anti-epileptic drugs as outlined above [in the report]&#8221; </span>Nonetheless, Dr Rittey went on to say that, while he thought it unlikely that C would respond to topiramate, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am of the view that it is worth giving him a trial of the drug as a final option for managing his epilepsy.&#8221;</span></p>

It did not prove to be effective; there was no change in the frequency of seizures. The treating physicians then treated C with a trial period of 24 hours of pyridoxal-5-phosphate on the basis that there was one case in the literature (not a case of lissencephaly) in which it had proved successful in stopping seizures. It was thought it was very unlikely that the seizures would stop and sadly that proved to be the case. There is no evidence before the court that the trial of topiramate was not completed nor that the drug was incorrectly administered, as was previously argued by C&#8217;s mother. As observed by Drs E and F C&#8217;s epilepsy has proved truly refractory (resistant to treatment). Although the trial of topiramate proved to be unsuccessful, and notwithstanding this lack of success, his mother, in her oral evidence asked that the court should order another trial of a 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> anti-epileptic medication, zonisamide, and if that has no effect to order that there should be a further trial of topiramate.

The court was given two papers relied on by the respondent parents which concerned the use of zonisamide on older children (the youngest was eighteen months) none of whom suffered a condition corresponding to C&#8217;s. Dr F explained that zonisamide had been used in Japan for many years for the treatment of children over a year old but that in the UK topiramate is used in preference. She explained in detail that both the drugs worked on the neurotransmitter systems to reduce or stop seizures, in particular GABAergic and glutamate systems but not in the same way; the drugs are similar but not the same. The use of zonisamide in very young children carries a substantial risk of side-effects, including stopping sweating which in turn leads to overheating, which could be fatal, and severe allergic reactions. </p>

Dr F told the court that she did not think that such a trial was sensible at all, there was little likelihood of it working and there would be no benefit to C. Objectively, the additional trial of a drug so similar to that which was tried on the advice of the consultant who provided the second opinion, and which proved unsuccessful, must be contra-indicated. Dr F had no experience of the use of the drug in a child. There is no evidence before this court that is capable of supporting an additional and prolonged trial of a drug which is not only similar to one which has already been tried (and failed) but for which there is no data available in respect of very young infants and, in particular, those with a condition as severe as C&#8217;s. In respect of cannabidiol Dr F told the court that it is used for two specific conditions in older children (Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome) neither of which C suffers from, was not suitable for use on C and that the associated side-effects would be detrimental to his health. </p>

There is no surgical procedure which can resolve, or even begin to resolve, the abnormality or change the underlying problem which has dramatically shortened his life, the bradycardia (abnormally slow heart) apnoea (cessation of breathing) and oxygen desaturation have increased dramatically over the past two to three weeks. According to Dr Playfor it is most likely that the abnormality is genetic, and C suffers from other congenital abnormalities too, he has a form of diaphragmatic hernia which means there is bowel protruding through the diaphragm, lying beneath the right lung. C&#8217;s lungs have an abnormal appearance on x-ray, he has a high oxygen requirement and it is Dr Playfor&#8217;s opinion that C is at <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very high risk of developing periods of respiratory failure in future&#8221;</span>.

C&#8217;s mother, A, who has remained at his side since birth and is undoubted highly devoted to him, is clear that he responds to his father&#8217;s voice and to A when she bends over him or puts her face close to his; the former was observed by Dr Rittey during his examination of C, but had not been observed by Dr Playfor and the physicians treating C.

The test to be applied is an objective one to determine what is in the best interests of the C. Thus, when considering his best interests, I include C&#8217;s medical, emotional, sensory perceptions (including his ability to give and, in C&#8217;s case as a small baby, especially to receive love and affection, his awareness of his surroundings, and his pain and suffering) and the human instinct to survive and prolong life. There is, and it has been long established, a very strong presumption that be attached to the prolongation of life because the human instinct and desire to survive is strong and so must be presumed to be so in the patient, even if that patient is an infant.</p>

C&#8217;s guardian (in her position statement) and Dr Rittey both observed C on the ward with his parents. The guardian was able to see the high level of care provided by C&#8217;s parents and the hospital staff. The family ensure that C is never left without a family member on the ward and his mother spends most, if not all, of her time caring for him. The benefit to C, as a little baby, in receiving the love and affectionate care from his family is clear. C&#8217;s guardian described C as an attractive little baby who was beautifully dressed in a babygro. At the time of her visit to C a scan was being undertaken, while the probe was being used she observed C to grimace and his diaphragm was moving rapidly up and down; he appeared breathless, his eyes were closed, and he lips moved almost continuously. During the hour or so of her visit C&#8217;s oxygen levels fell and he required an oxygen mask to be applied on three occasions; the guardian saw C&#8217;s colour change and he legs coming up to his chest in seeming discomfort. C&#8217;s father gently stroked his head and removed secretions whilst keeping an eye on the monitor to assist the nurse.

I accept Dr Rittey&#8217;s report of C having random roving eye-movement, and his evidence, supported by Dr Playfor, that there was no evidence of visual fixation, in other words there is no evidence that he can focus and/or fix on any object. On the balance of evidence before this court C&#8217;s awareness is extremely limited, but I am certain that he must derive some comfort and reassurance at a very basic level from being held by his mother, or other loving members of his family. </p>

At all times C has an N-G tube in one nostril and N-J tube in the other, he has EEG wires attached to his tiny chest and an oxygen tube on his foot to measure oxygen levels, at the very least this will cause discomfort. His associated congenital abnormalities means he isn&#8217;t even able to eat or suckle, nor will he ever be able to do so. He has the burden of very frequent seizures and as observed by Dr Playfor <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the extra-ordinary level of intervention which is currently being delivered to [C] is not part of a therapeutic plan with any realistic prospect of improving his underlying condition, and is undoubtedly contributing to the burden of discomfort which he currently endures&#8230;It should be noted that the current situation with multiple daily episodes of bag-valve-mask ventilation and occasional CPR necessitates C being continuously monitored and cared for a high dependency area by staff highly trained in advanced paediatric life support with the immediate availability of advanced resuscitation equipment. This prevents C spending time alone with his family and experiencing</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">other more pleasant, non-clinical environments.&#8221;</span></p>

The fear induced by breathlessness is atavistic and experienced by anyone, no matter how young or old, who is left gasping for breath; it would be unacceptable to overlook the likelihood that distress and even fear is inculcated in C by his constantly experiencing shortness of breath. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To that must be added the considerable burden of the repeated pain he suffers when he is subjected to jaw thrust, as observed by Dr Rittey, the use of bag and mask together with jaw thrust and the less frequent but still often repeated CPR. Each treatment, when objectively considered separately or in combination, brings with it the burden of pain, discomfort and distress. Of the three the CPR would seem the most painful with the need for the use of considerable force and physical trauma to this already fragile and very vulnerable child. The court heard that the necessary force causes rib fracture in adults, it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that it has and would continue to cause bruising and trauma to C&#8217;s rib cage and internal organs. It is not possible to have effective &#8220;gentle&#8221; CPR as suggested by A in her statement. C&#8217;s parents wish CPR to continue to be performed; CPR has rightly described as an aggressive act as the chest is compressed with such force that ribs may be broken. This court is aware that this is not unknown when CPR is performed on infants.</p>

This continued intervention is ultimately futile and is highly likely to significantly increase C&#8217;s suffering at his death as it is likely to lead to C spending his last minutes alive surrounded by medical and nursing staff instead of being comforted by the people who love him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both Dr Rittey and Dr Playfor referred to and considered the Guidelines of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) (2015) which provided an ethical and legal framework for making decisions to limit life-sustaining treatment in life limiting and life-threatening conditions in children. The RCPCH guidelines set out three sets of circumstances when treatment limitation can be considered because it is no longer in the child&#8217;s best interests to continue, because treatments cannot provide overall benefit; 1) when life is limited in quantity; if treatment is unable or unlikely to prolong life significantly it may not be in the child's best interests to provide it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drs Playfor and Rittey as independent clinicians and C&#8217;s guardian and his legal representatives have all carefully considered the benefits to C of receiving the treatment that A and B want to prolong C&#8217;s life or delay the inevitability of his death. The conclusion that the treatments will not restore health is aphoristic but true. C will not survive his condition and decisions made about his treatment by the physicians and medical professionals are made in that knowledge. Indeed, C&#8217;s parents were made aware of C&#8217;s brain severe abnormality and lack of development before he was born. Dr F explained to the court that while in utero C&#8217;s brain abnormality meant that he had not moved about as normal and had affected the development and mobility of his limbs. Dr E spoke in his written and oral evidence of the great discomfort felt by him, and his colleagues, about the conflict with A about C&#8217;s treatment and the concern felt about the continued use of bagging and CPR after the trial of topiramate had proved unsuccessful. There can be little doubt that the discomfort felt by the medical professionals reflects their reluctance to continually inflict pain and distress to C. The court accepts that C&#8217;s life expectancy is short but that there is no means by which it can be precisely or accurately predicted. The court is being asked to consider what is in this baby&#8217;s best interests for the short time that is left to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C is loved by his parents and family, but he is also a child who has continually and repeatedly suffered pain and distress because of his condition and the medical intervention and treatment he has required. There is no evidence before the court that would suggest a positive outcome in a trial of a tenth anti-epileptic drug, zonisamide still less to support a second trial of the similar drug topiramate; as with the continued use of bag and mask and CPR, it would only be delaying the inevitable while subjecting C to further pain and distress as he continues to suffer many seizures each day. C&#8217;s death is inevitable, and nothing can be done to stop it or reverse or treat his underlying condition. (See paragraphs 17 to 19 above.) It is the judgment of the court that C should be permitted to end his life in as comfortable, pain-free and comforted condition as it is possible to achieve. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is understandable that C&#8217;s parents, particularly his mother, want medical staff to persist with treatment and/or intervention an attempt to extend C&#8217;s life but the court is objectively concerned with C&#8217;s best interests and I am aware that to continue to intervene, to bag and mask and to carry out CPR is against the advice and wishes of C&#8217;s treating physicians and his medical team for good reason and because they are aware that continued intervention and treatment will not address the cause of the frequent seizures suffered by C. This is a baby who has already suffered a great deal. I have endeavoured to consider C&#8217;s situation from his perspective in as much as it is possible for any court to do so. The conclusion that I have reached is that it is in C&#8217;s best interests for the court to make the declarations sought by the NHS Trust because the intervention and invasive treatments which his parents seek confer no real benefit and subject C to continuous, and ultimately futile, pain, suffering and distress; it follows that it is lawful for the treatments to be withheld.</p>
