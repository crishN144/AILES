	<paragraph eId="para_1">
	  <num>1.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This has been the culmination of a process which has its origins in the events of October 2009 when X, a very vulnerable then 17 &#189; year old, made sexual allegations of the most serious kind against her uncle, the father of A.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing, which spanned 8 days, has been so as to determine the truth or otherwise of X&#8217;s complaints as the first step in considering whether A and her father should be permitted to resume a normal and unrestricted relationship with one another.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact finding exercise, to say the least, has been highly unusual. A series of unforeseen difficulties arose over which I had little or no control. To take just two, the quite appalling noise disturbance from Carey Street during the first day of X&#8217;s oral evidence and the problems in securing continuity of representation for F.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Irrespective of the noise intrusion, at times it seemed as though there would be no chance of X being able to say anything at all over the video link. When she did, the manner in which she gave her answers made clear that the process was enormously difficult and for extremely unusual, only partially explained reasons.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If it had not been for the extremely impressive and dedicated involvement of Naomi Mason, a registered Intermediary with considerable experience of facilitating the evidence of vulnerable witnesses in the criminal and family courts, in all probability, X would have found it quite simply impossible to say as much as she did.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I pass from the preliminaries, it is necessary to describe the various ways in which prior to the hearing  I intervened so as to ensure that F, A&#8217;s father, had an advocate on those days when X and her mother gave evidence. Neither could have tolerated direct questions posed by F, a litigant in person. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, during the week before the hearing, I involved myself in both exploring the potential for public funding with the Legal Aid Authority and also in establishing whether <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> representation could be arranged. My inquiries of the Legal Aid Authority assisted the Solicitors tentatively retained by F to make an application to the Exceptional Cases Funding Team. Although successful on the merits, F failed to obtain public funding because he is living with his father, the paternal grandfather. Under the regulations, the Agency is required to take into account the means of another individual who is maintaining or supporting the applicant for legal aid. I was led to believe there would be no prospect of a successful appeal.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Friday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, I convened a hearing at which, uniquely, I requested the local authority to underwrite the cost of an advocate for F. With commendable generosity and speed, doubtless recognising the well nigh impossible situation which otherwise would have ensued, Z County Council indicated that it would meet the cost of representation for F for the two days of X&#8217;s evidence. There was an extension to three days when the local authority came to realise that X&#8217;s mother was unable to countenance the prospect of answering F&#8217;s direct questions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Monday 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July, Frances Orchover appeared for F. She had spent a large part of the previous weekend reading the papers; and had produced a position statement.  During the course of the afternoon, I was told there was a difficulty for Ms Orchover in continuing to represent F. It had come to her attention, via the local authority, that at some stage earlier in the proceedings she had been instructed to appear for Z County Council at an interim hearing and had discussed the case with Ms Purkiss. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X has not been able to provide a narrative statement. Nor is there an ABE interview. The content of what she alleges arises from the records made at the time by a number of key individuals. Some of the people X spoke to were known to and trusted by her.

The more significant revelations have been described in statements made by the seven witnesses who had involvement. Each of them has given oral evidence &#8211; X&#8217;s then Headmistress, &#8220;HM&#8221; (who was also the child protection officer at the school), her Pastoral Deputy Head &#8220;PDH&#8221;, the Head of Sixth Form &#8220;HSF&#8221;, two members of a national charity for which X carried out voluntary work &#8220;CW1&#8221; and &#8220;CW2&#8221;, a local authority social worker and a police officer.</p>

X repeated much of the material contained within her earlier discussions at school and with CW1. She spoke about the difficulties for her in talking &#8211; that it would make her a coward, that she deserves punishment and that you have to be punished when you do something wrong. She also said she had hurt someone deliberately; she had told her aunt that she had walked in on her uncle who was with another woman when she was 8 years old. Her aunt had been upset. X also said she was still seeing her uncle, though her parents did not know. He had her mobile phone number and tells her &#8220;where and when.&#8221;</p>

Thereafter, progress was painfully slow. As Ms Mason explained, X was anxious about &#8220;stepping over the line&#8221; in relation to almost every question asked of her. Just before 12 noon, X buried her face so that even Ms Mason could not make eye contact. </p>

When asked about what she had said to CW1 there was a muting of the link so she could decide whether she could answer. When she returned she delivered an extremely lengthy and reasoned reply as to how and why she had spoken to CW1. X&#8217;s evidence continued in much the same way; there was very little of the hesitation that had been the hallmark of how she&#8217;d responded when F was in court. Shortly before 15.30 it was necessary for X, a diabetic, to check her sugar levels. Her responses to the last few questions asked of her by Miss Morgan were difficult for X. She said she was thinking about whether she was &#8220;allowed to answer.&#8221; X was slapping her knees and then said, &#8220;I really want to talk myself into it.

As the result of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref> the standard of proof in finding the facts necessary to establish any factual issue in the case is the simple balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less. Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof in determining the facts. In our legal system if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He has to find for one side or the other. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to the rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof.</p>

They may do so for a whole host of motives. Not necessarily because they are culpable but, for example, to protect someone else; or they may lie in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. The mere fact that a potential perpetrator lies is not in itself evidence of guilt. It would almost never in this situation be sufficient evidence of culpability to establish that someone had lied. It is an altogether more subtle and delicate process than that.</p>

I have no hesitation in deciding that X&#8217;s claims against F are fundamentally true; that however he began his despicable behaviour he did indeed inflict the most serious kind of sexual, emotional and psychological abuse upon her over a period of about 10 years; and that, even now, he continues to exert some form of sinister controlling influence so that X cannot freely speak about what has happened. Indeed, one of the most perturbing elements of all centres upon the extent to which X&#8217;s free will would appear to have been overborne insofar as relating the narrative of what F has done. In similar vein, I am particularly troubled by X&#8217;s view which is that she bears at least some responsibility for what was done to her.</p>

The weirdness of what she has said about &#8216;deals&#8217;, &#8216;punishment&#8217; and &#8216;promises&#8217; is a factor which militates heavily against this being a false allegation. Likewise her florid reaction to the news that F had turned to try to see her face whilst she was giving evidence. </p>

The memory of the complainant may be faulty when relating events which occurred many years previously. X at 17 &#189; was giving a description of the situation as it had unfolded almost 10 years previously.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The key to an understanding of X&#8217;s retractions is that on those occasions when there has been the potential for her allegations to be placed on a more formal footing, by the involvement for example of social services and the police, X has sought to deny or withdraw her account. When she did so in early October 2009, she said she&#8217;d lied because she was bored. By no stretch of the imagination was that a credible explanation. It was nothing more than an attempt at keeping the authorities at bay.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should not have been surprised had X been unable to maintain her allegations in the court environment. There would always have been the potential for a retraction; and F obviously believed and hoped X may have been on the verge of denying his involvement when he turned to look at the screen mid way through the morning on Wednesday 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July. As it turned out, X maintained her core complaint throughout. Miss Morgan led her through a very lengthy exploration of whether her central allegations were true or not. X adhered to her claims.</p>

Mr Storey drew my attention to seven explicit events charting the problems for X in her relationship with her mother, in particular, from about 2005 when she was 13 years old. </p>

She &#8220;disclosed she was under a lot of stress&#8221; and did &#8220;not know how to make it stop.&#8221; She was not explicit but suggested there were problems in her relationships with her parents, especially her mother, that she would be punished and that it was &#8220;similar to sexual abuse.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I pause to observe that in nothing X has said to anyone since, has there been any hint of sexual impropriety as between her and her mother or, indeed, her father. My sense is that by the summer of 2009, X was in a state of considerable anxiety as to what she should do about revealing what F had done. She was close to telling someone, hinting about &#8216;sexual abuse&#8217; though unprepared then to identify the reality or  name the perpetrator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr W said this in her report of January 2012 &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">X presents with a long history of medically unexplained physical symptoms. In my opinion, these are likely to be a &#8216;somatised&#8217; (physical) expression of emotional distress. Her episodes of medically unexplained symptoms appear to have coincided with adverse events and periods of significant stress. In particular, there appears to be a temporal relationship between the onset of her early physical symptoms (in the form of collapses or &#8216;non epileptic attacks&#8217;) and the start of the alleged sexual abuse&#8230;. It is possible to see an established pattern of repeated medical presentations from the age of 8 years onwards with non specific symptoms, often of a dramatic nature, for which no physical cause has been found. While not all presentations of medically unexplained symptoms have an underlying psychological cause, research studies suggest this is likely in about 30% of patients presenting in this way. A pattern of repeated presentations makes this more likely. One psychological perspective is that physical symptoms can be an alternative &#8216;language of distress&#8217; i.e. a way to access care when more adaptive and overt means &#8230; are not possible. In the case of X she was unable to disclose the alleged abuse because of threats to her sister and for fear of the consequences. In addition, the family culture is not one which seems particularly encouraging of overt expressions of emotion.&#8221;</span></p>

The purpose of her report was to inform the court&#8217;s decision as to whether X&#8217;s social services&#8217; records should be disclosed. Nonetheless, her view as to the causes of X&#8217;s medically unexplained symptoms is relevant and merits consideration.</p>

Of his participation in the Court of Appeal hearing, McFarlane LJ said this, &#8220;The father despite the limits of a telephone link, was readily able to communicate his frustration to the court. He has not seen his daughter for three years. He has been accused of being a paedophile, yet not told by whom or what the allegations are. He has been given no chance to prove his innocence.

He feels a &#8220;full and proper police investigation&#8221; is the only way to clear his name. His attitude towards the court is on the one hand seemingly respectful &#8211; more often than not he&#8217;s addressed me as &#8216;Ma&#8217;am&#8217; &#8211; but on the other he is dismissive, particularly should the outcome be adverse to him. I thought his response to my question about Mr Storey&#8217;s role and F&#8217;s appreciation of it very telling. If the outcome is as he would wish, F&#8217;s view of the fairness he has been accorded will be favourable. If not, then as M has said, he will probably return to Australia saying he&#8217;s been subjected to a &#8216;kangaroo court.&#8217;</p>

He said, &#8220;If by some miracle&#8221; the allegations are found to be false then he would like M to give him a few thousand pounds so that he might stay here for a few weeks and take A on holiday.&#8221;</p>
