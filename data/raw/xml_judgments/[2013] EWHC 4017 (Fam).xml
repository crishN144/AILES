	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If the subject matter of this case were a ship or a bond or a contract it would be very interesting indeed involving proceedings in three jurisdictions (England and Wales, Italy and Finland) and questions of interpretation of the governing European  Regulation, decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and domestic decisions. But the subject matter of the case is a small five year old boy called G. It is pitiful (in the true sense of that word) that such acute and complex legal  controversy should rage over his future and I hope that even now sense will prevail and his parents will agree reasonable arrangements for him. At the last hearing I was told that the parents had agreed to mediate and I express the hope that they will yet go down that path.</p>

G was born in Italy on 19 September 2008 and the parties married in Italy on 18 December 2008. The parties moved to England in January 2009 but the marriage failed and they separated in June 2010. Divorce proceedings took place in the Canterbury County Court and decree absolute was pronounced on 18 July 2012. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 July 2012 the mother issued two applications under the Children Act 1989  seeking, first, a residence order and, second, leave to remove G &#8220;temporarily&#8221; from the jurisdiction to Qatar for 14 months from July 2012 to September 2013. On 18 July 2012 the mother issued a repeat application for leave to remove G temporarily from the jurisdiction (the reason for this is obscure) and an application for a prohibited steps order preventing the father from removing G from the mother&#8217;s London home save for his scheduled periods of contact every alternate week-end. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to that latter application the mother&#8217;s solicitor made an ex parte application for relief on the same day, 18 July 2012. The application was granted and an order was made forbidding the father from removing G from his (G&#8217;s) home in England save for the purposes of contact on alternate weekends. The father has never applied to vary that order, nor has he sought to appeal it. I take the view that the order of 18 July 2012 completely and finally dealt with the mother&#8217;s latter application for a prohibited steps order, and, in any event, as shall be seen, the agreement later reached by the parties allowing the mother to take G overseas for a finite period entirely overreached or superseded the mischief that the mother sought to address namely the unilateral removal of G from his <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">London</span> home by the father.  </p>

The latter order fixed the final hearing date for 18 October 2012. I take the view that the mother&#8217;s application for residence was also by necessary implication listed for final hearing. It would be absurd to take any other view and in fairness Miss Miller, counsel for the mother, does not seek to argue otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Obviously a parental responsibility judgment is likely, almost invariably one would have thought, to make provision for future events and future conduct (in contrast, perhaps, to many commercial judgments). The same can be said of a maintenance judgment. The fact that aspects of the judgment are executory, i.e. contain obligations yet to be performed, does not mean that the judgment is not final. This was the view of Sumner J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Foreign Contact Order: Jurisdiction)</span> [2003] EWHC 2911 (Fam) [2004] 1 FLR 641, with which I fully agree. There the mother, an English national, and the father, a Spanish national, were married and lived in Spain, where their son was born. They divorced in 1999 and on 4 June 2001 a Spanish court gave the mother permission to live with the daughter in England, with fortnightly contact to the father alternating between Spain and England. The father appealed the order and, because the mother was not arranging for the child to go to Spain each month, made a series of applications to enforce the order. On 2 October 2001 the mother applied in the Principal Registry in London for an order to vary the Spanish contact arrangements, but her application was rejected on the grounds that the proceedings in Spain were not final as the father's appeal had not yet been determined. On 7 June 2002 the Spanish court rejected the father's appeal against the order of 4 June 2001. Approximately 1 year later, in May 2003, the father again applied for enforcement of the original order and sought residence with contact to the mother. The two applications before the English court were the mother's stayed application of 2 October 2001 and a second defined contact application of 8 May 2003. </p>

It is only a final judgment provided that no further applications are made under it within the time frame that she envisages. It could be, she says, up to 5 years. </p>

That gives the concept of a final judgment a degree of uncertainty and unreality which I am satisfied was never intended. It also provides for a form of continuous jurisdiction beyond what would otherwise be a final order when it is plain that jurisdiction ceases after a final judgment. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[58] Secondly, Brussels II contemplates that there may be further proceedings in relation to the children after final judgment. That could arise as here because one parent wishes to change the residence of a child, or, for instance, to enforce a term which may have been obeyed for a time and then broken. That does not alter the status of the final order. </p>

It is only until such time as that first order or a subsequent one becomes a final judgment. Thereafter jurisdiction in an appropriate case passes to another Member State who can enforce that final judgment.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Miller has valiantly argued that the terms of this particular order are so hopelessly ambiguous and so redolent in its language of temporary, interim arrangements that it would be unreal to characterise it as having finally disposed of the applications before the court. She relied on the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Povse v Alpago </span>[2010] 2 FLR 1343. There the unmarried couple lived in Italy, and had joint custody of the child under the Italian Civil Code. Following the couple's separation the father obtained a provisional prohibition on the mother leaving Italy with the child; the mother nonetheless took the child to live in Austria in breach of the order. At the next hearing, the Italian court revoked the prohibition on the mother leaving Italy, provisionally awarded joint custody to both parents, and stated that the child could reside in Austria pending the final judgment. The father's Hague Convention proceedings in Austria were dismissed. However, about a year later, in the context of a report by the social worker indicating that the child's access to the father was now minimal and insufficient, and in the light of what the Italian court regarded as the mother's failure to comply with the access schedule drawn up by the social worker, the Italian court ordered the immediate return of the child to Italy. The Italian court explicitly concluded that it had retained jurisdiction over the child, and issued a certificate under Art 42 of Brussels II Revised. In the meantime, the Austrian court had concluded, without giving the father an opportunity to be heard on this issue, that it had jurisdiction in the case, and had gone on to award provisional custody of the child to the mother, serving the interim order on the father without informing him of his right to refuse acceptance of service and without a translation. The father's application to a different Austrian court for enforcement of the Italian return order was initially dismissed, but the father's appeal was allowed, and the child's return to Italy was ordered. On the mother's subsequent appeal, the Austrian court asked the European Court of Justice for preliminary rulings.</p>

The fact that this ruling on the question of custody of the child provides for a review or reconsideration at regular intervals, within a specific period or in certain circumstances, of the issue of custody of the child does not mean that the judgment is not final. &#8221;</p>

Once seised that court retains jurisdiction even if the child changes habitual residence during the course of the proceedings. This is the principle of perpetuatio fori. It is a practical rule to prevent one party from aborting proceedings by a tactical move during their course. Thus it can be argued that the issue of Children Act proceedings fixed jurisdiction in London until the termination of the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

However, she continued to maintain that the order still provided for unfinished business inasmuch as the mother's application for a prohibited steps order was un-adjudicated. I have dealt with this aspect above. The order of 18 July 2012 dealt with that application. While the mother was overseas the order would be overreached or superseded and would in effect go into hibernation. When the mother returned with G, as she was obliged to do by 1 October 2013, that order would revive and would remain in effect until varied or discharged.</p>

There is a very significant difference in the parties&#8217; accounts as to the events and intentions of each in the period from September 2012 &#8211; July 2013. It is the father&#8217;s case that by October 2012 the parties&#8217; relationship had resumed. The father&#8217;s employer wanted him to return to be based in Italy. The mother decided she would give up work in Qatar and join the father in Italy. To that end she obtained work in Italy and resigned from her job in Qatar. From that point the father says the parties intended to make their home in Italy. The mother strenuously disputes this version of events. She says there was no reconciliation and that her sojourn in Italy was only temporary and that she at all times intended to return to London. In fact in the events which occurred she found new employment in Finland.</p>

Thus on 26 July 2013 the mother launched an application in the Italian court for a location and recovery order. That application is not inconsistent, necessarily, with the mother's case that at the relevant time the English court retained jurisdiction by virtue of the order of 18 September 2012 because article 20 of B2R allows another regulation court to make provisional, including protective, measures in urgent cases. However, on 12 August 2013 the mother applied to the Italian court for an order seeking permission to relocate G to Finland. This is very difficult to square with her proclaimed case that England retained sole jurisdiction over G; it is also difficult to characterise this application as being provisional or protective.</p>

There are a number of problems with this submission. First there is no expert evidence before the court that tells me that in Italy the court there will not be seised until service has been achieved. Miss Miller fairly reminds me that service is not a requirement of seisin here and of course it is trite law that in the absence of expert evidence of foreign law I assume that the foreign law is the same as ours. The second problem is that the Italian court was undoubtedly seised of the mother's application to relocate G to Finland, although questions arise as to whether that application still has any continuing existence, or whether it was in fact, contrary to first impression, an application made under article 20.</p>

The parents' relationship deteriorated and the mother wanted to return to Germany with the children. The girl had complications following the birth and had to remain in hospital for 6 months after the boy had been discharged. The parents signed an agreement before a notary giving them joint custody but allowing the mother to return to Germany, initially with the boy, and the girl was to follow once she was allowed to leave hospital. The mother took the boy to Germany and the father issued proceedings in the Spanish court for provisional measures in respect of both children. The court awarded the father sole custody rights and ordered the mother to return the boy to Spain. The father applied to the German court for enforcement of the Spanish order. The German court sought a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union as to whether provisional measures concerning rights to child custody were to be enforced in the same way as final orders.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems obvious to me that the Italian court here <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">might</span> have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter and further that it <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">might</span> be properly seised for the purposes of article 16. In such circumstances, notwithstanding that I might personally think that the father would struggle to establish jurisdiction in Italy, it must be for the Italian court to determine by reference to its own national rules whether it is seised of the issues of parental responsibility put before it by the parents and if so to determine the question of jurisdiction. Fortunately there is a hearing in only five days time when those very issues may be decided. I cannot say here that it is manifestly clear from the object of the action brought before the Italian court first seised and from the account of the facts set out that that action contains <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">no ground</span> on which Italian court seised by that action could justifiably claim jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter</p>

Obviously in order for that application to succeed it will have to be shown that G was at the relevant time habitually resident in Italy and this is the very basis of jurisdiction that will have to be proved in the Italian court. Obviously I am expecting (but not ordering) that no steps will be taken in Helsinki by the court there until the Italian court has determined that very question. </p>

In a case with international features it is very important that the order should make it clear on its face whether it is a final order or whether it is an interim or provisional order and that the proceedings have not run their course.</p>

It seems to me that authority requires me to invite your lordship to address that submission before filing an Appellants (sic) Notice. However, given the imminence of the hearing in Florence I feel that I must protect my client&#8217;s position by filing an Appellants (sic) Notice to be on the safe side.&#8221;</p>

This is a phenomenon which is becoming increasingly common and which in my opinion should be halted in its tracks. Applications for reconsideration or explication should only be made where it is considered that there has been plain error or great ambiguity or a change of circumstances.</p>

It pointed out that the mother had applied for temporary (i.e. finite) leave to remove and that the relief sought had been fully granted. It is impossible to see, given the relief actually sought, how the order did anything other than finally and conclusively dispose of the application. Further, I pointed out in my judgment that in argument Ms Miller accepted that the order in question was a final order in relation to the application for the relief in question. </p>
