	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have before me applications by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor in relation to the 21 petitions listed in the Schedule annexed to this judgment. In the six cases listed in Part A of the Schedule, the matter has not proceeded as far as decree. In the four cases listed in Part B of the Schedule, decree nisi has been pronounced. In the remaining eleven cases listed in Part C of the Schedule, both decree nisi and decree absolute have been pronounced. Twenty are petitions for divorce, one (<span style="font-style:italic">Marco Lo Grasso v Surendra Naik</span>, ZC15D03263), is a petition for dissolution of a civil partnership. For present purposes, nothing turns on this difference. It will be noted from the individual case numbers, where the two-digit number indicates the year in which the petition was issued, that the petitions cover the period from 2006 to 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Queen&#8217;s Proctor alleges, and I find as a fact, that the architect of these frauds, as I find them to be, was one Khalik Bhatoo, a former member of the English Bar. At the relevant times members of his family owned properties at 73 and 75 West End Road. By an order I made on 22 March 2017, Mr Bhatoo was joined as a third party to all of the 21 petitions. It is a matter of public record that Mr Bhatoo was convicted on 28 April 2003 before Kingston Magistrates Court of two offences of dishonesty in relation to obtaining housing and council tax benefits and that on 1 October 2006, following an unsuccessful appeal from the decision of the Tribunal, he was disbarred, after a Disciplinary Tribunal of the Council of the Inns of Court on 23 May 2005 had found him guilty of three offences of professional misconduct.</p>

I should add that the timetable set out in that order was subsequently modified by a further order I made on 11 July 2017.</p>

Be that as it may, no Answer has been received from any of the parties to any of these petitions. Apart from Mr Bhatoo (see below) the only responses of any kind from anybody were (i) from solicitors acting for Mohsin Tola (the Petitioner in <span style="font-style:italic">Mohsin Abdul Majid Tola v Maria Maryline Migeon</span>, FD13D01422), who contacted the Queen&#8217;s Proctor after their client had received the Queen&#8217;s Proctor&#8217;s Plea but did not, in the event, pursue the matter any further, (ii) from Surendra Naik (the Respondent in <span style="font-style:italic">Marco Lo Grasso v Surendra Naik</span>, ZC15D03263) and (iii) from Asma Bi (the Petitioner in <span style="font-style:italic">Asma Kausar v Shahraz Riasat</span>, BV15D18675).</p>

As I made clear to him at the hearing on 22 March 2017, repeated in a letter sent to him the following day by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor, there was no need for him to volunteer any information before he received the Queen&#8217;s Proctor&#8217;s Plea. In the event, although he attended the final hearing and addressed me briefly, Mr Naik has at no stage sought to file an Answer or any evidence or to mount any other challenge to the Plea.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The Queen&#8217;s Proctor avers that there has been deception in each of the 21 petitions because it appears that Mr Khalik Bhatoo (&#8220;the Third Party&#8221;) was responsible for making all 21 of the divorce applications and may also have been involved in the signature process of some of the petitions and some of the acknowledgement of services in response to those petitions. The Third Party is a disbarred barrister, who was disbarred by an order of the Council of the Inns of Court which took effect on 1st October 2006. One of the charges for which he was disbarred related to a conviction of fraud against the Third Party in 2003 in which the Third Party had forged a tenancy agreement in order to claim housing benefit. </p>

Land Registry records demonstrate that that the register of the title to 73 and 75 West End Road at the material time was in the family name of Bhatoo, as Audrey Ayessiah Bhatoo is the registered owner of 73 West End Road and 75 West End Road is registered in the name of Claire Ayessiah Bhatoo. These persons are believed to be family members and/or connected to the Third Party.</p>

It would appear therefore that none of the parties to the petitions resided at the address as claimed in the divorce petitions. This contention is supported by information from one of the petitioners herein. On 30 November 2016 Asma Kausar, the petitioner in BV15D18675, made contact by telephone with the Bury St Edmonds County Court. This information was passed to the police and on 2 December 2016 she spoke to DC Tariq Ahmed. Ms Kausar confirmed to DC Ahmed that the Third Party had told her to put down 73/75 West End Road as her address notwithstanding that she did not live there, as he would then be able to deal with the court and paperwork and would not need to keep bothering her.</p>

Interestingly, Ms Shaikh&#8217;s statement also includes the assertion that &#8220;We use the address in Southall because she does not want her former husband to know her where about [sic].&#8221; Even if this is true (and it conflicts starkly with Mrs Bi&#8217;s account) it cannot avail. There are other processes available to those who legitimately wish to conceal their address from the respondent and giving a false address on the face of the petition is not one of them. Even if the motivation for this was as Ms Shaikh asserts, the fact is that the petition told a lie.</p>
