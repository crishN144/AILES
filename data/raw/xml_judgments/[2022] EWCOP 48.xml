	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an urgent application in the Court of Protection heard out of hours. I gave a ruling and reasons for that ruling at the hearing but this is my full written judgment. The person with whom I am concerned is X. I have made a Transparency Order prohibiting the identification of X, any members of his family or the healthcare professionals treating him. The Respondent Trust can be named. The Order remains in force until further order.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is brought in tragic circumstances by X&#8217;s parents, his father V and his mother W. At the time of the hearing X lies unconscious in intensive care following a sudden collapse. There is virtually no prospect that he will recover. He may be assessed as being brain stem dead within the next 24 hours. The application is for a declaration that it would be lawful for a doctor to retrieve X&#8217;s gametes and lawful for those gametes to be stored both before and after his death on the signing of the relevant consents. Further, the applicants seek an order that V may sign the relevant consents in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 3 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1990 Act</ref>&#8221;).</p>

In this judgment I shall refer to X&#8217;s sperm rather than to gametes. The applicants do not seek any orders in respect of the use of X&#8217;s sperm once collected and stored. That, they say, is for another day. However, it is clear that the applicants want X&#8217;s sperm to be collected and stored in order that it might be used in the future for the conception and birth of a child or children. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The family is Chinese. At the hearing, V had the assistance of his brother-in-law to act as an interpreter. W was not in attendance. The applicants were represented by Mr Jones, Counsel. The Trust was represented by Ms David, Counsel, through whom I have been given uncontested information about X&#8217;s condition and the process that would be used to collect and store his sperm. The Trust takes a neutral position on whether the declarations and orders sought are in X&#8217;s best interests. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8220;HFEA&#8221;) wished to appear at the hearing but could not do so out of hours. Nevertheless, I was provided with a detailed letter from the HFEA setting out their opposition to the application as they understood it to be made. The Official Solicitor does operate an out of hours service, which is extremely helpful to the court and the other parties, and was represented by Miss Khalique KC, who told the court that the Official Solicitor aligns herself with the HFEA&#8217;s position.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X is a student at a University in the South West of England. He is 22 years old and previously fit and healthy. He is his parents&#8217; only child. On 24 October 2022 he was playing sport when he collapsed. He had suffered a stroke. He was taken to a hospital in the South West and then by intensive care transfer to the care of King&#8217;s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London. I have a written report from a consultant neurosurgeon at the hospital. He says that X suffered a cryptogenic stroke (meaning that it has an unknown cause) which he described as a malignant, middle cerebral artery stroke. X has suffered brain stem ischaemia. Whilst initially his eyes were open and he responded to some commands, he deteriorated. He underwent surgery to decompress his brain but since 27 October 2022 his pupils have been fixed and dilated and there have been no motor responses. The neurosurgeon reports,</p>

A CT angiogram demonstrates that there is no perfusion of either hemisphere above the level of the upper basilar. Overall, the appearances are consistent with a very extensive bi-hemispheric ischaemic insult.&#8221;</p>

In the circumstances his death has not been confirmed and I proceed on the basis that X is alive. X is intubated and supported by mechanical ventilation. He has no cough or gag to suctioning and exhibits no spontaneous respiratory activity. The prognosis is very poor and he is not expected to survive. It may be possible to keep him on ventilation for an uncertain period of time but multi-organ failure is anticipated and his heart may stop at any time. If so, there would be no justification for resuscitation.</p>

Y recalled that the forms asked the couple which types of fertility treatment they wished to undertake, including collection of Y's eggs and Z's sperm, their storage and use in fertility treatment. It was clear from the contents of Y's statement that the couple discussed the storage of their genetic material and the uses to which this material might be put, including the creation of embryos and the ethics of discarding the same. Additionally, the couple talked specifically about what would happen if one of them were to die. Y's statement recorded that Z had talked about the storage of his sperm and what would happen if he died, her recollection being that this issue had been raised specifically in the clinic form which he had to complete. Y recalled asking Z specifically what they would do if he died whilst they were having fertility treatment on the evening that they completed the clinic consent forms. Z told Y that he was happy for her to do it - that is, have the treatment - if it was what she wanted. Y said to Z that she would want to go ahead with treatment because she wanted their son to have a brother or sister and she recalled Z being in complete agreement with her about this issue.&#8221;</p>

The application before me is brought by X&#8217;s parents not his life partner. X has a girlfriend, but I have no evidence of any discussions he has had with her or others about whether he would want his sperm to be collected and stored in the event of his becoming unconscious with a very limited life expectancy. There is no evidence that X and his girlfriend were in the process of trying to conceive nor that they have tried in the past. There is no evidence of the nature of their relationship. X may have wanted one day to have children, but that is not the same as wishing for his sperm to be collected and stored when unconscious and dying. I cannot know what his wishes and feelings about that decision would be. Unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">Y v A Healthcare Trust</span>, there is no direct evidence that X ever contemplated the issue. Nor do I have any evidence as to his values and beliefs from which I could infer what his decision would have been. I cannot infer from the fact that he wanted one day to be a father that he would have wanted his sperm collecting and storing with the potential that it could be used for the conception and birth of a child he would never know.</p>

I have no evidence as to the practice in hospitals in England and Wales in such circumstances but it would be unlawful under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> to store collected sperm without the consents referred to earlier in this judgment. Here, the Trust has not agreed to the procedure and is concerned that without X&#8217;s actual consent it would be acting unlawfully to collect and store his sperm.  If the Court of Protection were routinely to authorise the collection and storage of gametes in cases where there is no or little evidence that the incapacitous, dying person would have consented, then it would undermine the regulatory provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> which require actual consent. </p>

For the purposes of this out of hours application I proceed on the basis that the Court of Protection does have the power to declare the retrieval of gametes from an incapacitous person, and their storage, to be lawful notwithstanding the absence of written consent. For the purposes of this out of hours application I also accept that in an exceptional case, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Y v A Healthcare Trust</span>, where there was strong evidence that the incapacitous individual would have wanted their sperm to be collected and stored so that it could be used after their death for their life partner to conceive and give birth, such a declaration may be given.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It might be said that there would be no harm in allowing the sperm to be collected and stored and that an interim declaration would at least allow a fully considered decision about the use of X&#8217;s sperm to be made at a later date. However, the process of collecting sperm from an unconscious individual is an invasion of privacy. It involves extracting sperm in circumstances that a conscious person would find invasive and some might find humiliating. The sperm might eventually be used to lead to conception and the birth of a child or children. Decisions about whether or not to become a parent are part of a person&#8217;s private life. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) covers reproductive rights. As such the decision raised by this application engages X&#8217;s Article 8 rights under the ECHR and the collection and use of his sperm would be an interference with those rights.</p>

It would not be in X&#8217;s best interests to make the declarations sought. Assessment of his best interests involves not merely an analysis of the risks and benefits of the proposed procedure, but also of X&#8217;s past and present wishes and feelings, his views and beliefs, and his autonomy. His right to privacy and to self-determination in relation to reproduction must be considered. There is no evidence before the court to persuade me that X would have wished for his sperm to be collected and stored in his present circumstances. I cannot accept that there should be a default position that sperm should be collected and stored in such circumstances as being generally in a person&#8217;s best interests. I cannot conclude that making the declarations as sought would be in accordance with X&#8217;s wishes, values or beliefs. The process of collecting X&#8217;s sperm is physically invasive and there is no evidence that X would have consented to it or would have agreed to its purpose. I take into account the views of his parents about X&#8217;s best interests. However, weighing all the relevant matters in the balance I conclude that it is not in X&#8217;s best interests to make the declarations sought. The declarations if made would lead to a significant interference with his Article 8 rights and I am not persuaded that the interference would be necessary or proportionate.</p>
