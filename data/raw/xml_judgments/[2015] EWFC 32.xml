Subsequently, the Wife has had to mortgage the property to meet the legal fees incurred by her in these proceedings.

At the time, the charge secured &#163;40,000 but it has since been reduced by him to &#163;13,652.  It appears that counsel&#8217;s fees may have been the prime motivation for the execution of the charge although there can be no doubt that the brief fee would have already been incurred at the time the charge was executed.</p>

Adverse inferences were drawn as his disclosure was found to be lamentable and not frank.  The finding was that he had hundreds of thousands of pounds in offshore accounts/investments along with further undisclosed assets in Y country although not on a massive scale.  The District Judge transferred Z property to the Wife absolutely.  He also ordered the transfer of some further properties in Y country and ordered the Husband to pay the Wife&#8217;s costs in the sum of &#163;167,850.  The order was eventually perfected on 9th December 2013.  </p>

Mr Burles, for the Wife, informed me that the Husband was represented by ABC in relation to those applications and that he must have paid the costs of his own representation involved with those applications.  </p>

He reserved his judgment until Sir Peter Singer had given judgment in another case called <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J-M</span>.  Once this judgment was considered and further written submissions had been made, Robinson DJ handed down judgment on 17th June 2014. At an inter partes hearing on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014, he made the order that is the subject of this appeal.  He accepted an undertaking from ABC that, in the event that the charge becomes enforceable in the future (such as following a successful appeal), ABC would not seek to enforce their charge by applying for a sale of Z property at any time thereafter.  Nevertheless, he set aside the legal charge dated 30th April 2013 pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref>.  He refused ABC permission to appeal.  He ordered the firm to pay the Wife&#8217;s costs of the application, summarily assessed at &#163;8,020.08 by 2nd August 2014.</p>

In order to have this knowledge it is necessary for the bank to know that the wife was making, or was about to make, a claim for financial relief.  Once in possession of this knowledge, it might, in the circumstances of this case, be difficult for the bank to avoid a finding that they should then have realised that the husband had the intention to defeat or prejudice the wife&#8217;s claims.  The fact that the wife may not have any equitable or proprietary interest in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> application is not directly relevant, nor may I add with deference to existing authority, to the fact that the wife had or had not registered her interest.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;At the date of the mortgage, the wife was not contemplating divorce. She was content to remain in occupation of No 1 receiving support from her husband.  If at that time the bank had asked her if she had an interest in the property or objected to her husband charging it by way of mortgage it must be pure speculation what her reaction would have been.  For my part, I do not consider that her reaction upon the occasion when she was asked to sign the licence 3 years later and at the same time was told that the husband would not continue to support her, could be taken as a reliable indication as to what she would have done if the bank had approached her in 1980. In these circumstances, I find it impossible to say that there was any evidence upon which the judge could infer that the wife was contemplating divorce proceedings and therefore, whatever indirect motives the husband may well have had at that time, of which the bank would have had notice, one of them could not have been an intention to defeat the wife&#8217;s claims for financial relief.&#8221;</span></p>

The Deputy Judge made the same findings as in this case as to valuable consideration, the solicitor acting in good faith and her lack of actual notice.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Burles for the Wife distinguishes this case from <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J-M</span>.  He points to the fact that the solicitors in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J-M</span> entered into the charge before the wife had made any claim against the motor car as opposed to the position here where the Wife had &#8220;explicitly set her sights on the Husband&#8217;s interest in the former matrimonial home.&#8221;  The charge in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J-M</span> was entered into at any early stage of the proceedings, well before the FDR.  As a result, the evidence of the Husband&#8217;s guilty intention and the wife&#8217;s case as to that intention was embryonic and limited.  In contrast, he says, ABC&#8217;s charge was entered into on day two of the final hearing, after service of the Wife&#8217;s evidence and her counsel&#8217;s Skeleton Argument, all of which had made explicit her strong evidence of the Husband&#8217;s gross non-disclosure and her strong claim for an outright transfer of the former matrimonial home.  Finally, he points to Paragraph 51 of the judgment in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J-M</span> where Sir Peter said:-</p>

That said, I have to say that in this case I would have set aside the transaction (if I had found constructive notice).  For I take the view that it is unconscionable that the husband should be in a position and in effect have a blank cheque to fund his lawyers fully to the hilt of the Bentley&#8217;s value.  On the other hand, the Wife and her present lawyers are respectively left without the ability to offer and to receive security for the rising costs, which in present circumstances she has little option but to continue to incur so long, obviously, and so far as they are reasonably incurred, and her lawyers are prepared to take the risk of non-recovery.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Warshaw QC argues to me that this is a matter of general importance.  He submits that it was not open to the District Judge, in the circumstances of this case, to find that the solicitors did not know of the intention to defeat the claim but were fixed with constructive notice.  Constructive notice means knowing something which ought to have stimulated enquiry or wilfully abstained from enquiry.  He argues that a matrimonial solicitor is not like a bank or an ordinary third party.  The solicitor has access to all the facts already.  He knows every detail of his client&#8217;s financial position as well as the detail of any allegations of non-disclosure and the ambit of the other side&#8217;s case.  There was therefore, he says, no need for the firm to consult some third party.  There was no enquiry that ABC ought to have made or that the firm could have carried out.  The District Judge drew an impermissible inference to overcome this problem.  He correctly identified that he could not draw inferences from the Husband&#8217;s assertion of privilege but he concluded he could draw an inference that ABC was put on enquiry.</p>

It would have focussed on Z property.  The Wife would have been able to point to all the evidence she had put together as to non-disclosure.  I consider it is highly likely that the District Judge would have made an injunction preventing the execution of the charge until the conclusion of the case.  At that point, given his findings, it is quite inconceivable that he would have discharged that injunction to permit the charge.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The costs provisions commonly included in freezing injunctions do not in general cover costs already incurred.  Indeed, my experience is that, at least initially, such provisions apply primarily to the costs of taking legal advice on the injunction, preparing a statement of assets and applying to vary or set aside the injunction, if so advised.  Even if an exemption for costs provision is made, it usually requires disclosure as to the source of the funding.  Almost invariably, this will be an otherwise frozen bank account. It would be extremely rare for a court to permit the costs to be secured by a charge over the very asset that is the subject of the dispute.  However, regardless of these arguments, the simple fact of the matter is that the Wife was not given the opportunity to make the application by the failure to give her notice.</p>

There would have to be an application for a freezing injunction in each case.  That cannot be right.  I am of the view that, where there is a restriction, it is always incumbent on a solicitor to give notice of an intention to execute such a charge over real property.  If no action is taken by the other side by the expiry of a reasonable period, the solicitor is then in a position to proceed to execute the charge without fear that it will subsequently be set aside.</p>

If nothing else, there would be no restriction on the register against such payments.  To this extent, Mr Warshaw is wrong when he says that there is no difference between cash and real property.  I cannot conceive of a situation in which the payment of cash itself would ever give rise to constructive notice sufficient to engage the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Kemmis</span> doctrine and require further enquiries.  The solicitor receiving a monetary payment is not therefore obliged to inform the other side in advance.  It is entirely incumbent on the other party to apply for an injunction to restrain such payments being made if he or she considers the application has merit.  It is not open to that party to raise the matter retrospectively.</p>
