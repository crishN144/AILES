In 1998 there was great public debate about the MMR vaccine. Much of the controversy surrounded the research paper, published in the Lancet, by Dr Andrew Wakefield which cast doubt on the vaccine&#8217;s safety and the risks said to be attached to administering it, particularly in relation to the possibility of autism. As a consequence of this the parties decided, in consultation with their GP, that L should not receive her booster and M has had no vaccinations at all.</span></p>

He says he has become increasingly concerned that the girls have not been immunised and were not protected. Dr Wakefield&#8217;s research paper was later discredited. The Lancet subsequently retracted Dr Wakefield&#8217;s paper and his research was not approved by the General Medical Council. The NHS, General Medical Council, Chief Medical Officer and the World Health Organisation all recommend that children should have this vaccine. He is concerned that the consequences of contracting measles, mumps and rubella are serious. He states the need for the children to have protection has been brought into sharper focus following the recent outbreak of measles in Wales.</span></p>

That agreement was not forthcoming and the father issued this application on 5 April 2013. Following initial directions by the District Judge the matter was listed before me on 25 April 2013. I made directions, including the filing of a CAFCASS report setting out L and M&#8217;s wishes and feelings. I made further directions on 6 June 2013 listing the matter for hearing on 31 July 2013 and making directions for L and M to discuss this issue with their GP, which took place on 16 July 2013. They came and met me on 25 July 2013 together with Ms Vivian. Ms Vivian filed an addendum report on 26 July 2013, together with a note of our meeting. Both parties have filed updating statements. </span></p>

She denied any influence on the children&#8217;s views. Until this recent application she said both girls had been brought up in a family where there was a consensus between the parents regarding vaccinations. When asked about what her opposition was to the vaccinations she said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;Parents have a choice to do what they feel in their hearts they really believe. I feel both children have grown up in a frame of mind which they were settled in and supported in the same outlook and are now forced to take a different view without more positive reassurance and help given and the recording of ingredients [of the vaccine] is unsatisfactory. They have a right to be informed.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In relation to the suggestion by the father that the girls need to be protected from the risk of getting either measles, mumps or rubella she said from the NHS guidelines the risk of complications from these diseases is higher if the immune system is compromised in some way; L and M are healthy active children which she considers lowers the risk. If the father&#8217;s application was granted she said she would feel she had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;not been able to put their [the children&#8217;s] views across enough&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In cross examination she said she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;had no view&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> on whether the MMR vaccination was effective as she was not trained in reading statistics.

She accepted the girls would have seen her distressed by the father&#8217;s behaviour and this application, which she described as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;bullish&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> She considers the girls will feel they have let her down if the application is granted.

He acknowledged the girls are angry with him regarding this application, they think he is trying to exert control on the mother and using them as a vehicle to do this. He regards his relationship with his daughters as being </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;solid and strong&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, although he accepted this issue has caused difficulties in his relationship with them in the short term. His concern, he said, is the risks to them of getting any of the diseases if they do not have the vaccination. It was the Wakefield research that caused the parents to decide not to have any further vaccinations. He accepted M had no vaccinations at all. He was asked about the delay and timing of this application, bearing in mind the parent&#8217;s relationship broke down in 2009. He said the mother was aware he was unhappy about the situation. He accepted he could have made this application earlier, when the children were younger, but said the Swansea outbreak exacerbated the issue for him. He denied he reacted to what was termed tabloid hysteria. He respected L&#8217;s views as a vegan, but he said she is still a minor and her parents have parental responsibility to look after their welfare which involves looking at balancing risks and he regards the risks of getting the diseases far greater; his concern is she does not properly understand the risks of not being vaccinated.  He considered M&#8217;s views are largely influenced by L; they have a very close relationship. He remained clear in his view that L and M should have the vaccination, as only by doing so would the risks of getting any of the diseases be reduced. </span></p>

She has discussed with them the underlying rationale for their opposition to the vaccination. They are both fully aware of their parents&#8217; views regarding this application. The focus in their most recent meeting with Ms Vivian was the ingredients in the vaccination, which L said she would </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;be so upset if that was in my body&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. When asked by Ms Vivian how they would get better if they became ill with one of the vaccine preventing diseases M responded they would go to the doctor and get medicine and get better. There was no issue about what would be the ingredients in that medicine. L wondered whether they would get treated as the doctors may be scared of getting it too.

She was very concerned, particularly in her more recent interview, of the information the girls had that they did not necessarily understand or were able to consider in a balanced way. She said this was illustrated by her talking through with them if they didn&#8217;t have the vaccination and got one of the diseases what would happen. They had not considered what may be the ingredients of any medication they may receive and appeared to consider that the doctors may not want to touch them for fear of getting the disease. She did not consider they had any rounded appreciation of the pros and cons of the vaccine and as a result there should be some caution before attaching significant weight to their wishes and feelings. She said one of the difficulties for both girls is their mother is very anxious about this and Ms Vivian considered they will take some responsibility for making her feel okay about that. Following any order made by the court all relationships will have to be managed and she considered this is a task for both parents. In relation to their father she agreed L and M&#8217;s relationship with their father is strong and loving, but their feeling is he doesn&#8217;t know or understand what is in the vaccination. They might be re-assured if he was able to tell them he does understand their point of view. Even though the girls are different ages she did not consider they should be treated differently. She acknowledged there are risks regarding their relationship with their father as she felt they had aligned themselves with their mother. She was asked about the risks to them if their wishes and feelings were overruled, she acknowledged there is always a risk when children are involved to this degree but she did not consider it any different from other welfare based decisions that do not accord with the wishes and feelings of the children concerned. In any situation where the court is making welfare based decisions the parent who did not agree to the issue that may be ordered has to manage that outcome. She said that is what parenting is about; it can take on many different aspects. She considered these particular children to be very bright and have a lot of empathy and respect for their parents and would understand why decisions are made and the parental process. She said they were reluctant to come and see her, but they came as they were told they had to.  </span></p>

The court can only make decisions on the evidence that it has in each particular case and by considering the welfare needs of each child. By doing so in this case the court does not in any way dictate how this issue should be decided in other situations, each case is fact specific. This case is only concerned with the welfare needs of these children.</span></p>

First, from their perspective the parents were initially united in their decision for them not to be vaccinated and they can&#8217;t understand why their father has changed his mind. As M told Ms Vivian she could not understand how he could say he wants them to be safe (by having the vaccination) yet he didn&#8217;t feel that before. This perhaps displays a lack of maturity and an appreciation that views can change for a variety of reasons. Second, they have become focussed on the issue of the ingredients of the vaccine without being able to consider and balance the wider picture, and the consequences or actions of them not having it, including medication (and its contents) that would be required in the event of them becoming ill from one of the vaccine preventing diseases. Third, it is not surprising that they are likely to have become influenced by their mother&#8217;s views. Those views are clearly strongly held and will inevitably have influenced both children. As Ms Vivian said in her oral evidence </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;The difficulty for the girls is their mother is very anxious and they will take some responsibility for making her feel okay about that&#8217;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> she considered they had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;aligned themselves with the mother&#8217;.</span></p>

I agree. Their views, whilst understandable in the circumstances, lack the ability to step back and consider the advantages and disadvantages of having the vaccination. The focus was entirely on what they considered were the negative aspects, in particular the ingredients and the side effects.  L&#8217;s focus was on a particular ingredient without any suggestion or consideration by her of balancing that aspect with other factors. This is also illustrated by Ms Vivian&#8217;s questioning about what they would do if they contracted any of these diseases and what would be the ingredients of that medication. That was clearly something they had not contemplated or considered.</span></p>
