	      <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The issues for determination in this case arise as a result of articles 10 and 11 of the compendiously entitled 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (Brussels II) of 27th November 2003 concerning Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Matrimonial Matters and the Matters of Parental Responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000'. I will refer to this as 'BIIR'. Unlike its repealed predecessor, BIIR applies to all children who fall within its jurisdiction and scope, although no maximum age is prescribed so that this is left to national law. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:14pt">These issues involve consideration of as yet unplumbed depths (certainly in English jurisprudence and, as far as the admittedly non-comprehensive enquiries of counsel could establish, elsewhere) sounded by those and other articles of BIIR; and of their inter-relationship with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (to which I will refer simply as 'Hague') as interpreted and applied in England and Wales; and their interface with our own domestic law and procedure in relation to questions concerning a child's welfare, primarily founded on the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 (and their counterpart for use in Family Proceedings Courts). </span></p>

By article 72 the Regulation is 'binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.' 'Member States' include all the existing and subsequently acceding countries, with the exception of Denmark which opted out. It is in this slightly restricted sense that I use the term Member States in this judgment. </span></p>

The Practice Guide makes it plain that it does not have the force of law, which ultimately (and 'ultimately' may be the right word) must be for the European Court of Justice to decide. In June 2005 the European Commission published an updated version of the Practice Guide. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Information which I have obtained from the statistical records for recent years maintained by the Central Authority in London indicates that the volume of refused outgoing Hague requests to EU member states for children's article 12 return is as set out in the Annex to this judgment. I am grateful to Mr Wood and Miss Marsh of the International Child Abduction and Access Unit ('ICACU', which now performs the function of Central Authority for England and Wales for both Hague and BIIR purposes in place of the former Child Abduction Unit) for extracting the information, but it must be noted that a small number of these refusals will have been made for reasons outside the scope of article 13 of Hague, whereas it is only non-return orders based on article 13 which trigger an article 11 application under BIIR. So it can be expected that the annual volume of such applications is unlikely to exceed single figures. In my view they should be heard by a High Court judge of the Family Division, and cannot or should not be assimilated with domestic Children Act applications, all this for reasons which I will advocate later.</span></p>

His father (F) is a Palestinian national born in Gaza and now aged 44. F left Gaza and lived for a time in Greece before coming here on a six-month visitor's visa in 1996. In 2001 he met the mother (M) a French national now aged 27 who was then working and living in London. In June 2001, within a very few months of meeting, they were married at a Register Office. A consequence of the marriage was that F was then granted the right to reside here until August 2008, a permission revocable in certain circumstances. In October 2004 they celebrated a Muslim marriage. F worked nights in casinos but lost his employment in about April 2004 after his employers discovered that he had assumed a false identity, and since then has apparently not worked full-time until recently. M until shortly before A was born in May 2005 continued to work in Slough for Amazon. They maintained separate accommodation until 2002 and then lived together (with some separations) in a succession of flats in the London area. </span></p>

Each party has given a detailed account from their viewpoint in the extensive written evidence, supplemented by their oral testimony. F denies most of M's account, and appears not to recognise that there were already significant difficulties between them before A's birth. The experienced CAFCASS officer Mrs BH, in her capacity as A's guardian, formed the view that H continues to harbour what (having heard him and M at some length) I regard as the entirely unrealistic hope that M will return to live with him and that their relationship can be salvaged. </span></p>

By the time of the second visit the family was about to become homeless in London. They were due to vacate their flat while M was in France. F was not working and was without visible sources of finance, but while M was away he took on a flat at a rental which virtually consumed M's maternity pay. </span></p>

She proposed fortnightly supervised contact exclusively in France. In fact to date F has been unable to obtain the necessary permission to visit France, at least in part because he has not been able to demonstrate that he has informed the Home Office here of his separation from M. </span></p>

The consequence is that the aggrieved parent in such a case will not normally have any direct communication with the Procureur, whereas our own practice in a reverse situation is that English lawyers are instructed to act directly for the left-behind parent, and to seek their instructions from him or her. Thereafter ICACU normally takes no further part in the court proceedings. </span></p>

This has clear practical drawbacks, and also (as in this case) ICACU risks finding itself in the position that it is in effect advocating the left-behind parent's version of events, and thus performing a representative rather than a purely referral role. In this case, for instance, ICACU supported some of F's representations which on any view (in the light of the evidence before me) were at best only partial. For example, by fax dated the 24th January 2006 ICACU passed on from F the statement that 'his casino employer did not report F [to the police] because he was a terrorist, but rather to do with the fact that he is Palestinian and from the West Bank' whereas in his written evidence in these proceedings F accepts his dismissal came about after his employer discovered that he was working under a false identity and in breach of his visa requirements. </span></p>

This was said to be a 'compulsory document'. At that stage, and indeed until latterly, the Home Office has not been aware of the separation which has now endured for over two years. </span></p>

Indeed article 7(d) expressly provides that to that end Central Authorities should 'exchange, where desirable, information relating to the social background of the child'. But it is important that those involved, the lawyers and courts of each country and those who act for their Central Authorities, should be aware of the difficulties which can arise in obtaining and transmitting information in this indirect manner, quite apart from the likelihood that delays will result, as they did here, in the pursuit of the Hague 'hot pursuit' remedy.</span></p>

The French Court therefore exercised its discretion against ordering return. F sought to appeal, but seems to have been frustrated in that attempt by the French Central Authority's inability to take the steps requested by ICACU until the time for appealing had expired.

The covering letter states that 'after careful consideration we have decided to revoke [F's] right of residence as he has ceased to be a family member following [M's] departure from the UK with their son. F has been notified of our decision and given a right of appeal against this decision'. The refusal letter sets out the history and records that the Secretary of State is satisfied that F does not qualify for a retained right to residence under Regulation 10(5) of the 2006 Regulations already referred to and that accordingly the decision has been taken to revoke his Residence Card. The Refusal Letter informs F that 'If you appeal you do not have to leave the United Kingdom while the appeal is in progress.

Important aspects of his evidence were extremely vague, particularly in relation to his work pattern and proposals, his plans to rehouse himself, and his finances present and prospective. As to the latter he claimed to earn only &#163;360 per month as a part-time driver, but to spend &#163;90 a week on the rent of his single room in a multi-occupancy house.

Thus F would be able to enjoy either shared care or extensive contact. He said that he could find her a job here, and that she and A could initially move into his room while he would move elsewhere. If she had a day job, he would try to find night work, so that A need not be left with others. He would contribute financially. These proposals self-evidently lack realism. </span></p>

But Mr Scott-Manderson then made it clear that he would submit that an order whether for contact, and more particularly staying contact, here (or, as F would prefer, a shared residence order providing for him to live with F on his visits here) both fall within the scope of what BIIR envisages the court may order when it examines 'the question of custody of the child' under article 11(7).

His budget excludes the &#163;280 which is the cost of four hours of supervised contact and which he says should cease. On any view long-term financing of these meetings will be a considerable burden for these parties, and one which they will need to share as they go along if it is to be more than temporarily affordable. M maintains (as seems inevitable on her figures, wherever within the range quoted the cost falls) that she will have to increase her debts to achieve six-weekly contact visits to London, but says that she is prepared to do so as she recognises that it is the only manageable way for A and his father to maintain contact. </span></p>

I have heard detailed representations from the guardian whose duty on behalf of the child is to make submissions as to what is in his best interests. The contact in question will be in England rather than in France, and future review and fine-tuning of it would more easily be achieved by an English court, if the jurisdiction exists. Moreover the expense and delay of re-arguing contact issues in France would thus be avoided. Another factor is that any security arrangements necessary or desirable to safeguard A's return to M after meetings with F (such as regulating by undertaking to the court the deposit of passports during contact, injunctions restraining removal from this jurisdiction save between here and France or, in case of real and imminent risk, the imposition of a Port Alert) could more realistically be policed by and with the wider powers of the English court. </span></p>

The courts of the Member State to or in which the child has been wrongfully removed or retained should be able to oppose his or her return in specific, duly justified cases. However, such a decision could be replaced by a subsequent decision by the court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child prior to the wrongful removal or retention. Should that judgment entail the return of the child, the return should take place without any special procedure being required for recognition and enforcement of that judgment in the Member State to or in which the child has been removed or retained.</p>

France would in this case be the country of enforcement, but (as was helpfully pointed out in a new paragraph added to the end of Part VII of the Practice Guide in its June 2005 updated version) if the child were in the meantime moved to a third Member State, the decision as evidenced by the certificate would be enforceable there with the same facility, without any need to commence any exequatur procedure for the child's return from that third country. </span></p>

So if a child is brought or retained here in circumstances which make that wrongful within the definition ascribed for BIIR purposes (which is not identical in its terms with the corresponding definition in article 3 of the Hague Convention), practitioners and judges must be astute to take the point that (and to investigate whether) an application to an English court, for instance for residence and an order restraining the other parent from removing the child from the applicant's care and/or from England and Wales, is impermissible and should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Scope does exist under article 20 for an English court in an urgent case in such circumstances to take 'provisional, including protective, measures. But that is clearly intended only to be a stopgap measure to have effect only until the home court exercises jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.

'The return of the child' in this context is to be read with article 11(7), and will be ordered where the examination of the question of custody results in a decision that the child should live with the parent who is here, not just an order in effect requiring M to make A available here for the purposes of meeting F. It is in this connection that the dichotomy to which I have referred between 'rights of custody' and 'rights of access' has significance. A custody decision relates to the care of the child, and where he shall live (article 2(9)). The article 2(10) description of rights of access distinctly refers to 'the right to take the child to a place other than his or her habitual residence for a limited period of time.' In this context, I suggest, it is the 'place' rather than the 'country' of habitual residence which is indeed meant, for of course rights of access do not necessarily imply cross-border access. If A is to remain living with M and in France, the orders which F seeks fit that access definition precisely both in the short and in the longer term. </span></p>

She regards his current accommodation as in any event unsuitable for overnight stays. F may or may not move from where he now is, but I am not persuaded that taking A to stay in a spare room at a friend's house is satisfactory enough.

F is strongly opposed to both constraints. The guardian is not prepared to discount M's abduction fears. She shares with M the anxiety that if it became apparent to F that he might be obliged to leave England and thus that his meetings with A were likely to cease, then the emotional pressure upon him and therefore the risk would be increased. The guardian does not therefore regard the risk as fanciful. Neither do I. It was for instance rather chilling to read, at paragraph 28 of his affidavit, how easy F says it would be for him to obtain a false passport were he so minded. The same would presumably be true of a passport or other travel document for A, although F may well be right when he says that A would not be entitled to a Palestinian travel document. F regards it as 'exquisitely ironic' that M should say she harbours this worry, in the light of her own removal of A to France. He seemed only belatedly to recognise that A should have a stable life, based in France, with his mother. An arrangement for the deposit of F's passport while meetings take place would offer M (and the court) some security. </span></p>

That was a case where care proceedings were dismissed the intention of which had been to avoid the removal abroad of children with their parents by a determination that the children would be at risk of significant harm if the family were not allowed to remain here. Mr Scott-Manderson placed reliance on a passage at [53] where the judge emphasised that one effect of the authorities he had reviewed was the proposition that 'the court when exercising its powers under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is not entitled to have regard to immigration policy. It must be guided by the interests of the child'. Mr Scott-Manderson's submission boils down to this: if there is a chance a shared residence order will strengthen F's hand qua the immigration authorities, it must be in A's interests that I should make that rather than a contact order, as a shared residence order may help to preserve the father-child relationship. If I adopted that proposition I would not be applying the first half of Munby J's summary: I would indeed be paying regard to what might be immigration policy when exercising Children Act powers. </span></p>

The amount of time for which it may include any form of staying contact is uncertain in view of F's immigration difficulties, and will at best be limited in current circumstances. There is a risk that such an order might encourage F to advance again before a French court the argument (which I have rejected) that a shared residence order amounts to an order for A's 'return' to this jurisdiction, so that pursuant to article 10 (it might be re-argued) the French courts lack article 8 jurisdiction, A having required habitual residence here as a result of the supposed 'return'. Quite what a French court might make of a shared residence order is, so far as I am aware, untested.

If the English court subsequently renders a 'judgment which requires a return of the child' then Article 11(8) provides that that judgment is enforceable to secure the return of the child, and articles 40(1)(b) and 42 should lead to the English judge certifying by use of the standard form in Annex IV (inter alia) that 'the court has taken into account in issuing its judgment the reasons for and evidence underlying the order issued pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention': see article 42(2)c). </span></p>

It would be consistent with this approach for an application which may result in a return order on the face of it at odds with a non-return order made in another Member State to be dealt with here by the same judges who regularly hear Hague applications for the return abroad of children and who are well versed in this very specialised jurisprudence. Again as a matter of comity, it is preferable that the English judge who arrives at a conclusion other than that reached by a foreign court should have experience, in the reciprocal situation, of deciding whether or not to order under Hague the return of children to other jurisdictions. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:14pt">My own experience indicates that the case management of such applications can be complex, and can indeed give rise to questions of interpretation of the detailed provisions of BIIR. Such questions should be settled at High Court level where decisions are more readily reported than if dealt with in the county court or (as might now occur in the absence of any approved practice) in the family proceedings court. The High Court judiciary are very hard-pressed, but from the statistics for recent years it does not appear that any 'floodgate' fears would be justified. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The obligation upon the court to carry out that examination arises as a matter of indirect jurisdiction, and it is at least questionable whether it can be encompassed within the remedies envisaged in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or whether a distinct form of initiating process would be preferable. In any event, to treat such an application simply as a Children Act application involves the risk that it will not immediately be recognised for what it is, that a pointless conciliation appointment will lead to delay, and that the application may proceed in the county court or the family proceedings court. If the parties and their advisers apply using Children Act forms and procedures then, pending the Family Proceedings Rules, they should mark all forms and other documents lodged in connection with the application 'In the Matter of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and/or in the matter of an application pursuant to article 11(7) of the Brussels II Revised Regulation for the return of the child[ren] from [the member state in question]'. Judges and Court Service staff will therefore immediately be alerted to the nature of the case and its international dimension. Internal procedures should be put in place to transfer the application at the earliest opportunity from the court of issue to the Family Division in London, to be listed as soon as practicable for directions before a judge of the Division, who will then be in a position to manage the application as appropriate.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In a case (not this one) where the English court is already seised by one of the parties, article 11(7) does not apply. Thus the provisions for notification to the parties of information received from the Hague court and the obligation to invite them to make submissions do not appear to arise. If this reading is correct this may be an unintended consequence given that the obligation upon the court which made the non-return order to transmit documents is mandatory under article 11(6). But it cannot however have been intended that in such a situation the home parent should be precluded from applying for the child's return after an article 13 Hague non-return order made in another Member State. That (perhaps obvious) conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the article 11(8) consequence of streamlined enforceability arises in the case of '</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt">any</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> subsequent judgment which requires a return of the child issued by a court having jurisdiction under [BIIR]', which is this situation. </span></p>

Unless the subsisting application is already before the Family Division in London, similar steps promptly to transfer it there should be taken, and the case should be listed for directions before a judge of the Division as a matter of priority.</span></p>
