	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A baby known as A is nearly 7 months old.   Currently she is well (although taking controlling drugs) and lives happily at home in a loving, caring and devoted family.   But it is medically certain that she suffers from haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).   She has already been very ill, and without treatment it is medically certain that she will die, and probable that she will die by about the age of one, or within another year or so from now at the very most.   The only effective treatment is a bone marrow transplant (BMT).   In the circumstances of this case, the doctors estimate that such a transplant has about a 50 per cent prospect of effecting a lasting cure so she then has a normal life expectancy.   There is also about a 10 per cent prospect that she will die during and as a direct result of the treatment; a 30 per cent prospect that the treatment will not be successful and she will still die from her underlying HLH; and a 10 per cent prospect that although she survives she may have some significant impairment.   The treatment will be lengthy, painful and distressing, and could be very painful indeed.   A&#8217;s parents believe that she should enjoy the quality of such life as remains to her and not undergo the treatment.   The doctors strongly disagree and have asked the court, in place of the parents, to give the necessary permission or consent for the treatment to take place.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is an unusual feature to the case which I should make clear at the outset.   Usually when contested medical issues of this kind arise, the child concerned is already in hospital and undergoing some treatment.   The question is then whether a particular form of treatment should or should not be given or continued.   In this case, as I have already said, baby A is currently at home and well.   She would only arrive at the hospital for the BMT if her parents take her there and, in practice, their active participation and co-operation would be required before and during the treatment.   There has been no suggestion whatsoever in this case that the court should positively order the parents to take her to the hospital for a BMT; still less that she should be removed from them for the purpose, under a care or similar order.   So the parents do and will have the final control over whether A undergoes a BMT or not.   But the parents are deeply law abiding people who clearly respect the authority of this court and, I hope, its objectivity and wisdom.   And they have said that if I do grant the declaration which the hospital seek, then they will most probably feel that they should respect it and co-operate in the BMT taking place.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So the stark and awesome question for me is: should I approve and authorise this very significant invasive treatment which the doctors so strongly recommend; or respect and endorse the well informed and long considered judgment and decision of the loving parents?   The issues are truly ones of life and death, but the case also raises profound issues of parental autonomy in our society.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> These are proceedings to which CPR rule 39.2 applies.   This provides that &#8220;The general rule is that a hearing is to be in public.&#8221;   Rule 39.2(3) permits, however, that in certain circumstances a hearing or any part of it may be in private.   At the outset of the hearing the applicant hospital and the parents both strongly urged me to hear this whole case and to give judgment in private.   The parents desperately wish to avoid any publicity or intrusion into the lives of themselves and their family.   The hospital wish to avoid any intrusion into their vital and sensitive work for this and other patients.   I did decide to exercise my discretion to hear the evidence and argument in private.   To do otherwise would, in my view, have been very unfair on the parents in particular, who are already suffering greatly from the illness of their child, who did not initiate these proceedings, and who have done nothing whatsoever to court any publicity into this intensely private matter.   However, this remains a public court of justice, and when a court is called upon to make a decision of this gravity, which raises issues of legitimate public interest and fit for public debate, then I consider that it must announce its decision and reasoning &#8211; i.e. this judgment &#8211; publicly.   The public are entitled to know what decisions courts take in this field, and why.</p>

However, I wish to stress that apart from this judgment the proceedings have taken place entirely before a court sitting in private and relate to the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to minors.

I wish particularly and publicly to thank Mr Philip Havers QC, his junior Mr Sydney Chawatama, and their instructing solicitors, Leigh Day and Company.   All of them have acted entirely pro bono, which is a lawyers&#8217; quaint way of saying entirely free of charge and in the public interest.   Since the case lasted three full days in court (excluding today) and must also have required considerable preparatory work by both solicitors and counsel, the extent of their selfless generosity must be considerable.   Realistically, they must all have devoted about a week of unpaid work to it.   The parents have just sufficient means to be ineligible for legal aid, but could not possibly have financed legal representation themselves.</p>

They each have considerable intelligence, and since the diagnosis of HLH they have read deeply about it and BMT as a treatment, and they clearly have a very good understanding of the medical issues involved.   They have some elder children who are in good health and untouched by HLH.   It is obvious that the parents are committed, devoted and excellent parents to all their children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Baby A was born in December 2006 and at first appeared completely healthy and normal.   In mid March 2007 she first became ill at home with symptoms of fever and jaundice.   She was admitted first to a local hospital and rapidly transferred to more specialist hospitals.   By the end of March she was in the hospital who now bring these proceedings and whenever I refer to &#8220;the hospital&#8221; it is to that hospital.   It is a hospital of world standing in performing BMTs in children.   By the beginning of April the clinical diagnosis that A suffers from primary or familial HLH had been made.   It was positively and indisputably confirmed by the results of DNA tests in mid April.   Familial HLH occurs in about 1 in 50,000 live births.   It is a genetic defect in the immune system and has the effect that a viral infection triggers an abnormal and massive overproduction of the body&#8217;s scavenger cells (macrophages and histiocytes) which invade and literally eat into vital organs such as the liver, bone marrow and brain.   When it first becomes &#8220;active&#8221; it may respond, as it finally did in the case of A, to very strong drug treatment, in particular with the drugs dexamethasone and etoposide and, initially, cyclosporine.   But untreated, it is invariably fatal.   The experts &#8220;state with certainty that without the significant medical therapy she has received to date, this child would already have died.&#8221;   The disease is currently inactive or &#8220;in remission&#8221; (use of that phrase is not strictly accurate), but can become active again at any time.   When it does become active again, then, if at all serious, the opportunity for a successful BMT will already almost certainly have passed.   A BMT provides the only chance of a cure.   Otherwise she must die.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over a period of about 8 weeks from late March to late May 2007 A was very ill indeed and received prolonged, painful and damaging treatment.   She very nearly died and spent about two weeks in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).   One of the experts, Dr Wynn, commented during his oral evidence that &#8220;nothing prepares any family for the horror of a PICU.&#8221;   A received a  number of powerful drugs and reacted badly in particular to cyclosporine.   Her skin became blistered; her bottom became severely burned by the chemotherapy; she developed electrolyte imbalance; she required continuous positive air pressure (CPAP); she developed fluid retention and became very puffy; she required an oscillator to blow air into her lungs; she had numerous punctures in many parts of her body from which blood had been withdrawn or into which drugs were injected.   Most specifically, a Hickman line was inserted under general anaesthetic.   This (of which I was shown an example) is a thin plastic tube which is inserted through the upper chest area into a vein and left indefinitely in the body so that blood can readily be withdrawn for testing or drugs infused.   The sites of the Hickman line became severely infected and I have seen photographs, which are distressing, of several severely excoriated and infected areas on her upper right chest and the fold of her neck as a result.   Eventually the line had to be removed.   During much of  this period A was in obvious pain and distress, evidenced by marked grunting and groaning.   Of course, being a small baby, she could not articulate or describe her pain and distress and one cannot know her agony of mind or body.   But her parents were undoubtedly deeply affected by the experience and the sight of their child undergoing so much suffering.   One or other of them was at her side throughout.   They do not want their child to have to undergo such an ordeal again.   But the child did survive and, as I have said, is now currently well, her wounds repaired or repairing, and living a happy life as a 6 &#8211; 7 month old baby at home.   I have seen with pleasure a short video of her as a happy, apparently healthy, and contented baby.   Although the ordeal was very great for both A and her parents, I wish to stress that I have absolutely no reason to believe that the doctors and nursing staff did anything other than A&#8217;s condition required if she was to survive at all.</p>

In this case a suitable matched family donor is not available and the doctors propose to transplant with cord blood and marrow taken from an unrelated placenta immediately after child birth.   There are now considerable stocks of preserved cord blood around the world.   In the case of cord blood, a full match is less critical than with adult blood because the cord cells have had no experience of life.   Ideally a match of 6/6 antigens would give the best prospect of a cure, at around 70%.   Currently the nearest match that has been found in a world wide search is 4/6.   It is of course possible that any day a better match might become available; but on the basis of the evidence in particular of Dr Y and Miss Z I will proceed on an assumption that the best match available would be a cord with 4/6 antigens.   The doctors have made clear that they would not proceed with any lesser match.</p>

First, there must be a process of &#8220;conditioning.&#8221;   The child must be kept in very strict isolation for 2 &#8211; 3 weeks, although up to three named family members may visit (and one can be resident at all times).   During the conditioning period the child is given chemotherapy drugs which suppress the child&#8217;s own immune system, thereby creating space for the new bone marrow cells, when transplanted, to grow.   This is a very invasive procedure with some inevitable side effects and a high risk of infertility.</p>

A small bag of the donor blood and marrow is transfused through an inserted central venous line, and I understand that the transfusion itself is relatively painless and only last about half an hour or less.   But there is then a critical period of several weeks during which the child must remain on much medication and, if the transplant is successful, the donor bone marrow becomes engrafted in the patient in place of her own.   During this period there is a risk of rejection, or a risk of graft versus host disease (rejection and gvhd are mutually exclusive), and the highest risk of infection.</p>

At the risk of over simplification, the more powerful the drugs, the greater is the prospect of a successful transplant and cure; but the greater also are the pain and side effects during the process and the greater are the risks to the child during the actual process itself.   Dr Y described how the hospital and his team are pioneers of reduced intensity transplant, and if a transplant does take place he would wish to have detailed discussion with the parents about the degree of intensity used.   My understanding is that if only 4/6 matched donor cords are available he would prefer to use a higher intensity to maximise the prospect of a successful cure.   But he would respect the wishes of the parents if they preferred a lower intensity, accepting the risk of a lower prospect of ultimate cure.</p>

There is no cure and the 30 children will ultimately die of HLH (unless conceivably there is a second, successful transplant which is not even in prospect in this case at this stage).   Of the remaining 60 children, about 10 may have significant neurological damage or other major and lasting problems or damage.   That leaves 50, who may be expected to have a lasting cure, although there may be long term effects such as, particularly, infertility to which I will refer later.</p>

Following the transplant there may be infection and sepsis, and acute toxicity to the liver, gut and lungs.   Any of these will involve much pain, medical intervention and treatment.

Some, such as growth failure and pubertal damage, are common or relatively common, but may be effectively managed if and when they occur with simple drug therapy.   Growth failure is a &#8220;relative phenomenon.&#8221;   The child (and later the adult) may be shorter than he or she otherwise might have been, but still within a normal range.</p>

What is predictable is that there are less chances of her becoming really sick if she is transplanted when she is well.&#8221;   Dr Y said in his oral evidence that if the disease becomes active again it would reduce the survival and cure figures by 25 per cent and &#8220;we would not want to push for that&#8221;; although, as I understand it, he would consider a transplant even when the disease was active if, conversely, parents were strongly pushing for it.</p>

There will still be the use of immuno suppressive drugs and the use of a Hickman line.

In that case the respective positions of the parents and doctors were the reverse of the present.   The doctors wished to withdraw treatment (with the result that the child would rapidly die); the parents wished them to continue it.   In my judgment in that case I endeavoured to summarise the relevant law in ten propositions at paragraph [16].   I do not believe that the propositions differ whether it is the doctors or the parents who wish to give or not give the treatment concerned (of course, no doctor can be compelled to carry out any treatment but that is not the issue here).   All the advocates in the present case expressly agreed that my ten propositions were and are a correct  and fair summary of the law, and I propose, therefore, to repeat them and direct myself by them.   They are as follows:-</p>

It can only be said safely that there is a scale, at one end of which lies the clear case where parental opposition to medical intervention is prompted by scruple or dogma of a kind which is patently irreconcilable with principles of child health and welfare widely accepted by the generality of mankind; and that at the other end lie highly problematic cases where there is a genuine scope for a difference of view between parent and judge.   In both situations it is the duty of the judge to allow the court&#8217;s own opinion to prevail in the perceived paramount interests of the child concerned, but in cases at the latter end of the scale, there must be a likelihood (though never of course a certainty) that the greater the scope for genuine debate between one view and another the stronger will be the inclination of the court to be influenced by a reflection that in the last analysis the best interests of every child include an expectation that difficult decisions affecting the length and quality of life will be taken for it by the parent to whom its care has been entrusted by nature.&#8221;</p>

If that judgment is in accord with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and good.   If it is not, then it is the duty of the court, after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment.   That is what it is there for.

If there is a BMT, there is a very high risk that the effect of the chemotherapy in the conditioning process would render A infertile.   Dr Y said that if his preferred dosages are used, with an unrelated 4/6 matched cord donor, to give in his opinion the most optimum outcome, then there would be a 95 per cent risk of infertility.   In those circumstances I consider that I should approach this case on the basis that if there is a BMT it would definitely render A infertile, but with the tantalising, agonising and very remote possibility that it had not done so.   Her own eggs, already present in her ovaries at birth, would be irrecoverably damaged and she would not be able to conceive her own genetic child, whether naturally or with assistance outside the womb (i.e. as a &#8220;test tube&#8221; baby).   She would, however, be able naturally to carry and give birth to an implanted donor foetus, not genetically her own.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a factor to which the parents, in particular perhaps the mother, attach considerable weight.   The mother referred to it in paragraphs 11 and 12 of her supplementary statement, now at bundle A, page C 267(4).   I have every aspect of the whole paragraphs very firmly in mind, but will only quote selectively from them.   She said: &#8220;Also of considerable concern is the risk of hormonal imbalance and, even worse, infertility in A &#8230;.   The weight of this burden of uncertainty cannot begin to be appreciated for [our family] &#8230; Part of the expected benefit and privilege of being a woman which A, by God&#8217;s grace, will become, is derived from the ability  to bear children.   Imposing such an uncertain risk means that A and this family will face years of uncertainty.   I have knowledge of sterility being caused due to medical intervention and I am not entirely sure that in the future A would appreciate enduring these consequences of the treatment provided.&#8221;   In the course of her oral evidence the mother said &#8220;Infertility is incredibly sad.   It is something that if you can avoid you should avoid.&#8221;   She further developed why it is a factor of such importance to her and this family.   As Mr Havers commented during his closing submissions, it was when discussing infertility that the mother became overtly tearful and distressed.   </p>

He said it is the most striking long term risk, but nevertheless there are varying degrees of risk of a number of long term complications of which infertility is a part and they all need to be considered as a whole.   That is correct.   Nevertheless, I am deliberately giving discrete consideration to infertility for a number of reasons.   First, it is a factor of considerable importance to the parents.   Second, I myself feel I must approach it as a certain consequence, not a risk.   Third, although the damage would be done now, at the time of the BMT process, its actual consequence would take effect many years later when A became of child bearing age and desired to have a child.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are then two aspects to the mother&#8217;s concern.   The first is the actual fact, assuming it occurs, of infertility and of A being unable to bear her own child.   I have tried to appreciate how great a burden this would or might be to A as a young adult, longing to have &#8220;the benefit and privilege of being a woman&#8221; (the mother&#8217;s phrase) and yet being unable to do so.   And yet, on the above hypothesis and assumption, the alternative is death, and no human life at all beyond the age of about, say, one.   Whilst, as I have recognised, a minority of infertile women may actually feel and believe that they would prefer actually to be dead, I do not believe this would be a majority feeling.   If it is otherwise in the best interests of A to undergo a BMT I do not consider that even the certainty of infertility can weigh at all against having a BMT.   I cannot accept on her behalf that if (it may be a big if) she can be cured and otherwise lead a long, full and normal life, the certainty of infertility can outweigh or even impact upon the decision.   Put crudely, I must, on A&#8217;s behalf, conclude that it is better to be alive and infertile than dead; and I can only hope and assume that if she does have a BMT, does live into adulthood and does later read these words, she will agree with me, despite the closing words of her mother in the passage from her statement quoted above (&#8220;&#8230; I am not entirely sure that in the future A would appreciate enduring these consequences of the treatment provided.&#8221;)</p>

She said &#8220;Imposing such an uncertain risk means that A and this family will face years of uncertainty.&#8221;   I have assumed the certainty of infertility, but the remote possibility of fertility remains.   Again, I do understand that the element of uncertainty may be agonising for A.   As a burden, it may arise sooner, for she may learn from a relatively young age that she is probably infertile but possibly may not be.   This uncertainty may hang like a dark cloud over her childhood and youth.   Her parents and family would have to strive to help her accept it.   But as with the fact of infertility itself, I cannot and do not accept that this burden of uncertainty can weigh at all against a BMT if otherwise in her best interests.</p>

They focus on the prospect of cure, and may minimise the pain and suffering and significance (if not the degree of risk) of complications.   He stressed, too, the still very small or &#8220;fragile&#8221; statistical basis for predicting outcome.   Dr Y is an expert of world standing in BMT, yet he has only performed 40 transplants in 39 children with HLH (one child had a second transplant).   Most of these have been transplants from closely matched related donors.   The number of transplants into HLH children from unrelated cord donors is very small indeed.   Dr Wynn, at his hospital, has so far undertaken only one transplant from an unrelated cord donor (with a 5/6 match) into a child with HLH.   So Mr Havers submits that &#8220;the numbers involved are tiny, it is still an experimental procedure, and there is not a sure basis of experience for the doctors&#8217; 50 per cent degree of optimism.&#8221;   Further, he made the point that the use in ordinary language of 50 per cent, or &#8220;fifty fifty&#8221;, is itself &#8220;wholly uncertain&#8221;.</p>

The techniques continue to improve, and of those 39 he transplanted 19 within the last 5 years.   Of those 19, 16 (or nearly 85%) are alive and free from the disease.   Further, both he and Dr Wynn stressed that although the absolute numbers of transplants into children suffering HLH are small, many more BMTs have been done by themselves and others into children suffering a range of different, other diseases.   Broadly speaking, the medical science and techniques are the same.</p>

But I do believe that in the present case there is a consistent body of informed evidence from doctors and experts of competence, integrity and great expertise and repute.   The procedure of BMT  in HLH patients may still be pioneering and evolving, but even in such patients it is certainly not so experimental as to be treating A as a proverbial &#8220;guinea pig&#8221;.   In an answer which I have already quoted, the joint experts&#8217; report describes BMT as &#8220;the standard of care for such patients across the world in this situation.&#8221;   Clearly a prognosis of fifty: fifty has considerable elasticity, but it still conveys that out of 100 patients, around 50 will survive and will be cured.   It must be recalled that in any event a balance would still have to be performed, and decision made, between intensity and outcome.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already described the qualities of the parents and their informed, reasoned and balanced approach to the issues in this case.   I make clear that in my view the decision they have reached is an eminently reasonable as well as well-reasoned decision.   This is not at all a case where, in the words of Waite LJ quoted above, they are &#8220;prompted by scruple or dogma &#8230;&#8221;; rather, this case is at the other end of Waite LJ&#8217;s scale, and there is &#8220;genuine scope for a difference of view.&#8221;   The consideration does weigh heavily upon me that the best interests of this child include an expectation that difficult decisions will be taken for her by the excellent and reasonable parents to whom her care has been entrusted by nature.   But ultimately the issue is not whether the parents or their decision are reasonable, as Waite LJ himself, and Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the passages quoted above, and proposition (iii) above all make clear.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR once said, it is impossible to weigh all the considerations mathematically.   An adult facing a terminal illness may be able in some way to assess the value he places on the continuation of his own life, and weigh against that consideration of pain and suffering and all other relevant considerations.   Every day, patients are having to do just that.   But it is extraordinarily difficult to assess what value to place on life on a baby&#8217;s behalf.   That may be particularly so when, as in the case of baby <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">MB</span>, what was under consideration could be no more than prolongation of life for a relatively short period.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here, however, the potential benefit to A if a BMT is successful is not merely prolongation of life by a few months or even years, but the prospect of a full, whole life into adulthood with a normal life expectancy.   As Dr Wynn said, it is important to have an image in mind of the child after a successful transplant.   If the transplant is successful, he or she will be &#8220;normal&#8221;, rarely need any treatment or follow up visits to hospital, do all normal age appropriate activities, and grow into &#8220;normal&#8221; adulthood.   Very understandably, parents in the position of these parents may focus on the baby in the cot now, and the unbearable prospect of subjecting her to further suffering, and the very real prospect (the other 50 per cent) of an earlier and medically induced death or grave impairment.   It is necessary, however, also to look beyond.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Foremost must be the certainty of some, and possibly considerable, pain and suffering.   That is what the parents so strongly fear on behalf of their child.   However, children do stoically endure it.   It may to a considerable degree be managed: see the evidence in particular of Dr Moriarty.   So far, A has suffered, and the parents have witnessed, the ordeal of treatment for active HLH.   Dr Wynn stressed that while the overall account, as revealed by the medical records and the detailed description by the mother, of A&#8217;s period in hospital in March &#8211; May (and particularly her time in the PICU) is &#8220;typical of HLH&#8221;, it is not typical of the transplant procedure, although it could, atypically, be repeated.</p>

On the evidence, there is about a 10 per cent possibility of that, and it weighs very heavily with me.   Few people would readily or lightly embark on a course which had a 1 in 10 risk of killing them.</p>

A would still die of HLH, and such life as she is destined to have would have been considerably impaired by the ultimately futile period of pain and suffering and hospitalisation away from her warm and loving home.</p>

I must decide this case on the basis of medical knowledge and experience, the evidence, and reason.   By definition, a miracle defies medical science and all known experience and reason.   Whilst I respect the faith of the parents, I must leave entirely out of account any possibility of a miraculous cure.</p>

I bear very much in mind what I said within proposition (x) above: &#8220;Where, as in this case, the parents spend a great deal of time with their child, their views may have particular value because they know the patient and how [she] reacts so well &#8230;&#8221;   They are in intimate and constant contact with A.   They witnessed her suffering during the ordeal.   They know her happiness and contentment at home now.   But by the end of the hearing, and in agreement with the guardian, I have become convinced that it is in the overall best interests of A to undergo a BMT and that I should, as I will, grant the requested declaration.   It will be in the terms which have been agreed as a matter of drafting by all counsel and are annexed to this judgment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If a BMT could only prolong by a relatively short period her life; or if it would  leave her alive but probably seriously impaired (e.g. significantly brain damaged) then I would or might take a different view.   But in my view a 50 per cent prospect of a full, normal life (even though infertile) when set against the certainty of death before the age of one or one and a half, does in this case outweigh all other considerations and disadvantages.   If the opportunity of a BMT is not taken, a very real prospect of a full life, weighed against certain death, will have been lost for a few more months of babyhood.   A is more than merely a baby.   She is a living human being, with a future as well as a present, to whom, despite her disease, modern medicine and science may be able to give a full life.   In a case which includes a strong reference to God and religion, I am deeply conscious of my fallibility.   But I am convinced that A should be given that opportunity.   I hope that the parents will feel able to accept my judgment.   Whatever her future and outcome, A and her family will remain deeply in my thoughts.</p>
