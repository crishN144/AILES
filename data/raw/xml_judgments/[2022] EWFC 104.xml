	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The court is concerned with a four-year old child, H.  H travelled to this jurisdiction with his mother (R) in mid-May this year. This is an application by H&#8217;s father (J).  Pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention, he seeks the summary return of his son to Spain which is where the family had been living since they left England the previous year in May 2021.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Those basic facts are not in dispute.  The issues which I have had to determine in the context of the father&#8217;s current application are (i) whether at the time he was removed from Spain or retained by his mother in this jurisdiction against his father&#8217;s wishes, H was habitually resident in England &amp; Wales.  If he was, that removal or retention would not be considered &#8216;wrongful&#8217; in Convention terms regardless of any breach of his father&#8217;s rights of custody; and (ii) if the child had by that stage acquired habitual residence in Spain, whether the mother can avail herself of a defence under Art 13(b) of the Convention so as to give this court a discretion as to whether a summary return should be ordered.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The father is 42 years old.  He was born in Spain but has since acquired dual British nationality having worked for some time in the international hospitality sector.  The mother is 33.  She was born in Serbia where members of her family still live.  She, like the father, has pursued a successful career which has seen her working in several different jurisdictions.  She is now a national of Great Britain and Hungary as well as retaining her nationality of birth.  She works as a self-employed marketing consultant and, like the father, has had some notable success in her career.  She recently secured a Masters degree.  H is clearly a much-loved child and he is fortunate indeed to have two devoted, intelligent and professionally successful parents.  On behalf of his client, Mr Wareing described both as &#8220;responsible, caring parents&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The father came to live and work in London in 2002.  Six years later, the mother moved to this country.  They met in 2014 when they were working at the same restaurant and a relationship developed between them.  By the Spring of 2015 they were cohabiting.  In 2017, the mother became pregnant.  It appears that by that stage their relationship was committed, happy and stable.  H was born in 2018.  He has British nationality.  Whilst he was still a small infant, his parents began to discuss the prospect of leaving England to make a home together in Europe.  In the early part of 2019, the father had been approached with a view to securing employment in Ibiza where he was negotiating with potential employers in relation to a job running a theatre and restaurant on the island.  That opportunity went no further and, in 2020, he was in discussion with a group of investors about a potential move to Madrid.  These negotiations were fairly advanced but the project was delayed as a result of the pandemic.  In the meantime it seems that the discussions between these parties about a move to Spain continued.  The father saw greater employment opportunities in that jurisdiction and both appeared to have been attracted by the lifestyle options available to the family if living at a location close to the coast.  The mother does not dispute that these preliminary discussions took place but her case is that there was never a plan for permanent relocation to Spain.  She accepts that their plans to relocate were motivated by the father&#8217;s need to find alternative employment when he was made redundant from his role as the general manager of a well-known restaurant in central London.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">As the evidence before the court confirms, there came a point when there was a consensus between them to leave London and make the move to Spain.  It was a natural point of gravitation for the family since the father had family members in that city (his mother and two sisters) who would be available to offer support following the family&#8217;s arrival.  Arrangements were made to let the London apartment which had been the family&#8217;s home up to that point.  The tenancy agreement initially ran for 12 months from 1 April 2020 and was subsequently renewed for a further 12 months.  In the early part of 2020, their plans to leave London for Spain had to be put on hold as a result of the global pandemic.  Travel arrangements for April 2021 were postponed and the move eventually took place at the beginning of May 2021.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">At the time of the move, they shipped some of their belongings, including some office furniture, to Spain, other pieces of furniture and winter clothes being placed into store in London and Spain as surplus to their immediate needs and requirements.  There appear by now to have been financial constraints on the couple.  The father sold a small 2 bedroomed apartment which he owned in Spain in order to give them some working capital as they made the move.  The mother had secured some consultancy work in London which she was able to undertake remotely from Spain.</p>

The house which they rented after some weeks searching for the right property was a fairly substantial home with four bedrooms, three bathrooms and all the usual amenities of a family home.  Following the move into that property, the father has not returned to England.  The mother has returned with H on three occasions where she was able to spend time with her family who live close to central London.  It is a close-knit extended family and I have no doubt that both she and H took much pleasure from those trips.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">It seems that difficulties in the parents&#8217; relationship began to surface towards the end of 2021 but they remained together as a couple for several more months.  By March this year (2022), they had reached a decision to separate.  The mother travelled to England over Easter that year.  Having returned to Spain, she informed the father that she wished to make a further trip to England for her sister&#8217;s graduation event.  When the father objected to H leaving Spain, the mother indicated that she would travel by herself.  On 14 May 2022, the mother contacted the father by telephone to inform him that she and H had travelled together to England but that they would be returning to Spain by the end of the month.  Three days later, on 17 May 2022, she called to say that, having sought legal advice locally in England, she had decided not to return and would be remaining in England permanently with their son.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">By that stage there were parallel proceedings ongoing in the domestic courts of both jurisdictions.  The mother had by then issued proceedings in a London Family Court for a child arrangements and prohibited steps order.  Those proceedings were stayed by order of Mr Justice Peel on 16 June 2022.  For his part, the father had issued his own application in the Court of First Instance in a city in Spain.  There have been two hearings in those proceedings.  On 6 May 2022 the Spanish court accepted jurisdiction and he was given permission to proceed with an application &#8220;seeking measures to avoid an abduction&#8221; of their son.  At a subsequent hearing on 31 May 2022, the father&#8217;s application was extended to include a request for guardianship and custody of the child.  The mother was directed to respond to his application within 20 working days.  She tells me through her counsel that she has not been formally served with those proceedings.  I am proceeding on that basis for the purposes of this hearing.  She accepts that she is aware of the proceedings having now had an opportunity to see the orders flowing from each of the two hearings in the local Spanish family court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">As I made plain during the course of argument yesterday, I have no doubt that the correct legal analysis of the position up to that point of time is that this little boy was habitually resident in England &amp; Wales.  Mr Basi, on behalf of the father, does not seek to say otherwise.  He was born here and had made his home throughout with his parents here.  He travelled with is parents to Spain shortly before the celebration of his third birthday.  I need no persuasion that, up to 1 May 2021, the child was habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  Much of the mother&#8217;s evidence in terms of the fabric of their son&#8217;s life in the London community up to that point in time in not controversial.  I accept her evidence from childminders, friends and family that he had established strong links in his local community.  If the judicial enquiry was focussed on the period from 2018 through to the Spring of 2021, I would have no hesitation in finding that this child was habitually resident in England.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The issue then becomes this:  having moved to Spain and having spent the next 12 months living in that jurisdiction, albeit with trips back to London to see the extended maternal family, did that position change ? On behalf of his client, Mr Wareing places significant reliance on the subjective intentions of H&#8217;s mother who never intended the family&#8217;s relocation to be permanent.  As I pointed out during the course of argument, the parents may well have had different subjective intentions both at the time of the original relocation and subsequently as their relationship broke down.  Those intentions are only one aspect of the enquiry which the court is obliged to undertake.</p>

That definition finds no reflection in the language of the 1980 Convention and thus it is my task in these proceedings to look at all the circumstances of this case in order to reach a conclusion as to the simple factual determination which must be addressed:  where was H habitually resident when he travelled to London on 13 May 2022 ?</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The law in relation to habitual residence is now settled.  One of the most recent, and often cited expositions, is that of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Custody Rights: Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 4 WLR 156" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 4 WLR 156</ref>.  Essentially, the task of the court is to look at the facts in a straightforward way without applying any legal sub-rules or glosses.  The court has to ask to what extent a child has integrated into the social and family environment of his or her new circumstances in the second jurisdiction.  The focus in this context is on the manner in which the child is actually experiencing his or her life and the degree of integration into the experience of childhood and family life in that new jurisdiction.  No one factor in the overall assessment is determinative: the evaluation which the court conducts is an holistic enquiry into all the child&#8217;s and his parents&#8217; circumstances as they present in the context of family life.  The focus of the enquiry is on the child himself although the younger the child, the greater the likelihood that his or her habitual residence will be the same as the parents who are caring for him.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>In this context the law does not recognise a state of hiatus where a child has no habitual residence.  In the usual course of events, a child will lose a former habitual residence as he acquires a new one.  The court will frequently look to the analogy which Lord Wilson gave us in an earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2016/4" uk:canonical="[2016] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] UKSC 4</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>of the see-saw.  It is a simple analogy but it is a good one.  His Lordship said this:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

As is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, there does not need to be full integration into a new jurisdiction before the court can properly make a finding that a child has acquired a new habitual residence.  There does, however, need to be a <span style="font-style:italic">sufficient </span>degree of integration such that a child&#8217;s residence can properly be characterised as &#8216;habitual&#8217;: see Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC (Children) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 1038" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 1038</ref> at para [60].</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">It is not without significance that Spain was a country which was already familiar to H when the family left England in May 2021.  He had grandparents living in both jurisdictions but had made at least four trips to Spain to see his paternal grandmother and members of the father&#8217;s family prior to that date.  The parents having taken the decision to move, they began to make the usual arrangements in relation to leaving the home in London and arranging for the transportation of their belongings to Spain.  I accept that this was not a relocation which involved the severance of all their ties with London.  Their home was rented out, as I have said, and some of their belongings placed into storage.  I am satisfied that the day-to-day paraphernalia of family life and all the clothes and toys which would have been familiar to H accompanied them on their move.  The father contacted the Spanish Embassy in London in order to remove himself from the register of Spanish nationals paying national insurance in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">As for H, the parents registered their son at a local nursery school in Spain within a week of arriving in Spain.  He was enrolled in an after-school club where activities were available after the school day until his parents were free to collect him and take him home.  It appears that the rhythm of his weekdays involved attendance at the nursery from Mondays to Fridays from 9am to 2pm and thereafter until about 5.30pm when he would be collected from the after-school club.  There are no reports in the evidence of his being unsettled or unhappy with these arrangements and it is reasonable to suppose that, as a bright young child, he soon became acquainted with the teachers and staff who cared for him there prior to returning to the home he then shared with both of his parents each evening.  There are in the bundle many photographs depicting time away from school or nursery spent in the company of young friends having fun in the way any young child might enjoy time at weekends.  I have no doubt that this is the way this happy little boy lived his life both in Spain and in England.  He appears to have had a secure attachment to each of his parents and he was growing up and learning to socialise and experience life in both jurisdictions.</p>

All three were registered formally as legal residents of Spain.  Whilst it appears that he remained registered at his former GP&#8217;s surgery in London, it seems he visited, and was treated, by doctors locally in Spain on three separate occasions in 2021 and 2022.  On the father&#8217;s case his proficiency in spoken Spanish improved as he spent time in the local community with his family.  It is the father&#8217;s case that he attended all the usual birthday parties when invited by his school friends and was enrolled in a form of &#8216;summer camp&#8217; for part of the school summer holidays in 2021. The father has produced evidence that, as he was due to move from nursery school, H was subsequently registered for a place at a local Spanish primary school.  The mother disputes that she signed those registration forms.  That is not a dispute which this court can resolve.</p>

That position is aligned closely with her case that the move to Spain was only ever intended to be temporary.  On her behalf, Mr Wareing  has described it in his skeleton argument as &#8220;a temporary &#8216;decamping&#8217; to Spain&#8221;.  I note from the declaration in relation to international travel which she signed prior to the move on 1 May 2021 that the purpose of such travel was &#8220;moving to Spain&#8221; and &#8220;work&#8221; but I accept that not much turns on that statement since it could be said to support both a temporary and permanent move.  In contrast, when the father completed contemporaneously a similar document, he gave as his reasons for travel &#8220;moving to Spain for good&#8221;.</p>

Her work required her to return to England from time to time although she acknowledges that the father was reluctant to disturb H&#8217;s routine in Spain so as to enable him to accompany her on those occasions.  To use another, and different, analogy, I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence to the effect that, when the family left England in 2021, they did not entirely &#8216;pull up the drawbridge&#8217;.  The father retained property in this jurisdiction albeit that it was let to tenants.  Some of the previous aspects of family life in London remained as a matter of record, such as H&#8217;s continuing registration at his previous doctor and dentist.  He had extended family in London.  Through his mother, he may have had some ongoing indirect contact with friends he had left behind when the family moved to Spain in May 2021.  She continued to maintain a bank account in this jurisdiction and the flow of UK child benefit into that account was uninterrupted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Of H&#8217;s integration into social life in Spain, the mother&#8217;s statement paints a picture of a rather isolated little boy who did not go on play dates or to birthday parties as the language barrier prevented him from making friends.  This is in direct contra-distinction to the many photographs which I have seen of this happy little boy enjoying time with his peers in a number of different settings.  As everyone accepts, these are good and committed parents.  I find it difficult to conceive of circumstances where this mother would have countenanced a situation where, for the best part of a year, their child was socially isolated from children in the local community and the evidence which is available suggests he was not.  Where there is a dispute between these parents, I look to the availability of independent third-party evidence.  I have in the bundle a certificate of attendance produced by the director of the school which H attended.  That certificate confirms the child&#8217;s regular attendance through the 2021/2022 academic year, as the director of the school puts it, &#8220;attending regularly from Monday to Friday from September according to the school calendar, leaving in June&#8221;.  As we know, and as the director of the school may not have known, H left in May this year when he travelled to England with his mother.  It does not appear to be in dispute that he had previously attended at a nursery from 8 May 2021 and thereafter at summer camp through July 2021. Thus, it seems to me that there is reliable evidence before this court that H was indeed a pupil, and regular attender, at his local nursery/school where he spent the majority of his day before moving on to the after-school club.  It is very difficult to conceive of circumstances where he did not acquire a degree of integration into his nursery/school life.  He was travelling to and from those establishments every weekday during term times with the support of his parents who no doubt delivered and collected him on a daily basis for these purposes.  </p>

She maintains in her first statement that such registration did not confirm &#8216;residency&#8217; but rather assigned to the family members as foreigners a unique personal number confirming their status and entitlement to remain in Spain for &#8220;economic, professional or social reasons&#8221;.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Whatever the technicalities of that registration, it does not absolve the court from looking at the realities of those twelve months from the child&#8217;s perspective.  The essence of the mother&#8217;s case as advanced on her behalf by Mr Wareing appears to be that (i) H was habitually resident in this jurisdiction prior to 1 May 2021; (ii) the mother never intended the move to Spain to be permanent; (iii) she left Spain with H, without the father&#8217;s permission, as she accepts, a year later to return to London; and (iv) both she and H have now resumed their previous life and there has been no wrongful removal.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The reality is that rather than &#8220;wrongful removal&#8221; for reasons she sets out in her statements; she simply came home with her child to their habitual residence&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">It seems to me that this formulation ignores the important policy considerations which have for many years underpinned the 1980 Hague Convention and Brussels IIA whilst the United Kingdom was a member state of that latter Convention.  The starting point of the legal analysis is that both these parents had, and were throughout exercising, rights of custody in relation to their child.  Neither parent is entitled to act unilaterally in terms of important or significant decisions for a child and that includes decisions in relation to where a child should live.  If there is disagreement, this becomes a welfare decision which will ultimately lie with a court for determination.  The 1980 Convention provides a means for ensuring that, in cases which involve an international dimension or a movement of a child or children between two different member states, there is a swift mechanism for ensuring that it is the courts in the country of the child&#8217;s habitual residence which will determine that dispute.  As I have said earlier in this judgment, in this context, a removal will be &#8216;wrongful&#8217; once it is established that (i) the child concerned was habitually resident in a particular jurisdiction and (ii) his removal from that jurisdiction breached the &#8216;left behind&#8217; parent&#8217;s rights of custody.  It is not open to a parent to take unilateral action simply because her relationship with H&#8217;s father had broken down and she felt herself to be &#8220;an emotional hostage&#8221; to that relationship.</p>

It is clear that the father was delegated to view various properties.  He obviously kept the mother informed of how the search was progressing.  She was clearly enthusiastic about the property into which they eventually moved On 6 August 2021, at a time when the mother appears to have been visiting her own family in Serbia, she wrote this in response to his description of the viewing:-</p>

There is no suggestion in any of those messages that the mother was urging caution in their planning because of an imminent or early return to London.

It does her much credit and it displays a significant amount of insight into the pressures on their relationship at that point of time and her proposals for addressing those issues.  She was clearly concerned about the effects upon H of these difficulties.  She had clearly not resolved at that point of time to separate permanently from the father.  She spoke of her love for him and for their child.  She described feelings of being &#8220;overwhelmed, scared and tired&#8221;.  She said she wanted all three of them to be &#8220;well, happy and thriving&#8221;.  She made a proposal to the father that she should be allowed some time to return to London and Serbia with H.  She proposed to spend some holiday time in Serbia.  He, in turn, should take some time whilst they were away to think about what he wanted to do about his own employment situation.  She suggested a number of options he might consider.  She said &#8220;Let us please take a break from everything &#8230;.. let me be for some time in the country where I have my family and friends with H and to give you time to refocus on yourself and your life.&#8221; She concluded her message with these words: &#8220;I know this is a solution that will benefit us all.

If such an intention existed in her mind at that time, it was not communicated to this father.

Within a brief few weeks of the family&#8217;s arrival, they had moved into a spacious family home.  It was a home about which the mother was clearly enthusiastic.  She reflected in her texts to the father all the amenities which it had to offer them as a family.  H settled into that home with his two parents.  The rhythm of his life over the coming months reflected a perfectly normal routine for a child of this age.  He went to nursery and school.  He spent time outside school at an after-school club before returning home each evening with his two parents.  Whatever the mother now seeks to say about his social isolation over those twelve months, there is ample evidence in the material before the court that he was a happy, engaging child who enjoyed spending time with family and friends taking trips to the beach as both parents intended he should.  Their home had been chosen with access to the coast very much in mind.  The mother wanted him to grow up in &#8220;green spaces&#8221; as her messages show and that is the lifestyle which his parents provided for him.  </p>

Over the early summer months, as he became familiar with his new nursery/school environment and spent time with his peers, the &#8220;see-saw&#8221; moved swiftly, to adopt Lord Wilson&#8217;s analogy.  He lost his old roots in London and acquired fresh roots in Spain.  Certainly by May this year, after 12 months in that country, he had acquired a new habitual residence in Spain, and I so find.  Given that there is no issue but that his removal by the mother to England on 13 May was in breach of rights of custody which the father was exercising at that time, such removal was &#8216;wrongful&#8217; as a matter of law in Convention terms.</p>

If so, the court then moves on to evaluate the precise nature of the evidence put before the court so as to reach a conclusion as to whether or not, in this particular instance, the risk has been made out in relation to this particular child.  It is at that point that the court moves on to consider the efficacy of the protective measures offered by the other party.  Access to the courts in that jurisdiction is an important consideration in this context.  A Judge has to look critically and &#8220;examine in concrete terms&#8221; what the situation would look like on the ground for the child concerned and ensure that basic arrangements are catered for, such as what happens when the abducting parent steps off the plane.

There is expression in that evidence of the mother&#8217;s apparently genuine concerns for the father&#8217;s emotional wellbeing and an expression that she wanted him to take care of himself because &#8220;you will then be best for your child too&#8221;.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Taking all the evidence at its highest, I am not persuaded that the mother has made out a defence in this case in relation to a grave risk of sufficient magnitude to this child at the hands of his father to bring it within the intended scope of Art 13(b).  I do not consider that threshold has been reached.  However, even if I had taken a contrary view, I would nevertheless have had to consider the position as it would be on the ground for the child in the event of a summary return. The mother has accepted without reservation that she will return to Spain as H&#8217;s primary carer if the court orders the child&#8217;s return to that jurisdiction.  In that event, the father has undertaken to move out of what was their family home to enable her and H to return.  He offers them exclusive occupation for a period of a month during which he will meet all the financial outgoings.  He envisages moving out and living for a temporary period in one of his family member&#8217;s properties.  In the longer term, he proposes to rent accommodation of his own.  In these circumstances, the mother and H would be in a position of returning to a four-bedroom property which is already familiar to them both and where many, if not most, of their personal belongings and effects are still in place.  The father is currently in receipt of an income of &#8364;1,800 per month.  The mother has the ability to work remotely as she has demonstrated throughout several months of the last year.  The financial arrangements to be put in place after that initial period will be a matter for the local Family courts.  In this context I am satisfied that, with ongoing proceedings already established in that jurisdiction, both parties will have ready access to the court as soon as the mother and child have returned to that jurisdiction.</p>

He has agreed that no steps will be taken to remove H from the primary care of his mother.  He offers to underwrite the cost of their return travel and thereafter to provide child support at the rate of &#8364;150 per month for H pending further consideration by the Spanish courts.  I would wish to see these arrangements in relation to both the former family home and child support in place for at least the period it takes to bring this matter back to the court in Spain. If that means that he has to use savings to fund any shortfall, then so be it.</p>

I will record the father&#8217;s undertakings by means of a schedule attached to my order and I will direct that he should be required to ensure that both my order and those undertakings are registered in an appropriate way, whether by way of mirror orders or otherwise, with the Court of First Instance in the local court in Spain.</p>

I appreciate that this will be a matter for the judge in that jurisdiction who is charged with making best interest welfare decisions for H from the foot of representations made by each of these parents.  Having found that H was habitually resident in Spain as at 13 May this year and that his removal was wrongful because it was in breach of the father&#8217;s rights of custody, I am bound to order a summary return at this juncture in circumstances where the mother&#8217;s Art 13(b) defence is not made out.</p>

I appreciate that her father, H&#8217;s grandfather, may find it difficult to understand why the court has taken this course when what he sees is a happy grandson who is thriving and largely reintegrated back into the life he left before these parents took the decision in 2021 to move to Spain.  Whatever the current wishes of his daughter, H&#8217;s mother, in relation to the future, these are decisions which should properly be made by the courts in the place where H was last living before he was wrongfully removed to this jurisdiction.  There are important and wider policy considerations behind these matters.  Parents who share responsibility for their children are not entitled to act unilaterally and international conventions, such as the 1980 Hague Convention, have operated successfully over many years to ensure that children&#8217;s lives are not disrupted in this way without local court sanction.</p>
