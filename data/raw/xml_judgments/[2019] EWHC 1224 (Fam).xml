The success of the business can be seen by the fact that she was earning around &#163;50,000 per annum but it was sold in around 2004 for approximately &#163;160,000 in total.  She has since been a housewife and mother although she commenced training as a counsellor in 2014.   She has now qualified although she is intending to take a further threeyear course to further her skills.   </p>

Thereafter, they moved briefly to another rented property in central London.   In November 2002, the Husband purchased the former matrimonial home.  This is a substantial part-Tudor listed property with 8 bedrooms, staff annexe, outbuildings, tennis court, outdoor swimming pool and 65 acres of land.  It has been suggested that the Husband paid approximately &#163;2 million for the property but the exact details are unknown. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">Thereafter, a substantial programme of renovation and improvement was commenced.  The Wife estimates this work cost approximately &#163;1 million.  It is assumed that the Husband paid for it from a distribution to him from a trust that was wound up around this time.  Whilst the works were being done, the couple briefly occupied an Estate property in London.  The former matrimonial home was valued for these proceedings by William Nicoll of Savills in February 2018 at &#163;2.63 million.  It is said that the estate is now &#8220;tired&#8221; and in need of further renovation.  Mr Nicoll replied to an email from the Wife&#8217;s solicitors on 23 February 2018 saying that he thought &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">easily &#163;500k possibly more could be spent renovating the house, buildings and land</span>&#8221; but I have no further details. </p>

I will return to this in due course.  It is fair to say that virtually none of this huge income has been preserved.  It was all spent.  The only tangible asset, other than the former matrimonial home, is a property that was built in South America as a holiday home.  The Wife invested between &#163;70,000 and &#163;80,000 from the money that she received from the sale of her business into the cost of the home in South America, although the property was conveyed into the sole name of the Husband.  Due to the Husband&#8217;s failure to engage with the proceedings, we have no valuation of the property. </p>

The Wife complains that, during this period, she received little financial support.  She petitioned for divorce in July 2017.  The day after the date of the Wife&#8217;s divorce petition, the Husband transferred &#163;246,000 to her. It has been virtually the only responsible thing he has done in the case.  Initially, she believed that this was a repayment of a sum of &#163;250,000 belonging to her son, AB that she had given the Husband to invest.  Later, however, he made it clear that this sum was, in fact, maintenance.  It seems likely that AB&#8217;s money remains invested in an account in Monaco.   </p>

In her statement of the same date, she said that the Husband had not been paying the household bills or the children&#8217;s costs (including their school fees).  All that he had continued to do was to continue to pay to her a monthly allowance of &#163;4,000.  She made the point that she believed he received &#163;68,000 per month from his Trustees on the basis that they also pay his tax bills and, periodically, make further income distributions to him.  These included a sum of &#163;1.1 million in the year 2015/2016.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">She filed her Form E on 18 October 2017.  She valued the South American property at &#163;750,000 but concedes that this is no more than a guess.  She deposed to &#163;114,009 in bank accounts.  This was the balance of the sum of &#163;246,000 that the Husband had transferred to her.  She has chattels worth &#163;54,000 and a pension worth &#163;38,124, giving total net assets of &#163;206,134.  In the context of this case, this is a very modest figure indeed.  She says her income needs for herself are &#163;27,897 per month and &#163;9,965 per month for the three children but this does not include school fees.  She adds that the family lived a very privileged lifestyle.  She estimates her future earning capacity from her work as a counsellor at between &#163;20 &#8211; 25,000 per annum.     </p>

He was further ordered to pay to the Wife &#163;232,746 in respect of maintenance pending suit and &#163;191,796 for legal services by 9 November 2017. The case was transferred to be heard by a High Court Judge.  He made no order on the Wife&#8217;s application to join the Trustees.   She has not applied to join them subsequently.  The Trustees are therefore not parties although they have cooperated fully and attended various hearings via their lawyers, Farrer and Co.   </p>

On 17 November 2017, Recorder Nice made a freezing order in the same sum.   The third-party debt order was made final on 11 December 2017 by Gibbons DJ.   </p>

The case was listed on 15 February 2018 for him to attend and for the court to consider the consequences of his failure to comply with directions of the court.   He failed to attend before Francis J on 15 February 2018.  By now, it was becoming clear that third party disclosure orders would be the only way to get reliable information.  A number of such orders have subsequently been made.  On this occasion, the Husband was also ordered to pay to the Wife a further sum of &#163;223,392 in respect of legal services and &#163;104,972 in relation to maintenance pending suit.  Both orders were subsequently enforced by third party debt orders to his bankers, C Hoare &amp; Co.    </p>

This included the former matrimonial home at &#163;2.6 million; &#163;500,000 to renovate the property; &#163;4 million for a London home and a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> fund of &#163;8.4 million to cover a lifetime income need of &#163;334,764 per annum.  She also sought &#163;300,400 for AB and capitalised school fees and child periodical payments in the sum of &#163;1,042,000. Finally, she argued that she should have a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">reversionary</span>&#8221; sum of &#163;1,000,000 to cover any legal fees arising from future applications launched by the Husband against her or necessitated by his behaviour.    </p>

She said that she needs a home in London because her family and support network live there.  She spent approximately one evening per week in London with the Husband during the marriage, often staying at a luxury hotel in central London.  She says she will be staying in London during term time as she will get more patients in London.  She added that responsibility for the children is firmly on her shoulders due to the Husband&#8217;s health.  She raises his conduct during the course of the proceedings.

As with so many of his communications, it is thoroughly offensive to the Wife and her solicitors.  I do not propose to quote from any of his communications other than to say that they are peppered with disgraceful anti-Semitic comments that are as offensive as it is possible to get to the Wife and her solicitor.  He is also very disrespectful to the court, describing it as a Talmudic Court of Injustice.  His communications have undoubtedly distressed the Wife enormously.  This email does ask the question why he should have to pay for AB when AB&#8217;s father is still alive. He contends that the Wife should return to him all monies and possessions that she has &#8220;stolen&#8221; from him.   </p>

I am clear that these were drafted for him by a solicitor as they are formulated in a way that is quite different to everything that emanates directly from the Husband.  The document says that he has no wish to disrupt proceedings or to give evidence or make submissions.  He proposes that the Wife and children should have exclusive use of the former matrimonial home until the children are over the age of 18.  He repeats that there is no need for a London property as the family did not have one during the marriage and they lived &#8220;quietly&#8221;. He says he will pay to the Wife outright 50% of the value of the former matrimonial home, the South American property and his UK bank balances, saying he has already transferred &#163;245,000.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">I now turn to deal with the written evidence before me as to the Husband&#8217;s interest in the Trusts.  Farrer &amp; Co instructed Tiffany Scott QC to prepare a note for the court which was originally dated 5 November 2018 but was updated on 28 February 2019 following the oral evidence.  It says that the Husband&#8217;s entitlement is principally in Fund A of which he and other family members are life tenants with broadly equal notional shares.  The Husband&#8217;s interest is 26.5582%.  There is no power to accumulate income.  It must all be distributed to the beneficiaries.  The Husband will receive the capital outright if he survives until 20 years after the death of certain other family members.  This is likely to be between 2045 and 2080, although using actuarial tables, a date of 2064 emerges.  It is of note that the Husband would then be aged in his 90s.  The assets in Fund A are some &#163;400 million so the Husband&#8217;s notional share is &#163;106 million.  There is no power to make loans.  The Trust has to pay the basic rate of tax at 20% on the income.  The beneficiaries are responsible for higher rate tax at 40% and, mostly, 45% although, administratively, this is also paid by the Trustees.  On the Husband&#8217;s death, his interest will go to his children equally.  At present, this is CD, EF and GH.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">There is power to advance up to 70% of the capital to the Husband.  In theory, this would amount to &#163;74 million.  The Trustees have a duty to consider any request, but the Trusts are dynastic in nature and are managed as one unit.  There have been no capital distributions to date other than modest payments to assist with property investment or repair.  In addition, life insurance payments to protect against Inheritance Tax are a charge against capital.  The Note says that, if a request for capital is made to the Trustees, they will have to consider as an important factor the vociferous opposition of the Husband.    In November 2018, the Trustees were willing to consider leasing a property in London for the Wife for a term of say 20 years, to avoid possible enfranchisement, but it could not be settled on her as she is not a beneficiary. A market rent would have to be paid.  The Trustees have since reconsidered their position and do not now support such an arrangement.  They say they will have to seek the Court&#8217;s blessing under Part 64 before compliance with any order that I make, and the children must be a party to that application.  Originally, it was thought I could hear that application, but they now consider it should be heard in the Chancery Division. The Trustees are extremely respected people who will undoubtedly comply with the Trust Deed to the letter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">There is no doubt that Fund A generates a very significant income for the Husband every year.  Indeed, the income has grown significantly in recent years due to the flourishing property market.  In 2015/2016, the Husband received net distributions of &#163;62,000 per month (&#163;744,000 for the year) plus a one-off distribution of &#163;1,100,000.  In addition, small amounts were paid to CD (&#163;15,000) and his mother (&#163;48,481).  In total, therefore, he received &#163;1,907,481 net and his marginal tax bill of &#163;1,443,877 was paid.  In 2016/2017, the monthly figure was &#163;68,000. Total distributions were &#163;882,555 for the year and marginal tax was paid of &#163;660,719.  It is, however, clear that, during that year, income was retained in the fund, such that a large distribution of &#163;2.5 million was paid in September 2017.  This is the money that was frozen pursuant to the various freezing orders. </p>

Nevertheless, I consider these to be conservative figures such that I can safely take the Husband&#8217;s average net income over the coming five years as being likely to be in the order of &#163;1,185,000 per annum.  It is clear that the Husband has been the driving force in relation to all expenditure throughout the marriage.  It is obvious that virtually no capital has been saved.  This supports the Wife&#8217;s case that he has always spent everything that he has received.   In one sense, this leads to a conclusion that there was, indeed, a very high standard of living.  Equally, however, there has been clear profligacy.  For example, the Husband spent &#163;420,737 on private jets between May 2017 and May 2018.    </p>

They include the former matrimonial home at &#163;2,551,100 after costs of sale; the South American property at &#163;772,500; and the frozen money at &#163;2,214,202. Part of this sum is definitely needed for costs such that I have been working on a figure of &#163;1.75 million as being left after the costs have been paid.  The Schedule also includes the capital value of the Husband&#8217;s interest in the Trust at &#163;74.3 million but I am satisfied that this is entirely notional.  Excluding that figure, the Husband&#8217;s capital assets are broadly &#163;5.5 million. </p>

The Wife&#8217;s figure is therefore just the &#163;215,513 in her bank accounts and her pension now valued at &#163;41,616.  I did ask whether the fact that her bank balances had increased from &#163;114,009 at the time of her Form E showed that she had been able to save some of her maintenance pending suit.  This was denied by Mr Cusworth, saying it was a question of timing, but Holman J made his order to the end of February 2019, so I consider there has been some saving.  I do not say this to criticise her. It is in many ways prudent and welcome.    </p>

They therefore concentrate on the Open Proposal made by the Husband in July 2018, even though he appears to have disavowed it since, arguing that the Wife should get nothing.   They say they take issue with a good deal of the Wife&#8217;s Open Proposal on the basis that it contains &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">forensic exaggeration and makeweight aspiration</span>&#8221;. They calculate that the Husband&#8217;s offer of half his resources amounted to around &#163;2.875 million.  They point out that the Husband has never had a capital distribution, other than the sum of &#163;1,050,000 in 2004 on the dissolution of one of the subfunds in the Trust.  They remind me that the Trustees have said that (a) their discretion must not be fettered; (b) they will consult other adult beneficiaries; (c) they will consider the property, finance and tax consequences of any request; and (d) the Husband&#8217;s vociferously expressed wishes will be an important consideration.

They produce property particulars for housing for the Wife, once the children are off her hands, at between &#163;1 and &#163;1.5 million.  If she spent &#163;1.4 million on housing, this would leave her with a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> fund of approximately &#163;1.5 million per annum which would generate around &#163;74,000 pa. This does not, of course, cater for the next few years whilst she remains in the former matrimonial home.  They argue that the Wife&#8217;s spending during the marriage was &#163;7,494 per month for herself and &#163;5,281 per month on the property, making a total of &#163;12,775 per month.  The difficulty with this assessment is that it completely ignores the spending on her behalf paid by the Husband such as holidays and credit cards.  They tell me that the CMS assessment of maintenance for the boys is not the maximum and therefore I have no jurisdiction to make a maintenance order.  They are undoubtedly right about that, although I note that the Wife is appealing the assessment.  It may well strike the neutral observer as odd that a man with a net income in excess of &#163;1 million per annum has to pay less than the maximum assessment for the children.  Mr Marshall&#8217;s document asserts that the Husband pays the boarding school fees but it emerged in evidence that he has not been doing so and the Wife has paid out of her maintenance pending suit.    </p>

Perhaps most importantly, the very large future income stream is also clearly non-matrimonial.  There is no dispute that the compensation strand is not engaged.

The precise boundaries of that judicial self-restraint have never been rigidly defined &#8211; nor could they be if the jurisdiction is to retain its flexibility.  But certain principles emerge from the authorities.  One is that the court is not obliged to limit its orders exclusively to resources of capital or income which are shown actually to exist&#8230;where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust&#8230;.), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party.  Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse.  This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others.  There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court&#8217;s view of the justice of the case.  There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8221;  </span></p>

In fact, I note that the Husband has requested a capital distribution of &#163;15 million which the Trustees have not finally determined.  I recognise that he did so for his own purposes, but at the very least this might have been a way around the difficulty.  If so, he would only have had himself to blame.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">The Wife gave her evidence in an entirely straightforward and honest way. She was doing her best to assist me. She has clearly been very upset by the Husband&#8217;s behaviour and the damage it is doing to the children.  The vast majority of Mr Marshall&#8217;s careful and thorough cross-examination involved probing and challenging her reasonable needs going forward, including the need for a London home; her budget; AB&#8217;s fund; her request for two expensive motor vehicles; and the proposed reversionary litigation fund.  I will deal with all these matters when I make findings of fact as to her reasonable needs.  She was also asked about her earning capacity.  I am quite clear that it is far too late for her to attempt to resurrect her previous career.  That avenue was closed down when she sold her business.  I accept her evidence that the Husband was initially supportive in her decision to train as a counsellor.  I find that it was a reasonable aspiration, but I accept entirely that it is not a career that is likely to lead to a significant income.  I consider her estimation of an income of between &#163;20 and 25,000 per annum is accurate and reasonable.  She did talk of a colleague who was still counselling at the age of 80 but it would not be reasonable of me to expect her to work beyond her 65<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.  In one sense, it is a matter for her.  By working, she will boost her income somewhat.  It will probably be good for her own health.  It will certainly be valuable to her children to see her working hard in a profession, which is in stark contrast to the position of their father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">There is no doubt that the position adopted by the Husband throughout this case has made the job of the court far more difficult.  It has not assisted him one iota.  I recognise that, by finding he lacks capacity to litigate, he has a defence to the abject failure to comply with court orders.  I have not, however, found that he lacks capacity to deal with his financial affairs.  By continuing to pay him vast sums of money, it is clear that the Trustees do not consider he lacks such capacity.  I am therefore entitled to be very critical of the way in which he has approached the provision of funds to his Wife and children.  Moreover, just because you lack litigation capacity, it does not excuse dreadfully offensive anti-Semitic rhetoric that may well constitute a criminal offence.   </p>

It is for Parliament to decide on the law of financial remedies following divorce, which it has done by passing the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and amending it on a number of occasions.  The courts merely apply and interpret the statutory provisions.  Up and down the land, spouses share, often equally, assets that have been generated by their efforts during the marriage.  Regularly this involves a party who has generated those assets sharing them with the spouse who has been the homemaker and child-carer.  In many other cases, claims are made against nonmatrimonial assets to cover needs. The vast majority of spouses divide their assets without complaint as they, like the courts, see it as fair.  The assets in this case were not generated by this Husband.  They are the product of the considerable efforts of his ancestors and their very astute advisers.  Indeed, so far as the Trust itself is concerned, it is not his asset, although he is a beneficiary.  I accept entirely that this makes the Trust dynastic.  The income, and the modest capital accrued from that income, are thus non-matrimonial assets but to say that the Wife has no entitlement to make a financial claim against those resources to cover her needs is bizarre, illogical and just plain wrong.    </p>

It has been said that it is up to the respondent to financial remedy litigation to open the cupboard door and show that the cupboard is bare.  If he or she does not do so, the court can draw the inference that the cupboard is not bare.  As explained in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Baker v Baker</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 829" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 829</ref>, this is not an improper reversal of the burden of proof.  It remains for the applicant to prove his or her case.  A failure by the respondent to discharge the duty of providing full and frank disclosure can, however, lead the court to draw inferences that are appropriate.  I will not be unfair to this Husband.  I do not propose to find that he has assets available to him about which we know nothing, although that is, of course, a possibility.  But I am going to proceed on the basis that the South American property is worth the figure that the Wife asserts and that the Husband retains every penny of the &#163;325,000 in the Monaco account at the time of his Form E and the &#163;723,018 forwarded to Monaco on his behalf last August.  He has, after all, had the additional sum of &#163;38,400 paid to him every month by the Trustees.  If he has not managed his expenditure within that figure, he has only himself to blame.   </p>

He told Holman J that the Trustees were distributing &#163;76,800 per month net to the Husband, albeit that orders in this case have directed half of that amount into the frozen C Hoare &amp; Co accounts. Mr K added that the occasional one-off distributions were designed to attempt to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">smooth out</span>&#8221; income.  In fact, it now appears that, in reality, the Trustees have really been distributing undrawn income that was, presumably, previously withheld in case income fell dramatically.

I accept that the Trustees did, initially, show a willingness to consider such an arrangement and that, on the face of it, the reasons for no longer being prepared to do so are not strong.  Nevertheless, I am clear that they did so in the context of the Husband&#8217;s July 2018 proposal.  When read carefully, this proposal was not an offer by the Husband for the Wife to have two properties. I find that he was referring to the position when the former matrimonial home was sold.  In any event, I am clearly of the view that it is for me to determine what is reasonable provision for the Wife and that, if this did include a London property, there would be much to be said in favour of it not being an Estate property given the open hostility of the Husband to any such provision for the Wife. </p>

The Husband has never had such a policy.  I have obviously been concerned about the Wife&#8217;s security, but it is clear to me that he would not cooperate in obtaining a medical report, which would be a fundamental requirement before securing such insurance.  I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing that I can do about this although it is something that I factor into my thinking when coming to my conclusions, particularly about the division of the sum of &#163;1.75 million frozen by order of this court.  Again, however, his failure to have life cover may well have a serious consequence for all three of his children if his share of the Trust assets attracts 40% Inheritance Tax without a policy being in place.  </p>

The Estate has been in existence for a long time.  It seems pretty clear that, over the years, fresh trusts have been settled prior to the existing ones vesting absolutely.  Mr K reminded me that this may not be possible any longer due to the 20% entry charge.  It may therefore be that CD, EF and GH receive a very significant sum outright at some point.  Mr Hagen put it to Mr K that it would be impossible to treat the other beneficiaries fairly if there was a capital distribution in favour of the Wife.  There are good reasons against such a capital distribution, but I agree with Mr K that this is not one of them.  It would be relatively easy to sell assets and then adjust the Husband&#8217;s share of the fund.  There would be CGT to pay on the sales but, as Mr K said, assets do get sold.      </p>

It would be monstrous if he refused to give that consent going forward.  Mr Cusworth satisfied me that the Husband is paying around &#163;3,000 per month to CD for her living expenses and rent.  The Fund pays an additional sum of &#163;15,000 to her at the Husband&#8217;s direction.   I do not believe it right for me to capitalise the school fees, but I am going to proceed on the basis that the Trust will pay out of the Husband&#8217;s income.  I very much hope there will not have to be a third-party debt order every term but, if there has to be such an order, there will be such an order and it is highly likely that the Husband will have to pay the costs on each such occasion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">I am also clear that I cannot capitalise the Husband&#8217;s child maintenance obligation.  Mr Marshall has drawn my attention to the child support regulations that make it clear that I have no jurisdiction to make child periodical payment orders, in the absence of consent to do so or a maximum assessment having been made.  There is no consent from the Husband although he cannot be criticised for that as he is entitled to deal with the matter via CMEC.  Equally, there is not a maximum assessment.  It follows that there is no jurisdiction to capitalise such maintenance as to do so would be to fly in the face of the child support legislation.  This does mean that the money that the Wife receives for the children will be modest.  This fact is partially mitigated by them being weekly boarders, but they still require a roof over their heads; clothing; holidays and the like.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">The last claim, other than for capitalised maintenance, is for the contingent litigation fund.  I recognise that such a fund was provided in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">AlKhatib v Masry</span> [2002] EWHC 108; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 1053" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 1053</ref> but that was a very different case to this as the father there had already abducted the children in breach of court orders to a non-Hague Convention country.  There was already a clear need for what was likely to be lengthy and costly litigation.  In this case, there has been no such litigation.  It is right that, when the Husband had solicitors, he did, on a couple of occasions, indicate an intention to make an application for an order that the children live with him, but he did not do so.  His more recent position has been the opposite, namely an intransigent opposition to litigation.  Indeed, I have found that he lacks capacity to litigate.  I am not aware of any decision in which a litigation fund has been established in a case where there is neither the immediate need for litigation nor has there been previous unjustified litigation.  I appreciate that, if there is Children Act litigation in the future, the Wife would be unlikely to satisfy the court that she should have legal fees funding given the award I am about to make in her favour.  Equally, I accept that costs orders are rare in Children Act litigation, but I am clear that this is a case where unjustified Children Act litigation most certainly could result in a costs order given the history of this matter.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">I realise that there is an argument that the emails already sent by the Husband to a significant number of different people, including National Newspapers, which are deeply offensive, may give grounds for proceedings for defamation if the Wife wished to do so.  I do not, however, take the view that it is my job to provide her with the costs to fund such litigation via the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  Costs tend to follow the event in such proceedings and it certainly cannot be said that the Husband is not able to pay a costs order if one is made against him.  It therefore follows that the claim in relation to a reversionary costs fund fails.  Indeed, I consider it would be an illegitimate extension of the existing law to permit such a claim in a case where there has been no Children Act litigation and none is immediately necessary.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">I now turn to the question of the Wife&#8217;s maintenance claim.  I have found her earning capacity to be between &#163;20,000 and &#163;25,000 per annum.  The standard of living during the marriage was very high.  The Husband has an extremely large income.  The marriage lasted thirteen years with approximately two prior years of cohabitation.  There were two children for whom the Wife has virtually sole responsibility.  This will continue for several more years.  She is already aged 49.  She gave up her career to look after the family.  All these factors point clearly to a substantial maintenance claim and a clear finding that she cannot adjust without undue hardship to the termination of that claim in the absence of a significant capital payment.  A clean break in this case is essential so her maintenance claim must be capitalised.  Having considered the authorities, I am clear that her entitlement is on a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> basis, namely for her actuarial life. The length of the marriage may be relevant to the question of quantum, if only to avoid the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duxbury</span> paradox that, the younger the applicant and the shorter the marriage, the higher the capitalisation figure.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.24in">What is a reasonable budget for her?  Mr Cusworth puts forward a figure of &#163;352,992 per annum net for life.  He does so almost entirely on the basis of the standard of living during the marriage.  I have already rejected the Wife&#8217;s claim for a second home in London.  Second, there were undoubtedly elements of reckless spending during the marriage that should not be allowed to inflate the income needs figure.  Of course, the Wife could spend in excess of &#163;300,000 per annum but I do not consider it would be reasonable for her to do so.  Indeed, I am not convinced she has been spending at that rate.  I accept that financing the former matrimonial home is expensive, but I do not accept that she needs &#163;30,000 per annum for domestic help, nor &#163;32,400 per annum for gardening.  If that was necessary to maintain the former matrimonial home, it would have to be sold in due course.   </p>

She needs to be careful, but it may be that her expenditure will be higher in the next few years and lower thereafter.  That is a matter for her.  I do not propose to reduce this figure by her earning capacity.  Her earnings will merely enable her to have a slightly higher standard of living, particularly holidays. </p>

The Husband has not cooperated.  He has made it extremely difficult for orders to be enforced against his income from Fund A.  I cannot ignore the sum of &#163;420,737 he spent on private jets shortly after the separation.  If he had cooperated and it was clear there would be no future difficulties in securing compliance with my order, I would have been sympathetic to releasing to him at least part of the sum of &#163;1.75 million so that he could put such sum together with his other funds to buy a new home.  But, as he has not cooperated and is highly unlikely to do so in the future, it is only right that the Wife should have the entirety of this sum as part payment of her lump sum.  It follows that, once paid, she will need a further sum of &#163;2,500,000 which will have to be paid over time. I consider a reasonable period of time to be five years.
