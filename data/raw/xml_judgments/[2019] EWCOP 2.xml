There is an ever-growing number of social media &#8216;apps&#8217; available for instant messaging and networking; among those most prominently referred to in these proceedings are Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facetime, Skype, Instagram, and Twitter, all of which are relatively easy and cheap (even free) to use.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The internet and associated social media networks are particularly important for people who have disabilities, and/or social communication problems.  They enable ready access to information and recreation, and create communities for those who are otherwise restricted in leaving their homes.  The internet and social media networks have generally served over the years to promote social inclusion, rather than exclusion; they offer disabled users opportunities and enhanced autonomy, they provide a means to express social identity, and they enable the learning of new skills, and the development of careers.  The importance of creating and maintaining ready access for the disabled to electronic and digital technology is well-recognised, and needs no amplification in this judgment; it is indeed identified as a <span style="font-style:italic">right</span> within the <span style="font-style:italic">United Nations</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (&#8216;UNCRPD&#8217;).  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-style:italic">Article 9</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">UNCRPD </span>requires states to take appropriate measures to enable those with disabilities to &#8220;live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life&#8230;.[including] access, on an equal basis with others, &#8230; to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems&#8221;.  There is a requirement on states to eliminate barriers to accessibility for the disabled to &#8220;information, communications and other services, including electronic services and emergency services&#8221;; <span style="font-style:italic">Article 21</span> (ibid.) provides a complementary provision, for persons with disabilities, to &#8220;exercise the right to freedom of expression and opinion, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas on an equal basis with others and through all forms of communication of their choice&#8221; by &#8220;encouraging the mass media, including providers of information through the Internet, to make their services accessible to persons with disabilities&#8221;. <span style="font-style:italic">Article 22</span> (ibid.) enshrines the right to privacy for the disabled.  While the <span style="font-style:italic">UNCRPD</span> remains currently an undomesticated international instrument, and therefore of no <span style="font-style:italic">direct</span> effect (see Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2005/71" uk:canonical="[2005] UKHL 71" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] UKHL 71</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 221" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 221</ref> at [27]), it nonetheless provides a useful framework to address the rights of persons with disabilities.  By ratifying the <span style="font-style:italic">UNCRPD</span> (as the UK has done) this jurisdiction has undertaken that, wherever possible, its laws will conform to the norms and values which the <span style="font-style:italic">UNCRPD</span> enshrines: <span style="font-style:italic">AH v West London MHT</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/aac/2011/74" uk:canonical="[2011] UKUT 74 (AAC)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKUT 74 (AAC)</ref>; [16] (See <span style="font-style:italic">R(Davey) v Oxfordshire CC &amp; others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/1308" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 1308" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 1308</ref> at [62], and <span style="font-style:italic">Mathieson v SS for Work and Pensions</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/47" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 WLR 3250" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 WLR 3250</ref> at [32]).

The internet is, or can be, a dangerous place; it has a dark side, where dehumanising and illegal material (including images, pseudo-images, videos, livestreaming and text) is all too readily accessible.  Internet abuse is common-place and is known to take many forms: bullying, harassment, child sexual abuse, sexual grooming, trafficking, trolling and the theft of personal identity among them. These activities thrive when they are left unchecked.  Ironically, dating &#8216;apps&#8217; and social media sites may feel safe to some because they pose no immediate threat of violence; however, it is well-recognised that the more insidious threats posed by sexual predators, and those who prey on the wider vulnerabilities of the young, the learning disabled, the needy and the incautious, are no less harmful (indeed they are potentially <span style="font-style:italic">more</span> harmful) at least in part because of their pervasive nature.  </p>

Online abuse of disabled people has become, and is, an issue of considerable and increasing national and international concern, and justified debate; &#8216;mate crime&#8217; &#8212; where internet users are befriended online with the intention exploiting them financially, physically or sexually &#8212; is a particular issue for adults with learning disabilities, as it is for children and other susceptible classes of internet user.  Social media and online dating sites have increased the exposure of vulnerable disabled people to those who might exploit them.  The learning disabled and other vulnerable users may readily find themselves the victims of such behaviours, which cause potentially <span style="color:#333333">lasting damage to their health.  </span>Those with learning disabilities may find themselves unwittingly initiating social media or internet activity which turns out to be harmful or hurtful to themselves or others; this activity is far less likely to be calculated than impulsive &#8211; indeed, many may be unaware of the consequences of their actions, confused, na&#239;ve, but perhaps surprisingly digitally savvy. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems to me that there are particular and unique characteristics of social media networking and internet use which distinguish it from other forms of contact and care; as I described above (see [4]), in the online environment there is significant scope for harassment, bullying, exposure to harmful content, sexual grooming, exploitation (in its many forms), encouragement of self-harm, access to dangerous individuals and/or information &#8211; all of which may not be so readily apparent if contact was in person.  The use of the internet and the use of social media are inextricably linked; the internet is the communication platform on which social media operates.  For present purposes, it does not make sense in my judgment to treat them as different things.  It would, in my judgment, be impractical and unnecessary to assess capacity separately in relation to using the internet for social communications as to using it for entertainment, education, relaxation, and/or for gathering information. </p>

Although counsel in this case prepared an &#8216;agreed&#8217; formula, I have had the benefit of wider argument on the issue in the two cases.  Critical to my assessment of capacity in this regard, and the issue on which focus has been brought in this hearing, is what should be the &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; which P needs to understand for the purposes of determining capacity to make a decision to use social media for the purposes of developing or maintaining connections with others (within the functionality / ability test).  I have been careful not to overload the test with peripheral detail, but to limit it to the &#8220;salient&#8221; factors (per <span style="font-style:italic">LBL v RYJ</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/2664" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 2664 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2664 (Fam)</ref> at [24], and <span style="font-style:italic">CC v KK &amp; STCC</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2012/2136" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCOP 2136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCOP 2136</ref> at [69]).

Counsel in this case cited from the Government Guidance on &#8216;Indecent Images of Children&#8217; (see (ii) above).  Whilst the Guidance does not refer to &#8216;looking at&#8217; illegal images as such, a person should know that entering into this territory is extremely risky and may easily lead a person into a form of offending. This piece of information (in [28](vi)) is obviously more directly relevant to general internet use rather than communications by social media, but it is relevant to social media use as well. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I should add that I heard argument on the issue of whether to include in the list of relevant information that internet use may have a psychologically harmful impact on the user.   It is widely known that internet-use can be addictive; accessing legal but extreme pornography, radicalisation or sites displaying inter-personal violence, for instance, could cause the viewer to develop distorted views of healthy human relationships, and can be compulsive.  Such sites could cause the viewer distress.  I take the view that many capacitous internet users do not specifically consider this risk, or if they do, they are indifferent to this risk.  I do not therefore regard it as appropriate to include this in the list of information relevant to the decision on a test of capacity under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As is apparent from this judgment, I received helpful evidence from Dr. Milnes.  He was of the view that A had only a partial understanding that information and images (including videos) which he shared on the internet or through social media could be shared more widely, including with people he didn&#8217;t know.  He had a &#8220;limited&#8221; understanding of privacy settings; he had only a partial understanding that people may be upset or offended by information shared online but was not able to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; that information.   He had a &#8220;poor&#8221; understanding of the risks which people might pose on line, and could not understand that people may disguise their identity to take advantage of him (&#8220;this was lacking, it <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> was&#8221;: &#8220;I asked [A] if he thought that a person who was nice on Facebook might not be a good person, after some thought he said &#8216;yes&#8217;.  I asked him why a bad person might appear to be nice on Facebook and he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;).   In his oral evidence, Dr. Milnes underlined that &#8220;[A] is very, very, trusting.  He is therefore easy to manipulate on the internet&#8230; He has no understanding of ulterior motives&#8221;.  While A understood that if he looked at or shared extremely rude or offensive images, messages or videos on line he may get into trouble with the police, he felt he was blameless as he was accessing this without meaning to do so; he was not able to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; the information that he may in fact be committing an offence in relation to this. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I am satisfied that the capacity assessment of A has been undertaken in an appropriate way by an experienced practitioner.  It reveals clearly A&#8217;s difficulty with flexible adaptive reasoning &#8211; that is, while in some respects he can repeat back what he has been told, he is unable to apply it to actual situations.  I am equally satisfied that over recent months and years a number of practicable steps (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref></span>) have been taken (and are still being taken) to help A to understand the issues, without success.  The brief summary of the relevant and powerful evidence in [31] above are sufficient to reveal the deficits in A&#8217;s ability to understand, and/or use or weigh the relevant evidence.  This is not just &#8216;unwise&#8217; behaviour.  In the circumstances, I have reached the conclusion (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>) that he lacks capacity to use the internet or social media. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In considering A&#8217;s best interests, I have had regard to the local authority&#8217;s draft &#8216;internet access and safety&#8217; care plan.  This provides for A to use one of the iPads owned by Dimensions for a limited period each day, under a degree of supervision; his phone contract is financially capped, and his mobile device does not have the capability to access the internet.   He has agreed that staff may check his mobile phone for messages on a daily basis to support him to deal with unwanted text messages, and to ensure that he is not engaging in inappropriate communications with others; the staff know that he is dextrous and canny in deleting his call and message history.  The staff working with A are attuned to ensure a high degree of vigilance around their own digital devices.  A is aware of this and has, I believe, accepted it.  This plan corresponds entirely with his best interests and I am happy to approve it. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There is no issue between the parties in this case that A retains capacity to decide on his residence (provided that the care package is the same in any available location) and in relation to consent to sexual relations, but lacks capacity to litigate, in relation to his care and support package and contact, and in the management of his property and finance.  The detailed and comprehensive report of Dr. Milnes covers the relevant ground with meticulous care, describing in each area where A has received, or is receiving, practicable help to enable him to make the relevant decisions.  No party requires me to set out the evidence or my conclusions in these respects in any greater detail.  The local authority&#8217;s care plans set out with commendable clarity the arrangements for his contact with his parents and others. </p>
