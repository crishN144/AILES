Mr and Mrs O, who claim to be her parents, were joined as parties by His Honour Judge Hayward Smith QC on 17 June 2011 and have been separately represented in these proceedings.

In the event, I decided that I required further evidence and that I would hand down a written judgment for consideration by the parties before a short hearing on Thursday 17 November to consider what orders should be made. I have not been asked to rule on threshold: to my mind it is amply made out for a number of reasons which I shall describe in this judgment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to the Os, E was born to Mrs O at the Revival Specialist Hospital and Maternity, (&#8220;the Clinic&#8221;), director Dr Odimba, situated about an hour&#8217;s drive outside Port Harcourt in Southern Nigeria, on 9 November 2010. Neither of those facts has been established to my satisfaction.  I have not seen E&#8217;s birth certificate:  it is with the police. I am told that it is not thought to be genuine. In any event a birth certificate is only as good as the information on which it has been obtained. For reasons which will appear from this judgment, I have good reasons to doubt the authenticity and accuracy of any information from the Clinic or about E&#8217;s birth. Dr Odimba has not been called to give evidence. I can place no weight on a letter and a document purporting to describe E&#8217;s birth dated August 2011 said to emanate from him. </p>

Mrs O did not say this, and nor was it said on her behalf. I am dealing with a civil case and the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  But I also direct myself that:</p>

Mr Naylor wished (i) to examine Mrs O&#8217;s perineum, to see whether there was any scar which  related to episiotomy or tear: this would have involved, perhaps, parting her thighs manually, but  not touching her genital area: if there had been any such scar this would be conclusive evidence of previous vaginal delivery. If there were no scar he would have (ii) inserted one finger to the knuckle to test the laxity or otherwise of the vaginal opening; and (iii) examined her cervix, which, if she had given birth within the last year, would be likely to have a specific appearance: this would have involved the insertion of a speculum.  In addition if she had been subjected to female &#8220;circumcision&#8221; (as some Nigerian women are) she could not have given birth vaginally without the performance of a procedure the results of which would have been obvious.

Some research indicates around 1 in 350 pregnancies in West Africa is in fact pseudocyesis. Women who suffer from this condition believe that they are pregnant, and have symptoms mimicking pregnancy: their abdomens may protrude and they describe experiencing sickness, food cravings, breast tenderness and enlargement, and other symptoms associated with pregnancy, and say that they experience foetal movements: they may have elevated levels of certain hormones. Some aspects of this case may point to pseudocyesis.

Mrs St Claire-Smith the current social worker expressed her concern in evidence as to what this would mean for E: what would she think if it were recognised, at least by Mr O, that he was not her father; who could be her father?  What would this mean about Mrs O as her mother?  What would she believe about the state of her parents&#8217; marriage?  What would be the effect on her of different beliefs in Mr and Mrs O?  Whether as a result of hearing this evidence or not,  in Mr O&#8217;s oral evidence it eventually became clear, although originally his views were very vaguely and tangentially expressed, that he believes that the DNA tests are wrong, or alternatively, that E is his child in some spiritual or metaphysical or perhaps supernatural sense in which DNA is irrelevant.</p>

But there were quite marked discrepancies between what Mrs O said to me and other records of what she has said.

There is a reference to an estimated conception date and delivery date, to the risk of threatened miscarriage due to bleeding, but no positive account of an examination leading to a diagnosis of pregnancy. There has been a difference of account from Mrs O as to whether the pregnancy was detected by a midwife or by a doctor in Nigeria. The notes, as I have said, are vague, and Mrs S said that she had not examined Mrs O for pregnancy and the notes were made by the doctor.  Mrs S said that the birth notes which she made were sent to lawyers. No further evidence has been produced as to how and when that might have been.

According to Mr O she was treated with traditional medicine: Mr and Mrs O have referred to her having undergone traditional rites which were said to be relevant to addressing the problems resulting from her having a pregnancy not detected on a scan. Also, Mr O&#8217;s father is a traditional herbal healer.  Mr O implies in his statement that there was something that the Clinic could do that UK hospitals could not. His evidence was extremely vague and he had to be pressed as to what he meant.  He denied that he thought that there had been no pregnancy until Mrs O was treated in Nigeria: although some of his previous evidence might have supported such a thought process.  He than said that the herbal treatment offered was to  help a baby that was too small to be detected to grow: that is of course a physical impossibility: Mr Naylor told me that scans will always detect a uterine pregnancy six weeks after the last menstruation: if the pregnancy is extra uterine it is incapable of natural delivery (and is medically very dangerous), and if ectopic will kill the mother unless surgically removed. </p>

I am also struck by the fact that if the results had been back on the 29 December 2010 (and there is no record of this) the hospital would have realised earlier that the lack of antibodies was highly anomalous. Furthermore Mrs O showed some ignorance of HIV mechanics: viz. her statement that her husband is not at any risk from her: and confusion between antibodies and viral load. I do not accept that she knew that the absence of antibodies as opposed to virus would be impossible if E were not her child.  It is also possible (although again not put to her) that she thought that she needed to present E for a blood test in order to demonstrate  that she did think that she was her child: just as she and Mr O thought it necessary to take a photographic record of many important events.

Some parts of Mrs O&#8217;s account are consistent with a false labour process: a drink of herbs to &#8216;induce labour&#8217; leading to internal pain, a midwife putting a hand inside her and a gush of fluid which she interpreted as her waters breaking, could have been created to deceive her: but the account is just as consistent with a complete fabrication. The Clinic plainly had dealings with Mrs O because they have supported her account. No motive has been given for Mrs S to lie and deceive Mrs O: this is not a case such as the Haringey case (<span style="font-style:italic">Haringey London Borough Council v C, E and another intervening </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 47" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 47</ref>) where Ryder J. was able to find that the ministry running the clinic had a vested interest in &#8216;miracle&#8217; births. I cannot find that there were significant financial arrangements (other than the &#163;250 which Mrs O said that she had paid): but I cannot find that there are not, and there must have been some incentive. The presence of Mrs O&#8217;s relative at the clinic with Mrs S when the doctor was not there points to some family connection and influence, and Mrs S gave evidence under her supervision.  All these factors tend to support the case that Mrs O is not an innocent dupe. Further than that I cannot go.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs O spoke lucidly and clearly if with a good deal of emotion and anger and with no sense that she was deluded. Much of her presentation is consistent with pseudocyesis: for instance her swollen abdomen, which is documented and of which there are a number of pictures, and which would probably be impossible to fake: but it is also consistent with simple weight gain. The picture from the medical records that she had presented herself as being pregnant consistently from July 2009 until November 2010 is also consistent with a pseudocyesis: but it may also be consistent with a consciously simulated pregnancy. Also, having heard Mr Naylor&#8217;s evidence Mrs O backtracked on crucial features of the case previously accepted or presented:  for instance denying that in February 2010 (at just about the time of E&#8217;s conception) she had told the doctor that she had felt the baby kicking: saying that he had suggested that to her, and her change of case about the ultrasounds in Nigeria.   This suggests to me that she was able to take a tactical and rational approach to the question of matters relating to pregnancy which may be inconsistent with a fixed false belief.  Also, as I have said above, Mr Naylor told me that in his experience of women with pseudocyesis he had never encountered a woman who had then claimed to give birth and produced a baby: although a common presentation was that a woman would be admitted to hospital claiming to be pregnant, and then once confronted with evidence that she was not pregnant, accuse the nurses of stealing her non-existent baby. On the other hand in the <span style="font-style:italic">Haringey </span>case Ryder J. did accept that the wife had been deceived into believing that she had given birth to three children, in rather similar circumstances to these and where Ryder J said that of that couple&#8217;s belief&#8230; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">faith is the answer to what medical science cannot or will not explain</span>&#8221;. </p>

Mrs O presented Dr Wright&#8217;s letter obtained by Mr O supporting her account that she did not know that she was pregnant at the time of her travel but that the pregnancy had been diagnosed in Nigeria and complications had developed which led to her having to delay her return beyond September 2010.  Mrs O denies that she gave this account to the ECO, but the ECO plainly needed to be satisfied as to why Mrs E had unexpectedly approached the High Commission immigration clearance for an unexpected child, and Mrs O&#8217;s account that she neither knew nor suspected that she was pregnant provides such an explanation. That account is inconsistent with the account given by her and Mr O in these proceedings that she believed that she was pregnant when she went to Nigeria.</p>

Mrs O is presently being treated at the Caldecott Clinic in London for HIV.  I do not have a report from that clinic.  She says that she has complied with her treatment regime and that her viral load is presently undetectable.  In her recent notes she is referred to as having a viral load of less than 40: which seems to support her account.  In the light of the history I have to be very cautious about accepting any account given to me by Mr and Mrs O, particularly with regard to health matters, but there is nothing to suggest that she is not telling the truth about this, and I got the impression that she is committed to her own treatment. Apart from a short period of time before she returned from Nigeria with E, when she ran out of drugs, she appears to the Caldecott to be compliant with her medication. I am prepared to accept that she had E tested at her instigation, for whatever reason.</p>

I regard their attitude to the risks as alarmingly cavalier.  If Mr O becomes infected and in particular if he does not get tested or obtain treatment this will have very significant ramifications for himself, his children, and perhaps for the public, depending on whether he is working in an &#8216;exposure prone&#8217; occupation, as his employment may be.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Ojituku specifically reminds me that I did not refer to a letter written by a firm of Nigerian solicitors on behalf of Mrs O dated 1 August 2011 and submitted during the trial.  It is very vague and allusive, and it does not assist me. I quote &#8220;this letter is inspired by the fact that her situation and predicament preceding her delivery may be novel to some persons outside our cultural community and/or society, but these situations however have been known and experienced in the cultural set-up where certain unwholesome things are practiced (sic). The family was therefore part of the initiative for Mrs O to come to Nigeria, given her experience and problems associated with the pregnancy, which can be resolved in the country. That if the situation was allowed to linger, it will have damaging effects on the family reputation if she was allowed to die in the process&#8230;&#8230; That her predicament and case is not unknown in this clime and solutions have in known cases been found for the women as in her own case.&#8221; I accept that one of the reasons given has also been a visit to Mr O&#8217;s family.</p>
