	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a father&#8217;s appeal against a decision of District Judge Aitken sitting in what was, at the time, the Principal Registry of the Family Division. In accordance with the then practice, the appeal was made to, and the hearing before me on 12 March 2014 took place in, the Family Division of the High Court. In accordance with articles 2 and 3(1) of The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/22" uk:canonical="2013 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Crime and Courts Act 2013</ref> (Family Court: Transitional and Saving Provision) Order 2014, SI 2014 No. 956, the proceedings have continued on and after 22 April 2014 in the Family Court as if they had been issued in that court. It is accordingly in the Family Court that I now sit to give judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal arises out of care proceedings relating to six children: ZZ born in 1997, AZ born in 2000, FA born in 2005, ARA born in 2006, KA born in 2008, and ASA born in 2010. The mother of all six children is ZN. The father of the four younger children is SA. The maternal grandparents are MN and SP. AM and RM are the maternal great uncle and great aunt. SS is a maternal cousin.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings commenced on 19 July 2012. The local authority&#8217;s &#8216;threshold&#8217; statement asserted that all six children had suffered significant harm. In support of that assertion the local authority relied on nine specific allegations. The first was that SA had assaulted the two elder children, ZZ and AZ: the next three were that SA had assaulted ZZ; the fifth was that ZN had failed to protect ZZ; the other four were that SA had assaulted ZN. The threshold statement concluded with the assertion that, as a consequence, all the children suffered significant emotional harm and were at risk of suffering physical and emotional harm. A fact finding hearing in relation to the nine specific allegations took place before District Judge Aitken over ten days in December 2012. The District Judge handed down a reserved judgment on 14 January 2013. She found all nine allegations proved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequently, ZN and ZZ purported to retract their complaints about SA. The question of what should be done came before the District Judge on 13 August 2013. SA sought a rehearing of the entire fact finding before a different judge. ZN sought a rehearing of the first four allegations before a different judge. The local authority accepted that certain findings should be discharged. The District Judge refused the applications for a rehearing, discharged certain of her findings, and gave directions for a final hearing on 30 September 2013 with a time estimate of five days. She refused SA&#8217;s application for permission to appeal.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my view the approach [of the family court to earlier findings] has three stages. Firstly the court considers whether it will permit any reconsideration or review of, or challenge to, the earlier finding (here referred to by the parents as a review). If it does the second and third stages relates to its approach to that exercise. The second stage relates to, and determines, the extent of the investigations and evidence concerning the review. The third stage is the hearing of the review and thus it is at this stage that the court decides the extent to which the earlier finding stands by applying the relevant test to the circumstances then found to exist.&#8221;</p>

In that case Hale J was concerned primarily with the first stage. She identified, pages 128-129, a number of factors to be borne in mind by the court when deciding whether or not to allow any issue of fact to be tried anew. I need not set them all out. For present purposes what is important is this:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Above all, the court is bound to want to consider whether there is any reason to think that a rehearing of the issue will result in any different finding from that in the earlier trial. By this I mean something more than the mere fact that different judges might on occasions reach different conclusions upon the same evidence &#8230; The court will want to know &#8230; whether there is any new evidence or information casting doubt upon the accuracy of the original findings.&#8221;</p>

Once that stage is passed, and the court is involved in evaluating the evidence itself, it would be wrong to afford some sort of priority to the evidence given and findings made at the earlier hearing that are to be considered within the review. Indeed it would be difficult to do so in any formal way. The starting point will be that a finding has been made. <span style="font-style:italic">In a case such as this, that result can only have occurred because there already exists &#8216;strong&#8217; evidence in support of it.

That of course is one extreme. The other extreme would be to reject the development absolutely and treat the previous finding of fact as incapable of being revisited. There is, between these two extremes, an obvious middle way, and that is to conduct the disposal hearing in such a way as to adopt the process of preliminary hearing as the foundation, and then to make such adjustments as are necessary to reflect subsequent developments rigorously tested through the process of examination-in-chief and cross examination. His Honour Judge Hamilton clearly suspected that there was no greater value in the fifth statement than in the earlier statements, and in that suspicion he may be right. But no complete conclusion can be reached without affording the mother the opportunity of explaining herself in the witness-box and answering as best she can the local authority&#8217;s response, namely, that the fifth statement is contradicted by or is inconsistent with, the medical evidence.&#8221;</p>

I must deal with the third stage in that the findings of the court are to be reconsidered because ZZ has retracted the allegations which he made against his stepfather, and his mother has retracted her allegations of domestic violence. The court must weigh up both of these retractions against the other evidence and there must be strong and cogent evidence that the original findings of the court are unsafe in order that the high test referred to above before findings can be set aside is passed.&#8221;</p>

If a rehearing has been ordered within the same proceedings, it seems to me that it is a complete free hearing. Of course, some of the evidence given before may be taken as read. It will not normally be necessary for every single aspect of the evidence at the first hearing to be revisited at the rehearing, but where there is new evidence &#8211; in this case alleged retractions of previous allegations &#8211; the court must look at all relevant material again in the light of the new evidence.&#8221;</p>

There is an <span style="font-style:italic">evidential </span>burden on those who seek to displace an earlier finding &#8211; in that sense they have to &#8216;make the running&#8217; &#8211; but the <span style="font-style:italic">legal </span>burden of proof remains throughout where it was at the outset. The judge has to consider the fresh evidence alongside the earlier material before coming to a conclusion in the light of the totality of the material before the court. I think that Charles J&#8217;s phrase &#8220;a high test&#8221; is best avoided at this as at previous stages. I can well understand why, in the particular circumstances of <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham (No 1)</span>, where there were concurrent findings of two High Court judges and the Court of Appeal, Charles J used those words, but to elevate them to a test &#8211; a legal principle &#8211; is unwarranted, unnecessary and potentially misleading. Indeed, I think with respect to Charles J that reference to &#8220;a high test&#8221; at the third stage is simply wrong, essentially for the reasons given by McFarlane J in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham (No 2) </span>at paras 42(iii) and 55.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current approach is to discourage their use except in a relatively limited group of cases: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S, Cambridgeshire County Council v PS and others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/25" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 25" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 25</ref>, paras 26-32. Ryder LJ made clear, para 29, that a split hearing in a care case will usually be appropriate only in either &#8220;the most simple cases where there [is] only one factual issue to be decided and where the threshold for jurisdiction in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> would not be satisfied if a finding could not be made&#8221; or &#8220;the most complex medical causation cases where death or very serious medical issues had arisen and where an accurate medical diagnosis was integral to the future care of the child.&#8221; He went on, &#8220;For almost all other cases, the procedure is inappropriate.&#8221; I agree. See also, to the same effect, <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Children, W &amp; T)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/638" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 638" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 638</ref>, para 71.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add only this. The benefit of hindsight is enormous, and the split hearing in the present case was directed at a time when such things were fashionable, but it might be thought that the present case stands as an object lesson in the perils of the split hearing. The risks to which Thorpe LI drew attention have in the present case borne spectacular fruit, to the disadvantage of everyone and the discredit of the system. Even if one leaves out of account the further delay generated by the appeal which is currently before me, the proceedings which had been launched in July 2012 were not concluded until October 2013. How much quicker and more smoothly everything would have gone if there had not been a split hearing.</p>
