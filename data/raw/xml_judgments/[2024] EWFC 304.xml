	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application for a parental order in relation to Z, age 1, provides an important cautionary reminder of the need for those embarking on surrogacy arrangements, particularly those that cross a number of different jurisdictions, to carefully consider, in advance, the arrangements, consequences and implications of that arrangement. This is not only for the adults involved but, more importantly, for any child born as a result of such an arrangement. The lack of care in some arrangements and the real risks it exposes the intended parents, surrogate and any child to is very concerning. It is hoped this judgment will provide a timely reminder of why such care is needed. Put simply, the applicants in this case ended up having little or no control as to where Z was born. Z was born in a jurisdiction where the applicants were informed surrogacy arrangements that involved same sex relationships, which A and B are in, are not permitted. Those basic facts alone demonstrate how difficult the position was. </p>

They chose what was called a &#8216;Premium Package&#8217; paying 64,000 EUR, that guarantees they would become parents.

The applicants said when they raised the issue about whether the contract should be clearer that the process would be taking place in Cyprus the agency assured them that was not necessary. In the agreement payment of 64,000 EUR was broken down as follows:  29,000 EUR was paid within 5 days of the agreement being signed;  15,000 EUR was due within five days of confirmation of the surrogate&#8217;s pregnancy by the agency; and 20.000 EUR was due within three days after the birth of the child. At the end of the agreement there was a list of what was included within the agency fees, which included the surrogate&#8217;s compensation as well as other expenses related to the surrogate.

The applicants state they were informed that delivery of the baby could take place in either Cyprus or Country W for an additional 14,000 EUR. According to the applicants the agency&#8217;s advice was Country W as it would be easier to obtain a passport for the child from Country C there, due to there being a Country C Embassy presence in Country W.

Within that total fee was a compensation element for X of 20,000 EUR. In fact, as explained by the applicants, the total sum they paid to the agency was 71,000 EUR. The exact sum paid to X remains unclear as some was paid directly to X in cash. X informed the Guardian that she had received between 17 &#8211; 19,000 EUR, which the applicants don&#8217;t take issue with although the agency had overall control of the payments. Ms O&#8217;Connell accepts an element of these payments do not relate to expenses reasonably incurred and submits this was an arrangement entered into with an experienced surrogate and there is no suggestion the applicants acted other than in good faith.  In those circumstances, she submits, the court can and should authorise any element of the payments unrelated to expenses.</p>

Albeit I accept much is with the benefit of hindsight it remains, in my judgment, an abdication of the most basic responsibility of intended parents in such circumstances not to have clarity about the essential information outlined in paragraph 2 and 4 above. In this case the consequences of the applicants behaviour resulted in them all being in a precarious legal position at the start of Z&#8217;s life. I agree with the Guardian it remains an unfathomable feature of this case why the applicants should undertake a surrogacy arrangement with an agency based in Country Y, when they knew it was a jurisdiction that did not support same sex relationships. It simply makes no sense.</p>

It is clear A has no intention of returning to live there. On the evidence he has firmly put his family roots down here in establishing his relationship with B here, making their home together here, entering into a civil partnership and jointly deciding to have a child which they intend to bring up here. A works here, pays taxes here and has purchased and established his family home here with B and Z, which would not be recognised in Country C. Other than the wider family who he visits in country C he retains no other ties there.

The statutory framework is clear as to what is required, namely consent that it is given freely, unconditionally and with full understanding. It is correct that the evidence suggests that at the time the surrogacy arrangement was entered into X may not have been clear that A and B were in a relationship however I accept the evidence that soon after the time Z was born she became aware of that. Through her continued contact with the applicants, her written consent and her discussion on two occasions with the Guardian it is clear she understands that the consent she is providing is to this court making a parental order in favour of both the applicants and she understands this will extinguish her legal relationship with Z in this jurisdiction. The combination of the written evidence and the contact the Guardian has had with X confirms, in my judgment, that the court can be satisfied in this case that the consent requirement is established.</p>

It is only necessary to give one example to illustrate the point, what would have been the legal position of the adults and Z if Z had required medium to long term medical treatment as a result of any complications during the birth in Country W?

If what the applicants say is correct the behaviour by the agency is equally to be deprecated but in the end it was always open to the applicants not to sign the various agreements. The black letter terms of the agreement with the agency left the applicants exposed in many ways as to uncertainty as to where the child was born and not being candid on the face of the agreement regarding the nature of their relationship. I agree with the Guardian that bearing in mind the circumstances in their respective jurisdictions of birth regarding same sex relationships it is inexplicable why they would enter into a surrogacy arrangement in a jurisdiction that holds the same views. It is likely A and X presented themselves to the authorities in Country W in a way that did not give the full picture, that appears to have been permitted or encouraged by the agency, and A is unlikely to have given a full account as to the circumstances of Z&#8217;s birth to Country C.</p>
