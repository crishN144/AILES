That was what she accepted. In fact, I found that she failed to protect him in the following ways: </p>

That psychological assessment was delayed as the mother experienced difficulties getting to </p>

In the meantime the mother had been referred to the Freedom Programme, which aims to assist the victims of domestic abuse to understand abusive relationships, to understand the effect of domestic violence on children and to guard against them in the future. Although the first meeting took place in early July it was not until October that further face-to-face meetings with the mother began. I shall return to this in due course. The local authority noted with concern that the mother had been seen with R3 in the vicinity of his home on 8 June 2019. The mother and R3 both deny they were together and this is an issue which I will need to determine. Over the summer the mother secured work and moved away from X. She continued to see both B and A although there were a number of missed contacts. She subsequently moved into lodgings. At some point I think in late October she injured herself at work and has been off work for four weeks. At about the same time the reflective face to face work in the Freedom Programme began and the mother also began to see a counsellor from an organisation called Free From Concern. Thus the mother has recently had fairly intensive &#8216;therapeutic&#8217; input in relation to issues connected with domestic abuse and the Findings I made. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal issue which remained to be resolved regarding these children at the commencement of this hearing was whether care and placement orders should be made in respect of B or whether she should live with either the first respondent mother or the R3, B&#8217;s father. However the mother accepted that she was not in a position to ask for the immediate return of B to her care at the conclusion of this hearing but rather submitted that the court ought to adjourn the final decision to enable her to progress her work with the Freedom Programme and with Free From Concern with a view to obtaining an updating report from the psychologist Dr B by March 2020 with the hearing being resumed as soon thereafter as possible in April or May. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Although in his statement dated 28 October 2019 R3 had put himself forward as a carer for B, in his Position Statement he did not pursue the placement of B with him but rather supported the placement of B with the mother and sought contact with her.  Shortly before he gave evidence his position changed again and he confirmed that in order to support a placement of B with the mother, he was willing to withdraw from B&#8217;s life and to forego the possibility of a time when he could have a relationship with her.  Although his position in relation to B&#8217;s care has altered his position in relation to the Findings that I made has remained steadfast; he does not accept any wrongdoing and maintains the position he did at the fact finding. Given the fact that he is currently in prison for further driving offences and does not accept the Findings made against him aspects of his change in position were no more than facing up to the inevitable.  </p>

Prior to the commencement of the hearing there remained an issue as to the extent of contact between the Mother and A both as to frequency and as to nature. However the mother accepted that her contact should take place fortnightly and should be supervised either in the family centre or more loosely in due course at a Children's Centre.  </p>

However ultimately the welfare of the child is paramount and if, contrary to the general principle, delay promotes the welfare of the child then delay will be the right course to pursue. Thus planned and purposeful delay which is likely to promote the welfare of the child should be pursued. On the other hand delay which is unlikely to promote the welfare of the child should not be. In cases such as this where the delay is linked to the viability of rehabilitation and where the consequences of proceeding immediately are so profound, involving care and placement for adoption, the court must also bear in mind the issue of proportionality. </p>

Conversely, if the option away from the parent is clearly more likely to promote the child&#8217;s welfare that will be a proportionate interference.   </p>

In her oral evidence she said that it was early days. There was no reason not to progress the Programme; the mother had attended 5/6 sessions so far and there were a further 5 to take place. She thought it was too soon to get a true picture of what impact the Programme had had so far there were several further areas to go into including looking at new relationships, safety planning and the effect of domestic abuse on children. She thought it would be another 4-6 months to do that work and to assess its impact. She said that the mother appeared very matter-of-fact about the abuse A had suffered and </p>

I am not sure what Ms S&#8217;s qualifications are. In her report she sets out the nature of the discussions that they have had in the four sessions which have been undertaken. Ms S says that the mother has appeared to be committed to the sessions and has done the homework which she has been asked to. She said she believes she is making good progress and is beginning to associate her memories and emotions around her own child hood and the impact of this on her own thoughts and behaviours. She says she agrees with Dr B that it will take a significant amount of sessions to fully explore and unravel the details and trauma not only that she has face but also that of her son and the implications of such. She said she is making very good progress. It seems clear from the description of the conversations that are being undertaken that this work is beginning to delve beneath the surface of the mother&#8217;s response to the Findings and is requiring her to engage at a deeper level with what happened and how she feels. The account of the mother&#8217;s emotions when she spoke of A in hospital calling for her and the extent of the distress which she displayed when recalling this was clearly genuine. However her answers to the questionnaire which is attached to the report are very limited indeed and show little real reflection. This may of course be a function of writing in English but it suggests that the views of both Dr B and Ms S that there is a lot of work to do is accurate. </p>

She gave quite lengthy oral evidence and did her best to give it in English. She has clearly tried to improve her English but occasionally had to resort to the interpreter. On occasions I was concerned about whether she fully understood or was simply agreeing with questions put but on clarifying with her she was clear that she did understand. In the main I believe she did understand what she was being asked and was able to give accurate answers. There were perhaps occasions when there was a degree of misunderstanding but overall although she was not giving evidence in her first language I&#8217;m satisfied that she was able to give evidence appropriately.</p>

She clearly has been able to make progress in her life in that she has obtained work and now obtained accommodation. She has managed to clear the majority of her debts. She has undertaken the Freedom Programme and has begun the reflection work with the EHW and in tandem with that has begun to work with Free From Concern. In her statement and in her evidence, she spoke about the process of undertaking the Freedom Programme work. In evidence she said she had been doing it after work and in her statement she said she had been completing it on her days off. She explained that the Lithuanian version seemed poorly translated and so she had completed the work in English. She said that when she finished it she told the social worker and asked to be sent the EHW&#8217;s number. Although only a small point she said she had lost the EHW&#8217;s number. As a result of the delay in completing the work and making contact with the EHW the reflective work did not start </p>

Given the discussions the mother had with the EHW and given the importance of  the EHW and the Programme I cannot understand why the mother did not prioritise retaining her number. It is also surprising that she did not contact the EHW when she realised the Lithuanian information was so poor that she needed to switch to doing it in English. The Programme could be completed as quickly as you wanted or over an extended period of time; it depended on the individual. The time that the mother took to complete it and her lack of engagement with the EHW in July, August and September suggest either that the mother was not prioritising it or she was finding it very difficult to engage with. No doubt her new job, moving home and maintaining some level of contact made it difficult but this work was critical to the mother's case for B to return and yet she was unable to commit sufficiently to it to move the process rapidly along. If she was finding it difficult to engage with, one might have expected her to contact the EHW. </p>

What was not very evident was an application of that theoretical knowledge to her own situation.  When she does relate it to her own situation I found it to be limited. She could identify that the R3 had been a drinker and had used abusive language for instance but she was unable to give any reason as to why he might have assaulted A.  She acknowledged that she had not told the EHW about the domestic violence in her first relationship. Given that domestic abuse was the central focus of the work with the EHW and this was reflective work the failure to mention it is hard to believe. Whilst I accept that she had told Dr B and that had the EHW had Dr B' report she could have explored this, one cannot avoid the fact that during counselling about domestic violence the mother failed to mention a domestically violent relationship. </p>

Similarly the mother&#8217;s evidence that she does not want her landlady to know she has children or that they are in care suggests the mother has not appreciated the benefits of being open with those who might be important in your life. Whilst it is only her landlady and a relatively recent one this is somebody who would potentially be part of her support network. Whilst on a human level the desire to keep such sensitive matters secret is understandable if she cannot talk about what has happened to her she is unlikely to build a support network.   </p>

Clearly the process of translating knowledge into understanding is something which may take time but I am concerned at the mother&#8217;s limited progress. Her demeanour while she gave evidence was very similar to how she gave evidence in May. In my judgment I noted that she appeared detached from events and that there did not appear to be an emotional connection. Dr B also noted this.  The same was evident now.  When she was asked about how A he had suffered she was very matter-of-fact in describing the injuries he had sustained but there was almost no connection with either the terror and pain he must have felt or with the fact that he had nearly died. The mother herself acknowledged that she could come across as unemotional but was unable to explain why that was or to get close to the emotions that might be expected to be invoked in relation to the terrible abuse that her son had suffered and which she had allowed to occur. When she was asked to reflect upon the judgment she was able to say that she had failed to protect A and went as far as to say that she hated what she had done and that she knew when </p>

This is nearly one year on from A nearly dying and some 13 months on from him having sustained fractured ribs and scapula. That it has taken this long for the mother to face up to the reality for her son troubles me greatly. Her detachment from her emotions seems likely to be highly relevant to her failure to protect. A capacity to distance herself from the real consequences for A of the behaviour of R3 goes a long way to explaining her inactivity. Had she really connected with the pain and terror that her son experienced when he was brutally assaulted by R3 in October 2018 it is hard to see how she would not have acted differently. By remaining detached from her son&#8217;s feelings she was able to &#8216;justify&#8217; remaining in the relationship. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the mother says in her statement and has said to Dr B and in evidence that she accepts the Findings that I made, when more closely examined this acceptance appears to have relatively shallow roots. When she was questioned about her failure to protect arising out of the assault on A in October she said that she had only been aware of R3 smacking A. This was far from a full acceptance of my finding that she believed that R3 had seriously assaulted A causing obvious injuries which she did not seek immediate medical treatment for but which led her to tell R3 social services were investigating in an attempt to curb his violence. When asked about why she thought he had been violent she did not focus on R3 but rather asked rhetorically what A had done to provoke this. Whilst I do not think she was blaming A it is troubling that even after having undergone the Freedom Programme and reflective sessions together with therapeutic sessions with Free From Concern, I am concerned that she was not able to identify R3 as the problem or articulate why he might have behaved that way notwithstanding that I had explored that in my judgment. Ultimately it seems to me that she has made only limited progress in understanding the Findings I made. I do not believe she has been able to get much beyond a simple acceptance that I have reached those conclusions. Converting those conclusions into something meaningful in terms of her understanding of what she did and didn&#8217;t do and being able to learn lessons or modify her behaviour are a long way away. As I said in my earlier judgment it may be that the mother fears being overwhelmed by the emotional consequences of fully engaging with the reality of what happened to her son and to her. One can envisage the terrible feelings of guilt, shame, anger and grief that must be the inevitable consequence of truly grappling with what happened but until she has the courage to embark on that process and to process those feelings I cannot see how she will truly understand what happened or will be able to start make the changes necessary to prevent it happening again. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Her evidence of why she had found R3 attractive was only a small example but it again illustrated the lack of progress she has made in understanding what might be important in a partner; particularly against the backdrop of what she has experienced. She told both the EHW and said in evidence that a strong man who could protect was what she had seen in R3. She did not attempt to explain how wrong she had been but appeared to be saying that these were still qualities along with provision of material gifts. Given that the Father has featured heavily in this litigation and has demonstrated the qualities of a good father her inability to identify what might be important in a future partner troubles me. Although she maintained that the man she has seen on four occasions is really no more than a friend and she does not see it as a relationship I do not believe that the EHW misinterpreted what the mother had said to her. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that this relationship is and always has been just friendship. In the context of the work the EHW is doing it is inconceivable that she would have misinterpreted what the mother said. I did not find the mother&#8217;s evidence on this point persuasive. Given that she had told Dr B she was not interested in a relationship her embarking on the first steps towards another relationship at this particular point in time points to an inability on the mother&#8217;s part to prioritise her therapy and her children. I appreciate her need for company and support but embarking on another relationship is unlikely to be the best way of achieving this. Her evidence that she knew little about the man&#8217;s background and did not want to know was so inconsistent with the lessons that she must be learning in the Freedom Programme that it suggested she had learnt nothing from that. </p>

His recent arrest on 31 October 2019 demonstrates there has been no change in his attitude. He purchased a car in June when he still had eight months of his ban to serve. He bought it to drive. His evidence about the insurance policy was as improbable as his evidence about the registration of the car. He plainly was dishonest with the insurance broker if indeed he did secure insurance. His denial of the Findings and his continuing willingness to ignore the law demonstrate he remains a significant risk to his daughter, the mother and probably any intimate partner or child. The additional consequence of his continuing disregard for the law and his dishonest evidence to me is that I can set relatively little store by his concession that if B is placed with the mother he will not seek contact. He plainly is attached to B and he became emotional when contemplating her and the end of their relationship. Whilst I am prepared to accept that in the court environment his concession is sincere I have no doubt that it would not survive very long in the real world once court proceedings ended. His impulsivity and complete disregard for the law leave me in no doubt that the intensity of his feelings for his daughter would override any order this court might make and that he would seek out contact with B were she in the care of the mother. I doubt that as things stand at the moment he would have much difficulty in tracking her down through the Lithuanian community. At present I doubt that the mother would be able to resist him and in any event there is every chance he would resort to violence in order to see B were she to do so. </p>

Even if she has properly separated her ability to remain separated remains untested. The underlying vulnerabilities that led to her failure to protect in the first place need to be tackled. Her low self-esteem, her social isolation, her detachment, her depression will make her vulnerable. Her poor engagement with the freedom programme and the early help worker and her non-attendance at contact show she is not connected to the services that could help and monitor her.

She has not been open; her failure to explain 8 June incident assuming they were together is a concern.  Her failure to tell the EHW about the abuse in her first relationship also supports the conclusion that the mother is only just beginning the journey.  She should be far longer down that path given the period between November and now. What is going to happen now which really changes it? The mother&#8217;s depression and lack of support network are weaknesses when one considers her resilience and ability to reject the father.

It is unlikely that her national and cultural heritage will be maintained. B has developed positive relationships with her parents through contact. Her principal attachment is to her foster carer. She is likely at this stage to be able to make a successful transition from her foster carer to an adoptive parent. The emotional wrench will be less from her parents than from her foster carer. She is likely to settle well at this stage as she has never lived with the mother or the father. As time passes and as she passes through further significant developmental stages adoption will become more difficult. At 18 months there will be fewer prospective adopters. She will have become more attached to her foster carers. She will be in a different developmental stage. The risk of a breakdown in the adoption will increase albeit she will still be below the age range where breakdown often occurs.  </p>

Ultimately his view was that the weight of the evidence suggested that the mother was only at the beginning of the process and that the outcome of the therapy could not be predicted with any confidence. In the absence of confidence in the mother being in a position within a few months to offer a realistic home for B which would be either low risk or risk free he concluded that an adjournment was not appropriate. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have found before neither the mother nor the R3 are reliable historians. R3 is clearly prepared to lie in order to protect his position. The mother also is at times prepared to suppress the truth or to lie in order to support her position. It is self-evident that ongoing contact between herself and the R3 is highly detrimental to her case. Given the Findings I made in May and the making of a non-molestation order this hardly needed to be emphasised. The history shows that even after serious assaults upon her and in circumstances where the mother had options to avoid the R3 she was unable so to do. This led to the assault on 20 March 2019. I acknowledge what Dr B says in his report about the mother&#8217;s vulnerability to ongoing contact and the difficulty that she would likely face in finally extricating herself from contact with the R3. I did not consider that either the mother or R3 were telling the truth about 8 June. The social worker&#8217;s evidence about it was clear and compelling. She has no reason to fabricate or to exaggerate what she saw. Her evidence had the ring of truth about it. The inference she drew that they were together is an entirely reasonable one and is consistent with both what I know about the mother&#8217;s inability to keep herself away from the R3 and with the opinion of Dr B. What precisely was the nature of the contact that took place between them on 8 June I cannot tell. It may have been that they bumped into each other or it may have been that the mother had visited the house that she used to share with the R3. Either way they were together on that day and the mother has not been able to tell the truth about it. Whilst it may be understandable in August that she could not tell the truth when she filed her statement it becomes less understandable when she has undergone the Freedom Programme, received the report of Dr B and had the benefit of therapy with Ms S. Her inability to tell the truth during this hearing is a powerful indicator of the lack of progress that she has made. She continues to prioritise protecting her position which is understandable in one sense but this fails to appreciate that in protecting her position she is prioritising her own agenda to seek B's return rather than prioritising the children&#8217;s need to be kept safe. In order to protect herself and the children from R3 or further abusive relationships she needs to be completely open with those who are seeking to assist her in order to make the changes that are necessary. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The social worker also gave evidence about the mother&#8217;s recently acquired phone which has a voicemail message which invites the caller to leave a message for &#8216;R3&#8217;. The mother gave evidence that her old number had been erroneously reassigned to another individual and hence her need to acquire a new number. The voicemail message is automated save for the name which is said in a woman&#8217;s voice. The social worker and the Guardian are concerned that this may indicate some continuing relationship or involvement between the mother and R3. The mother says that she acquired this phone from the market and that initially the voicemail did not contain any reference to &#8216;R3&#8217; she says it is only recently that it has started to refer to this. The evidence she gave on this I thought appeared to be spontaneous and genuine. If the phone had been obtained directly from R3 surely the message would have referred to &#8216;R3&#8217; from the beginning although of course it is conceivable that the mother for some inexplicable reason subsequently put his name on it or that somebody else managed to do so. Although it is hardly surprising that the local authority and the Guardian are concerned that this represents some form of ongoing liaison between the mother and the R3 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it does. The truth of how the R3&#8217;s name came to be referred to I cannot determine. </p>

The idea that he handed over a damaged phone to the seller of the vehicle who happened then to come across the mother&#8217;s name and entered it was frankly ludicrous. Far more likely that he provided the mother&#8217;s details rather than his own fearing that registering the car in the name of a person with an eight months period of disqualification still to serve might draw attention to him.

I concluded then that the full story was still not being told by her. No further significant revelations have been made by her since. Thereafter she was unable to break away from the R3 and he was present at her home on 18 January 2019 in breach of his bail conditions. Subsequently she stayed at his home in the period 15 to 20 March and suffered further violence at his hands-on 20 March 2019.  She also alleges he raped her. Subsequently on 8 June they were together for a purpose I cannot ascertain. At the present time I&#8217;m prepared to accept that the mother and the R3 are not and have not been in direct contact with each other for some time. However set against the backdrop of the toxic relationship that they were in and the mother&#8217;s previous inability to keep herself separate from the R3 notwithstanding police and social services involvement and the assistance of the courts I cannot be confident that the mother is now in a position </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">where she will remain separated from the R3. Incarceration and the build-up to this hearing have of course been powerful disincentives or barriers to any contact. The fact that the court was alerted to a possible ongoing relationship in June may also have played a role in them remaining separate. However the R3 appears to have a considerable power in respect of the mother. Her attitude to him ranges from saying that she hates him through to still appearing to value the early part of their relationship and identifying qualities in him which she still adheres to. It seems likely that she is making progress in extricating herself from the various psychological and physical ties that bind them but she is not there yet. Given his utter disregard for the law and his impulsivity and prioritisation of his needs I consider that there is a real risk in coming months that he will seek out the mother for his own purposes and that she will struggle to resist. </p>

In undertaking a holistic evaluation I take into account all of the evidence that I have read and in particular what I have set out in this judgment. I bear in mind the arguments addressed to me on behalf of all of the parties. In undertaking the holistic assessment the realistic options are care and placement orders or adjournment with the possibility of rehabilitation to the mother. No family placements are available and long-term foster care for a child of B's age is not realistic. </p>

Even allowing for linguistic difficulties and the difficulty in expressing oneself freely in court her level of detachment from the reality of what this amounted to A was worrying. Her detachment has been noted by Dr B, by the Guardian, by the social worker and by Ms S.

Whilst she has made some progress it has been far less significant than it ought to have been. She has maintained some association with the R3 at least up until 8 June and has not been open about it. Her engagement with the Freedom Programme was frankly poor in the early days. Giving all allowance for linguistic difficulties, the pressures of a new job and the emotional difficulty of addressing those difficult subjects her explanations for why it took from 4 July until early October to get to the stage of face-to-face meetings with  the EHW simply demonstrated a lack of commitment, assertiveness, prioritisation.

Her detachment is a significant component in this. I do not fully understand the reason for this detachment or lack of empathy for the children&#8217;s feelings. It may be the product of some life experiences or it may simply be an adopted mechanism the mother has learned in order to protect herself from distressing feelings. However it seems to me that the net result is that it means that she is not attuned to the children&#8217;s emotional needs. Her failure to protect A from July through to November, and in particular from October to November was in my view probably a product of her failing to have the emotional wherewithal or courage to face up to how it was for A. This was to prioritise her own position over A&#8217;s position. As a consequence he might have died.  It is in my view significant that in the year that has passed since she has been unable to come to terms with what happened to A. Her ability to recount the physical injuries to the exclusion of the emotional consequences for him is another demonstration of her lack of engagement with the Findings and what it really means. I find it hard to understand why she has not in the past year been agonising over how A must have felt and why she had not been able to protect him from it. Although in her statement she expresses the words and on 14 November with Ms S she began to get in touch with the reality of the situation the totality of her evidence makes it clear that this is at present a very shallow engagement and requires far far greater commitment by the mother to confront the negative consequences for her and the incredibly difficult emotions which must be faced up to in order to truly change her behaviour.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has addressed some of the multiplicity of factors which Dr B thought contributed to her failure to protect. She is more independent and stable financially and so not entirely reliant on the R3.  However her lack of assertiveness remains unchanged. She is not proactive but reactive. Although only a modest example she was unable to take steps to get herself to the first day of this hearing because she had not received an email from her solicitors; I hardly need to set out what she could have done if she were not so passive. Her support network remains extremely limited. She does not appear to have friends or family who can support her. The person with whom she lives-albeit only a landlady-does not know even that she has children. The one route which she has pursued in order to reduce her isolation appears to be the pursuit of a potential relationship. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that this was only a friendship. And yet she says she has not sought to find out anything about this individual or his past. How can she possibly protect the children if she knows nothing about an individual she is seeking to associate with.That she is still capable of saying this after having undertaken the Freedom Programme and various sessions of reflection work with the EHW and therapy with Ms S is troubling. The same is true in respect of her acceptance of the Findings and her true understanding of the meaning and effect of the Findings. Her insight into her own behaviour and the behaviour of others is still very limited. The extent to which she has begun to engage with any issues which arise out of her childhood and out of abusive relationships is so far limited. The Father said during the fact-finding hearing and I agreed with this, that there is much more to come from the mother in terms of what has happened to her over her life or within her relationship with the R3. So far little more has emerged from her. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The broad consensus from Dr B, the EHW, Ms S and the Guardian is that the process that the mother will need to undertake in order to attempt to get to grips with the underlying issues is several months upwards. Dr B is cautious about the prognosis. Ms S is more optimistic. The EHW is neutral. The evidence in relation to the mother&#8217;s engagement so far, her commitment to the process, her openness and the lack of progress from November to May and most importantly from May until now in her understanding suggest to me that she is truly only at the beginning of the process. It also seems to me that it is a process she will genuinely struggle to make progress with. It involves her confronting feelings which she has hidden from. In relation to A and in relation to abusive relationships this may have only lasted for a matter of months or years. However it also seems that she will need to contend with issues from her childhood which may have been present for years. I therefore conclude that the process of the mother tackling the emotional and psychological issues which she needs to in order to deal with her failure to protect and in order to build her resilience to the R3 or other potentially abusive relationships is likely to take a minimum of six months to a year. The relative lack of progress so far means that the outcome at six months or even a year is really impossible to predict. At present it seems to me that it is as possible in six months' time that the mother&#8217;s progress will have stalled as it will have made successful advances. I have to bear in mind that the recent developments take place in the shadow of an imminent court hearing with extensive input from her legal team and with the advantage of being off sick at work. There is a risk that away from the focus of an imminent hearing that the mother&#8217;s ability to prioritise this will slip and the pattern seen in July and August will re-emerge. I very much hope it will not and I very much hope that the mother will continue to make progress. However hope is not a solid foundation for adjourning these proceedings. </p>

Particularly delay which in reality is largely speculative in terms of where the mother will be in terms of her ability to protect in six months or a years' time. B has been with her foster carer for nearly a year and I do not think she should stay very much longer with an ever-developing attachment which will inevitably then come to an end. She needs a long-term placement and at the moment she has a very good prospect of making a successful transition to an adoptive placement. At present the mother does not present a realistic option. I do not consider that in six months' time there is a real probability of her then representing a realistic option. She may make limping progress. Less likely she may make very good progress.However in any future assessment of B&#8217;s welfare the risk of harm and the mother&#8217;s capability to protect her from harm will be the most prominent features given the severity of the risk to B having regard to what happened to A and the mother&#8217;s ability to protect her. The strength of all of the other factors which point to the benefits to B of the possibility of reunification with her birth family and everything that carries with it are of course significant. But they do not in my view get close to outweighing the risks of harm that currently exist and which in my view will endure for some considerable time to come. Only the most successful outcome in the therapy will ameliorate the very serious threats that B might potentially face if rehabilitated to her mother. </p>

None of this is her fault.However her failure to protect A, whatever its roots, is her ultimate responsibility. More importantly it has been her responsibility since November last year to seek to put herself in a position where she might resume care of her children. For reasons which I in part understand but in others I do not she has not been able to do this.  As the Guardian said, this is not about helping the mother it is about meeting B's welfare needs. Meeting the mother&#8217;s need for therapy leaves B in limbo with no real prospect of the delay leading to it being viable to place her with the mother on a permanent basis.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore agree with the submissions of the local authority and of the Guardian and I refuse the mother&#8217;s application for an adjournment of this hearing to enable the mother to undertake further work and to be further assessed by Dr B. Having ruled out adjournment as a realistic option the only remaining realistic option is for a care order on the basis of a plan for adoption. Making a care and placement order is both necessary and proportionate. I consider that B&#8217;s welfare requires that the mother&#8217;s consent be dispensed with. I do not need to dispense with R3&#8217;s consent as he does not have parental responsibility for B. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of A his placement with the Father has been successful. It will need to have continued support which can be provided through a supervision order. That will have to be kept under review depending on developments over coming months. A child arrangements order providing that he will live with his father is plainly in his paramount welfare interests. There is no other option for him but in any event his father represents a good home for him. Maintaining a relationship with his mother is also in his welfare interests provided that it is safe. Given the ongoing risk that the mother represents to him their time will have to be supervised or supported in the way proposed. Further attention will need to be paid to the wording of the conditions on a spending time with order in order to strike the right balance for A in order to maintain that relationship but also to ensure he is not exposed to unnecessary uncertainty if the mother is unable to maintain her commitment. </p>
