	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with three children, H who is three, A who is two and E who is one.  The mother, it is fair to say, has another child which is also subject to ongoing proceedings albeit not before this court.  Although mother successfully completed a residential placement, on 1 May 2024, that child, I believe, was removed following an incident involving her current partner, and has been placed with a family member.  The outcome for that child is yet to be determined.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two fathers for these children, Mr S is the father to A and E and Mr&#160;F is the father to H.  Neither have attended today or been represented or engaged in the proceedings.  Originally, there was a Mr G who was initially named, but incorrectly, on H's birth certificate.  I note, however, he did not wish to be assessed, in any event, as a potential carer.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The concerns in this case relate to mum's mental health, domestic abuse and the impact of mother's diagnosed learning needs on her capacity to parent leading to neglect.  Mother has a diagnosis of a learning disability, ADHD and Tourette's, she also has a diagnosis of emotional unstable personality disorder.  A previous cognitive assessment recommended the use of an intermediary and an advocate, which has been facilitated today.  A pre-proceedings assessment was negative, but it was not based on a PAMS assessment.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset, the mother sought the return of all the children to her care.  A number of alternative carers were put forward, however, none have materialised.  I am told the grandmother has withdrawn from the process and the maternal grandfather was assessed as negative, as was the paternal grandfather who withdrew and although a further paternal grandmother was positively assessed, this is the mother of Mr&#160;G, she herself later withdrew.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an order of 22 June last year, it recorded that Mr S, who is the father of E and A did not wish to be contacted any further.  It was also recorded in that order that Mr&#160;F was also served but wished to play no part.  Within that order, the court approved an independent social work assessment on the basis of the utilisation of the parent assess methodology in relation to the mother.  A subsequent report from the mother's GP confirms her mild learning disabilities, a diagnosis of emotional unstable personality disorder, ADHD, Tourette's and a history of self-harm.  As I indicated, a subsequent Communicourt report confirmed that she required an intermediary, and various recommendations were set out in the eventuality that she was required to give oral evidence in court.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A parenting assessment within these proceedings was undertaken of the mother and the mother's partner, Mr W.  Sadly, it was negative.  It concludes that a focus on developing the couple's parenting skills alone, would not be sufficient to enhance their parenting capacities to an acceptable standard.  Reunification, therefore, was considered not to be a viable option, and that a change in their parenting style would be a major challenge.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has a worrying history of entrenched behaviours and has not undertaken any meaningful therapy or training, she has complex mental health needs and the couple together would struggle to manage the stresses and strains of caring for three children.  It was also considered the mother lacked insight into her own needs, and the impact this has on her as a parent.  There were concerns as to the couple's ability to recognise risk, and any identified work would fall outside of the children's timescales.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority care plan is therefore one of adoption.  Mother, as the case developed, indicated that she opposed this option, she still wished to seek the return of the children but if not, she would prepared for them to remain in long-term foster care, preferably with the current foster carers.  The Guardian, at the outset, highlighted various issues in this case with regards to the parents learning difficulties, neglect, the mental health problems and emotional regulation, domestic abuse and parenting abilities.  Added to that, of course, was the fact that mother has given birth to another child who, at that time had been placed with the mother in a residential unit where it was noted the outcome, potentially, was finely balanced.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note various toxicology reports in relation to mother's partner, which was positive for cannabis from November to January 2024, but were negative from January to February 2024.  There was also passive exposure to amphetamines.  However, it did record excessive alcohol consumption from October to February 2024.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian noted the mother's mental health fluctuates and it is unlikely that she will be able to care for all four children, including the new baby.  Of course, if mother is unable to care for the children, she would seek for them to remain in foster care with their current carers.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian reports that all three children are thriving with their current foster carer, who is happy to become a long-term foster carer for them, but with fostering support.  She feels unable at this stage to accept a special guardianship order.  She has a good relationship with the mother, and would even consider caring for the new child if the mother was unable to do so.  The foster carer stated to the Guardian that she would be concerned if the children were separated on adoption.  The Guardian commented on the difficulties in the Family Finder being able to identify suitable families to take all three children within the West Midlands area.  She therefore indicates that she has reservations about adoption being the only available option in this case, and sought consideration for a long-term foster carer to be looked at as a viable option, given this is a tried and tested placement of the sibling group.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian was concerned that the local authority's evidence lacked analysis as to the disruption of removal and potential severing of sibling ties, when compared with the potential for long-term foster care with the current carers.  The Guardian noted that the foster carer is trained in attachment style parenting, and was concerned that adoption was being considered due solely to the age of the children themselves without proper analysis.  She mooted that long-term foster care with committed carers can offer the same level of stability and also a sense of belonging albeit not &#8216;legal belonging&#8217;.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Adoption would also mean the loss of a relationship with the mother and the new sibling, as well as the established relationship with the foster carer, and that local authority intrusion during the life of long-term foster care would be a small price to pay.  Accordingly, she does not accept that nothing else will do.  In light of that, the mother shifted her ground, and does not actively oppose the making of a care order, provided it is on the basis of long-term foster care with the current carers.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority issued their placement application and placement directions were given on 5 February 2024.  I noted in my order of 29 February of this year, that the issue in this case has now narrowed to that of placement by way of a care order under the plan of long-term foster care, or an application for a placement order by way of adoption.  The local authority pursues the placement order.  The mother and the Guardian proposes long-term foster carer and for the children to remain with their current carer.  Mother bravely accepts that she herself is not able to care for all three children.  She is wishing to concentrate her efforts on the new-born baby.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was also determined at that hearing that the mother would not give oral evidence at this hearing, and therefore full participation directions were not needed, although she has had the assistance of an intermediary and been represented by counsel.  It was confirmed that the issue in this case is a difference of opinion with regard to where the balance should be struck between the Guardian and the local authority, the mother supporting the Guardian's position.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I subsequently made directions for the final hearing to be in effect today, which it has, and there is an agreed threshold which I accept.  My judgment, therefore, will not deal specifically with whether threshold is crossed, it clearly has been and I make findings in accordance with that document.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a late twist in that as stated in the order of 17 May, a paternal grandmother re-entered the scene to seek to care for H, due to a change in her own personal circumstances since previously withdrawing from the full connected persons assessment.  A subsequent viability assessment which was obtained, was negative.  She does not seek to challenge that assessment. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read the statement of the Family Finder, who confirms that the children belong to a bonded sibling group and have lived with the foster care since 12 January last year.  Despite this, the current foster carer does not feel able to consider a special guardianship order or, indeed, any other kind of order.  In her own words, the Family Finder states the foster carer sees her position as a career.  She provided various data in relation to the availability for adopters in the local area for three or two children.  At the time of her report, there were no internal adopters for all three children.  However, an external search identified two.  In her report, she indicates it is difficult to forecast the likelihood of identifying an adopted family and the timescales but suggested timescales for a twelve-month search.  The alternative plan will be for them to remain in long-term foster care.</p>

They accept the children are settled in their current placement and have a lovely sibling bond.  However, long-term foster care would not meet the children's needs and therefore, prefer the permanency of an adoptive placement over long-term fostering.  There is a together and apart assessment which confirms the children's positive relationship with one another.  </p>

There may well be an exploration going forward in relation to sibling contact between them and the mother's other child, although at this stage they have not met.  It is intended that the placement of all three together is the ultimate goal.  However, if that was not achievable, the two older boys, H and A would be placed together, and that a dual placement perhaps should be looked at, following a search for all three together after a period of six months.  If the children were to be placed separately, sibling ties will need to be maintained.  </p>

She accepts that the decision of the court is a finely balanced one, however she remarks that if the foster carers had accepted a special guardianship order, as invited to do so, this hearing would not have proceeded on the basis of a contested hearing.  If a placement application is successful, she feels it is more likely than not that the children will be separated and if they are separated, there is no guarantee of ongoing sibling contact.  </p>

The local authority pursue placement as this, they say, provides the children with lifelong permanency and reflects their change of legal status without long-term intervention, insofar as the local authority would be involved if they were to remain looked after children and the stigma that attaches to this.  Such an order would feel different from the children's perspective to that of long-term foster carer and, of course, would extend into adulthood, and that the court should not deprive the children of a lifelong placement on the basis of a short period of time with the current carer.</p>

They are settled and thriving in their placement and invested in it.  The foster carer is fully committed to the placement long-term, which mitigates the risk of a placement breakdown.  The placement is tried and tested, the sibling bond is significant.  The local authority's plan will, more likely than not, lead to a separation of the siblings, which cannot be compensated through inter-sibling contact.  There will be, in essence, a triple whammy with regard to initial separation of the parents, the foster carers and potentially each other.  The decision of the court in this matter needs to be more nuanced and fact-specific.</p>

With regard to a placement search, the Guardian was of the view that the likelihood of placement altogether is slim.  This is based upon the local authority's own evidence and her own experience, and this is an important factor.  The court needs to have a degree of realism as to the likely outcome.  The current figures supplied by the local authority are based upon numerous inquiries, without detailed information and photos.  It was put to her that there may be more interest once that information is supplied, and the Guardian accepted that.  She accepted there is a possibility that they could be matched from the process and the ability for adopters seeking two children to have all three.  She regarded this however as vague, and she was not confident and felt that that view was speculative.</p>

She is of the view that long-term foster care can also provide a permanent family.  It was put to her that any loss sensed by the children can be mitigated by direct work, the foster carer would support the transition and is happy to remain in contact with the children, however, the Guardian is of the view that there is no guarantee that that will happen.  If the placement broke down, the children would experience loss.  The Guardian was of the view that the children are already integrated in the family.  </p>

Sibling contact will not make up for that loss, and there will also be the negative impact of separation from the foster carers.  Local authority intrusion is a small price to pay to maintain an otherwise positive placement.  Any stigma can be managed with an appropriately managed care plan, implemented so as to keep any intrusion into the children's lives to a minimum as they get older. </p>

Firstly, what is the likelihood of placing all three children together in an adoptive placement.  Secondly, the balancing of the risks of a move to such a placement which may never materialise and the uncertainty that that creates for the children and their carers versus remaining where they are in a tried and tested placement with committed carers via long-term foster care.  </p>

Clearly, it is not possible to predict a match with any degree of certainty within that timeframe.  I am concerned that, insofar as the local authority's evidence is concerned, that although the main goal is to keep these children together, this cannot be guaranteed and clearly, the matching process will be a fluid, dynamic and variable process.  As hinted at in the together and apart assessment, the local authority clearly cannot guarantee a change in the goalposts from a placement for all three children to that of a dual placement search within that process.  </p>

Yes, they are a lot and sometimes it is chaotic, but we have adapted, and love every minute of it.  We are never shy of admitting that it's hard work having three boys so close in age at one time.  However, we have worked hard as a family to have a routine that works for us, all in the chaos of having three toddlers.  From taking turns sleeping on their bedroom floor to ensure they would sleep, to where we are now and where they put themselves to bed, lie down and sleep for the night.  The boys are a part of our family life, and we love to include them in everything.  Not only do we have an amazing and solid bond with the boys, so does our son.  He sees them as his little brothers, and they all look up to him in awe, and just love being around him.  I don&#8217;t know what more I can say to prove our long-term commitment to the boys.  We love being their caregivers and providing them with all the love, safety and security they deserve.  We love our career as foster carers and support and training is what makes us know we will be able to provide the best care for them as they grow.  We know in our heart of hearts we would be there for the boys forever, not merely until eighteen or twenty-one, but forever.  Yes, we cannot predict the future or what is to come, however, we have overcome some of the biggest challenges since being foster carers, both within fostering and with our own son and together as a family, and remain not only together, but stronger.  We love these boys and want nothing but the best for them.  We hope to have the boys reunited as a sibling group, and after watching them grow and bond together for the last eighteen months has been incredible.  We believe that this is how it should remain."</p>

Equally, having formed a genuine love and attachment for these children, there may come a time when they do seek to obtain legal recognition under private law orders, so as to cement the children's relationship in their lives, and to obtain parental responsibility, without the continuation of the involvement of the local authority. </p>

The placement with the current carers is secure, a placement order, in her view, will potentially lead to these children not being placed together.  Although placing all three together is possible, it is likely to take up to twelve months, with slim chances of success, placing the children in statutory limbo.  Long-term foster care should not be undervalued, this too can provide a permanency solution.  The children are already integrated in the foster carer's family.  Both children and foster carers have invested in it.  The bond between the children is palpable and must be maintained.  The carers are committed.  Other than legal status, this placement ticks all the boxes and is supported by the mother.</p>

This placement has been tested over a prolonged period since January 2023.  It guarantees that the children will be placed together.  In every sense of the word, these foster carers have become &#8216;connected&#8217; to these children.

The positives of the current placement for these children should not, in my view, be sacrificed on the altar of adoption, purely because it is viewed as a more favourable permanency solution.  I accept the Guardian's argument that if these carers had signed up to a special guardianship order or other order, there would be no contentious issue in this matter.  In my view, the absence of such an order in itself is insufficient to rule out long-term foster care.  </p>

As against a move to an adoptive placement, which could ultimately lead to a triple whammy of separation from their mother and thereafter separation from their foster carer, with whom they have invested, and a very real possibility of separation from each other.  Sibling contact, in my view, would be a poor substitute, as well as the devastating effect on the current placement by leaving it in limbo whilst the searches are undertaken.</p>
