The Guardian is also concerned regarding a lack of information about what other more effective methods of behaviour management should be used and whether this placement is right for &#8216;U&#8217;. This Court shares those concerns.  Those significant concerns led the Guardian to make an application under Part 25 Family Procedure Rules for permission to obtain expert evidence from an independent Psychologist, necessary to assist the Court to resolve these proceedings justly. This Court agrees that such evidence is necessary. Separate directions have been made by the Court permitting the instruction of such expert. </span></p>
