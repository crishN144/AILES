	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Albert is said to suffer from vascular dementia and memory and cognitive impairment. He also suffers from poorly managed diabetes.  In December 2010 he was admitted to hospital; this is said to have been occasioned because of neglect of his care and health. In January 2011 he was discharged to BR Rehabilitation Centre for Dementia for a multidisciplinary assessment. There does not appear to have been any involvement from an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA), or a best interests meeting, at the stage at which his next placement was considered. </p>

Mr McKendrick has provided very clear and comprehensive submissions to which Mr Stringer has assented without demur. The Official Solicitor has indicated in correspondence that he did not feel it was necessary to comment on these submissions, although he was invited to do so by me. I am indebted to Mr McKendrick for his industry and make no secret of the fact that I have drawn heavily on his written work. </p>

The Court need not appoint P as a party and require P to have a litigation friend, albeit this may be desirable in some circumstances, as the statutory regime clearly anticipates P sometimes not being made a party (see for example COP rule 73 (4)).</p>

Properly understood the RPR may be a party in his or her own right and it is submitted by Mr McKendrick that the Court should not automatically appoint the detained person as the Applicant and end the role of the RPR (which appears often to take place in practice). I tend to agree. </p>
