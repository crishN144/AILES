	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This, my third judgment, in long running private law Children Act (CA) 1989 proceedings, concerns an eight-year-old boy M, the youngest of the three sons of MY (their mother and the Applicant) and FY (their father and the Respondent). Previous proceedings had also concerned the older two boys (L and K). K, L and M have dual British and Saudi Arabian nationality: they and their parents come from prominent and wealthy Saudi Arabian families. As the oldest K is now a young adult (he was born 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2000), and the middle child L, who was born 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2002, is now 17 years old, neither are the subject of these proceedings, but the youngest M, who was born 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2011, and is still only a child of eight, remains the subject of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> applications concerning the time he is to spend with his father FY.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">K, L and M all continue live with their mother MY in England following the orders made by this court dating back to 2013. The previous judgment dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016 was handed down after hearing an application by FY for contact: see <span style="font-style:italic">FY v MY &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2016/16" uk:canonical="[2016] EWFC 16" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWFC 16</ref> (23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2016). The consequential orders made in 2016 included an order that there was to be no direct contact between the children and their father, until therapeutic work had been undertaken by FY, as had been recommended by the court appointed expert, and an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> which was to remain in force until 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2018. On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by FY against that order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following the recommendations of the expert who reported to the court in 2016, FY had undertaken some work at the Anna Freud Centre before 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2019 when an independent social worker engaged by both parents (and approved by the court) Vivien Kenley provided a report which set out recommendations for L&#8217;s and M&#8217;s contact with their father which were duly followed by the parties and approved by this court in an order dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019. This judgment follows the hearing which took place at the end of February 2020 and was for the court to hear evidence and decide what orders should be made on MY&#8217;s <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> application dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019 to vary the existing child arrangements order so that M&#8217;s time with FY reverts to being supervised contact; and FY&#8217;s cross-application dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019 to enforce the existing child arrangements order and for overnight and holiday contact. The contact which had taken place was interrupted by an incident which took place on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 involving FY and all three of his sons in or just outside the lobby of the apartment building in which MY and her children live.

The facts that are decided by the court will form the basis for future contact between M and his father, and the further issues for determination at this hearing have been identified by counsel as whether FY breached his undertakings to the court as to his conduct during contact and whether MY failed to comply with the contact orders without reasonable excuse. The applications were considered by the court on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 when directions were made for Ms Kenley to file a further welfare report and the parties to file further statements. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">took place. Ms Kenley was to review the arrangements and send the parties a further report with her recommendations.  All contact arrangements were contingent on FY&#8217;s undertakings to the court which included his promises to the court not to raise his voice or use any form of physical chastisement during his contact with the children. The order expressly set out that FY understood that if he breached his undertakings the court would have the power to direct that contact return to being supervised or suspend it altogether. Any further applications were reserved to me with permission to either party to apply urgently on notice in the event of any breach. It is a matter of undisputed fact that MY had fully complied with the order until the incident on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.  </p>

K is over nineteen years old and has special needs as he has difficulty with auditory functioning, visualising, and verbalising, and has some autistic spectrum problems in social functioning. At present K makes his own arrangements to see FY but this has not been without its problems. K is still in full-time education attending Sixth Form College where he is retaking his GCSEs. L is now seventeen and he attends a day school in London. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD and regularly sees a psychologist in London. L&#8217;s dysfunctional and fractured relationship with FY remains very troubled and troubling. L last had specifically arranged contact with FY in 2018 and his current position is that does not want to see his father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">M is still at primary school and he attends a day prep school in central London. After contact was re-established M enjoyed seeing FY and the contact largely went well, until the incident on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019. Whatever occurred on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September (and I shall return to the incidents and events of that day below), it is clear that M is now confused and at best has mixed feelings about his father: FY accepts that M does not want to see him and has refused to do so. M, too, is seeing a child psychologist.       </p>

Before the judgment was handed down in 2016 the parties had separated and divorced. There were subsequently contested financial relief proceedings which MY successfully appealed. At the time of writing this judgment FY had remarried, divorced for a second time, and now has a young daughter (X) who lives with him in Dubai. K, L and M are aware of X but only K has met her. X has very limited contact with her mother who lives in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In my first judgment in 2013, the reasons for refusing FY&#8217;s application to relocate with K, L and M to Dubai were set out, and I made findings in respect of his abusive behaviour towards MY and the children and concluded that FY had demonstrated the controlling, abusive and manipulative behaviour as described in complaints made by both K and L who had also complained about their father&#8217;s aggressive and violent behaviour towards them and his inability to control his temper. Then, as now, the court recognises that this father loves his sons and that they love their father but sadly his contact with them has proved to be problematic and his relationship with them, and with L in particular, has been troubled and fractured. Sadly, as became plain after hearing his oral evidence, FY appeared to lay the blame for this dislocation and estrangement largely at the door of his teenage son L. As I have said above, after the hearing in 2013 contact was agreed between both parents, and notwithstanding the frequent difficulties that arose MY consistently supported contact. Unfortunately, there continued to be difficulties with contact from the outset and it was suspended in the months before the hearing took place in 2016 because of the risks to the wellbeing of the children. As a result the boys did not see their father in face to face contact for the seven months prior to that trial. FY&#8217;s contact with M did not resume until 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Kenley&#8217;s report containing her recommendations for the resumption of M&#8217;s contact with his father was dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2019: the court order, in which the court was pleased to encompass those recommendations, was dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020. Ms Kenley supported and observed contact and in her addendum report of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 she observed that the reports from FY, MY and M about M&#8217;s contact with his father were positive. The two visits that she had partially observed were also positive. MY was agreeable to an increase in contact when FY visited the UK in addition to collecting M from his school at least once during the week. MY had no issue about him attending M&#8217;s school functions. Nonetheless Ms Kenley considered that, at that time, it was too soon for M to go on holiday overseas with his father as FY had requested. M had told Ms Kenley that he did not want to stay overnight at his father's home. It was her view that overnight contact with FY would need to be built up gradually, observing that M had not slept away from home on his own. MY was prepared to consider M having overnight contact with his father in the future as long as his nanny accompanied him, provided as the contact continued to be positive.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Kenley said that in her opinion it was premature to consider M spending time overseas with FY and with a younger sister he does not know, even with his older brother K present. I pause to observe that although there are benefits for M in having the familiar presence of his older brother during contact with FY it is categorically not the responsibility of this vulnerable young man, or indeed any sibling to support contact or to ensure that it goes smoothly, that burden lies with the child&#8217;s parent, thus the suggestion that M should be accompanied by his nanny. Ms Kenley went on to say that MY agreed with extending the duration of FY&#8217;s contact and to his collecting M from school. In the opinion of Ms Kenley, about six hours with FY on one or two days of FY&#8217;s monthly visits [to the UK] was appropriate and that MY was amenable to this recommendation. Indeed, the evidence before the court was clear, including that of Ms Kenley, that although FY assiduously took up the contact that had been arranged he often if not invariably reduced the length of time M spent with him. There is no criticism of this, but it is an indication of the length of contact that is best managed by father and son and is evidence in support of Ms Kenley&#8217;s recommendations.     </p>

On the morning of the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 FY took M to school without incident and later that day he collected M and took him home, after which he met up with K and took him to the barber&#8217;s.

M joined in the call and it became apparent that FY would be dropping K off at their apartment block.  </p>

The letter continued that they would be making an urgent application to the court, subject to my availability, and that Ms Kenley remained free to supervise the proposed dinner the next day. Given that Ms Kenley told me in her oral evidence (which I accept) that she had emphasised to MY the need to put M&#8217;s safety and welfare first, and that Ms Kenley had made herself available to be there so that contact could take place, I cannot and do not find that MY acted without reasonable excuse and find instead that her conduct was appropriate given the advice she received. Notwithstanding the order of this court the decisions MY took as a parent and principal carer of this young boy, at that time, were child-centred and entirely congruent with M&#8217;s welfare, and provided for an opportunity for FY to see his son in manner that would have provided reassurance to the child himself, an opportunity FY chose to refuse.

It was Ms Kenley&#8217;s firmly expressed view that MY had not and was not seeking to manipulate or frustrate her sons&#8217; contact with their father, and that Ms Kenley had found her to be remarkably relaxed and flexible about contact. When this opinion is contrasted with FY&#8217;s inability to accept any real responsibility for M&#8217;s reaction to contact and for L&#8217;s estrangement from him, indeed the way FY put his case about L gave cause for concern as he not only implicitly but at times explicitly sought to put the blame on L, it becomes clearer whom is the more responsible parent, and who can put their child&#8217;s needs first before their own hubris. </p>

While K sees his father regularly, there is little doubt that he is the more biddable and amenable of the two older boys and is less likely to challenge or disobey his father. The fact is FY appears to have been unable or unwilling to build a healthy relationship with L and sees little of him. FY has chosen to take offence at the attempts made by L to stand up for himself, behaviour that is wholly predictable and understandable in any adolescent. It is more likely than not that M is affected by his brothers&#8217; relationships with FY and that will have contributed to his reluctance to see FY at all. It would be cause for concern if that were not the case, as it would belie the affectionate inter-sibling relationship that can be seen in CCTV images which starts with L and M playing together outside their home in London, with L taking a nurturing and caring role with his younger brother.</p>

The events took place on the corner of two streets, where the mansion block is situated and in the lobby of the block where MY and the boys live. There were images available from several different CCTV cameras, one inside and the others outside the building. During the incident, which occurred in the early evening it started to rain and began to get dark. </p>

L told his mother that FY tried to speak to him and to hug him and that then FY had tugged and pulled him. As this was happening they had entered the lobby. L told his mother that he had then asked FY to leave him alone, but he refused and that then FY cornered him by the lift (off camera) and was pushing him and flicking at his face with his fingers and had threatened to slap him. In the altercation FY had pulled L towards him and would not let go. The CCTV shows M becoming distressed and running upstairs towards his home, L, apparently at FY&#8217;s bidding, followed M and brought him downstairs where he could be seen sitting on his father&#8217;s knees on a chair in the lobby. The group then went outside towards FY&#8217;s car and K and M got into the car. By this time it was raining quite heavily and L remained on the pavement. FY can be seen gesticulating at L. L told his mother that FY had touched him and then pushed the car door into L&#8217;s chest. L accepted that he was angry and verbally aggressive but says that FY had kept telling him to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fuck off.&#8221;</span> The scene was witnessed by K and M, who were both upset by it, as there is little doubt that M had run upstairs because he was upset earlier.

There is no evidence to support any suggestion that MY deliberately withheld CCTV images of scenes that supported FY&#8217;s case. As soon as the full or further CCTV images of the incident were requested, MY had taken steps to obtain it and provide it to FY. It is MY&#8217;s case that what can been seen from the CCTV supports the account given to her by her sons, but as I have already noted, the imagery does not cover everything that happened and there are no images of what occurred by the lift or of how the incident ended. The court was provided with a schedule identifying and describing what can be seen. It is FY&#8217;s case is that the CCTV images support his case.

I keep in mind, as I was urged to do by counsel for FY, that the reported speech of the parties&#8217; children requires the court to exercise great caution, nonetheless the fact that they said what they did to their mother reflects the import of the incident of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September on them and is indicative, at the very least, of events which caused them all distress and that was an unpleasant experience for all concerned. FY himself, in his evidence to the court, accepted that he had not handled the incident as well as he might have done. Thus, even on FY&#8217;s case, to quote the document prepared on his own behalf, this was a distressing incident. The document then goes on to lay the blame firmly at the feet of L by saying it was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;distressing because of [L]&#8217;s behaviour, which, it appears admitted by all, was bad, which would have impacted on all three children.&#8221;  </span></p>

I found Ms Kenley&#8217;s evidence about the video, particularly the last ten minutes in the rain at FY&#8217;s car parked by the kerb on which L was left standing. During this time, it is MY&#8217;s evidence, while on the phone to L, that she could hear confusion, a lot of noise and shouting in car, shouting which included FY.

There was, on any view conflict and confusion, and it is more likely than not that there had been shouting and raised voices, including from FY.

I accept that FY would have been saddened by the situation, but there can be little doubt that he was also angry. FY has sought to blame his adolescent son for what happened and accuses him of lying.

Furthermore, although I accept that M has said different things at different times about seeing his father immediately after the incident, including telling FY he wanted to see him, this latter was in the context of M&#8217;s birthday in early October and unsurprising, as observed by Ms Kenley in her oral evidence, when FY was promising more presents and treats. It strongly brought to mind FY&#8217;s similar conduct in the past when offering the inducement or promise of a Segway to K. It is of concern that seemingly FY is still unable to connect his actions and promises with anything his young son might say, still less see that it would be likely to be putting pressure on the boy. It is, sadly, irresponsible behaviour. Counsel points to other incidents where M has reacted in a negative way in respect of FY and has said things that seem to reflect badly on FY, such as his<span style="font-weight:bold"/>complaint about FY <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;shouting in [his] ear and pointing&#8221;</span> at the bowling alley, when Ms Kenley had seen that as the respondent being helpful and encouraging. Pausing to reflect that Ms Kenley&#8217;s view or impression of what happened was hers and not the child&#8217;s, it is nonetheless disturbing that M&#8217;s reaction to FY has deteriorated to the extent that he was at the time of the hearing refusing to see FY at all.</p>

As FY says, L as the big brother is an influence on M, which FY says is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to say the least, not a wholly positive one&#8221;</span>.  FY seeks to rely on the fact MY has told Ms Kenley on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2020 that she thought that some of M's statements such as his father lying or K driving being &#8220;stupid&#8221; were M repeating comments that he had overheard said by L. It would be surprising, and indeed more than a little concerning, if the brothers did not have an effect on each other, and had demonstrated fraternal loyalty, but it is far from clear, based on the evidence before me, that L is overtly influencing M against FY. Of concern is the fact that once more there is little or no evidence of FY being able to reflect on any negative effect he may have on his sons and the effects and consequences of his actions towards L, in particular, in the past. While is clear that L is angry with his father and feels hurt by him it is, I find, a striking piece of evidence that he was able to put M&#8217;s wishes first when he contacted FY on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 and then took M downstairs to wait for their father. I was equally struck by the way L played with his little brother and kept him safe while they were waiting for FY on the pavement outside their home. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having considered all the evidence, as set out above, it has become apparent that FY completely mismanaged the situation and lost control of it, becoming frustrated and angry, particularly with L. I do not doubt that FY was genuinely pleased to see L and had tried to embrace him hoping for the hug to be returned and for a reconciliation, in this he was either na&#239;ve or deliberately blind to the hurt and emotional distress that he has repeatedly caused his son in the past. FY&#8217;s disappointment in what he perceived to be L&#8217;s rejection of his attempt to proffer some physical affection is a manifestation of FY&#8217;s lack of empathy with his child, his refusal or inability to accept and recognise the extent of his responsibility for L&#8217;s estrangement from his father. That FY tried to hug L without first considering, let alone finding out, whether such physical attention was welcomed was insensitive at best, one does not force an embrace on anyone-elsewhere it would be considered an assault. Moreover, his action was a further example of FY&#8217;s overwhelming need to put his own feelings first, to be in control and to control the actions and reactions of his children. I find that, once again, for the reasons set out in the review of the evidence above FY, was physically aggressive to L by pushing or attempting to engage physically with him near the lobby door. I find it more likely than not that FY was angered by what he considered to be an unwarranted rejection, regardless of whether or not L wanted him to, and that then he flicked or fingered L&#8217;s face in the lobby near the lift when remonstrating with his son.  </p>

The scene in the car and at the car door seemed to last a very long time to those watching the CCTV images, it would have seemed even longer to M. I find that FY, in his determination to take M with him, allowed the situation to degenerate so that M was witness to his older brother standing in the pouring rain while FY tried to get MY to agree to further contact over the phone with all the boys present. The confused, chaotic, and noisy scene would have caused M further distress and anxiety and, inevitably, caused trauma in a young boy. Taken as a whole these were, from a child&#8217;s point of view very frightening events demonstrating that contrary to his protestations when giving evidence, FY has not changed sufficiently to enable him to put M first and before his own feelings and wishes.  </p>

FY accepts little or no responsibility for what happened and has attempted to place the burden of responsibility largely on the seventeen-year-old L. There can be little wonder that this young man continues to have emotional difficulties. Despite the fact that FY has apparently breached his own undertakings to the court, FY has sought not only to blame L but to have MY subject to censure for trying to arrange supported contact with M in the aftermath of these distressing events. Moreover FY, by raising his voice and in the way he behaved towards L, has breached his undertakings not to raise his voice or use any form of physical chastisement during his contact with the children. It is submitted on behalf of MY that in doing so FY has reverted to the type of controlling and abusive behaviour that the court has previously made findings about.

The evidence of that significant emotional harm can be seen at school and in the descriptions of M&#8217;s distress and confusion as described by Ms Kenley. Ms Kenley&#8217;s real concern about M&#8217;s mixed emotions was dismissed by FY in his evidence, but her concern was such that she expressed relief that M was receiving therapeutic help. His rejection of his father is further evidence of emotional trauma and harm he has suffered. Sadly, it remains clear that FY&#8217;s understanding of his boys&#8217; emotional needs remains limited, curtailed by his own views, emotional needs and feeling about what he sees as his role as their father. Although he had some limited therapeutic assistance in 5 sessions at the Anna Freud Centre in 2016, it is some years ago since it took place and appears to have had little long-term or qualitative impact. FY has failed to demonstrate any insight into the effects and the impact of his behaviour, his words, and his actions, on all three boys. By failing to accept, or seemingly even to comprehend, that as the parent his is the ultimate responsibility for what occurred on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, there must be concern about his ability to control himself and take his full share of responsibility, as a parent, in future.  </p>

M&#8217;s rejection of his father, and the fact that the deterioration of achievements at school is demonstrably linked to contact, along with the emotional confusion is all evidence of the distress and harm caused to M by FY.  Ms Kenley has recommended that FY should undertake a forensic psychiatric assessment, and the court agrees that some professional assessment is necessary to enable the appropriate assistance to be put in place to ensure that there is not further repetition of the events which took place in September 2019 and in the past.  </p>

I have no doubt that FY loves his sons, and that they and he wish to see each other, but there must be real concern that for M (who is still a young boy) there should be not be a repetition of the estrangement between L and his father. MY has repeatedly shown her commitment to her boys seeing their father, and any conditions she has sought to impose over the years have been aimed, solely, at ensuring the safety of her children. There needs to be professional intervention and support with two principal goals, prerequisites in providing for a safe and nurturing environment in which contact can proceed and progress: to enable FY to understand and think about the situation and paternal relationship from the point of view of M in particular, and each his children; and, secondly, to enable FY to control himself and his own emotions and anger, rather than trying to control his children or others. Such intervention is likely to include a risk assessment of FY.    </p>
