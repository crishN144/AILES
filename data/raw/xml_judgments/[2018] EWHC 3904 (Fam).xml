Louisa agreed and the decree absolute was granted on 10 July 2013.  Matt and Ruby married the following month. </p>

His widow, obviously, was in possession of the vast majority of the assets which might potentially have comprised his estate and it seems as if at that point then, discussions ensued about Louisa&#8217;s potential claim and that of the children.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have not immersed myself in the to-ing and fro-ing because I think, as sometimes happens, the issuing of the claim itself was deferred by agreement between the parties, but it certainly became apparent that the claim on behalf of the children, was likely to be hotly contested in certain aspects.  Firstly, Matt&#8217;s widow indicated that she did not accept that Matt was domiciled in the UK.  Domicile is of course a precondition for a claim to be brought under the Inheritance Act and, without an established domicile, any claim would potentially have had to be brought in the USA in the state of Pennsylvania, which I believe was Matt&#8217;s domicile of origin.  Therefore, although it appears that Matt had made his home in the UK since around 2001 and for 15-plus years, there was a live issue as to domicile, in particular, his widow asserted that they had brought a property in the Bahamas, which indeed they had and that their plans were to leave the UK, notwithstanding I think, that the widow and her children had a home in England, and to relocate to either Barbados or to the United States, so that was the first hurdle that was thrown up. </p>

	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Perhaps more significantly, and indeed more surprisingly, the widow asserted that the payment into her account of the proceeds of sale of Greenfields was an outright gift to her, and that Matt had not intended to retain any interest in that sum.  Therefore, in order to bring any value in to the estate, Louisa and the children would have to demonstrate that that was not a gift but rather that Matt&#8217;s widow held the sum as a bare trustee for Matt as the beneficial owner of it. </p>

	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Further difficulties emerged, in particular in relation to the value of the estate because as a United States citizen, Matt had an obligation to pay tax to the IRS and it appeared that since he had left the US he had almost certainly not done that, so there was a potential claim that the IRS might have brought in respect of unpaid income tax.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There was also the issue of potential tax consequences, either of the disposal of Matt&#8217;s shares in Greenfields Technologies or indeed, gift tax issues, if part or the whole of the &#163;5 million plus had been a gift. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Thus, those advising Louisa and the children had to confront a number of legal and accountancy issues in valuing the claim.  I should also note that there were two properties </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">also in London, one of which, I think, the larger, was 99% held in Louisa&#8217;s name with a value of about &#163;600,000-700,000 and Matt only retaining a 1% share in that and there was another property which was, I think, was held as tenants in common on a 50/50 basis.  In relation to the 99% held property, there was of course, potentially an argument open to the estate that in fact although expressed at being owned 99% by Louisa, that in fact it was owned 50/50 as it was, I think, the former matrimonial home. </p>

	  <num>25.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Therefore, there were a series of obstacles facing the claim.  Depending on whether those hurdles were surmounted or whether they tripped the claimants, they would potentially have significant consequences to the sums that they might recover.  If the Court concluded that Matt was in fact, not domiciled in the UK, no claim would have been possible at all.  Louisa may have had her own claims in respect of the properties under the Trusts of Land Act, but in terms of the children&#8217;s claims under the Inheritance Act, they would not have been capable of being pursued in this jurisdiction, but rather they would have had to contemplate a claim in Pennsylvania. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#163;5 million plus had in fact been an outright gift to her, that would have rendered the estate essentially insolvent, such that there would have been nothing to distribute to the children from the estate, or nothing of any significance. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There were other issues to do with accounting, to do with how much money of the &#163;5 million had in fact already been spent in meeting Matt and his widow&#8217;s and his step-children&#8217;s living expenses, either prior to his death or subsequently, such that the net value of the estate was unclear. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_28">
	  <num>28.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Thus, negotiations led to a compromise.  The proposed distribution is as follows:  Ruby will  make a payment on behalf of the estate of &#163;950,000 within I think, 28 days of the order being approved, (if it is approved) to the second and third claimants, thus Alexander and Julian would receive &#163;475,000 each, in respect of their claims.  This compares with I think, the maximum sum that they might have received if the &#163;5 million plus was held not to be a gift, the maximum that they might have received would have been &#163;1.346 million between them.  However, at the bottom end of the scale if domicile was not established or if the &#163;5 million were an outright gift the sum would be zero, so &#163;950,000 is a significant percentage of their best-valued claim.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In addition, and this, I think, is in respect of the first claimant, Louisa, she will receive not only the half-share of the property, which is owned 50-50 with Matt, but will also receive the other 1% of the Burntwood property and will not face the potential argument by the estate to seek to recoup another 49% of that property.  That property is worth, I think between &#163;600,000-700,000 so Louisa will receive that outright, together with, I think a total sum of &#163;300,000 in respect of the other London property. </p>

Perhaps the difference in property prices between Australia and London and the sums they get will enable them to get that massive, amazing house that their dad wanted them to have. </p>

These children have lost their uncle, their father, and their grandfather all in fairly quick succession, as well as, I believe as their paternal grandmother and grandfather.  The closest relatives they have are their mother and their grandmother and, against that backdrop of losses, it is hardly a surprise that their mother </p>

But of course, for Louisa and the boys, the reality would be months extending into years no doubt, of litigation.  A huge emotional cost to be paid by Louisa, a huge distraction from the priority of caring for the boys, and a significant, either actual financial liability or a contingent liability, that would rest upon her until proceedings concluded successfully. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Therefore, looking from the children&#8217;s positions, both taking into account the financial value of the settlement, but also the incalculable non-financial benefits to them of having their mother able to focus exclusively on their welfare, the combination of those two satisfies me that this compromise is indeed a compromise for their benefit.  In addition, it is a reasonable and sensible compromise, both in value terms and in ancillary benefits terms. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I had originally declined to deal with this matter on paper because I was concerned about the backdrop to the case.  In particular the assertion of the first defendant, that the proceeds of sale of Greenfield Technologies were an outright gift to her.  I suppose this case shows the value of a hearing in the more complex cases such as this, where the nature of the arguments behind the compromise can be more fully explored in a hearing.  The terms of the compromise are unchanged from when they were put before me on paper but having seen more of the paperwork in support of it and had the benefit of the written skeleton and the supplemental advocacy of Ms Kennedy McGregor, I now fully understand why the compromise has been reached as it has been and agree, that it is a proper compromise on behalf of these two infants. </p>

I have been provided with a statement of costs, which shows the total costs in respect of today&#8217;s hearing, which has been listed I think for half a day or two hours, are just under &#163;10,000.  This cost appears to me to be an entirely reasonable sum, both in respect of the solicitor&#8217;s costs and Miss Kennedy McGregor&#8217;s costs as counsel, for the documents she has prepared and for the fee for the hearing.  Therefore, I will order that the estate pays the costs of the claimants in respect of today&#8217;s hearing summarily assessed in the sum of &#163;9,985. </p>
