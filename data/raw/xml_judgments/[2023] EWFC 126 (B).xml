	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my decision in respect of Torbay Council&#8217;s application for care and placement orders in respect of Joshua, who is 5 (Joshua is not his real name).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Everybody agrees that Joshua sadly cannot be safely cared for by his parents. The issue is whether the court should authorise his continued placement in foster care for the long term by making a care order, or authorise a plan for adoption by also making a placement order. A subsidiary but important issue relates to contact between Joshua and his mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Torbay Council is the Applicant local authority. They bring this application and propose adoption with letterbox contact once a year to the mother and grandmother. They propose a time limited search for up to 12 months, and if by then a suitable adoptive match has not been made their plan will revert to long term foster care (hopefully with Joshua&#8217;s current carers). If Joshua remains in foster care, Torbay&#8217;s care plan is for M&#8217;s contact to gradually reduce to six times a year in school holidays, and I am invited to make an order permitting the Local Authority (&#8216;LA&#8217;) to refuse contact between Joshua and his Father. Torbay are represented by Mr Whitehall.</p>

Her position for some time has been that if Joshua cannot return to her care he should remain in foster care with his current carers if possible, but as of the outset of this hearing M accepted that she cannot look after Joshua at the moment and that a care order should be made. M does not want Joshua to be adopted and wants as much contact as possible. She has attended this hearing throughout even though she has obviously found listening to the evidence very painful. She is represented by Ms Parkhouse. </p>

He accepts that there is a lot of work he needs to do before contact between him and Joshua could be even considered. He attended on the first day of this hearing but found the stress and distress of hearing the evidence too difficult and absented himself (with my permission) from day 2 of the hearing. I do not know if he will attend today when I will hand down this judgment. He is represented by Mr Bitmead, who has full instructions.</p>

Joshua, instructed by Ms Barry, is represented by Mr Hayward. </p>

I have decided to refuse the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order. I do not approve a plan for adoption for Joshua. I think that contact with his mother is so important to Joshua that his care plan should be amended to reflect (in the first instance) a higher frequency of contact than the current proposal for six times a year. I explain why I have reached these decisions below. </p>

Previous proceedings were commenced shortly after delivery and when Joshua was 5 months old, after a successful mother and baby placement, those proceedings concluded with Joshua in the care of his mother under a 12 month supervision order, and an order which prevented F from coming into the home. That supervision order ran until 18 September 2018. Lisa Barry was the Guardian. I have a selection of papers from those proceedings, and whilst I do not have the final approved threshold it appears that similar issues were raised in those proceedings as are now raised in these i.e. the parents&#8217; drug and alcohol use, domestic abuse, and F&#8217;s extensive criminal history (as recounted in the agreed threshold in these proceedings).</p>

That plan ultimately broke down around the end of 2022 for reasons I need not go into other than to say that it was ultimately concluded that the MGM could not safeguard Joshua and should not be further assessed to care for him. By January 2023 it had become apparent that the parents&#8217; assertions that they had separated were untrue. Their phone records comprehensively show their deliberate and sustained efforts to continue their relationship and to conceal that from the local authority and the court until the coast was clear.

By all accounts it has been very successful so far, although it is early days. All agree Joshua has settled well and is doing well and making progress. He has expressed that he loves his carers and wants to stay forever. They have committed to care for him long term if he remains in long term foster care. They have indicated they are open to considering other forms of order such as a Special Guardianship Order (&#8216;SGO&#8217;) in due course &#8211; in a couple of years perhaps and after legal advice. They are experienced carers who are currently caring on a long term basis for two teenaged foster daughters, as well as their own child (and from time to time respite or short term foster children). Joshua has been able to remain at his same school and would continue to do so if he remained in their care. They have repeatedly affirmed their long term commitment to Joshua albeit they are not able to commit to options such as SGO or adoption at present. I would not expect them to go further than that given the placement is in its comparative infancy, and appreciating the significance of such a decision both for Joshua and for them, and for the other children in their care. </p>

The care plan was for letterbox contact on an annual basis to the mother and grandmother, and possibly the father in due course. On 26 May 2023 the court conducted an IRH. The Guardian&#8217;s analysis had been recently made available. That did not support the plan of adoption and made a number of proposals for clarification of the plans for a reduction in contact and amendment of the Child Permanence Report (&#8216;CPR&#8217;). Directions were made for the LA to file a statement dealing with those issues. In addition, the Guardian&#8217;s analysis recommended weekly contact if Joshua were to remain in foster care and twice annual face to face contact between Joshua and his mother post adoption, in addition to twice annual letterbox contact.</p>

That statement said the LA would amend its care plan to provide for direct contact post-adoption on an annual basis. No analysis of why that was now considered to be in Joshua&#8217;s best interests was offered. The plan also set out an alternative care plan (if a placement order were not made or an adoptive placement could not be found, which was that Joshua would remain in his current placement with gradually reducing contact with M, coming to rest at 6 times annually.</p>

In the parenting assessment it was suggested a return to the parents&#8217; care might be retraumatising, but there was no equivalent suggestion about contact. However, in oral evidence these issues acquired greater prominence, with Ms X emphasising that foster care would mean that Joshua would be continually re-traumatised by ongoing contact if in long term foster care, which she contrasted with adoption where he would be spared this retraumatising experience. Thus, what had been accepted as good quality contact was presented as a negative factor and one which weighed in favour of adoption rather than against it.</p>

She told me (in effect) that the mother had not been responsive to guidance on this. Questioned further she stated that she had not told the mother that this was causing issues at placement, but that the foster carer had done so via the contact book. I have considered the contact notes and the contact book (which was produced overnight on request). Neither support the proposition that the mother was given guidance that she failed to act on.

It is quite commonplace for a child to be unsettled or somewhat different or difficult before or after contact before settling back into their placement. Joshua is having contact three times a week with his mother. It is unsurprising this causes temporary ripples. That is a situation that cries out for management through active social work (and, as proposed a sensible contact reduction plan once final decisions are made). It is not a justification for the cessation of overwhelmingly positive contact. Nor is it evidence that Joshua is not settled as had previously been accepted. </p>

The local authorities&#8217; own case and Ms X&#8217;s own evidence was that Joshua is a 5 year old boy who has experienced trauma and is mimicking inappropriate adult behaviour.

I was unable to get any sense from the social work evidence that the local authority had reflected on or taken on board the points made in the Guardian&#8217;s analysis. For the avoidance of doubt I have reached this conclusion only after considering the evidence generally, and in particular analysing the detail of the LA&#8217;s own analysis and stated rationale below. No party has sought to suggest bad faith on the part of the local authority &#8211; the social worker and local authority is motivated by a wish to secure the best outcome for Joshua.

This did not feature in the LA oral evidence at all. In any event all the evidence is to the contrary. The mother has for months explicitly supported foster care as the fallback position if she could not secure Joshua&#8217;s return. It is neither surprising nor unusual that she was unable to fully accept that her wish for Joshua to return home was unrealistic until she was at the door of court, and for many months she has been consistently attending contact and ensuring that Joshua has a lovely time. She has been putting regular cheerful and constructive messages in the contact book in support of Joshua and his placement.  </p>

I am afraid that in the LA&#8217;s evidence, and particularly in its unexplained changes of stance, I detected an element of dogmatic adherence to the idea of adoption as better and a sense that evidence was being recruited in support of that decision and deployed defensively in response to appropriate challenge.

However, that does not mean I have disregarded the LA evidence. I have given it proper consideration and weight where warranted. Nor does it mean I have simply adopted the Guardian&#8217;s perspective or position. I have given that proper consideration and weight where warranted.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am tasked with making a decision between two courses of action each of which carries with it some risk and some advantage over the other. The Guardian did not see this case as finely balanced at all. I have not found it so easy to decide. The idea of leaving Joshua where he is based on the currently positive outlook for his foster placement is attractively presented and alluring, but there is potential for that placement to come to a premature end at some point over the next 13 or so years, and that would obviously be to Joshua&#8217;s detriment. Every family court judge is familiar with the harm that a succession of placement moves can cause to children in care, and the way in which such moves can escalate out of control for some children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Likewise, it would be easy to say that adoption is safer and best because it offers more &#8216;permanence&#8217; (whatever that means) and is cleaner. But the evidence I have heard makes clear to me that a <span style="font-style:italic">plan</span> of adoption (which is all I can approve &#8211; a placement order merely approves the idea of adoption in principle and authorises an <span style="font-style:italic">attempt</span> to identify a suitable placement) is not a neutral step. I accept the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that if Joshua is told he is to leave his current carer, will stop seeing his mummy and will be given new parents, he will be devastated. I accept that if he is later told a placement cannot be found that will be a further blow to his self esteem. In the meantime he will be unable to fully cement the emerging attachment with his foster carers because he will be in limbo, and will view their care as temporary. It is not a neutral step. Being more optimistic, if a placement is found there is a nonetheless a risk it will break down. That risk is higher for a child of Joshua&#8217;s age (i.e. a child of school age who is verbal and who will retain established memories of his parents and life in foster care) than for a pre-school child or baby, particularly given the difficulty he may have understanding or coming to terms with the disappearance of his mummy from his life, as is proposed. So, there are serious risks associated with both options.  </p>

There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the adoption order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.&#160;</p>

Adoption will afford Joshua legal and practical certainty, which will afford him a greater sense of security and stability for the remainder of his life.&#8217; I hope Joshua will be able to settle. The evidence I have received is mixed on that. I accept the Guardian&#8217;s evidence as regards the importance of Joshua&#8217;s relationship with his mother to him now, and in broader terms to his sense of self. I accept the guardian&#8217;s evidence that the loss of that relationship will be difficult for him to understand or bear and it is not possible to say with certainty that Joshua will settle. I specifically do not accept the proposition from the social worker that because Joshua has settled quickly in two foster placements he will therefore be able to settle in adoption, and will get used to not seeing his mother. Each time Joshua is moved his trust in adults will be depleted. He will be less likely to invest. Moreover, Joshua will not forget his mother. He will remember her and he may seek her out as he gets older. I am concerned that there is a risk that even if Joshua settles initially his placement may disrupt later on. I cannot quantify that risk. In my judgment having considered the evidence of ASW and the Guardian the risks of adoption disruption are probably higher on the LA&#8217;s plan of letterbox contact only, not lower as the LA contends for.</p>

This is particularly important for Joshua, given his very young age.&#8217; Joshua is not &#8216;very young&#8217;. I do not agree with the generalised propositions made here. To achieve a successful adoption Joshua will have to manage the news that he is not going to see his mum again, he will have to re-establish another new attachment, he will have to find a way to accept the ending of a relationship which for him is (in its current form) very positive. </p>

This involvement could cause Joshua to feel different from his peers and experience stigma&#8217;. I cannot accept the proposition that adoption is in any way less interventionist. That is simply wrong &#8211; it is the most serious intervention in a child&#8217;s family life possible. The ongoing interference in private and family life that comes with being a looked after child is relevant and can be stigmatising, which I do not minimise, but it is not in any way comparable to the degree of interference that comes with adoption, where the child&#8217;s entire existing family life is ended. As per the guardian&#8217;s evidence I do not think that the LA&#8217;s statutory role would impact on Joshua as extensively as suggested if managed sensitively. Moreover, regular meetings and visits will ensure that Joshua has access to support and services suitable to his needs over time, and that his care plan will be adjusted to suit those needs. </p>

I do not understand this. Joshua&#8217;s age is one of the reasons the local authority has developed a care plan for a time limited search. The fact that he is not yet 6, or not yet a teenager does not take away from the fact that he is of an age and stage of development, with enduring memories and connections that mean it will be harder to match him, harder for him to adjust, and that the risks and challenges of adoption will be greater. Joshua is not of an age where, when combined with his profile, it is likely to be impossible for him to be matched with adopters &#8211; but it seems to me that his advancing age is a complicating factor which elevates risk rather than reducing it.</p>

These are not hypotheticals, they are integral to the plan and necessary precursors to achieving the goal of adoption. The plan I am being asked to endorse is an attempt at finding an adoptive placement. It has to be found, Joshua prepared, a match made, successful introductions etc. There is a risk it will not go well or will stall or fail. The family finding evidence reassures me that the chances a match will not be found are low, but how well Joshua will &#8216;take&#8217; to the idea of adoption remains to be seen. If the local authority cannot achieve adoption for Joshua will not be a simple question of switching to plan B. Pursuit of this plan is not a neutral act. By virtue of the plan for adoption, for up to 12 months (hopefully less based on the family finding evidence) Joshua will be expected to adjust to the idea of adoption, to wait until a placement is found, perhaps &#8216;stepping back&#8217; from developing his bond with his current carers all the while. At the same time he will be adjusting to a reduction in contact. The permanence that all agree he needs will be delayed. If adoption does not happen (which the very fact of the local authority&#8217;s plan for a time limited search at the suggestion of ASW demonstrates is a realistic possibility), Joshua will be worse off. </p>

There is no guarantee any subsequent placement will be as good a fit as this one appears to be and as indicated above I am very alive to the spiral that placement breakdown can contribute to. However, based on the available contextual information, it seems to me that the risk of this placement breaking down is comparatively low. By contextual information I mean the information about the carers and Joshua&#8217;s responses to them set out above, along with the fact that Joshua&#8217;s education has not been disrupted, his links to peers and family are maintained. In addition, the foster carers position as expressed through the Guardian is a prudent and realistic balance between their clear commitment and emotional connection to Joshua and the fact that it is still early days. </p>

Joshua is only 4 years old [sic] and therefore he needs consistent care until he is at least 18 years and then into his adulthood. As he is so young, there is therefore more time when placement changes could happen.&#8217; I agree that there is a long period ahead for Joshua in foster care. The potential for change is real. I am reassured by the known facts about his current placement. Hypothetical scenarios about life events such as illness death or divorce do not greatly assist, save that I acknowledge that in times of crisis a foster carer may fall back on the ability to give notice, where an adoptive family might (perhaps) find that emotionally and practically more complicated. I do not think it is helpful to try and predict what these foster carers might do or what an hypothetical adopter might do in such a situation.</p>

This may impact on how Joshua perceives himself and he may experience stigma from others, such as his peers&#8217;. Joshua will in any event be aware as he grows up that he is a child who is not cared for by his birth parents. He will be aware that he is adopted or that he is in foster care. Again, I think the key to these issues is sensitive management of them through life story work and through practical day to day arrangements that do not emphasise Joshua&#8217;s difference. I do not underestimate the potential for stigma or teasing from peers, but sadly it is also the case that lots of children have unusual care arrangements and family set ups, and many will be being cared for by someone other than their parents. Compared to the benefits for Joshua of being able to continue his relationship with his mother I do not think this is a particularly weighty factor.</p>

That said, it would be wrong to assume that only unmeritorious applications would be made.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have concluded that there are a number of very real risks which the LA overlooked in its analysis and did not acknowledge, which I have set out above. <span style="color:#212121">In my view, knowing what I do about the individualised facts, the various risks associated with foster care for Joshua are lower than the risks associated with adoption for him. Moreover, if Joshua is able to remain in his current excellent placement he will have something he can not achieve in adoption &#8211; a relationship with his mother as well as stability of placement, i.e. the best of both worlds. Nothing is certain, but that opportunity is not something I consider should be taken from Joshua because of a dogmatic view that adoption is best. I don&#8217;t think a plan to pursue adoption would be best in this case, and I don&#8217;t think it is the right route for Joshua.</span></p>

Once weekly contact is established for a period, it can be reviewed. If that frequency is working well for Joshua and manageable for the carers it can continue. If it is not, it can be further adjusted downwards.</p>

Ultimately it is a matter for the local authority, but I hope that the local authority will reflect on my conclusions and act accordingly. </p>

This was initially proposed by the Guardian but only taken up by the LA in final submissions. Mr Bitmead was unable in the absence of his client to formally consent, but the father is not seeking contact and accepts that he has a long road to travel before he could do so. He understands that the LA will need to risk assess any request for contact before it could start. I will make the order, noting that it is permissive only and does not prevent the local authority from permitting contact if, at the time, it is in Joshua&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

It may be that in due course he begins to ask about him and then the local authority will need to weigh the risks and potential benefits of contact very carefully. The local authority should be empowered however to withhold contact unless and until Joshua is open to the idea, and any reintroduction has been assessed as safe and beneficial.
