This is agreed by all parties. They further seek a placement order in respect of T, this is opposed by all other parties. The Local Authority is seeking to place T in an open adoptive placement allowing limited parental contact. The key dispute is the appropriateness and indeed proportionality of a placement order in the context of a child with severe disabilities and a life limiting condition. The other significant feature is the effect of learning difficulties in respect of the parents and T.</span></p>

The final agreed threshold states that V and T are at risk of significant harm as a consequence of their additional needs and the parents&#8217; inability to care for the children given the children&#8217;s needs and their own limitations.  V has a diagnosis of developmental delay, T suffered brain damage following difficulties during labour and he has a number of very serious health conditions.</span></p>

Examples of their inability to learn the required skills include repeated attempts to demonstrate how T should be fed on specialist milk with concerns being raised on seven occasions.  The parents had also failed to order essential items including milk and various medications and that led to a risk of T being in increased pain.  It was accepted by everyone that the parents had their own learning difficulties and that the children had particular learning and care needs, this unfortunate combination resulted in the parents not providing consistent and safe parenting.</span></p>

He made an interim care order with V remaining at home and T remaining at A Hospice.  By its very name, it is clear that the hospice is a place for children who require palliative care.

That assessment took place at Dudley Lodge and the assessment was negative.  By October 2021, V had moved to the care of her paternal grandmother. The matter was due to reach an issues resolution hearing on 21 March 2022 and by that time, the parents both accepted that V should remain in the care of her paternal grandparents, under a special guardianship order.  </span></p>

Potential foster carers had met with the social work team.  They had significant experience of caring for children with profound needs like T, and they were looking to care for a child with disabilities and had a suitably adapted home with the requisite care equipment. They had expressed an interest in moving forward to adoption and indeed had adopted other disabled children some of whom lived with them into adulthood and continued to live with them.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="None">As such when the case came to a final hearing the issues had simplified.  It was accepted that T would not be returning home.  The issue for T was whether he would be made subject to a care order, with a plan of long-term foster care, or whether he would be made subject to a placement order, with what was described by the local authority as a &#8216;time-limited search&#8217; for adoptive parents.  In relation to V the issues were narrower.  It was accepted that she would remain with her grandparents under a special guardianship order, though inevitably there were outstanding issues in terms of the various care plans and the contact between siblings and parents.</span></p>

This omission put the allocated social worker in an impossible position; clearly long-term foster care was a realistic option for any child approaching four with an older sibling remaining in the family group.

It is the same carers performing the same role, but under a different legal framework.  It is entirely possible that the placement would be more stable with the assistance of a care plan and appropriate funding.  If it were possible to remove the parental contact from the equation, I can see the argument she is making, because we would have a life without state and birth parental intrusion. However, no party in this case suggests it is appropriate in this case to prohibit parental contact, the only difference is frequency of contact, as the plan is for twelve contacts per year under long-term foster care and six under an open adoption.  I thus struggle with the enhanced chance of breakdown under adoption.</span></p>

It was suggested that there had been real difficulties in finding a foster placement during the currency of this case.  It was suggested this rendered this course of action unrealistic and she did not accept this.  This appeared to be against the weight of evidence which clearly demonstrated finding any sort of carers was difficult and identifying prospective adopters willing to take on a child with these needs, and the requirement of an open adoption seemed almost impossible.

In doing so, I consider she placed too much weight on protecting the wishes of these particular carers, in effect, seeking an option which provided these carers with the most freedom of decision-making and did not fully acknowledge that this significantly reduced the role of the birth family.</span></p>

I do not think they will comply with anything other than what their hearts or guts is telling them".  This appears to me to be a far too wide assumption, but it does contain a central truth that it will be their decision to make, and those decisions will be made once they have devoted time and energy to T.  There is a real risk that they may be less open to other's views and input at that stage.</span></p>

I accept the allocated social worker&#8217;s view that he can form bonds with caregivers and familiarity is an essential element of this, but I find that his bond with his family has a different quality to it.  I make this finding on the basis descriptions of his interaction with his family and this is supported by the letter from the Hospice and inquiries made by the Children&#8217;s Guardian of those involved in his care. I note the Reed and Harrison research from 2002, which I have already referred to and which counsels against making assumptions about the value of contact in disabled children, and emphasis the engagement of senses such as sight, smell and hearing.  This indicates that we need to be more alive to the possibility that T bonds in ways different to other children.  I have also considered the photographs contained in the witness statement of mother, and these appear from [C62] onwards and show, for example, V embracing a sleeping T, T draped across his mother's lap and V beaming whilst cuddling T.  This is the sort of intense sensory interaction that cannot be replicated by adult carers;</span></p>

Conversely, I find that the caring demands will be so extreme that the availability of financial backing, respite care and expert advice as a right available at all times weigh in favour the sustainability of the placement during difficult times.  Therefore, on balance, I see that as neutral; it is the same carers caring for a child they say they already love, and this commitment will remain roughly equal whatever legal label is put on the placement. As such I find the chances of the placement breaking down are roughly equal whether it is an adoptive or foster placement in these particular circumstances;</span></p>

The court must have regard to the Article 6 and Article 8 ECHR rights of all parties and must be satisfied that any interference with the Article 8 rights of the parties is in accordance with the law, necessary and proportionate.  In the event the Article 8 rights of the parents conflict with the Article 8 rights of the child, then it is the child's rights that must be given priority.  A care order represents a drastic curtailment of the rights of the parents under Article 8, which can only be justified by pressing concerns for the child's welfare.  This is, however, not an absolute right and the court representing the State are in certain situations is allowed to interfere with that right, but such interference must be justified, necessary and proportionate.</span></p>

This means T must not be treated in a less favourable way because of his protected characteristics.  Furthermore, the local authority in its provision of services is required to make adjustments for disabled persons.  As such, the local authority must consider adoption.  I entirely agree that a failure to do so because of a difficulty in placement as a result of disability would be discriminatory.  However, the obligation is to ensure the options are available.  The Equality Act is not prescriptive as to what option is chosen, because that becomes a matter of the child's welfare and so falls to be determined under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>.

I have already indicated as a factual finding that I do not discern adoption to be more secure than long-term foster care in this unique situation.  Breakdown, however, is a huge risk through no fault of the carer.  Legally, the position is far simpler under a care order, for the local authority can simply move T to another placement sadly probably a hospice and can do so under the auspices of that order.  If an adoption breaks down or begins to experience difficulties, there are court processes and potential conflict.  I find this factor weighs in favour of long-term foster care.</span></p>

The purpose of adoption is to provide a chance of family life where the birth family cannot provide it.  Here, the birth family despite their inadequacies, can provide an essential element of it.  This may only be in the form of cuddles and love, but it is family life in the limited ways which T can perceive it.  They have demonstrated a continued commitment to T and there is no evidence to suggest that commitment would not continue through T's life. The adoptive carers appear able to provide a family life but their position is not covered by this criteria as T is not placed with those carers as of today.  Family members outside the parents have visited T, most significantly the grandparents who will remain very much in V's care. As indicated the birth family remain fully committed to supporting T as best they can and supporting his relationship with V.  As such, this factor weighs in favour of long-term foster care.</span></p>

This is not a numerical analysis but a holistic analysis and there are a number of individual factors which support long term foster care and I have indicated at least one factor (the removal of parental responsibility in health decisions) which weighs heavily against adoption. I could stop my analysis there, however, it is accepted that differing views may be taken of the weight given to the factors above.  However, when one adds in the proportionality of any action, I struggle to see how it could ever be proportionate to approve adoption in a scenario where identical care can be provided under long-term foster care. With the same care-givers being involved, it cannot be proportionate to sever familial ties when it is simply not necessary to do so.  For this very reason, I have not been able to dispense with parental consent, for there can be no rational argument that the welfare of the child requires me to do so when nothing else will do, when we have an option which so clearly will do so.</span></p>

I remind myself of the importance of the sibling bond.  If these children attain adulthood, those bonds will be the most long-lasting they will experience, and I would have been extremely reluctant to do anything which would impact negatively upon them.  Had I made a different decision on the welfare checklist for T, I would have had to cross-reference V's position, and then re-evaluate my analysis based on a proportionality decision, factoring in V's position.  It is not necessary for me to do so, having made a welfare decision in favour of long-term foster care in relation to T.</span></p>

I am totally satisfied that this decision is the appropriate one and a non-discriminatory one.  I note that rushing off to provide judgment at two o'clock, I have not provided any written judgment in relation to the contact points, and I am well aware the contact point remains important for the parents.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="None">I accept the view that under a long-term foster care, the position should be a guaranteed twelve sessions between T and his parents, and T and V.  In addition, there should be special occasions contact.  I accept that some of those contacts will be contact with parents and V and, indeed, that makes a lot of sense, but in the event that there are contacts which do not involve one or other of those parties, each party is entitled to that twelve.  In relation to V, she is entitled to twelve contacts with T and special occasions, as discussed.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="None">If we move onto the issue of video contact, I cannot possibly see how video contact between V and her parents should be subject to any real reduction, because it is grandparents speaking to the parents, one of whom is their son, with V (a six-year-old) being present.  I suggest that whatever has pertained up to this point continues.  The more problematical issue is video contact between T and V, and T and his parents.  I do accept that these people taking on this huge burden are entitled to have some privacy, some ability to develop bonds and relationships without contact all the time.  I struggle to see how a video call every two weeks to fill the gap would be any problem at all. Whether a video call is needed on the week where they have their face-to-face, I do not really see the merits of that.  </span></p>

What I am in favour of is monthly video contact in a direct chatty way.  Monthly face-to-face contact, and additional sending of clips and stories, to be shared between those dates.  </span></p>
