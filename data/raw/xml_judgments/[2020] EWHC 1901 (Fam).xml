The mother resists that application on three grounds (i) Z was habitually resident in England at the time of any retention; (ii) the father acquiesced in Z&#8217;s retention in England; (iii) it would place Z at grave risk of physical or psychological harm, or in an otherwise intolerable situation, if the court were to require his return to Australia. </p>

I heard oral evidence from the jointly instructed expert Dr Gamble yesterday and submissions from counsel for both parties this morning. I am extremely grateful for the effective preparation by the solicitors and the way this hearing has been conducted by counsel who have submitted an agreed chronology and note on the law. Those steps, together with their comprehensive skeleton arguments and focussed oral submissions have enabled the court to be able to give an ex tempore judgment today. </p>

When asked about the impact of these conditions on the ability to parent he said it depends on how persistent and how serious the symptoms are, with good and bad days, times when feeling low with a lack of interest, energy and a tendency to turn away when the person would be less responsive to the needs of a child. If over a long period it could lead to significant harm to the child.  </p>

He accepted that previously the stresses the mother had experienced had not affected her parenting of Z. He agreed the recent stresses were around these proceedings and the consequences. Mr Gration suggested that once they were concluded it would be a relief as that would bring certainty, Dr Gamble considered it could mean an escalation in the stress describing it as a double edged sword, which would be largely negative for the mother if she was required to return to Australia. </p>

Dr Gamble didn&#8217;t think so, referring to what the mother said about the father not being someone she could trust and stick to what he said he would do. Whilst he could see how it could give some reassurance he was not sure that would remove the stress for this mother in the way suggested by Mr Gration. He agreed that it would take a dramatic deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health to give rise to a situation where the child would be at risk but did not accept the protective measures proposed would make such deterioration more unlikely as it was not known what would  happen to the mother&#8217;s mental health. Those things may not be most important things in context where she is in Australia against her wishes, with the potential for further conflict with the father and less available support than in the UK. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Gration submits the evidence prior to the mother and Z&#8217;s departure in September 2019 makes it clear the visit was time limited as even though the lease on the family home had lapsed, she went with relatively limited luggage and left behind boxes of belongings, her car and other household goods. The father denies any discussions that the mother seeks to rely upon to suggest her stay was a permanent move, his position is best encapsulated in the message prior to their departure to the mother that recognised that he did think &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a bit of time in the UK would be good&#8217;</span> for the mother and Z. Such a message, he submits, is inconsistent with any agreement to a permanent move. Even on the mother&#8217;s own case the position was described as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;very open ended&#8217;</span> in her statement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Turning to the position after September, Mr Gration makes the point that there is no evidence of any detailed discussions between the parents about Z&#8217;s future after September 2019. He rejects the mother&#8217;s reliance on some messages exchanged between them in November 2019 relating to Z returning to Australia for a period of time. Mr Gration submits there are a number of flaws in the mother&#8217;s position and notes, for example, there is no reference to the mother informing the father Z was not returning on 21 January 2020 and there had been no discussion between them about how Z and the father would maintain their relationship if Z remained in the UK and the father in Australia.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the discussions between the parties in December when the father visited the UK the evidence is clear that the father raising the issue of Z visiting Australia for a short period was in the context of it taking place prior to the scheduled return, which the father still understood was taking place. In messages sent by the father to the mother on 20 December he was referring to their need to talk <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;about so many things regarding [Z] and what&#8217;s happening long term&#8217;</span> later that day messaging about the need to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;get an idea of what&#8217;s going to happen for [Z] long term and some kind of agreement as to what&#8217;s happening&#8217;.</span> This accords, he submits, with the mother&#8217;s account of the parent&#8217;s meeting on 23 December that they &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">had to get an agreement in place for [Z&#8217;s] future, because [they] had never agreed on one&#8230;&#8221;</span> and that the agreement that the father was proposing was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">on the basis that [they] returned to live in Australia which [she] was not agreeable to and which was at complete odds to what [she] had understood [the father&#8217;s] position to be&#8221;</span>. The father then proceeded on the basis that the mother and Z were returning on 21 January referring to them being ready for sunshine in two weeks in a message on 6 January and on 15 January about Z being excited to go on a plane and the mother responding <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;He loves planes&#8217;. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">In looking at the position regarding habitual residence at the time when the mother decided not to return Z in December he was not habitually resident here. Z had lived in Australia all his life prior to September 2019, he had visited the UK before but only for holidays, his father still remained in Australia, and this was a time limited trip with a fixed return date. Even on the mother&#8217;s case the plans for him were unclear until she formed her intention in late December, and his stay in the UK has been characterised by instability which would have impacted on his ability to integrate in England with very little detail being given by the mother about Z&#8217;s circumstances during his time here.</p>

The significant stress factors that included her mother&#8217;s ill health and death did not have an adverse effect of her parenting of Z. When she saw the practice nurse in May 2020, during the currency of these proceedings, she was recorded as being able to care for Z and did not suggest during her interview with Dr Gamble that she required support to care for Z.</p>

She has lived there previously, including through periods of stress, and her parenting of Z has not suffered. There is no evidence that her parenting of him has been in any sense destabilised notwithstanding the events that she has been through recently. It clearly has not been destabilised to the extent of being intolerable for the child.</p>

That is not the conclusion that Dr Gamble has reached. The mother is aware of her situation and has protected Z effectively. There is available to her in Australia a functioning medical service through which she could seek and obtain treatment of a standard commensurate to that which she can access in England. The protective measures offered by the father will, submitted Mr Gration, ease the transition in accordance with the purpose they are to serve as set out in paragraphs 43 and 44 of the HCCH Hague Convention Guidance. </p>

He had attended nursery here since early October, fully engaging with life here such as visiting the wider family and taking part in many activities. This integration is supported by the statements from three of the mother&#8217;s friends. Since coming here Z had grown up and developed fast as described by the mother in her statement. He reminds the court that the issue of habitual residence is a factual matter for the court to determine and does not depend upon parental intention, although that is a factor the court can take into account.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Crosthwaite submits this stay was different than previous ones as the tenancy on the family home had expired, there was no home for the mother and Z to return to and she had sold many of her belongings. In reality they retained limited ties to Australia, the mother&#8217;s job had ceased, and she had limited possessions. The mother states she returned to obtain her Australian citizenship to help facilitate trips there in the future.  Mr Crosthwaite states that with the father having moved to Darwin there was limited left in Australia for the mother and Z. Mr Crosthwaite characterises the father&#8217;s move to Darwin as a supervening event and left the mother facing the reality of no home, no job, no means of knowing she could cope financially, only time limited practical support from the father, no support from immediate family or </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">friends and suffering from mental health issues that would impact on her parenting of Z. Mr Crosthwaite submits by contrast Z has achieved some degree of integration in a social and family environment in the UK. Whilst acknowledging his father remains there his roots in Australia have been eroded as his home has gone, his parents have separated, the mother&#8217;s job had finished and his father had gone to live in a new state with his partner. This contrasted with Z&#8217;s life in the UK in settled accommodation, with the wider maternal and paternal family nearby. He had settled into nursey and was participating in life here as fully as he was able to commensurate with his age, he is comfortable and content here. Whilst recognising the fact that he would see his father in the way the father proposes Mr Crosthwaite submits that did not equate with Z having a stable family life in Australia.</p>

This is supported, says Mr Crosthwaite, by the references to the father&#8217;s suggestion for Z to have a trip back to Australia for a few weeks to enable the mother to focus on her own mother. He submits this would make no sense if Z was returning to Australia on 21 January.</p>

There is no issue the mother has suffered a series of traumatic events as outlined in the evidence which have, at times, impacted on her mental health to the extent that a neighbour contacted the GP in November and she went to see the practice nurse in May. There are considerable uncertainties were she to return to Australia, she would need to secure accommodation and get a job. Even with the financial package put forward by the father she faces very great uncertainty and she would have limited support when compared to the support of her family and friends here. In addition, she and Z would have to quarantine for 14 days and face the prospect of contested proceedings if she made an application for permission to bring Z to live here. The mother summarises her concerns as follows</p>

The effectiveness of any treatment would be reduced all the time that stress factors are present in her life and the mother&#8217;s parenting could be adversely affected by a prolonged period of mental ill health.  In his report he states that a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">prolonged period of adaptation is likely to be associated with a prolonged period of stress and associated depression and anxiety, which in turn is likely to affect her parenting of Z to some extent</span>&#8221;. </p>

The father could provide little practical assistance living almost 2,000 miles away and the mother is critical of his care of Z in any event.  Therapeutic treatment would only have limited effect on this given the continuation of the stress factors which have given rise to the mother&#8217;s condition. Therefore, it is submitted that there is a grave risk of harm Z of a return to Australia or it would alternatively place him in an intolerable situation. </p>

The mother says she does not have any savings that she could draw on or sell the property she currently jointly owns with her brother as he lives there. Mr Crosthwaite submits that the financial uncertainty in this case is not simply connected to a soft landing, it directly relates to the stress factors that would be in place upon the mother upon a return with consequences for her mental health and risks regarding her ability to parent Z. Even considering the package proposed by the father and the protective measures those stress factors would remain and are very real. </p>

Mr Gration submits it is 28 December 2019, as that is when the mother formed the intention not to return Z back to Australia. It is when her subjective intention was formed. He relies on paragraphs 43 and 51 (i) of <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2018/8" uk:canonical="[2018] UKSC 8" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKSC 8</ref>.</span> He submits there is no need to await what is described in paragraph 51 (ii) as an objectively identifiable act, namely the message on 17 January. He submits any other interpretation could potentially reward the retaining parent forming their intention at an earlier stage and not revealing the position until much later, thereby being able to have a longer period to seek to establish habitual residence. Mr Crosthwaite submits it is the later time on 17 January, when the mother sent the message saying she was not bringing Z back to Australia.

In fact both counsel agree that on the facts of this case it makes no difference what date is taken as there is no significant event or factor that occurred between the two dates that has an impact on the court&#8217;s assessment of habitual residence. In those circumstances, whilst I prefer the submissions of Mr Crosthwaite as they seem to accord with what is set out in paragraph 52 (i) &#8211; (iv) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> it is not necessary for me to determine this interesting debate. It will no doubt arise and be considered in a case where it will be of relevance. I am going to take the operative date of when I need to consider habitual residence is prior to 28 December 2020.</p>

As has been made clear, parental intention is relevant to the assessment, but not determinative. The court needs to consider the stability of the child&#8217;s residence as opposed to its permanence; it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than solely a measurement of time. The relevant question is whether a child has achieved some degree of integration in a social and family environment.

The father viewed it as a time limited trip with the mother and Z coming back, with the knowledge of the return ticket date of 21 January. In his messages during the discussions after the parties separated but before the mother and Z came here in September, he recognised that a bit of time in the UK would be good for the mother and Z. The mother described it as &#8216;open ended&#8217; and despite having the return date on the tickets matters remained uncertain. Mr Gration relies on the fact that there is no evidence from the mother that the father agreed to any permanent stay.

Whilst acknowledging some degree of flux about the arrangements he submits it is important that one of Z&#8217;s parents, who he had shared a house with during the majority of his life was left behind in Australia. In those circumstances it is, he submits, more difficult to establish a change in habitual residence. Due to his age Z&#8217;s real anchor are his parents, they are the bedrock of his life and the fact that one of the parents is left behind is a significant factor in the comparative analysis the court has to undertake. The circumstances of the mother during her stay here were characterised by uncertainty and loss, thereby impacting on her own ability to settle here. He submits it is significant that the explanation for her decision not to return Z back to Australia was the information she was given about the father&#8217;s drinking and that he was going to pursue proceedings in Australia in relation to Z. That, submits Mr Gration, is a factor the court should bear in mind having regard to the primary purpose of the Convention is to prevent parents removing or retaining children from a jurisdiction for such reasons. When considering the habitual residence of a child of Z&#8217;s age there is the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Crosthwaite submits that when the court considers the evidence in the mother&#8217;s statement and her references to the trip being open ended, this is not inconsistent with the father&#8217;s messages referring to the mother and Z going for a bit. There was a state of flux about the time period, even with the purchase of return tickets with a </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.04in">date of 21 January. This position he submits is entirely consistent with the subsequent texts from the father on 20 December when he states there is a need for them to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;talk about so many things regarding Z and what is happening long term&#8217;</span> then later that day <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;We have got to get an idea of what&#8217;s going to happen for Z long term and some kind of agreement as to what&#8217;s happening&#8217;.</span> Mr Crosthwaite submits the sequence is important when the father came here in December. He informed the mother on 17 December about his new relationship and his plan to move to Darwin, he sent the messages I have referred to on 20 December and the parties met on 23 December, when he wanted the mother to sign a written agreement that she and Z return to live in Australia. That, he submits, supports the fact that there remained uncertainties about this trip as regards its purpose and the time period. This also ties in with the information the mother was receiving in messages from her sister in law on 17 December about her concerns regarding the father&#8217;s behaviour. These factors coupled with the suggestion by the father that Z could come and visit Australia for a few weeks prior to the 21 January again support the continued uncertainty. He submits even with a child this age parental intention is but one of the factors, as has been made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re R,</span> it is not determinative in the global analysis the court is required to undertake. He places reliance on the fact that here the mother has a known, secure home which Z is familiar with, there is wider family on both sides nearby and practical and emotional support on hand which the mother has benefitted from during her time of loss. From Z&#8217;s perspective, as described by the mother in her statement, he is in a settled home with his primary carer, started nursery in October, has settled in well and fully integrated into social and family life here, which has included the period when his father visited. This compares with what there is in Australia where the mother and Z have no home, the mother no job, the father has moved over 2000 miles away and the mother&#8217;s possessions are limited to 15 boxes of personal effects and her car. Mr Crosthwaite submits there is no evidence that the uncertainty regarding the mother&#8217;s return has had an impact on her ability to settle and integrate here, if anything it shows the opposite when considering the statements from the witnesses who filed evidence on behalf of the mother.</p>

Having done so I have reached the conclusion that Z&#8217;s habitual residence in late December 2019 was in this jurisdiction, as a result of there has been no breach of Article 3 of the Hague Convention, these proceeding will be dismissed and Z will not be ordered to return to Australia.</p>

Also, in his messages on 20 December he makes clear that the parents still needed to have a discussion about Z&#8217;s future, the messages do not suggest that is only in the context of returning to live in Australia. I agree with Mr Crosthwaite the sequence of when the mother was given information from the father is important. Informing her on 17 December that he had formed another relationship and was planning to move some distance away, messaging her a few days later to say they need to discuss the long term plans for Z, and then on 23 December seeking to get the mother to sign an agreement to return to live in Australia with Z.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">From the perspective of Z during this period he was becoming increasingly integrated into the social and family environment here. That is demonstrated by the detail given about this in the mother&#8217;s statement, such as Z starting at nursery, which the mother informed the father about at the time and the report attached to her statement setting out how well he has settled in there, and his wider circle of nursery friends. Her descriptions of the quality time Z spent with her parents, grandparents and the wider maternal and paternal family, as described in particular at paragraphs 80 &#8211; 85 of her statement. This integration is supported by the three statements filed by friends of the mother&#8217;s which details further Z&#8217;s integration in a social and family environment. It is of note that this evidence about Z&#8217;s life during this period is not disputed by the father. I reject the submission made by Mr Gration that the difficulties the mother encountered created some uncertainty or instability for Z between September and December. The evidence points the other way, of Z being in a stable home environment, settling and doing well at nursery surrounded by maternal and paternal family who he has integrated with and has a good strong relationship with. In the words of Lord Wilson he has put down strong roots here.</p>

Whilst of course it is important, as Mr Gration stresses, to weigh carefully in the balance that Z&#8217;s father remains in Australia where Z was habitually resident when he left in September 2019. But that factor can&#8217;t be looked at in isolation. There is no settled home to come back to, no job and some considerable uncertainty about the social and family environment Z will be returning to. The father now lives some distance away, has expressed a wish to visit Z fortnightly, which may or may not be realistic, bearing in mind the distances and his financial position.

Whilst Dr Gamble agreed that it would take a dramatic deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health to give rise to a situation where the child would be at risk, he did not accept the protective measures proposed would make such deterioration more unlikely, as it was not known what would happen to the mother&#8217;s mental health. </p>

This is because the mother has, in effect, nothing to go back to Australia for. No secure home (even taking into account the father&#8217;s suggestion that the tenancy would need to be in place before she left), no job, the reality of limited if any social support, and the prospect of continued prolonged litigation with the father. Consequently, there is a grave risk the symptoms Dr Gamble describes in his report and in his oral evidence will create a situation that is intolerable for Z, due to the impact of the mother&#8217;s mental ill health on her parenting of Z. </p>
