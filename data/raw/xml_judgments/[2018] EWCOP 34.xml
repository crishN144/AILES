The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of AC and BC and members of their family must be strictly preserved; this is likely to require anonymisation of the residential care units and professionals.   All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. </p>

On 21 February 2018, given the then imminent changes in the funding arrangements for her services, the local authority was substituted as applicant.  Mrs. BC (who I shall refer to as &#8216;BC&#8217;), AC&#8217;s sister, is the second respondent. </p>

These decisions will be governed by what is in her best interests.  Given the specific options before the court, it is acknowledged by all parties that future care provision will inevitably be informed by conclusions reached about her recent past care.  In that regard the Local Authority has presented to the court a schedule of proposed facts on which they ask me to make findings. These pertain to the care provided to AC by BC in her home up to November 2017 (and to a limited extent thereafter).   This schedule has been the focus of the enquiry at this hearing, although inevitably the evidence has taken in a wider panorama.  I must also of course consider the care offered to AC in the last 12 months, most recently at Placement 2. </p>

From an early stage of their involvement it is apparent that BC was not satisfied with the package of care offered (although the package was said to be more extensive than AC&#8217;s actual needs required) and she complained strongly about the care staff; the care agency accordingly gave notice.

BC denied the allegations, but the safeguarding enquiry substantiated the allegations of physical abuse (by slapping), neglect (by BC&#8217;s non-engagement with professionals) and emotional abuse.

BC, I am satisfied, was difficult over agreeing health assessments and care plans sent to her by CM2 (Community Matron, who had taken over from CM1 in that role in October 2016 following a breakdown in that earlier relationship), and (I find) refused to co-operate over the drafting of the detailed arrangements; BC was openly critical of CM2 at court (both at the hearing before me, and at earlier hearings); however, on my finding, BC actively obstructed the community matron to do her job by withholding information and co-operation.  The personal or professional discord which festered between BC and CM2 over an extended period had implications for AC&#8217;s care; it could not be said with confidence that the medication chart and epilepsy protocol were accurate given the fact that BC withheld key information from KC.

The CCG struggled to identify a suitable company to provide the nursing care, and when the proceedings were issued (in January 2017) BC was protesting that she was unable or unwilling to work with the brokerage company. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Given the increasingly difficult relationships between BC and the professionals, and the lack of clarity about AC&#8217;s true health and care needs, in July 2017, the CCG asked the court to authorise an assessment of AC.  The CCG was concerned that the assessments which by that time had been completed had relied overly-heavily on information from BC, and that there was insufficient objective evidence in relation to the management of epilepsy and bowel care; it felt itself in something of a Catch-22 situation: a care plan was needed to govern the package of support and assessment, but the assessment was needed in order to devise the care plan.  HHJ Lynch, sitting as a nominated judge of the Court of Protection, heard evidence at the hearing in July 2017; she considered a large quantity of the relevant documentation and concluded that there would be a material benefit in there being a proper objective assessment.  She delivered a judgment acknowledging that BC would find it difficult to receive assessors in her home 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, but nonetheless considered that this would be the most appropriate method of assessment in AC&#8217;s best interests.  The judge felt that AC would be distressed to be removed from her home, and that this should be avoided if possible. The assessment was scheduled to take 6 weeks, with a 24-hour package of support in place.  BC continued to take the view at that time that she believed that the assessment would have to be conducted by <span style="font-style:italic">nursing staff</span> not <span style="font-style:italic">carers</span>.    </p>

She concluded: &#8220;I very much hope that &#8230; all the people involved in AC&#8217;s life can work together to make assessment in her home possible&#8221;. </p>

In the event, the assessment did not progress beyond the 12 October.  There is a dispute as to the precise reasons for this.  The Local Authority maintain that BC effectively closed down the assessment by her conduct towards the assessors.  The witnesses from whom I have heard evidence referred to BC as &#8220;obstructive&#8221;, confrontational, &#8220;aggressive&#8221;, and &#8220;intimidating&#8221;.  BC maintains that the care workers who came to her home had a preconceived bias against her and took the first opportunity to find fault in the smallest thing; they in turn allege that she interrogated them and was rude to them.  One of the care workers, CN2 (continence nurse specialist, supervised by CN1) complained that at one point BC shoulder-barged her, pushing her out of the way (&#8220;she was definitely not in a great emotional state. It was very intentional&#8230;&#8221;.).  Having heard CN2 and BC give evidence on this issue, I can indicate at this stage that I accept CN2&#8217;s account. I also, materially, accept the care workers accounts of BC&#8217;s conduct on this day. </p>

The Community Matron and district nurses were specifically asked if they would return to her home for further assessment if BC made assurances or gave guarantees about her behaviour. They stated clearly that they felt that no amount of assurances or guarantees from BC would make that difference and that they were not prepared to return to care for or assess AC in that environment.  The CCG&#8217;s application was placed before the court on 16 November 2017.  As an alternative to the home assessment, the CCG proposed assessment at a residential unit namely Placement 1 &#8211; a proposal which was adopted by HHJ Lynch in the face of opposition from BC.  No restrictions were placed on BC&#8217;s contact with AC save for those which were relevant to all visitors of the residents.  </p>

The deprivation of liberty at the placement was covered by standard authorisations (as indeed it has been throughout the period since November 2017).

On 18 December, HHJ Lynch ordered that contact between BC and AC should in the circumstances take place away from Placement 1 on Saturdays for no more than 3 hours; it was directed that BC was not to perform any invasive procedures on AC while at contact.   </p>

BC then made an application to the court for AC&#8217;s immediate return home; she alleged that AC was being neglected at Placement 1, was being institutionalised, and that she was withdrawn. BC threatened to take the issue to the local press.  The views expressed by BC were not consistent with the evidence filed by the CCG, which indicated that AC was enjoying life at Placement 1, and that the standard of care was good.

A similar report was prepared addressing the management of her epilepsy (EN1: 12 January 2018); a Physiotherapy report (12 January 18) and Occupational Health report (8 January 2018) completed the suite of investigations.  The assessments confirmed that AC&#8217;s mobility was improving, she appeared to be establishing a regular bowel pattern, and she was participating in activities in the unit.  The CCG in the circumstances opposed AC&#8217;s return home, when the matter was next before the court; their view was confirmed by the emerging picture of BC&#8217;s rigid attitudes and lack of co-operation with professionals.   </p>

This was a result of continued reported behaviours by BC towards the staff there, which they viewed as vexatious and disruptive to their service.  The matter was put before the court on 5 February, by which time Placement 2 had been identified as a suitable alternative resource.  On the following day (6 February), AC moved to Placement 2; this is a 12-bed residential and nursing placement.   </p>

However, this freedom was short lived, and in my judgment, quickly abused.   As a result of allegedly hostile and unpleasant behaviour of BC towards the care staff on the first few visits (9, 10 and 11 February), placement 2 suspended their offer to BC to visit AC in the home; it confirmed that its staff would no longer be prepared to have direct contact with her.  The matter was once again placed before the court (21 February), at which hearing the court directed that BC&#8217;s contact with AC was to continue at the sensory room at placement 2.

When later challenged about the breach, or purported breach, BC protested that this was not a breach of the agreement as AC had not entered the house itself.  She maintained that position at the hearing before me.  Contact was suspended for a period.   I pause here to indicate that I consider that BC did breach the contract of expectations in bringing AC to her garden at her home; this was bringing her &#8216;home&#8217; even if AC did not cross the threshold. </p>

In that regard, the Local Authority asserted that the allegations set out in the Schedule of Findings (to which I turn in the next main section of the judgment) were proven on the balance of probabilities, and that it was unrealistic to consider that AC could ever be safely cared for by her sister, and that there was no available package of care to support BC.   </p>

It accepts that this is not a black/white picture, in that it acknowledges that BC has had a reasonable relationship with the GPs and Dr. 2, the medical consultant.  It is said that the difficulties encountered by professionals here has been unique and unprecedented.  The local authority disputes any evidence of a &#8220;vendetta&#8221;, as complained of BC (see [96] below), but point to the corroboration offered by the consistent account of obstructive and hostile behaviour of BC towards multiple professionals.  Ms Thomas maintains that there is no scope for attributing these difficulties to clashes of individual personalities; she argues that BC has shown a marked lack of insight and reflection, and this affects BC&#8217;s ability to change.   The local authority assert that the difficulties have become more and more entrenched, with BC making increasingly exorbitant allegations, including most recently an assertion of &#8216;grooming&#8217; of AC by male staff at Placement 2 (&#8220;this appalling placement&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="19">

It is said that the bowel care involved far too frequent <span style="font-style:italic">per rectum</span> examinations (daily or more) and performed with little thought for AC&#8217;s comfort or dignity (illustrated by the examination on 27 September 16).  It is further argued that despite efforts to establish a clear picture of this intimate form of care, the continence team and carers were unable to do so; a proposed plan was &#8216;disputed&#8217; by BC. The authority maintains that a bowel care plan has been devised and implemented at placement 2 and that this is working (in this regard I rely on the evidence of CP2).     </p>

They are worried that BC&#8217;s stance on a bowel care programme has been reactive when it should have been proactive. The Local Authority have no confidence that the current plan would be maintained were AC to return to the care of her sister.   </p>

SW2 (social work team manager) told me that three conditions would need to be assuredly fulfilled before AC could return home; (a) there would need to be full and sincere agreement from BC as to the care plan, (b) there would need to be carers available to work with BC and AC, and (c) there would need to be district nurses available.  He asserted that it was unrealistic to consider that a care plan could be delivered without professional support (even if it were agreed).  Quite apart from the lack of confidence in BC&#8217;s ability to adhere to a professional care plan, and given the history, it is a hard fact that no professional has been identified to undertake this piece of work.  The Local Authority point to the fact that, given the history, cooperation by BC with the care plan or with professionals is very unlikely to be sustained. </p>

Accordingly, the Local Authority seeks an adjournment.

But for the incidents in August 2018, they had been content with the placement 2 care.  The Local authority accept that the events occurring in August 2018 at placement 2 are distressing and serious events, and as a consequence, they say that they are committed to looking more widely at supported living arrangements in the area.  This process has started, but has not yet been completed; there is much to investigate including the nature and contractual obligations of any tenancy agreement, and the financial ramifications and the distribution / allocation of state benefits.

He urges greater focus in this urgent work; he referred to the fact that the last statement of the social worker was misleading in that the placements identified were in fact unsuitable.  He urges the Local Authority to commit themselves to seeking to find alternatives to Placement 2.  The Litigation Friend wants to see the most robust examination of alternative options for AC; the range of options needs to be properly probed. </p>

He observes and regrets that BC appears to have set her face against contact otherwise than at her home; she will not accept other contact.  This approach is not in AC&#8217;s best interests, argues Mr. O&#8217;Brien.   I am asked to make an order that it is in AC&#8217;s best interests that BC and AC have contact; the order should reflect as a recital what the Local Authority propose.  There needs to be a rebuilding of trust and confidence between BC and the Local Authority; she needs to demonstrate that she can comply with the court orders.  Equally, the order must reflect some restrictions on BC&#8217;s contact with AC in any residential setting in order not to jeopardise professional relationships with AC&#8217;s care-givers. </p>

It is argued that these ought to be repeated in my order at this stage, and tidied up; there has been no &#8216;joined up&#8217; approach by the supervisory body and the social work team.  The Litigation Friend argues that the Local Authority should confirm a weekly liaison between the social worker and the supervisory body.  The social worker needs to read the records, and provide the records to the Litigation friend, so that he can be part of the scrutiny.  The Local Authority should agree, on the face of the order, to a regime which reflected the concerns of the Litigation Friend. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Before looking at the specific schedule of findings, it may be helpful to set a context.  It is relevant to note that BC&#8217;s case is that the NHS Trust, the CCG and the Local Authority have for some time pursued, and are still pursuing, a &#8220;vendetta&#8221; (her word<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="27">
		  <p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.5in"> While cross-examined by Miss Thomas for the Local Authority </p>
		</authorialNote>) against her, and that this explains their case, and the evidence which I have heard.   BC offered no real explanation for why these authorities would want to act in concert to pursue a &#8216;vendetta&#8217; against her.  I reject this argument.  BC further maintains (though it could be said to be part and parcel of the complaint about a vendetta) that all the agencies and/or individual professionals who have been assigned to work with BC in the period from 2016 approached their work with a pre-conceived bias against her, having received slanted pre-assessment briefings and/or having been party to discussions about her. In short, she maintains, that she had acquired a reputation which &#8216;preceded&#8217; her with all those who came to assess her. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This latter point is, at least potentially, a reasonable one for her to make, as there plainly were briefings for, and discussions among, care agency employees about BC and her care of AC, and some of those discussions took place before care-workers and others met with BC.  It is indeed possible that a slanted briefing or discussion may have an effect on the independence of a care-worker or someone tasked with assessing BC.  While I am satisfied that it is important for professionals to share relevant and necessary information with those who work with families in this context, there is sometimes a fine line between providing that which is relevant and necessary, and that which is gratuitous and prejudicial.  In certain circumstances it can be challenging to impart key information in an unbiased way. I recognise the risk that the unguarded sharing of prejudiced information may have the effect of contaminating the otherwise independent opinion of the recipient of the relevant communication.  It is not easy to say that this has not happened here; there is a chance that it has.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">BC further complains about the lack of professionalism of the care workers and nurses; she is specifically exercised about their deficient record keeping.  She is concerned that unrecorded myths (my word) about her care of AC (and/or its deficiencies) have been allowed to percolate through the professional care-agency network in an unchecked way.  She illustrated this, effectively it seemed to me, by reference to the repeated assertion that she provided liquid for AC via a teaspoon; it was well-known that AC did not like touching hot cups.  The only reference I could find in the voluminous material to the minimal amounts of liquid taken by AC referenced her using a &#8216;pot mug&#8217; and taking only 100mls at a time.  Over the months of years of recent involvement, she has felt driven to raise numerous complaints against the actions of the professionals through official channels &#8211; the Local Authority Safeguarding Unit, the Local Authority Commissioning Services, the Local Authority Complaints section, Placement 2 Complaints Service (TP), Placement 2 Management, the Care Quality Commission, and the Police.  These complaints have been investigated, and disposed of without (so far as I can tell, and save for the matters alluded to above concerning Placement 2 in 2018) any or any material findings against the agencies complained about.  </p>

There is a high degree of consistency in the evidence of the professionals from the various agencies, who have provided evidence on behalf of the Local Authority, reflecting the position as they each saw it.  There may be some validity in the complaint that record keeping has not been conscientiously observed as it might and/or that (save for the minor illustration above, or like issues of insignificance) rumours and chatter have been allowed to spread unchecked. Overall, however, I do not find that this has contaminated the approach of the professionals in the fulfilment of their roles or in their appraisal of the case.  </p>

The records reveal that other medications have been attempted over the years.  AC also receives epilepsy medication (Gabapentin is one of the drugs administered historically, if not recently; also Epilim), and occasional pain relief (Paracetamol, Tramadol or Buprenophine). For the whole of the period up to November 2017 BC was responsible for the administration of the bowel care.  Dr. 2 and Dr. 1 both have considerable experience of BC and AC, and in Dr. 2&#8217;s case, in the management of colorectal problems.

The carers had a sense that BC was so furious with the involvement of the staff assessing BC and AC that she was &#8220;spilling all her anger out on [AC]&#8221; and man-handling her in her room in an aggressive way.

In my judgment she has adopted an unreasonable stance towards carers characterising her relationship with them as oppositional (&#8216;them&#8217; and &#8216;us&#8217;); she has declared that she would not &#8220;be the scapegoat for incompetence by any professionals&#8221;, but I do not find that this ac accurately reflects the position.   In a letter to HH Peter Hunt in February 2017, she wrote off the safeguarding concerns as &#8220;disgruntled carers trouble-making&#8221;; in further correspondence to the judge she referred to the &#8220;long-winded manipulations of facts, unprofessional attitudes to cover-up [AC]&#8217;s very poor harmful care in the hands of the local authority and its associates&#8221;.  CMan1 (who I found to be a measured, and clear witness, who gave her evidence objectively and I thought fairly) was of the firm view that if AC returned to her home, BC would not comply with the care plan: in her statement of evidence, CMan1 observed that BC has &#8220;consistently asserted that her behaviour is reasonable&#8221; &#8211; an unpropitious stance given that attitudinal change is in my view required.  </p>

My assessment is that she regards them as of inferior qualification and skill to herself.  Even as recently as 1 September 2018, on the eve of a hearing on the issue of whether AC would be returning home (AC was at that time in hospital), a nursing sister on the ward where AC was an inpatient reported that BC threatened that the &#8220;social worker is going down after the court hearing&#8221;; this was denied by BC.  I accept that it is likely that she said this. It would be entirely consistent with the very low regard which BC had for the social workers, and her threatening conduct to those of the caring professions who have sought to help. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">AC&#8217;s stay at Placement 2 has been and continues to be controversial.  There can be no doubt about the seriousness of the incident on 11 August, when AC, with her considerable vulnerabilities, was subjected to inexcusable ill-treatment.  It is not only predictable but also wholly understandable that BC has been extremely distressed, indeed incensed, by this event.  Her feelings have been aggravated by what has been, in my judgment, a lack of urgency in the investigation of the assault, and a rather casual regard to the additional conditions attached to the standard authorisation.  I was, I confess, very surprised to hear the insouciant way in which the social worker reflected the failures to comply with HHJ Lynch&#8217;s conditions to the standard authorisation; there has been little corresponding or co-ordination with the supervisory body, and minimal supervision over the maintenance of the care records<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="38">

I sense that this interim stance is borne more of pragmatism than an expression of satisfaction with the current arrangement; AC is at least familiar with Placement 2, and there is, frankly, no immediate alternative if AC is not to return to the care of BC.  I need little encouragement (though I have received it from LF1) to reinforce the sensibly imposed safeguards on the standard authorisation which I propose to maintain and re-state for the interim.  The Litigation Friend reasonably points up the benefit of moving AC to a new residential care environment to achieve a &#8220;fresh start without the history of concerns and incidents which come with a continued placement at Placement 2&#8221;<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">44</span>. </p>

Their role is undoubtedly a demanding and often an exhausting one. They are mostly very exceptional people, who require (and invariably possess) great depth of personal resources and resilience.  Unsurprisingly, family carers cannot fulfil the many tasks involved in caring for their disabled relatives; many require professional support.  While caring for a disabled relative brings undoubted pleasures, satisfaction and mutual emotional benefits, it is accompanied by many stresses and upsets.  As BC herself has reflected, it &#8220;takes its toll&#8221;.  Familial care of this nature cannot be delivered without some sacrifice, and without some impact on the emotional and physical health of the carer.   </p>

She would probably want to live with her sister, and if not living with her, to see her frequently.

I have discussed this extensively above.  While I acknowledge that in some respects the professionalism of the care workers may have occasionally slipped during the period in which they have worked with BC over this protracted period, particularly when under pressure, they have not deserved the anger, aggression, hostility, obstruction, which they have received from BC.

I have not heard evidence from the author of the note, and do not feel able to make a finding about this.

It would be crucial to the future safe management of AC in her home that BC would have a healthy working relationship with professionals supporting them; given the entrenched antipathetic attitudes of BC towards them, and her lack of insight into her behaviours, I have reached the clear conclusion that it is extraordinarily unlikely that professional support would ever be co-operatively, consistently or effectively delivered in BC&#8217;s home.  Without it, as BC herself accepts (she did not argue that she should manage the care of AC herself alone going forward), it would not be reasonable to contemplate rehabilitating AC back to the care of BC.  I accept Mr O&#8217; Brien&#8217;s submission (see [97] above) that there is a likelihood that AC would become side-lined, and/or her interests ignored, simply so that BC can prove a point to the professionals.  It is fair to say that so clear and overwhelming is this point that the other issues raised in the case (i.e. the failure to produce or adhere to bowel care plans in the past and the incidents of physical harm for instance, in respect of which of course I found BC wanting) assume a much lesser degree of importance. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">So, where does that leave us?  Both BC and LF1 are far from wholly satisfied with the current arrangements of care for AC at Placement 2.  I share their current dissatisfaction, on the information available now.  I was troubled to read LF1&#8217;s reports of the visits to Placement 2 over the year (I have quoted from his note of an early visit above); the events of 11 August (and subsequently) have only served to deepen my anxieties.  BC now feels disenfranchised from AC&#8217;s upbringing given her exclusion from the unit, and doubts the accuracy or authenticity of the information provided to her.  She asked (not entirely rhetorically) &#8220;Are they [the carers at Placement 2] reading AC properly?&#8221; </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">AC&#8217;s future residential care.  The local authority needs urgently to identify suitable placements.  I consider that a suitable residential placement must be able to stimulate AC; it needs to be a nurturing environment; AC would benefit from a social life at the home (SW2 told me that AC likes to be where there are other things going on<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="45">
		    <p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.5in"> Cross examination by Mr. O&#8217;Brien </p>
		  </authorialNote>).  I accept BC&#8217;s observation that AC has a good awareness of the world around her, and has historically enjoyed social interactions at &#8216;The BS&#8217; and &#8216;CF&#8217; day centres.  She needs to have the chance to forge relationships with workers who can be her friends: in this regard, I draw for illustration on the comments of SE visiting AC in August </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">2018: &#8220;she was very responsive, she sprang up in bed, cuddled me, smiled at me and made lots of eye contact.  I felt that she recognised me&#8221;, and LF1&#8217;s visit in September 2018 &#8220;LF1 greeted AC who held out her hand to him.  LF1 gave AC his hand and she smiled and pushed his hand away.  LF1 and AL interpreted this as being playful, and AC appeared happy&#8221;.  I believe that AC would benefit at least initially from a care environment where her intimate care was predominately achieved by female carers.  The recent assessment (5.9.18) confirms that she responds better to females than males. </p>

I will certainly expect there to be more details about BD and the placement which is opening in February 2019 at LM; a balance sheet of the competing benefits and disbenefits of the options should be prepared. I will leave it to Miss Thomas to draw up an order which reflects the essential decision which is reflected by this judgment, and which sets up a case management programme for the final hearing along these lines:</p>
