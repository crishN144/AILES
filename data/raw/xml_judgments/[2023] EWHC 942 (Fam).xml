	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2022, because of some criticisms made by the husband about Ms Hart&#8217;s approach and conclusions, the matter was restored to court (in part in response to a direct request from Ms Hart to the court). After a fairly intense dispute before me, in which Ms Hart actively participated, a way forward was found to retain Ms Hart as the SJE and to retain the private FDR date of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022 and this went ahead as planned. It would, I think, be fair to say that, notwithstanding the finding of a way forward to retain Ms Hart as SJE, the husband had substantial criticisms of her approach and conclusions.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Sadly, there was no agreement at the private FDR and the case came back to court before me for a post pFDR directions hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022. On this occasion I made further directions in relation to Ms Hart&#8217;s involvement and listed the final hearing for six days in March 2023. By then the husband had already made his post-FDR open offer (on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2022) and I directed the wife to make her open offer by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2022. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Not long after the July 2022 hearing the wife changed her legal representation. New Solicitors (Vardags) and a new team of Counsel were instructed. The new team failed to make their open offer as directed and so on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2022 the husband made a D11 application for this to happen. I granted the application on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022 and the wife made an open offer on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022. It is apparent from the wording of the offer that in the time between July and November 2022 the wife&#8217;s new legal team had sought further accountancy advice from Mr Andrew Strickland of Scrutton Bland and the offer made reflected his view of the case, which was to place a far higher figure on the value of the husband&#8217;s interest in G LLP than that of Ms Hart.</p>

It should be divided equally. This principle is reflected in statutory systems in other jurisdictions. It resonates with moral and philosophical values. It promotes equality and banishes discrimination&#8230;These arguments do not apply to property received or created outside the span of the partnership, or gratuitously received within the partnership from an external source. Such property has little to do with the endeavour of the partnership and the equal sharing principle as explained by Lord Nicholls just cannot apply to it on any moral or fair basis&#8230;For obvious reasons the span of the partnership is looked at de facto and not de jure. It is not looked at from the date of the marriage to the date of decree absolute. Rather it is measured from when the cohabitation began on a permanent basis until the date of the separation. Given that a claim to share non-matrimonial property (as opposed to having a sum awarded from it to meet needs) would have no moral or principled foundation it is hard to envisage a case where such an award would be made. If you like, such a case would be as rare as a white leopard&#8230;This seems to me to mandate that the court should always attempt to determine the partition between matrimonial and non-matrimonial property. Once it has done so the matrimonial property should usually be divided equally and there should usually be no sharing of the non-matrimonial property</span><span style="color:#212529">&#8221;.</span></p>

Even if the payment relates to a period immediately following separation it may be too close to the marriage to justify categorisation as non-matrimonial. How close is &#8216;too close&#8217; can create some differences of judgment.

However, there is no evidence to support that and, in any case, the income generated post separation is matrimonial having been generated by the continuum matrimonial business&#8221;</span>. In cross-examination he persuaded the husband to accept that there had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no tracing exercise</span>&#8221; as to the precise source of the monies used for the purchases and that the source could have been generated from the success fees paid to the husband&#8217;s business by two of its clients. Mr Yates&#8217; categorisation of these success fees is that they represent the continuum of the matrimonial business. For me, the weakness of this argument is underlined by the observation (which I shall develop further below in the context of the G LLP issue) that the husband provides professional services to clients for which (if things go well) he receives a success fee. The professional services which led to the substantial success fees referred to above were themselves all carried out after the separation (late 2020 and 2021) and were paid partly in the business y/e 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2022 and partly in the business y/e 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2023. The facts presented here are not in the category of the difficult bonus cases where the work is done all or partly before separation, but the remuneration received after separation. In the present case the work was done and the payment received after the separation date. Further, I do not accept that the words &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">continuum matrimonial business&#8221;</span> are correctly used here. The fact that the husband had (he entirely accepts) long-standing business relationships with both clients prior to the separation date does not change this. I accept the pertinence of Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s comparative analysis that for a divorcing barrister, whilst he may have a long-standing business relationship with a particular instructing solicitor, if his instructions are received on a case and the work done and the brief fee paid after the separation then the pre-existing long-standing business relationship does not prevent the earnings being post-separation earnings.</p>

These are interests in two trusts (the A Trust and the B Trust).  In the early stages of the dispute the existence and value of these interests were the subject of fierce argument; but, in the end, it has been accepted that they are entirely non-matrimonial, are not subject to the sharing principle and have no claims against them in this case &#8211; and with that the heat has rather gone out of the argument. In relation to the A Trust the husband has a potential interest in</span><span class="within-new" style="font-weight:bold;color:initial"> &#163;1,458,062 </span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">net specifically earmarked for him and a further </span><span class="within-new" style="font-weight:bold;color:initial">&#163;5,473,536</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> in which he is one of a number of possible discretionary beneficiaries, but in relation to which he has made it clear he wishes to earmark for his children (and I accept that is his genuine present intention). In relation to the B Trust the husband is, again, one of a number of possible discretionary beneficiaries and (he told me and I accept) this is likely to be treated as an asset of one of his parents during their lifetime; but he may thereafter receive something. It is not necessary for me to dwell very long on its value, save to note that this trust represents the assets of one of the husband&#8217;s parents, who was a person of some wealth, and the value of the trust is likely to be measured in tens of millions of pounds. It may be that in due course the husband receives a substantial sum from this source, but this will certainly be in the category of post-separation accrual. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The external investors in G LLP consist of companies which between themselves own the other 5% of the profits of G LLP. The husband owns a small percentage of one of those companies ('K Ltd'), but the shareholders of these companies are otherwise friends and family members of the husband who have invested capital at different stages to provide working capital for his business. These companies are contractually entitled to an identified profit share each year until the capital is repaid and there are provisions for how the capital repayment might be calculated. In August 2022 an arrangement was made (and recorded in writing in a letter dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2022) whereby G LLP (i.e. the husband) acknowledged an obligation to repay &#163;4.4m by way of capital repayment to these companies and proposed to begin repaying the capital. It was proposed to pay approximately &#163;400,000 forthwith, a further c&#163;400,000 after the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2023 and a further &#163;2m after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2024 and the remaining &#163;1.6m at an unspecified date thereafter. The first &#163;400,000has been paid. Mr Yates has suggested that the August 2022 arrangement unnecessarily overpays the investors and should be regarded in the context of the present case as an attempt by the husband to prefer the investors at the cost of the wife. There is indeed a case for arguing that the investors&#8217; strict entitlement (at the moment) is a lower figure than &#163;4.4mbut (having listened to the husband&#8217;s explanation as to why he did this) I am satisfied that it was not an unreasonable thing for him to do in the context of the reputational consequences of his actions and also in the context of the investor expectations and I have not been persuaded that it was litigation driven, i.e. motivated by his interests in the present case. Certainly, the case against the husband has not been put on the basis that what he has done puts him at risk of a <span style="font-style:italic">Norris</span> add-back on the grounds of wanton or reckless behaviour. I propose to deal with the case on the basis that the capital acknowledged as being owed to the investors in August 2022 is a legitimate call on the capital of the business.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The approach of Ms Hall to valuing the business has been radically different from that of the other two. She does not accept there is a meaningful EBITDA separate from the husband&#8217;s own earnings, not agreeing that, for a buyer of the business, his role could be performed by an employee on a salary of &#163;800,000 per annum (which the others have assumed in reaching their EBITDA figures). She does not accept the multipliers, being particularly unimpressed by Mr Strickland&#8217;s 5.5 figure. Further, she has concluded that the &#8216;Surplus Working Capital&#8217; and &#8216;Surplus Cash&#8217; figures advanced by the other experts are flawed, concluding that there is in reality little or no surplus cash once the balance sheet is properly analysed, either on the basis of a going concern or on a closing down basis. The following extracted passages from Ms Hall&#8217;s written report, supported by her oral evidence, identify her views:-</p>

I conclude that the Partnership is a &#8220;singleton&#8221; business which is dependent on [the husband]'s continued involvement. The revenue earned by [G LLP] is only partly recurring in nature and is almost exclusively generated by [the husband].&#160;I further conclude that a willing purchaser of a professional services business would ensure that any acquisition would be structured such that key fee earners or partners were tied in to enable a continuation of the existing income streams.&#160; Ms Hart acknowledges that her valuation assumes that [the husband] would enter into such an agreement. As I cannot envisage a willing buyer to entertain a transaction to acquire [G LLP] without onerous tie-in obligations, which would be contingent on future performance (or [the husband] being willing to enter into such an agreement with such conditions) I consider that the business has no market value to a third-party investor. I also consider the current and future value of the Partnership to [the husband]. I conclude that while [the husband] could continue earning a future income from [G LLP] (until retirement), he could similarly do so without [G LLP], that is to say without him being attached specifically to [G LLP].&#160; I consider that any such future income would be dependent primarily on [the husband]'s future endeavours (whether within or outside of [G LLP], as a sole proprietorship) and not dependent upon [G LLP].&#160;I consider that the current value of the Partnership to [the husband] relates specifically to the Partnership&#8217;s current available distributable profits which have arisen from the current financial year, but which have yet to be distributed (specifically up to 31 March 2023). Accordingly, I consider the value of the Partnership to [the husband] to be &#163;2.63m, before tax, comprising &#163;2.5 million of distributable profits plus &#163;100,000 relating to [the husband]'s investment in [K Ltd] and &#163;33,000 relating to [the husband]'s capital account.&#8221;</span></p>

I do not consider that these balances can be considered surplus or could conceivably be available to a potential buyer. I note that despite Mr Strickland adding &#8220;surplus cash&#8221; to arrive at his partnership value&#8221; he appears to recognise that most of the cash on the balance sheet would not be available to a buyer, stating: &#8216;I recognise that the likely structure of a transaction would be for most of the cash on the balance sheet to be distributed to the partners in the form of undrawn shares of profit. These amounts would be taxable as income on the members in their profit-sharing ratios for the year ended 31 March 2023, to the extent that they represented the profits for that year&#8217;</span>.&#8221;</p>

However, a scenario without these obligations is not one that a willing purchaser would consider, nor would [the husband] subscribe to a transaction with these obligations (i.e. why would [the husband] hand over his income stream to a third party so that they could share in the future reward generated solely by him?).&#8221;</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">An important part of the analysis carried out by Ms Hall (which, having heard her evidence and that of the husband, I accept) is that there are only two fee earners in the business (the husband and another individual) and that the husband earns approximately 90% of the fees within G LLP. He is able to do this because it is his business contacts, knowledge and reputation, gained through decades of work and experience, that are the reason why large corporate entities come to G LLP for their advice rather than another corporate finance adviser. The husband is able to delegate some of the implementation and execution work to other employees, but the work is brought in because of him. It is a curious feature of this case that this 90% figure (although in my view very important and given by the husband to Ms Hart when she was first instructed and apparently also given to Mr Strickland when he was first instructed) makes no appearance in either the report of Ms Hart or that of Mr Strickland. In a particularly telling part of Mr Strickland&#8217;s evidence it emerged that, if he read the note about the 90% analysis, he had not had it in mind when he wrote his report.

In contrast, when Ms Hall gave evidence on this subject, my impression was that she was on top of the subject and presented a credible and reliable picture. I have not been persuaded by Mr Strickland that there is any enterprise value to this business which could be sold. The exercise being carried out by Mr Strickland was, in reality, very close to a disguised valuation of the husband&#8217;s earning capacity, the very exercise which the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Waggott</span> made clear should not be contemplated by the court.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in">First, I want to mention the 'Build and Bequeath' model about which the husband spoke passionately in his evidence.  What he meant by this was that his model of running a business was to behave in the way which providers of professional services traditionally behaved. The providers of the services would give loyal and reliable service to the clients and, when they wished to retire, they would bequeath their practice to another generation, and would not seek to monetise it by packaging the service in a modern corporate way and selling it. The husband had a nostalgic view as to how this was done in better days in the financial world and that many of the difficulties of the modern financial world were caused by the general abandonment of this practice. He told me this was how the matter was dealt with when his previous partners left the firm (and I accept this evidence). I was quite able to believe the husband when he said this is what he intends to do with his practice at some, as yet unidentified, stage in the future. I was able to believe also that the old-fashioned decency which perhaps lies behind this philosophy has contributed towards his good reputation in the financial world and perhaps has helped him get work which he might not otherwise have got. Having said all this, the husband&#8217;s views on this subject did not play a major part in Ms Hall&#8217;s analysis and have not played a significant part in my analysis of whether the business is actually realistically saleable. The court&#8217;s approach should be to deal with a case on the basis that a party will reasonably maximise their financial position, including (notionally or actually) being expected to sell business interests if they reasonably can at the maximum amount reasonably attainable, just as they are expected (in a different context) to maximise their earning capacity. I have approached the case in this way, but have (as set out above) accepted Ms Hall&#8217;s view on whether a realistic sale price can be established on the evidence </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in">Secondly, the husband told me about an approach by another partnership to merge their businesses a few years ago. I note that this subject had not been disclosed to any of the experts prior to the husband&#8217;s oral evidence; but I accept the husband&#8217;s evidence that no capital was offered and that the talks came to nothing. In the circumstances, I have not been persuaded that this development has any meaningful effect on any issue in the case before me.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Thirdly, it has been drawn to my attention that in the past G LLP was involved in litigation for which there are reported judgments. Mr Yates sought to persuade me that some of the contents of these judgments ran contrary to what the husband said to me in the present case. I confirm that I have read these judgments and I do not agree with Mr Yates&#8217; suggestion. Indeed, in some ways the contents of these judgments corroborate what the husband has told me about G LLP. Overall, though, I have not found anything in these judgments which has a significant bearing on my present task.</p>

This may be of particular significance in applications for variation orders and interim variation orders or other cases where there is a risk of the costs becoming disproportionate to the amounts in dispute. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">The court will take a broad view of conduct for the purposes of this rule and will generally conclude that to refuse openly to negotiate reasonably and responsibly will amount to conduct in respect of which the court will consider making an order for costs</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">. This includes in a &#8216;needs&#8217; case where the applicant litigates unreasonably resulting in the costs incurred by each party becoming disproportionate to the award made by the court. Where an order for costs is made at an interim stage the court will not usually allow any resulting liability to be reckoned as a debt in the computation of the assets.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.5in">Before FPR 2010 Rule 28 existed in its present form (i.e. pre-2006) a court dealing with a  financial remedies case would, once judgment had been given, look at the without prejudice correspondence and a party who could establish that a Calderbank offer had been made by them which was equal or more favourable to the other party than the outcome of the case ordered by the court, would properly be able to claim to be the &#8216;winner&#8217; of the litigation and typically seek an inter partes costs order having their costs paid from the date of the relevant Calderbank offer. As a public policy decision, by the introduction of the new rule, which came to be in FPR 2010 Part 28, that approach was disavowed. Rightly or wrongly, the typical approach in civil litigation where the loser pays the costs of the winner was specifically disapplied in financial remedies litigation.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.5in">The wording of FPR 2010 PD 28A, paragraph 4.4, which was introduced in 2019, did not reintroduce (directly anyway) the rule, even as a starting point, that the loser pays the winner&#8217;s costs. What it did was to emphasise and underline the duty to negotiate openly, reasonably and responsibly. It is important to note that there is a distinction to be made between openly maintaining a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">reasonable</span> position which is ultimately rejected by the judge and openly maintaining an <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">unreasonable</span> position which is ultimately rejected by the judge. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.5in">Although I have ultimately and clearly preferred the evidence of Ms Hall over that of Mr Strickland, it does not follow from this determination that the wife&#8217;s decision to rely upon the view of Mr Strickland to underpin her open offer of 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022 and her open position at all subsequent times was either unreasonable or irresponsible. Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s suggestion that Mr Strickland&#8217;s report was so obviously wrong that no reasonable litigant would rely upon it is, in my view, overstating the position. It was only when the two experts were subjected to robust cross-examination that, for me, the view of Ms Hall became manifestly preferable. It does not therefore follow from the fact that I have preferred the husband&#8217;s case that the wife was being unreasonable or irresponsible in her open position or was guilty of any conduct which might place her in any of the Rule 28.3(7) categories.</p>

Ms Hall&#8217;s report is dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2023 and the meeting between Ms Hall and Mr Strickland, which crystallised the issues upon which they differed, did not occur until 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2023.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.25in">The wife&#8217;s conduct has been further criticised by Mr Chamberlayne on the basis that (either by virtue of my order of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022 or by virtue of FPR 2010 Rule 9.27A(1)(b)) she should have made an open offer by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2022. She did not in fact make an open offer until 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022 and this was after the husband had made a formal application to force her hand. The answer to this is, in my view, adequately (and colourfully) set out in Ms Vardag&#8217;s email dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2022 when she said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The papers we received from our predecessors were in, one might say, a right old mess, and arrived in a very drip-fed manner&#8230;some of the issues, particularly pertaining to the valuation&#8230;need to be carefully weighed in an informed manner. Of course we could send you an open offer. Rather than being the subjects of some sort of enforcement of course we could do that. But without having enough time to inform ourselves and make a considered proposal any such offer will be rather like Austin Powers&#8217; Dr Evil saying &#8216;one billion trillion dollars&#8217; rather than something that might genuinely drive settlement. Please don&#8217;t make us go through the pantomime of producing an offer just to produce one</span>.&#8221; Of course, the purpose of Rule 9.27A is to promote negotiation and settlement, but if (as here) there is a particular and good reason for holding back for a period then it is difficult to regard that as being regarded as bad conduct.</p>

Mr Farmer, who is of course very well known in the court, articulated with great courteousness, skill and persuasiveness the arguments which found favour when he articulated the very same arguments before Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">Gallagher v Gallagher</span> (No.1)(Reporting Restrictions) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/52" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 52" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 52</ref>. Mr Chamberlayne strongly argued that I should not contemplate the publication of the names of the parties and that the published judgment should be in a redacted and anonymised form, indeed he urged me to stick with my provisional view. Mr Yates expressed neutrality on the issue, but (I note) the wife had earlier willingly consented to a confidentiality clause in my order.</p>
