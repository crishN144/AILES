It was implicit in my agreement to this application being listed for today that it would be supplemental or ancillary to such a valid, effective, albeit as yet unadjudicated, application.  However, it now appears that there is in fact today no such valid application in being.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.08in">In my previous judgment, I recounted how, somewhat to my surprise, the Ukrainian court had rejected summarily the father&#8217;s application under the 1996 Hague Convention for recognition and enforcement of the order of Mr Nicholas Goodwin, made on 24 August 2018, requiring the return of the children.  They declined.  It was summarily rejected because the Ukrainian court was not satisfied that there had been effective service of notice of that hearing on Slava, notwithstanding that there was evidence that had confirmed the validity of his e-mail address.   </p>

However, I have been told that recently the father&#8217;s appeal against the summary rejection of that application has failed, with the result that there is today before the Ukrainian court no valid application under the 1996 Hague Convention.  In such circumstances I am being asked today to make supplemental or ancillary orders where the main substantive application simply does not appear to exist.   </p>

However, that basis on which I granted the stay has been shown to be unfounded.   It seems to me, therefore, that what must happen, first and foremost, is that I make an order lifting the stay on the father&#8217;s application made in January 2019 for a further order requiring the mother to return the children to England ando Wales and give directions for it to be heard.   </p>

The maternal grandfather has offered some faint approbation of the proposal for mediation.  His stance is that he would not oppose it if the court considered that mediation would be of assistance.  It has been memorably stated by Lord Justice Thorpe that there is no case, however conflicted, that is not capable of being resolved by mediation.  For the father to accept, in circumstances where he is legally completely in the right, to engage in mediation is not a sign of defeat.  It is not, to speak idiomatically, to run up the white flag.  But it does recognise realities in circumstances where the previous measure that the court has adopted of allowing full publicity has not borne fruit, at  least not yet, and where with every day that passes the damage that is being wrought by the impairment of the relationship between this man and his children becomes ever more profound.  </p>

The names of distinguished mediators have been put forward, originating both from the civil sphere as well as the family sphere.  The mediators in question have signified their willingness to travel to the Ukraine, or it may be that the mediation would take place in some neutral venue.  I would have thought that the mediation, to be successful, would need </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.08in">I would urge the parties very strongly to explore a mediated solution to this case.  A mediated solution to this case may in fact mean a solution which is at variance with that which I have determined to be in the best interests of these children and which has been upheld by the Court of Appeal.  But, even if the solution that is adopted is at variance with what the court has determined to be in the best interests of the children, that does not necessarily mean that it is of itself contrary to the interests of the children.  What is contrary to the interests of the children is the continuing severance of this relationship between this man and his children and if a compromise has to be found which is at variance with what I have ordered but still allows the rebuilding of that relationship, then that should be embraced.  This is not to reward wrongdoers; this is to recognise realities.  </p>

I am not today going to adjudicate on the applications which are before me for orders in various forms against the maternal grandfather.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.08in">Before I move to that point, I should also say something about Slava.  He has resolutely refused to engage in the proceedings and, of course, it was his so-called supposed non-service that has derailed the father&#8217;s first Hague application.  Ms Kirby has said in her written and oral submissions that father has no objection to Slava being discharged from the proceedings and, indeed, she would welcome his ejection from the proceedings as his presence seems to be an impediment to progress.  So, the order that I make today will discharge Slava as a party to the proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.08in">There are a number of reasons why I decline today to adjudicate on the positive orders that have been sought against the maternal grandfather.  Firstly, I believe that to make them would seriously jeopardise any chance of a negotiated solution to this case.  But, from a more legalistic point of view, I would wish to be satisfied that the orders that are being sought are in fact within the powers of the court to order.  Ms Kirby trenchantly argued that they were and when asked what the powers were, she said, well, they just exist.  I am not at all satisfied that the orders that were being made, which are of the character of anti-suit injunctions, are, in the light of the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v Grovit</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 101" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 101</ref>, within the power of the court to order when the other country is a subscriber to the Hague 1996 Convention.  <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v Grovit</span> was concerned with the situation where the other country was a subscriber to the 1968 Brussels Convention, which of course was the predecessor of the Brussel I and Brussels II Regulations passed by the European Council.  The Brussels 1968 Convention was a jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement regime in civil cases.  The Hague 1996 Convention is a jurisdiction, enforcement and recognition regime in children&#8217;s cases.  They are highly analogous.  The Court of Justice of European Union held that there was no jurisdiction to make an anti-suit injunction where proceedings in the other place had already been started  (and, of course, I come back to the point that there are no extant proceedings at the moment in the Ukraine, but if one looks at the situation as if there were such proceeding in the Ukraine).  The European Court of Justice&#8217;s decision was clear that there was no jurisdiction to make an anti-suit injunction in such circumstances, the reason being that it was, as stated in paragraph 27 of the judgment: </p>

So I would wish, if the applications are being pursued, to hear full argument about the extent of my powers to make what is, in effect, a form of anti-suit injunction, although it has to be said that the second order is not so much an anti-suit injunction but a mandatory injunction requiring a party to commence and act in a foreign suit in a certain way, which is an order I have never before encountered in any shape or form.  So I would wish to hear full argument on the next hearing (if these applications are pursued) as to the extent of my powers to grant them.</p>
