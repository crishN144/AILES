	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2023 I conducted a fact-finding hearing in private law proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> at the Family Court in Newcastle upon Tyne involving the parents of Z (randomly chosen letter), a girl aged 3 years. The principal factual issues related to alleged sexual abuse of Z by her father. Each party also raised allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour against the other. Before me each of the parents appeared as a litigant in person. The mother had the benefit of a legal aid certificate, but, having recently parted company with her solicitors, she was intent on representing herself and did not accept the court&#8217;s invitation to apply for an adjournment.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an order dated 28 September 2023 the court directed that the matter be listed for a two-day fact-finding hearing. In addition to other case management directions, the judge ordered the court to appoint and arrange for a QLR to cross examine the mother on the father&#8217;s behalf in circumstances where there were contested allegations of domestic abuse. I was told that, thereafter, the court office in Newcastle had undertaken no fewer than 120 different communications by email or telephone in an attempt to find a QLR, yet none could be found who was willing or available to take on the case. At the commencement of the hearing, I considered whether to adjourn so that there might be a further attempt to engage a QLR. Following the mother&#8217;s decision to proceed as a litigant in person, there was also a potential role for a second QLR to be appointed to ask questions on her behalf of the father. In the event, both parties were keen for the factual issues to be resolved without a further adjournment and I took the view, having taken advice from the court staff, that it was unlikely that any further attempt to find a QLR would be successful. The hearing therefore proceeded, as I will describe, on the basis that I, as the judge, would ask all of the questions of each of the two parties. No other witnesses were called.</p>

The relevant regulations are The Prohibition of Cross-Examination in Person (Fees of Court-Appointed Qualified Legal Representatives) Regulations 2022 [SI 2022/567]. By reg 2, the fees to be paid to a court appointed QLR are set out in the Schedule to the regulations. Where a QLR attends a preliminary hearing in a case, the rate of remuneration is, in part, determined by the length of hearing and, in part, by the level of judiciary conducting the hearing. Thus, for a preliminary hearing that lasts for less than 1 hour, the fee paid ranges from &#163;62.69 in a private law children case before lay justices or a legal adviser to &#163;82.76 before a High Court judge. Different rates apply to other forms of family proceedings: domestic abuse, financial remedy and public law children cases. If the preliminary hearing lasts between 1 hour and 2&#189; hours, the fee for a preliminary hearing in a private law children case ranges from &#163;156.74 to &#163;206.87. For a hearing in such a case where cross-examination takes place the range is from &#163;496.30 to &#163;655.09 for the first day and &#163;397.04 to &#163;524.07 for any subsequent day. No separate fee is payable for preparation or time spent meeting the party on whose behalf the QLR is asking questions, but, where the bundle of papers provided to the QLR exceeds 350 pages, a &#8216;bolt-on&#8217; fee is paid once per cross-examination hearing; if 351-700 pages it is &#163;159.30, for 701-1,400 pages it is &#163;239.40 and for over 1,400 pages it is &#163;318.60. </p>

The system operated by HMCTS [His Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service] is based upon QLRs registering with a local court. The guidance allows for those who are committed to attending a training course within six months to be registered as a QLR with HMCTS. The latest published figures from HMCTS are now of some age. They show that, as at July 2023, 428 lawyers had registered for the scheme and, of these, 258 had completed the necessary training.

The validity of that statement is unlikely to be controversial in the eyes of judges and magistrates.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The lodestar for a judge, magistrate or legal adviser who takes on the task of asking questions on behalf of an unrepresented litigant in these circumstances must be fairness. In every case a fairness should require the court to be very open with the parties as to the process that is going to be adopted by explaining what is to happen, step by step, at the start in short straight forward terms. The court should explain that it is taking on the role of asking questions in order for the hearing to proceed in the absence of a QLR, and where there is no other satisfactory alternative. In this judgment I have deliberately avoided describing the process of the court asking questions as &#8216;cross-examination&#8217;, and I suggest that courts should also refer to it as the court &#8216;asking questions that the other party wishes to have asked&#8217;, or a similar phrase (rather than using the phrase &#8216;cross-examination&#8217;).</p>

This is the tricky path that must be trodden to which I have already made reference. Judges who were, or, if fee-paid judges, still are, practising advocates are likely to feel a temptation to move into full cross-examination mode if, as may be the case, they get the sense that the witness may not be telling the truth. That temptation must be resisted, not only because to do so is likely to increase the prospect of the process being unfair, but also because, in doing so, the judge is likely to become partisan and potentially blind to other factors in the case at a premature stage, and thereby hamper their ability properly to evaluate all of the evidence in the manner described by Baker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">K and L</span>. The essential difference between the court asking questions and a lawyer instructed by the party doing so is that the court is merely acting as a channel of communication and not as an advocate seeking a particular answer to a question or, more generally, a particular outcome to the case.</p>

Hayden J upheld the appellant&#8217;s core criticism of the judge, which was that, in honing and refining down his detailed questions, they were rendered superficial and over-simplified to a degree that minimised their potential value. Hayden J described the approach that the judge should have taken [paragraph 16]:</p>

A litigant in person is far more exposed than a represented party. The content, focus and style of the questions often reveal the personality of the litigant, long before he enters the witness box. It is clear to me that the Judge formed a very adverse impression of F, he considered him to be arrogant to the point that he regarded himself as &#8220;god like&#8221;. The disagreeable and the arrogant are of course as entitled to a fair trial as the polite and amenable.&#8217;</p>

This requirement, alongside the countervailing one for the court to avoid entering the arena, is what makes the judicial task a tricky one. In contrast to the first instance judge in <span style="font-style:italic">PS v BP</span>, the court must not edit, neutralise, or otherwise defuse the questions that a party seeks to have asked so as to minimise their potential value. The task that the court undertakes by asking questions is intended to be an alternative to cross-examination, so that the case of the prohibited party is fairly and properly put to the other party.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">It must always be borne in mind that in the overarching framework of Children Act proceedings, the central philosophy is investigative. Even though fact finding hearings, of the nature contemplated here, have a highly adversarial complexion to them the same principle applies. Thus, it may be perfectly possible, without compromising fairness to either side, for the Judge to conduct the questioning in an open and less adversarial style than that deployed in a conventional cross-examination undertaken by a party&#8217;s advocate.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with all that Hayden J says in that passage, and I commend his wise advice in all cases where a court is driven to take on the task of asking questions in these circumstances. The reference made in (i), (ii) and (iii) to a ground rules hearing is of particular importance. FPR, PD3AA, which makes provision for &#8216;vulnerable persons: participation in proceedings and giving evidence&#8217; is plainly of relevance and must be adhered to where it applies. FPR, r 3A.2A sets out the assumption that where it is stated that a party or witness is, or is at risk of being, a victim of domestic abuse carried out by a party, relative of a party, or witness in the proceedings, they are vulnerable. Where the court has decided that a vulnerable party or witness should give evidence, PD3AA, para 5.2 requires that there must be a ground rules hearing prior to any hearing where the evidence is to be heard. Paragraphs 5.3-5.7 make detailed provision for ground rules hearings in cases of this nature and paragraph 5.5 deals with the conduct of cross-examination:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">The default position for the full hearing should be for the QLR to be in attendance at court, rather than joining remotely, as the overall effectiveness and fairness of the process is likely to be diminished if they are not in the courtroom;</p>

The list should go to the QLR, or to the court if there is no QLR, but not to the witness or other parties. This process should not prevent the prohibited party from identifying additional questions that may arise during the hearing;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, whilst it is to be hoped that, in time, the continued training programme and the ability to claim travel expenses will increase the availability of QLRs, there will inevitably remain some cases where there is no alternative but for the court to ask the questions itself. Unsatisfactory though that process plainly is, in such cases it will be necessary in order to deliver a just, fair and timely conclusion to proceedings. Where that is the case, the advice in this judgment is intended to assist the court in navigating the tricky path between ensuring that the opposing case is put fully, fairly and properly, but doing so without entering the arena. </p>
