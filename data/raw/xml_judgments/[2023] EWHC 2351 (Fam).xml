The family lived in England but moved to Portugal in 2020. After financial difficulties due to third party fraud, in 2022 the mother took up employment in England. The children stayed with G in Portugal. After a visit home to Portugal the mother returned to England on 22 January 2023 taking F with her, without G&#8217;s consent. She admits that at the time this was a wrongful removal within the meaning of Article 3 of the 1980 Hague Convention. However, on 25 January 2023 the mother applied to the Portimao District Court in Portugal for what may be termed a child arrangements order and on 3 May 2023 that court made &#8220;provisional&#8221; orders including (in translation) that &#8220;The boy, F, shall be entrusted to the care of his mother and shall live with her&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Case management directions were given at a first hearing on 24 March 2023 at which the mother confirmed her reliance on Art 13(b): grave risk of harm/intolerability, and Art 13(2):  child&#8217;s objections. She has conceded that she removed F from Portugal on 22 January 2023 without consent and that the removal was wrongful at the time. The parties agreed an extended timetable after non-compliance with those directions. By 3 July 2023, the court had statements from each party and a Cafcass report from Ms Demery. </p>

Mr Gration KC submits that it merely recognises the reality of the child arrangements in place and was not designed to defeat the father&#8217;s Hague application. He points to the wording of the determination that the order is made &#8220;in order to regulate the current situation of the children&#8221; and to ensure that the children have contact with their parents. He highlights the questions raised in the determination about the proceedings in England, and draws attention to paragraph (c) of the Hague Network Judge&#8217;s response, which leaves open whether the Court &#8220;in the area of the child&#8217;s residence may be better placed to assess the welfare and quality of life of the child.&#8221; </p>

As the Network Judge has also clarified, the Portuguese court is in fact seised with jurisdiction over F&#8217;s welfare but will take into account evidence in the England and Wales Cafcass report about his welfare.

In these circumstances, the order of the Spanish court should be recognised and given force by this court in accordance with Council Regulation (EC)No.2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of Parental Responsibility (Brussels II b), which, by Article 60(e) provides that, in relation to Member States, the provisions of Brussels II b "take precedence over the [Hague Convention 1980] in so far as they concern matters governed by Brussels II b".&#8221;</p>

In this case, as a result of proceedings initiated by the mother in Spain, by the time the matter comes before this court for decision as to whether an order for the return of the child should be granted under the terms of the Hague Convention, those purposes have been achieved, in the sense there has been a full and careful hearing of the issue by a Spanish court in possession of all the relevant facts going to its welfare decision, as well as the full circumstances of the father's removal of the children. The Spanish court has specifically vested interim custody in the father on the basis that the children should continue to reside in England with the father as their main carer, and with appropriate and beneficial educational arrangements, pending a full and final hearing.</p>

In the unusual circumstances of this case, namely where immediately following removal of the child, the mother commenced custody proceedings in Spain, the adverse result of which was determined before the hearing of her Hague Convention application, an order made in pursuit of object (a) would conflict with object (b). Common sense would suggest that it should not be necessary to resort to the provisions of Brussels II b in order to resolve this conflict, but to adopt instead an appropriate internal construction of the provisions of the Hague Convention in order to do so. That could readily be done, as it seems to me, were it not for the established Convention jurisprudence that removal and retention are mutually exclusive concepts, each being distinct events occurring on a specific occasion and that it is impossible for them to overlap or be treated as an ongoing process: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H, Re S (Minors) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 AC 476" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 AC 476</ref> at 498-499.

The father held rights of custody pursuant to the orders of the Texan court and he was exercising his rights, or would have exercised those rights but for the removal. The return order did not curtail his rights of custody but authorised removal in spite of his rights. Article 3 of the Convention requires a ruling on whether the father exercised rights at the date of the hearing before Sir Peter Singer.

In my judgment the 1980 Abduction Convention was never foreseen or intended to be used in present circumstances. Once there has been a lawful departure, annulled 12 months later by a successful appeal, in my opinion only Article 18 (and in an English context the inherent jurisdiction) provides a remedy for the successful appellant.&#8221;</p>

Firstly, it might encourage abducting parents to abduct first and apply to the court later, rather than to apply for permission to relocate in advance of taking their child out of the jurisdiction of their habitual residence. This is particularly important because a known trigger for abduction is anxiety about a pending court decision. Secondly, it would lead to uncertainty, inconsistency, and potential delay in applications which the court in the receiving state is encouraged to dispose of summarily. One court could proceed on the basis that there was a wrongful removal only for another court to make decisions about child arrangements that would render the removal lawful. The court determining a Hague application for return might be invited to await the outcome of court proceedings in another jurisdiction in order to determine whether the removal had been wrongful or not. </p>

It seems to me that the mother&#8217;s case that an admitted wrongful removal can be subsequently rendered lawful by a court order in the state in which the child was habitually resident prior to the removal, is wrong. It is contrary to long established authority that a wrongful removal takes place in a fixed place and time, it would be inconsistent with the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision on the second ground of appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">DL v EL</span> (above), it would create incentives to act in ways that are clearly contrary to the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention, and risk uncertainty and delays in return order applications that would be contrary to the stated object of the Convention to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained in a contracting state.

Having determined that the removal was wrongful then Article 3 and Article 12 require a return order to be made unless one of the defences under Article 13 is made out and in which case the court has a discretion not to order return. However, I have already found that in the light of the Portuguese Court order of 3 May 2023, a return order would be futile &#8211; the mother could immediately return F lawfully to England. The court must manage cases having regard to proportionality and an appropriate allocation of resources. The order in Portugal is an interim order. The family court there is seised of F&#8217;s welfare (and that of his sister) and will receive evidence from the Cafcass Officer who has advised in these proceedings. It is clear that further consideration will be given to F&#8217;s welfare in the jurisdiction in which he was habitually resident when removed in January this year.

However, the Portuguese order is an interim or &#8220;provisional&#8221; order made at the first hearing and before any significant welfare inquiries. The Portuguese court expressed the need for it to be given more information about the proceedings in England. This is a case of an admitted wrongful removal of an eight year old boy who has a sibling still living in Portugal. There is therefore a realistic possibility that changes may be made to the interim child arrangements orders and that the Portuguese court may make orders which would not prevent, or may even require, the return of F to Portugal. If so, this court could be well placed to act to act summarily under the 1980 Hague Convention to secure his return or to find that the defences under Art 13 are made out and exercise a discretion not to order return. </p>
