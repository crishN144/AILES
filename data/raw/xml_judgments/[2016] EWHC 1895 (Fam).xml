I&#160;refused that application for reasons I&#160;gave in a short judgment.  I&#160;did not consider it necessary to adjourn the case to enable a fair hearing to take place.  This decision has, in my view, been confirmed during the course of the hearing.  The husband has been able to participate fully and, if I might say so, effectively.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The wife&#8217;s application is under Part III because the parties were divorced in France.  The French court has made an order in the wife&#8217;s favour of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">prestation compensatoire</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, which is a capitalised maintenance award.  The remaining financial consequences of the divorce in France have not yet been concluded.  I&#160;deal with this in more detail below, but, simply stated, under French law the parties are entitled to an equal share of the marital wealth.  The manner in which this is to be effected will be determined by the French court on application by either party pursuant to a judicial liquidation process.  At present, neither party has made such application.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Given the absence of a determination, agreed or imposed in France, I&#160;consider it important that my decision should not conflict with the prospective process in France.  This applies both to the substance of any order I&#160;might make as well as to the extent of the issues I&#160;address.  For example, if an issue is likely, or appears to be likely, to be part, or sufficiently part, of the French process, I&#160;consider I&#160;should not seek to address it in these proceedings.  I&#160;make these observations at the start of my judgment, because it brings what I&#160;regard as being a necessary focus which has not been a feature of the way in which I&#160;consider the wife&#8217;s case to have been advanced.</span></p>

I&#160;do not consider it appropriate or necessary to address all of these in this judgment.  This is, in part, for the reasons given above, but also because they are not all sufficiently relevant to the issues which I&#160;must address.  I&#160;mention this latter aspect to explain, in particular to the husband, why I&#160;do not address the historical issues about which he feels very strongly.  These include the circumstances in which the marriage came to an end.  I&#160;do not do so because they are not relevant for the purposes of these proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I should add that, in part, so many issues have been raised because the husband and the wife have the misfortune of having been engaged in proceedings for nearly ten years.  This has given ample opportunity for different issues to become potentially relevant, or to be considered by the parties to be relevant, because of the developing situation.  Further, the inevitable strain on the parties caused by the various proceedings, some of which are referred to in my judgment below, was only too evident during the course of the hearing.  I&#160;also have no doubt that it has had an effect on the ability of the husband and the wife to give objective evidence.  Their evidence is, or has been, in my view, heavily influenced by their developed perspectives of the history.</span></p>

The parties spent their whole marriage living in France, where they had their principal matrimonial home.  Following the breakdown of the marriage the wife and children moved to live in London in 2007, initially in rented accommodation paid for by the husband.  Since July 2010, the wife, and at times the children, have occupied WH.</span></p>

This was sold in the early 1990s and the family moved to Paris.  The husband began to work as an intermediary in the negotiation of contracts between the French Government and other Governments.  As the husband describes it, he was initially an emissary without title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in France.  This then expanded so he became an intermediary acting in relations between France and other States, in particular, so it appears, Pakistan, Syria and Libya.  </span></p>

The precise extent of this wealth during the marriage is not clear, but some indication can be obtained from the fact that the family had available to it valuable properties in Paris, Cap d&#8217;Antibes and London.  It is the wife&#8217;s case that WH was purchased as the family&#8217;s London home.  The husband disputes this, asserting that it was never a home. </span></p>

They included conduct by the husband and Mr.&#160;Takla which was inconsistent with the existence of the sale; a &#8220;whole series of transactions&#8221; after the date of the alleged sale which indicated that the husband rather than Mr.&#160;Takla remained the ultimate owner of corporate structure, including the deployment of funds held within the structure; the failure by WEL, if then owned ultimately by Mr.&#160;Takla, to challenge the wife&#8217;s Matrimonial Home Rights Notice or a charge registered by solicitors in respect of costs owed by the husband against WH; and the fact that, if genuine, the sale would have been effected at a significant undervalue given the value of the assets owned by Alveston, including WH.</span></p>

They range widely and cover a number of transactions and prospective transactions between 1997 and 2013 or 2014.  This evidence seeks to address the extent of the husband&#8217;s worldwide wealth.  The statement also exhibits the Barclays report referred to above, which records the husband stating, as I&#160;have indicated, that he owns assets valued in total at &#163;67&#160;million.  Specifically, the wife alleges that since the parties separated, and more particularly since June 2007, the husband has transferred sums totalling &#8364;41&#160;million to Lebanon.  </span></p>

It clearly raises issues which will form part of any liquidation proceedings in France, and which, in my view, it would not be appropriate for me to address given the difficulties that this would be likely to create for those proceedings.  For example, the report of Professor&#160;Devers makes clear that the French court has power to deal with the assets transferred by the husband to the Lebanon as diverted or concealed assets.  Further, the documents and the evidence relied on by the wife duplicate that relied on by her in France.

Additionally, there is a significant question over whether the French court would have jurisdiction in respect of WH.  In my judgment, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to leave the issue unresolved and to require the parties to test the scope of the French courts powers and jurisdiction in prospective proceedings.

It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts.  But I&#160;venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company.  In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership.  Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine.  But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:-1in"><marker name="tab"/><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;&#8230; the proper approach to Part III simply depends on a careful application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 16</ref>, 17 and 18 in the light of the legislative purpose, which was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where there were substantial connections with England.  There are two, inter-related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III.  The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application:  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>.  The second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18.  There are two reasons why the duties are inter-related.  First, neither <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16(1)</ref> directs the court to have regard to &#8216;all the circumstances of the case&#8217; and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> refers the court to certain matters &#8216;in particular&#8217;. Second, some of the matters to be considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref> may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa.  An obvious example would be that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court.  Plainly that would be relevant under section 18.  So also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, to have regard to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue.&#8221;</span></p>

I&#160;do not, however, consider that I&#160;should become engaged in these issues because they are likely to be the subject of determination in France.

The wife has an argument that the deployment by the husband of the mortgage proceeds which were obtained after June 2007 should result in the mortgage being deducted only from his half share.  However, in my view, a more prudent and appropriate exercise of this court&#8217;s powers would be to permit the wife to enforce against the husband&#8217;s notional half share the costs orders obtained against him in this jurisdiction, and I&#160;will hear submissions on this in due course, and also potentially in respect of the costs orders obtained against WEL, and for the enforcement against the husband&#8217;s notional share of the outstanding amount due in respect of the French court&#8217;s award of capitalised maintenance.  In this way I&#160;consider that I&#160;would not be creating any risk of conflict and I&#160;would be exercising this court&#8217;s powers, in applying the French court&#8217;s current determination and award, in a fairer and more appropriate manner than that proposed by the wife.</span></p>

I&#160;acknowledge that the precise extent of a fair allocation will not be known until the conclusion of the French judicial liquidation process.  However, I&#160;see no real prospect of the wife receiving less than a half share of WH, and I&#160;certainly do not consider it necessary or fair to delay determination in respect of the wife&#8217;s claim under Part III until the French process has concluded.  This is unlikely to transpire in the near future, given the complexity of the husband&#8217;s financial affairs and the need for the resolution of other investigations in France.  I&#160;would, in essence, as submitted by Mr.&#160;Hale, be permitting the wife an interim implementation and enforcement of the French court&#8217;s determination and award.  </span></p>
