	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.04in">After nearly 22 years of marriage, which must have contained happy times together and during which 3 children were born to whom the Husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) and Wife (&#8220;W) are devoted, this couple embarked on ruinous and recriminatory financial remedy proceedings. There have been 13 oral hearings, including 2 FDRs and an aborted 5day trial, and 4 applications by H for permission to appeal disposed of on paper at High Court and Court of Appeal level.  The combined legal costs are &#163;594,000. The litigation, and attendant bitterness, has led to fractured relations between H and the children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.04in">One might be forgiven for assuming that all this energy has been expended over great wealth.  This is not so.  The only liquid asset of any substance is the proceeds of sale of the FMH, some &#163;630,000 currently held on solicitors&#8217; account. That sum is now all but offset by the parties&#8217; debts, not least the legal fees. Thus, the true net liquid wealth is virtually nil.  I am left with the task of endeavouring to find a way in which each party can somehow be re-housed. That, in my judgment, is and always has been the real issue in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.04in">An equal division of &#163;630,000 would be &#163;315,000 per party from which each would have to meet their indebtedness.  W&#8217;s open proposal at the start of trial was broadly for that outcome, but subject to the sum of &#163;52,000 being top sliced to repay her brother who paid the mortgage for a period after separation. Thus, on her case each party would receive &#163;289,000.  H in his open proposal sought &#163;480,000.  The difference between the parties&#8217; offers is &#163;191,000. The legal costs are 3 times that figure. It is hard to express what a calamitous waste of resources this has been.   </p>

They lived in a 5-bedroom family home in London (&#8220;the FMH&#8221;). They had regular holidays and ate out frequently. To an extent, the lifestyle was underpinned by W&#8217;s parents who, in particular, largely met the children&#8217;s education costs. H told me, and I accept, that for a number of years they lived beyond their means.  He was in overall charge of the finances but I formed the impression that W had at least some idea of the indebtedness.  Certainly, before the marriage came to an end, they had decided to sell the FMH home and downsize so as to ease the considerable burden of mortgage and debt. </p>

There is a welter of narrative documentation from each party about the circumstances of the separation which I do not need to enter into.  Suffice to say that W remained at the marital home and H moved out.  Of more significance is the agreed fact that during this initial separation period W considered retaining the FMH by redeeming the mortgage (c&#163;550,000) and buying out H with payment of &#163;350,000 (his share of the net equity).  She had no capacity to fund this herself.  Her brother offered to facilitate it by remortgaging the FMH in the sum of about &#163;900,000.  </p>

An inquiry by the company revealed, so it was alleged, a number of misdemeanours by H while Managing Director. His resignation was met with a company letter dated 31 July 2018 stating an intention to investigate &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">serious concerns about your own conduct</span>&#8221;.  The dispute between the company (and thereby W&#8217;s family) and H rapidly spilled over into the divorce and became a proxy war in the Family Court.  </p>

His application for permission to appeal was dismissed on paper by a High Court Judge.

The order at that hearing records: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Upon the applicant confirming to the court and to the respondent that the conduct on which she seeks to rely is</span>&#8230;&#8221; and goes on to set out specific instances of alleged misappropriation of the children&#8217;s money to which W had adverted in her Form E. The order required H to reply to those allegations of conduct in his s25 statement, which had not yet been filed. No mention was made of the other allegations referable to H&#8217;s conduct as Managing Director of B Ltd. Therefore, and quite clearly, only matters relating to the children&#8217;s money fell within the pleaded conduct case to be addressed at trial.  </p>

W counterargued that if so, which she disputed, she was entitled to rely on H&#8217;s alleged misconduct while Managing Director of B Ltd. as one of the circumstances of the case.  She did not expressly rely on conduct, within the s25(2)(g) meaning, but argued that H&#8217;s actions constituted a general factor to take into account on this specific point; as her counsel put it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a shield, not a sword</span>&#8221;.  The judge appears to have accepted the argument, at least while hearing evidence, and did not exclude references to conduct which went beyond the children&#8217;s money. On the last day of the September hearing he made orders for further inquiry into H&#8217;s alleged financial misconduct. Thus, he went beyond that which had been set out with crystal clarity in the PTR order. </p>

His reasons were that (i) there is no place for conduct to feature merely as one of the general circumstances and (ii) if conduct is to be pursued, it must be specifically pleaded under s25(2)(g) with each party having the opportunity to deal with the allegations in narrative evidence.  Otherwise parties will be encouraged to introduce acts or omissions through the back door which they are not permitted to introduce through the front door.

There is no suggestion that the monies are being demanded, or will be demanded in the near future. There are no loan agreements. They will not be sued upon. I formed the clear impression that W expects matters between herself and her family to work themselves out.  W&#8217;s family have shown considerable willingness to assist W financially, both during the marriage and since separation.  Notably, they were willing to assist in the proposed retention of the marital home for W by buying out H.  In my view, these fall to be treated as soft loans. W understandably feels a moral obligation to repay them, but I consider that her family will reconcile the sums due at a later date and as part of a family arrangement.  They are not debts which should appear on the schedule save only that the capital part of the mortgage redeemed by W&#8217;s brother from June 2018 to September 2019 should be deducted and repaid to him. Otherwise, the parties would be benefiting by an increase in the value of their jointly owned property, a windfall to them which would be unfair to W&#8217;s brother. I do not accept H&#8217;s submission that W&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the property sale in 2018 offsets this mortgage redemption; the decision to sell was before separation, whereas W&#8217;s retreat from that decision took place after separation, as a very different landscape unfolded before her. Accordingly, &#163;33,000 will be deducted as a debt. </p>

On its face, therefore, the gross value of the business might increase to &#163;1.35m.  Against that, in common with numerous businesses across the land, the Supreme Court judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake is awaited.  If the Supreme Court reverse the Court of Appeal, care workers who &#8220;sleep in&#8221; are entitled to the minimum wage for time spent not actually performing specific duties.  There could be a back-pay claim against A Ltd. which would reduce the value of the company and cash reserves; the company has not put aside a contingency fund for this eventuality, although W speculates that there might be a &#163;500,000 cost to the company.

She owns 24% which computes at &#163;282,000 gross (A Ltd.) and &#163;82,560 gross (B Ltd.). The SJE has applied a 50% discount to those figures to reflect the minority shareholding.  I do not agree.  These are family businesses.  The family is likely to act in concert on major decisions, such as sale; W has not involved herself and has always been content simply to fall in with the other shareholders.  There is no suggestion that W would contemplate a sale of her shares alone. Their personal relationships are strong, with no evidence of major internal disputes or quarrels. They have rallied around W during the proceedings. This, in my judgment, bears all the hallmarks of a quasi-partnership and I will therefore not attribute a valuation discount (see Coleridge J in <span style="font-weight:bold">G v G [2002] EWHC 1339</span>).  In fairness, the SJE acknowledged that quasipartnership was a matter for the court rather than him, he had not been instructed to comment on it, he had not considered it and it was outside his expertise. </p>

Total directors&#8217; remuneration has similarly declined, from &#163;717,000 in 2015 to &#163;233,000 in 2019. It may be that profitability is restored in due course.

Her parents have been generous to W in the past, in particular with financial support for the children.   At the time of the breakdown of the marriage, her brother stepped in with a proposal to buy out H and enable W to continue to live at the FMH. To do that would have required him to effect a remortgage of &#163;900,000 (&#163;550,000 for the existing mortgage and &#163;350,000 to H); W described this as her and her brother co-owning the property.  In an open proposal made in June 2019 an offer was made by W on the basis of her brother paying H a lump sum of &#163;125,000 (I assume on the same plan of a remortgage to redeem the existing &#163;550,000 mortgage).   </p>

I do not consider that she would have made that proposal if she truly thought there would be no assistance forthcoming from her family who are clearly of reasonably substantial means.  I am quite sure that her wider family will not see her homeless. In closing submissions, her counsel accepted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">W will need some family assistance&#8221;</span> which seemed to me to be realistic. That will most likely be securing a mortgage, probably on similar terms to those discussed in 2018. </p>

Obviously the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit it is of lesser importance, that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy their contact time with him. Of course there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course there are cases where there is only enough to provide one. But in any case where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome."  </span></p>
