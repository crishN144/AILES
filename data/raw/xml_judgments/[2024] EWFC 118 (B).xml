This coincides with the period of the parties&#8217; brief separation in 2019. It is signed by the husband and his mother. It is not signed by the wife. This is curious and invites suspicion about what on earth is going on, given that S Close was in the wife&#8217;s name only and there is reference to a property in the agreement. It is for the sum of &#163;185,000, noting the borrower will make repayment &#8220;in full upon re-mortgage or sale of property&#8221;. The property is not identified. </p>

This statement is not accurate. There are two advances only on 17 and 21 May 2018, respectively for &#163;15,000 and &#163;10,000, which are marked as loans. The rest are not so marked.</p>

I am left somewhat confused by this step as, if the loan was property related, the property at S Close was in the wife&#8217;s name, but she does not appear as a party to the agreement.</p>

Usually, non-marital wealth has one or more of three origins, namely (i) property brought into the marriage by one or other party, (ii) property generated by one or other party after separation (for example by significant earnings) and/or (iii) inheritances or gifts received by one or other party. Difficult questions can arise as to whether and to what extent property which starts out as non-marital acquires a marital character requiring it to be divided under the sharing principle. It will all depend on the circumstances, and the court will look at when the property was acquired, how it has been used, whether it has been mingled with the family finances and what the parties intended.</p>

Obviously the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit of lesser importance that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy contact time with him. Of course there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course there are cases where there is only enough to provide for one. But in any case where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome.&#8221;</p>

Two people concerned with A Property Management were individuals called Laura and Lucy.

At around the time D Street was being first marketed, the husband had an argument with Laura and Lucy about the valuation at &#163;1.1M. It was not really their responsibility (A Property Management was not part of Haart). Nevertheless, the husband appears to have been asserting that Laura and/or Lucy thought the property was worth no more than &#163;650,000 based, I think, on their earlier assessments.</p>

I do not believe the husband. The husband&#8217;s mother is in the unhappy position of being dragged into this by her son and feels she must support him, even if that requires her to confirm things which are not true. So often the judge&#8217;s refuge is back in the contemporaneous documents, but I cannot rely on those here either. </p>

By contending for the equity in the family home and leaving the husband with the equity in ABC Properties Ltd, he would neatly side-step, if I accede to all or some of his case, problems in the realisation of equity out of ABC Properties Ltd which also involve the interests of an un-joined third party, Mr B. It was not his instructions to concede that his client was not due a loan repayment of &#163;125,000, on account of her having paid this to settle the company&#8217;s indebtedness with the husband&#8217;s mother. However, he wisely recognised that his way forward with &#8220;least traction&#8221; was not to include the repayment of the &#163;125,000 from ABC Properties Ltd, with all of the implications that would have for involving a third party.</p>

It will be recalled that the wife held the legal title to this property in her sole name. The beneficial ownership of this property has not been placed under the microscope during this hearing, nor did it need to be. The parties bought and sold property as a couple, sometimes putting the legal title in the wife&#8217;s name. Nothing turns on this.   Whilst there was no detailed argument about it, standing back, the money was most likely paid by the wife at the behest of the husband for and on behalf of the company as its agent. The organisation of the husband&#8217;s personal and business affairs has at times been chaotic. The money should have been recorded as a loan repayment from the company, but it was not. That does not mean that the wife becomes the beneficial owner of the money and entitled to the repayment of a &#163;125,000 loan from the company which she has advanced to it. Even if I am wrong, the procedural and costs implications of trying to extract a loan from this company which involves a third party would make this a disproportionate endeavour. Mr Perrins is correct in identifying the path with &#8220;least traction&#8221; as practically the only way forward here, even if that is not precisely his client&#8217;s case.</p>

Whilst I do not make my award in the expectation that the wife&#8217;s parents will necessarily step in and make up the shortfall, I am mindful of the fact that they have shown their ability and willingness to assist where necessary. </p>

I have firmly in mind the analysis to be found in <span style="font-style:italic">S v AG (Financial Orders: Lottery Prize) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 FLR 651" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 FLR 651</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">FB v PS </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 2 FLR 697" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 2 FLR 697</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">D v D (Financial Remedies: Pre-Marital Agreement and Unequal Shares)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2020] 2 FLR 662" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] 2 FLR 662</ref>.

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">My provisional view on costs is that the husband cannot conduct himself in the manner in which he has done in this litigation and there be no consequences. I have in mind FPR 28.3(5) which has as a starting point no order as to costs in financial remedy proceedings. By FPR 28.3(6) and (7) that starting point can be departed from. It will be apparent from my judgment that I do not consider that the husband has been reasonable in the manner in which he has conducted this litigation. However, I must also take into the financial effect of any costs order. The husband has a much more limited pot from my primary disposition and so my preliminary view on costs is to limit any order to &#163;20,000. I also have in mind that the wife is having her litigation loan cleared by my primary disposition.</p>
