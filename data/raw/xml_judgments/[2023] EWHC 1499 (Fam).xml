	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent is aged 50, the Appellant 42. The Respondent is of British and Pakistani heritage. His parents both died over twenty years ago. He is particularly close to an auntie, aunt D. The Appellant was born and brought up on an island which is an overseas department of France, but came to live in England when she was aged 18 to train to become a teacher. She completed her training, secured work as a teacher, and now has settled status here. They are both Muslim. Their marriage in 2007 was arranged after an introduction by a cousin of the Respondent who was a work colleague of the Appellant. Her parents and male relatives of the Respondent spoke and agreed to the marriage. The religious ceremony took place on the French island where the Appellant had grown up, only three months after the parties had met. A civil ceremony then took place in England. They had had little social interaction before the marriage. They have had two children but their first child tragically died at the age of nine months. Their surviving child, a boy, C, is aged eight. In 2015, whilst the Appellant was pregnant with C, the couple ceased to have sexual intercourse although they continued to share a bed. Two years after C was born, the Respondent moved out of the marital bedroom. In 2019, the parties attended a joint mediation session with a view to separating. In October 2020, the Appellant and C travelled abroad to the island of the Appellant&#8217;s birth with the Respondent&#8217;s knowledge. Two months later, the Respondent received a message via the Appellant&#8217;s solicitor saying that she would not be returning to England with C because of domestic violence. In fact, I was informed at the appeal hearing, she returned with C in December 2020 but lived in a refuge. In January 2021 the Respondent issued an application for a Child Arrangements Order and a few months later the Appellant made a cross-application. The Court made directions for a finding of fact hearing on the Appellant&#8217;s allegations. The hearing was conducted by Recorder Roscoe (&#8220;the Judge&#8221;) over three days between 12 and 15 September 2022 following which he handed down judgment on 27 September 2022. </p>

The Appellant had made four statements but the third and fourth concerned issues of contact only.

The allegation of physical abuse by striking the Appellant with a towel was not pursued at the finding of fact hearing having been removed at a Pre Hearing Review. Accepting that paragraphs other than those set out above did allege other forms of coercive and controlling behaviour and psychological abuse, and were therefore relevant to patterns of behaviour of which the sexual abuse was said to be a part, the specific evidence of sexual abuse over a seven year period was nevertheless lacking in detail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be noted that the allegation of sexual abuse that the Judge was invited to find proved was that the Appellant &#8220;felt a great deal of pressure to meet the father&#8217;s sexual expectations.&#8221; As I shall describe, when making his findings about alleged sexual abuse, the Judge referred to coercion, manipulation, forced sex, and rape. Sexual abuse may take many different forms and it is important to be clear as to what form of sexual abuse is alleged. The Appellant&#8217;s skeleton argument refers to pressures on her to submit to intercourse such as cultural expectations, religious observances, pressure from family members, and the arranged marriage. I clarified with Dr Proudman what the Appellant&#8217;s case had been before the Judge, and what it was now, in relation to the Respondent&#8217;s role in pressurising the Appellant to meet his sexual desires and expectations. She was anxious to avoid asserting that the Respondent&#8217;s<span style="font-style:italic"> intentions</span> were relevant to whether he had been sexually abusive, but did confirm that the Appellant&#8217;s case had been and remained that the Respondent exploited the Appellant&#8217;s isolation and vulnerability, and &#8220;weaponised&#8221; their shared religion to coerce her into sexual intercourse. It was not that the Appellant felt she had to submit to intercourse only because it was generally expected of her, but rather that the Respondent forced her to do so by threats and coercion related, in part, to their shared religion and culture. Her second witness statement might be read as limiting this sexual abuse to times when other family members were in the house, but that is not the Appellant&#8217;s case &#8211; she alleges that, daily from 2007 to 2015, the Respondent would force her to have intercourse with him. Her references to feeling pressure from others within the Respondent&#8217;s family were not intended to cloud the fact that it was the Respondent whom she alleged was coercing her.</p>

They then typically had intercourse three times a day. The Appellant had not felt comfortable having sex with the Respondent because they had not known each other well but she felt she had to do it &#8220;if not she would go to hellfire. She felt she had no choice. She did not know it was a choice, thinking it was normal &#8230; she felt she could not talk about it.&#8221; The Judge also recorded that the Appellant said, &#8220;I was very tense, I dreaded it. He would say your husband is frustrated and the angels curse women who do not give their husband his rights&#8230; and the family made me feel pressured.&#8221; The undisputed evidence was that on their wedding night the Respondent had advised the Appellant not to talk to anyone other than the Imam and Aunt D about their marriage.</p>

The great majority of women within his family did not wear a hijab but his own view was that they should. The Appellant wore a hijab prior to their meeting. In some households within his family, men and women are segregated. He and the Appellant were virgins when they married and were very inexperienced sexually. He said that the parties had not had intercourse on their wedding night because the Appellant had been nervous. He said that he and the Appellant had a similar level of religious understanding and observance. Washing after intercourse was something they both expected each other to do, in accordance with religious practice. He accepted that he would recite incantations prior to intercourse, sometimes only in his head, sometimes out loud. The contents of those incantations was not elicited but the Judge recorded the Respondent&#8217;s evidence that similar incantations or prayers might be spoken before consuming food, for example. There was no evidence that the content of the incantations was threatening or potentially coercive of the Appellant. The Respondent denied that his view was that his religion required a wife to submit to her husband&#8217;s sexual desires or that he had told the Appellant that she would go to hell if she did not submit to him sexually. He said that it would be contrary to the tenets of his religious beliefs to coerce a person into intercourse and that he did not do so. He characterised the parties&#8217; sex life as consensual, with the Appellant sometimes instigating intercourse even though more often he was the instigator. He felt that for the first few years their relationship had been a loving one. The Respondent agreed that the couple had not discussed contraception until after their first child&#8217;s death. They had ceased intercourse at the Appellant&#8217;s request in 2015 when the Appellant was pregnant with C. The Judge recorded that he found the Respondent&#8217;s embarrassment about speaking about sexual matters to be &#8220;tangible&#8221;. He found the Respondent to have been candid in his evidence.</p>

As to the findings of fact, none of the extant grounds of appeal concern allegation (b) before the Judge which was that the Respondent had assaulted the parties&#8217; child, C. It is nevertheless relevant that the Judge dismissed the allegation included in the Appellant&#8217;s schedule and the Appellant&#8217;s wider allegation of persistent physical abuse of C. The Judge&#8217;s findings that the Appellant&#8217;s allegations of controlling and coercive behaviour and psychological or emotional abuse were not proved, are not challenged by grounds 1 and 3, and the Judge&#8217;s express rejection of elements of the allegations of controlling and coercive conduct are not now the subject of this appeal. However, I do have to consider whether to give permission on ground 7 which concerns the Appellant&#8217;s isolation and vulnerability which is relevant to the allegations of sexual, psychological and emotional abuse, coercion, and control.</p>

The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted."</p>

The Judge did not find allegations of controlling and coercive behaviour or psychological, emotional or other abuse proved. Whilst I have yet to determine permission to appeal under Ground 7 of the Grounds of Appeal, which concerns issues of vulnerability and isolation, I have to proceed on the basis that the Judge&#8217;s other findings were properly made. Hence, it was not proved that the Respondent had assaulted C, or that he had controlled or coerced the Appellant by stripping her of her identity or by taking C to see his cousin who had been convicted of a very serious criminal offence, or that he had undermined the Appellant for having a Caesarean delivery, denying her the right to grieve or visit her son&#8217;s grave, or by using derogatory language. These were important findings because the court is required to consider all of the evidence to examine whether there was a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour. The allegations of sexual abuse needed to be considered in the context of all the evidence. As the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/448" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 448" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 448</ref> at [45], reducing the field of focus risks robbing the court of &#8220;a vantage point from which to view the quality of the alleged perpetrator&#8217;s behaviour as a whole&#8221; and removing &#8220;consideration of whether there was a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour from its assessment.&#8221; Similarly, the narrow focus of the remaining grounds of this appeal must not obscure the fact that the Judge was considering the whole of the evidence and did not find patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ground 7 of the Grounds of Appeal is that the Judge was wrong to conclude that the Appellant was not vulnerable or isolated &#8220;given the circumstances of the parties&#8217; marriage and the limited extent of the Appellant&#8217;s connections in this country.&#8221; The Skeleton Argument on appeal portrays the Appellant as vulnerable &#8211; &#8220;she could be persuaded to marry a stranger by a work colleague&#8221; &#8211; and the weaker party in a relationship characterised by a &#8220;power imbalance&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;M married a man she barely knew, naively trusting him and his wider family then living in a foreign country isolated from her support network.&#8221; However, the Judge noted that the Appellant was a professional woman who had come to England several years earlier and had shown her ability to live and work independently here. She had no vulnerability in terms of her immigration status, language, or her ability to function in society and the workplace. She did have family members in England to whom she was close. The Appellant allowed her parents, who still lived on the French island where she had grown up, to decide on whether the marriage should go ahead. The religious marriage took place on that island which was not somewhere with which the Respondent had any prior connection. Dr Proudman and Ms Traugott contend that &#8220;It was a legal error for the Recorder not to consider this vulnerability in the judgment.&#8221; In fact, the Judge did expressly consider the Appellant&#8217;s vulnerability but found that she had not been particularly vulnerable due to the circumstances of the marriage or her connections in this country [94]. He noted that she was 26, she was a professional, she had carved a life out for herself in England over the previous seven years, she had no material language barriers, she was not isolated and had regular contact with her aunts and cousins. Both parties had agreed to submit to their relatives&#8217; guidance on whether the marriage should be arranged and both were equally sexually na&#239;ve. This was a question of fact for the Judge to determine. The question on appeal is not whether the Judge might have reached a different conclusion. Here, the Judge was clearly entitled to reach the conclusion he did about the Appellant&#8217;s vulnerability and isolation due to the circumstances of her marriage and her connections in England, and there is no real prospect of the appeal succeeding on ground 7 nor any other compelling reason why permission should be given on that ground. Permission to appeal on ground 7 of the Grounds of Appeal is therefore refused.</p>

On her case, the fact that the parties were observant Muslims within an arranged marriage gave the Respondent the opportunity to exploit religious and cultural themes to force himself on the unwilling Appellant. The Appellant has not suggested that she said or did anything to resist the Respondent, but it follows from her allegations that even if the Respondent did not meet with resistance, he was consciously coercing or forcing her to comply with his sexual desires and that this was repeated sexual abuse that persisted for several years.</p>

I do not agree. The structure of the judgment does allow the submission to be made &#8211; the judge analysed the evidence in relation to each head of alleged abuse &#8211; but the Judge not only set out the correct legal approach [7(8)] but then reminded himself to look for patterns of behaviour [28], and to consider all the evidence &#8220;holistically&#8221; rather than considering the allegations in isolation [82]. Having reviewed all the evidence in relation to heads of alleged abuse, the Judge expressed his &#8220;overall&#8221; view of the credibility of the parties. Looking at the judgment as a whole, he did consider the allegations of sexual abuse in the context of all the evidence, he examined the broad nature of the relationship, as well as considering the credibility of the parties on the wider evidence, not just their evidence on the issue of the alleged sexual abuse.</p>

The findings he made on the allegations of sexual abuse were made in the context of findings that there was no pattern of abuse, coercion, or control in other areas of the relationship of the Respondent&#8217;s behaviour. Those findings stand. Hence, any pattern of sexual abuse would stand apart from the other features of the relationship which have been found not to have been abusive or to involve coercion or control.</p>

However, the evidence before the Judge was that both parties held to religious beliefs and practices by which they would expect to wash after sexual intercourse. The Appellant herself has not alleged that the Respondent made her wash, rather that &#8220;for religious reasons I had to take a bath following sexual intercourse&#8221; which would mean that those in the house would know she had had intercourse [her second statement, paragraph 5]. Neither party raised the issue of contraception for several years &#8211; this was not a question of the Respondent closing down the subject. The Appellant herself had not alleged that the Respondent used the issue of contraception as one of control or coercion. These were matters that the Judge considered in his judgment and the evidence entitled him to find that they were not probative of coercion and control, or sexual abuse.</p>

His primary reason for rejecting that evidence was that he found the Respondent&#8217;s assertion that such coercion would be contrary to his religious beliefs and tenets to be credible. The Judge considered credibility in the light of all the evidence and having had the advantage of seeing and hearing the parties give evidence before him. This rejection of the Appellant&#8217;s allegation of threats based on religious beliefs, was an important finding because it was one very specific allegation that the Appellant had made. As for the incanting of religious phrases or prayers before sex, which the Respondent accepted he sometimes did out loud, there was no evidence from the Appellant that she found that practice to be intimidating, coercive, or that it caused her to submit to intercourse. There was no evidence that she did not expect that kind of behaviour and, on the evidence placed before him, the Judge was entitled to find that it was &#8220; common amongst many Muslims&#8221;. It is right to say that the Judge also concluded that the father had not &#8220;intended to use those religious references to coerce the mother&#8221;. The Appellant complained that the Respondent&#8217;s intent was not relevant &#8211; it was the effect of the use of religious references that mattered. I would not agree that his intent was wholly irrelevant, but I accept that abuse can occur without an intent to abuse. However, in the present case there was no evidence at all before the Judge that the use of incantations was in fact coercive of the Appellant.</p>

That is an important qualification of which the Judge did not remind himself, but I have considered the judgment under appeal in full and it is evident that the Judge did apply the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities throughout &#8211; he set out the standard of proof to be applied at [17(4)] and then concluded that the Appellant&#8217;s allegations about sexual abuse were not established as being &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; [96]. </p>

The Judge had reminded himself of the possibility of a complainant &#8220;freezing with no protest or resistance&#8221; [20] and of the &#8220;nuances&#8221; that might arise from the fact that the parties were a religiously observant married couple [21], and that &#8220;everybody is different&#8221;,  but he has here applied a generalisation which tends to suggest that it is unlikely that anybody would repeatedly submit to sexual intercourse without protest or resistance for such an extended period. Not only is that assumption inapt generally, it is particularly inapt to this case. The Appellant placed her silent submission over several years in a particular personal, cultural and religious context: she was living in an arranged marriage which led to certain expectations of her, she was sexually na&#239;ve, her husband was also sexually naive, she did not feel able to ask others (beyond perhaps the Imam) about what was happening sexually within their marriage. Whether or not the Appellant&#8217;s allegations of sexual abuse were supported by the evidence, it is difficult to accept the Judge&#8217;s generalisation that the mother&#8217;s continual silent submission over several years was &#8220;inherently&#8221; improbable.

I do not accept that this part of his judgment undermines or contaminates the remainder of the judgment or the findings that the Judge made.

He concluded, &#8220;If the father felt that the mother&#8217;s body was his to use as he wished because that was his right, then it is unlikely he would have simply stopped having intercourse with her as soon as C was born in 2015&#8221;, and &#8220;I do not find this consistent with the acts of a man who sought to manipulate, exploit, or interpret religious text to make the mother feel that she ought to have sexual intercourse.&#8221; The danger with this reasoning, as Dr Proudman argued, is that it might be taken to assume that sexual relations between a couple and, in particular, elements of coercion, submission and consent, will be consistent throughout their relationship. The fact that the Respondent may not have overborne the Appellant&#8217;s will on one occasion, does not mean that he could not have done so on another.</p>

For two years they shared the same bed but, at the Appellant&#8217;s request, did not have intercourse. The Respondent respected that request and there is no evidence that at any point during that time he sought to coerce the Appellant into sexual intercourse. This was not a case in which it was alleged that the Respondent had committed sexual abuse on one or two occasions only &#8211; the allegation was that he persistently pressured the Appellant to submit to sexual intercourse with him, disregarding the need to ascertain the Appellant&#8217;s wishes and consent, every day for several years. It would be wrong to say that unchallenged evidence that he acted in a very different way when aware of the Appellant&#8217;s nervousness, or her wish not to have sexual relations, had no bearing at all on the allegation that the Respondent&#8217;s persistent conduct was of a very different nature.</p>

Nevertheless, he did refer to the Appellant&#8217;s education and profession when finding improbable her evidence that (a) she did not know that she had a choice not to submit to being forced by the Respondent to have repeated, frequent sexual intercourse with him, and (b) she did not feel she could speak to anyone about it. At first sight the Judge&#8217;s reasoning is objectionable. Many victims of sexual abuse within marriage or a partnership will find it difficult to speak to anyone about it. As the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re BB</span> (above) show, there are many reasons why someone might submit to an abusive relationship without insight into what they are suffering until after the relationship has ended, or perhaps long after that.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact, as the paragraph as a whole demonstrates, consistent with his judgment as a whole, the Judge focused on the evidence in the case, and the character of the Appellant as he assessed it to be, rather than &#8220;inherent&#8221; probabilities. Indeed, the Judge had reminded himself of the &#8220;rape myth&#8221; that the victim&#8217;s culture or religion may justify abuse. He reminded himself that some victims of abuse may face cultural or other barriers that prevent them from seeking help. I am satisfied that the judgment establishes that it was his view of the evidence from and about the Appellant herself that convinced him that it was unlikely that<span style="font-style:italic"> she </span>would have not known that having sexual relations with her husband ought to be a matter of choice and that <span style="font-style:italic">she </span>would not have spoken to someone, such as one of her own aunts or cousins, about what was happening. Having given this matter careful consideration, on balance I accept that the Judge was entitled so to find. The fact that some victims of sexual abuse may not realise they are being abused, or may not speak out, does not preclude a finding that had the alleged abuse occurred to a particular person, <span style="font-style:italic">that person</span> would have known, and would have spoken to someone else about it. Dr Proudman referred to the judgments of Hayden and Cobb J in similar cases as though the Judge in this case was bound to have reached the same conclusions, but each case is determined on its own evidence. Similar allegations do not necessarily lead to similar findings. A court should be cautious for the reasons set out in guidance about rape myths and stereotypes as well as in a number of reported judgments, but it is not precluded from making a finding that a complainant would have realised that the alleged conduct was abusive or would have spoken to someone about what was happening.  The Judge had the benefit of hearing three days of evidence. All appropriate special measures were taken to ensure that the Appellant could give her best evidence. The Judge was made aware of and included in his judgment, the risks of making assumptions or findings based on rape myths (applicable to all forms of sexual abuse). He was very mindful of the cultural and religious context within which the Appellant found herself. Some judges might have avoided this reasoning on this point, but the Judge was entitled to find, on the evidence before him, that had the allegations of sexual abuse been true, the Appellant would have known that the abuse was abuse and was not &#8220;normal&#8221;, and that she would have spoken to someone else about it.</p>
