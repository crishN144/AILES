This had originally been planned to commence on 26 February 2008 but in the event was re-arranged for 4 March 2008. At the end of this part of the process the Cassell was to provide an interim report for the court in time for the directions hearing which I had fixed for 14 March 2008.</p>

I do not propose to go into detail (the details are recorded in the documents referred to in paragraph [8] below) but suffice it to say that the medical staff took the decision that G and C could not stay. Security had to be called. On 25 February 2008 the local authority applied for an order that the hospital disclose its records relating to the incident so that the Cassell could see what had happened. I dealt with the matter as a paper application and made the order sought the same day.</p>

I need not go into details of what I was told. For present purposes it suffices to say that the Cassell did not, for its part, see the door as irrevocably shut, although it made clear that it would not be able to assist further were I to find that the events which had taken place on 12 March 2008 were indeed as alleged by the local authority.</p>

G &#8220;threw it back at him just missing K&#8217;s head.&#8221; G then &#8220;grabbed&#8221; K from C and &#8220;continued to fight with C.&#8221; In her oral evidence, Ms AJ confirmed that this was a physical fight; they were hitting one another with K in the middle. &#8220;Suddenly she thrust K with force into the baby bouncer&#8221; then &#8220;roughly swooped K back out of it and continued to fight&#8221; &#8211; that is, as Ms AJ confirmed, to fight physically. Ms SF said to G &#8220;give me the baby&#8221; and G &#8220;threw him at her from a distance of about 18 inches.&#8221; Ms AJ comments that although Ms SF caught him &#8220;G had carelessly thrown him without due care of where he was actually going to land and without supporting his head&#8221; &#8211; I interpolate that K was only 6 weeks old. Ms AJ&#8217;s account continues: &#8220;G and C continued to fight and at this point Ms SF and I took the opportunity to remove ourselves and K&#8221;. They went to a locked room for safety while the police were called.</p>

I am not going to go into details. Anybody who reads the local authority&#8217;s &#8216;running record&#8217; will know exactly what I mean. She failed to return to the Cassell on 10 March 2008 and has not been there since. At the hearing on 14 March 2008 it was far from clear that she would return even if given the opportunity. Even were she to do so, the prospects of her &#8216;staying the course&#8217; seem, sadly, to be slim indeed. I am driven to agree with the local authority&#8217;s submission, as articulated by Ms Rachel Rowley, that the prospects of G succeeding in any residential assessment are minimal.</p>

The onus will very much be on G to demonstrate to Judge Inglis that contact, no doubt carefully supervised and, it may well be, subject to stringent conditions, is something that should be allowed to resume. The next two or three weeks will give G a breathing space to show, if she can, that she is willing and able to work together with the local authority, to take on board the local authority&#8217;s concerns about her behaviour during contact, and to demonstrate as best she can that she is going to behave herself if contact resumes. <span style="font-style:italic">If </span>she is able to do this, then it <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>be that Judge Inglis will be persuaded that contact between G and K can safely and appropriately resume.
