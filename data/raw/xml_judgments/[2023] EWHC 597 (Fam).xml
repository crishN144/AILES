The mother issued cross applications.  There have been significant delays to the resolution of these applications arising from the mother&#8217;s application for asylum which was the subject of appeals.  Within these proceedings the father sought disclosure of documents from the asylum process which necessitated the applications being allocated to the High Court.  By the time of this hearing those complex legal issues had fallen away and the issues for determination before me had narrowed.  The central issue now is child spends with the father going forward and in particular whether it should be supervised.  The father also seeks the permission of the Court to take the child on holidays to Pakistan, where he is currently living.  In the alternative the father has a loose plan to relocate in the near future to the Netherlands and he seeks permission to travel to that jurisdiction with his son.  </span></p>

It is not necessary to record in detail the substance of that judgment but there are aspects of the mother&#8217;s case which were accepted by Judge Pickering which have some relevance to the issues which I have to decide.  In particular the mother asserted that during the course of the marriage the father had told her that he worked for or with an individual known as AG. The father also told her that AG was a violent and dangerous person and that he exerted a degree of control over the father and sought to involve him in his criminal activities. This was a deception by the father because apparently AG did not exist. But it was an elaborate contrivance which extended over a number of years during the course of which the father embellished and exaggerated the risk pose to him and by extension to the mother and E from this individual. It had a significant impact on the mother because she came to live in fear for her own safety and for that of her family, by which I mean the father and E.  Moreover when the mother discovered the deception it completely eroded her trust in the father and she simply could not understand why he had engaged in it.   It was wanton and done with real disregard for the effect it could have on her.  When viewed in the context of his violent and abusive behaviour during the marriage it is not difficult to understand why it had such a profound impact on the mother.</span></p>

Judge Pickering was also satisfied the mother had been a victim of domestic abuse at the hands of the father and he reached the conclusions that were the mother to return to Pakistan she faced a real risk of abuse and maltreatment from the father with possibly some encouragement from his family. He granted her application on &#8216;refugee grounds&#8217;.</span></p>

His position is as recorded by Mrs Justice Knowles in February 2022, namely that he does not accept that either the mother or E had a valid claim for asylum but that he does not seek to set aside that decision or to contest the factual basis upon which it was made.   While it is correct to note that the father has taken a pragmatic view of his case by not pursuing his applications to contest the evidence on which the asylum was granted, or to seek the return of his son, it is an uncomfortable compromise.  The father continues to hold a strong view that the mother lied to the English Court and further he is convinced that the English immigration and family courts have operated unfairly so as to deny him the life he seeks with his son.   I will return to this issue when I come to consider the father&#8217;s evidence below.</span></p>

She has also had to adapt to her isolation from her own family and culture.  It was not her plan to settle permanently in this jurisdiction on her own.

To her credit she recognised and valued the father&#8217;s role in E&#8217;s life for what it was, notwithstanding the abuse that she herself had suffered during the marriage.  She could see that E enjoyed time with his father and that he was willing to engage with him on FaceTime.

The mother&#8217;s fear is understandable.  During the currency of the marriage the father led her to believe that he was connected to criminal associates who had the capacity to cause harm to her and to E.  But she also lived in fear that the father was being dragged into quasi criminal activity by AG. I shall return below to the father&#8217;s acceptance and explanation for the lies that he told the mother and the contrivance of this individual. But it is hardly surprising that the mother has been left in a state of confusion and anxiety as to whether the father does in fact have connections to criminal associates and there is a deeply embedded distrust on her part as to anything the father tells her. She simply does not and cannot accept that the father is to be trusted. Against the backdrop of the history in this case the mother&#8217;s position on this is not unreasonable and the father cannot blame the mother if she has reached that view of him.  He cultivated it through his lies to her and his behaviour toward her.</span></p>

It was short and somewhat light on detail.   In oral evidence he told me that he has particular expertise as a forensic psychologist and that has for many years risk assessed convicted criminals prior to their release.  He was instructed to complete a psychological assessment of the father and to comment and advise on the risk which he posed to the mother and to E.  He met with the father for an hour during which he interviewed him about his attitude to the domestic abuse which he had perpetrated on the mother.   Dr Anderson assessed the risk as follows: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;I discussed with Mr F his history of domestic violence.

The report itself simply does not explain on what basis Dr Anderson was satisfied that the father had acquired insight that would eliminate the risk.  This is particularly so when insight was so lacking in his interview with the Guardian and in his written and oral evidence to the Court.  The father is an articulate and intelligent man who presents as sincere and committed and I do not doubt that he impressed Dr Anderson at his interview as he impressed the Court at times in his evidence.  But I cannot accept Dr Anderson&#8217;s conclusion that he presents no risk.  The report lacks the analysis to justify that view and the conclusion flies in the face of the evidence including that was obtained by a highly experienced child protection professional, the Guardian who appeared to challenge the father more robustly in her discussions with him.   Dr Anderson seemed not to properly consider the detail of the Guardian&#8217;s report when it was provided to him and while I accept these are two professionals from different disciplines it troubled me that he appeared unwilling to take on board a contrary view as to the assessment of risk.</span></p>

I understood this to mean that the father had a habit of petty criticisms of the mother&#8217;s care but on macro level he was also externalising blame and he held fast to the view that the real reason why his relationship with his son was restricted was because of the mother&#8217;s lies within the asylum application rather than arising from his abuse of her over a number of years which had required her to take the extraordinary step of seeking asylum.</span></p>

She explained to me in her oral evidence that managing the risk was not straightforward because E was a trusting child and she had observed him to be very compliant when in the presence of his father.

Until that happened she did not see how the supervision could be lifted.  This position was revised somewhat in her closing submisions in that she suggested that the supervision could be reviewed in 12 months.  It is my understanding of her evidence that it could take up to 2 years to move to unsupervised but if it progressed well and the father demonstrated consistency and commitment and there were no incidents, then it was possible that E could begin the work she recommended earlier.  She was clear however that it could not move to unsupervised until that work was completed.</span></p>

She had detailed interviews with both parents and she had the benefit of speaking to teachers and observing the father&#8217;s contact with E.  That gave her the advantage over Dr Anderson and she also reviewed all the evidence in the case so that she had, as it were, the whole picture.   The assessment of risk in this case is not simply informed by the father&#8217;s assertions that he has regrets but also by the impact of the abuse on the mother, her ability to cope psychologically and emotionally with the regular contact, the impact of that on her parenting of E and the vulnerability of E himself.  Her investigations impressed me as more thorough and wide ranging than those of Dr Anderson and she provided a more analytical consideration of the issue of risk both as to the nature of it and the ways in which it could be managed.  Perhaps most importantly the guardian was able to factor into her analysis the particular characteristics of this very young child whom she found to be vulnerable and malleable which increased the risk of abduction in her view.</span></p>

Her anxiety for the safety of her son is palpable and it is reasonably held.  It is clear that the mother still bears the weight of her experience and the direct contact is clearly a challenge for her given her evidence to me that she needs to sit outside the centre.   Managing regular contact which begins to progress to the community and increases in duration will take a toll on the mother psychologically and while she does support it I accept that she is in constant fear during the contact that something might happen to E.     I must have due regard to the findings also as to the abuse that she has suffered over many years and the consequence of it as to her isolation now in this jurisdiction.    E lives with his mother and she is responsible for his day-to-day care.  The impact of contact on her is considerable and I accept her evidence that it is difficult to manage, even in circumstances where it is supervised.  Any increase in her stress and anxiety poses a risk to E, if she is not emotionally available to him and that is a factor which the Court must weigh in the balance.</span></p>

His anger and resentment toward the mother were evident in the trial.  He externalised blame to her for the situation in which he now finds himself.  His evidence as to his perception of the mother having hoaxed the asylum process was troubling.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that this leads him to lean into a sense of victimhood which prevents him from accepting responsibility for E living here in the UK far from his paternal and maternal families.  The father&#8217;s deep resistance to acknowledging this and his blaming of the mother creates a high risk that he would abduct E or otherwise seek to remove him from the mother&#8217;s care.    That is also a factor which I must weigh in the balance.  In evaluating risk I also bear in mind that the harm to E were he removed from his mother and/or abducted would be one of emotional and psychological harm of a serious nature.  </span></p>

It can only be managed by professional supervision at this juncture and I find that the supervision must continue.
