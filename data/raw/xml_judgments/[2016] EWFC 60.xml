	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are public law proceedings concerning a baby boy (R) who was born on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2015 to his mother (HM), the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent in G hospital in C county in Wales. The baby&#8217;s father (RF) is the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> respondent. The care proceedings were issued by CCC (the local authority) after R (who remained in hospital on the High Dependency Neo-natal ward with his mother after his birth) was found to have a fractured femur on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2016; he was one month old. Three days before he had been seen to have bruising to his neck and chin. These injuries were considered to have been inflicted and child protection measures were initiated. HM denies causing any injuries to her child and alleges that they were caused by nursing staff on the ward. Four nurses (A, B, C and D) were identified by HM as being in the pool of possible perpetrators; they were represented by counsel.</p>

The local authority provided two alternative care plans dependent on the court&#8217;s findings as to the cause of the baby&#8217;s injuries; both care plans are for R to be placed with his father; the outcome of the hearing would, as far as the local authority is concerned, determine whether it is safe for R for HM to live with them too.</p>

The court was left with a possible pool of four including HM herself. The court heard evidence over eight days from the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October to 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority is seeking care orders. As I have said, both R&#8217;s parents accept that the threshold is met in respect of HM&#8217;s poor parenting and RF&#8217;s failure to understand and accept that she could not parent R to a good enough standard and to step in himself. This latter state of affairs in respect of RF remained the case for some time during and, as a result, R was placed in foster care after he was discharged from hospital. The local authority could have placed him with his father but not with HM living at the same address, as the couple remained living together, and as RF continued working full-time he was unavailable to care for R. The findings that I need make are in respect of the bruising and fractured femur that R sustained alone, although the concessions made by HM and other aspects of her conduct and behaviour from part of the whole picture which I must consider. Regardless of the findings I make in respect the perpetrator of R&#8217;s injuries he will be placed with his father.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the local authority&#8217;s case that HM is not able to provide consistent good basic parenting for R. They relied on observations of HM&#8217;s care of R on the ward and in contact sessions as evidence that she continued to struggle with basic care tasks and needed repeated prompting to care for her son. HM failed to pick up on or retain professional guidance during, and feedback after, contact sessions, and parenting support sessions did not bring about any real or consistent change in her parenting abilities. A parenting assessment had been carried out by the key worker, Rhianydd Barnes, dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016. At the hearing before me on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September HM told the court, through her counsel Mr Paul Hopkins QC, that she took no issue with the assessor, Ms Barnes, the nature of the assessment nor the process of the assessment (this was reflected on face of the court order of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2016). To a great extent that remained HM&#8217;s position at the final hearing. The parenting assessment highlighted that even basic tasks such as supporting R&#8217;s head when necessary, feeding and winding have taken months for MH to achieve, and it took intervention and guidance before she was able to accomplish even these basic tasks.  It was the local authority&#8217;s case that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">as [R&#8217;s] needs progress and develop, [HM&#8217;s] ability to respond to them will not be apace</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">[with R]</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">and she is likely to be several months behind her son&#8221;</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As an example in support of their case, the local authority relied on the undisputed fact that HM had taken over six months to learn how properly to wind R by which time he no longer needed winding and she was then having to catch up with the next set of skills needed in feeding him. She had not learnt how to bathe him without prompting and her preparation for such tasks, and for contact generally, was very poor. This she expressly accepted in her oral evidence. The local authority continued to provide HM with parenting support, but she failed to engage with or participate in all the sessions offered to her, so that not only did she miss opportunities to learn the parenting skills which she lacks, she also failed to see R in contact. The local authority&#8217;s view that she had demonstrated poor commitment is entirely justified; as is their case that, without continued intervention, HM would be unlikely to be able to meet her son&#8217;s basic needs and R would be at continued risk of significant harm. </p>

Later he was moved from HDU and, still within SCBU, he was placed in the nursery. His mother was able to stay on the ward, to &#8220;room in,&#8221; in order to facilitate breast feeding, so that R could be discharged once he had gained sufficient weight and was feeding satisfactorily. There were no problems with the baby, apart from his prematurity, which was not of itself causing any particular concern and it was intended that he should go home with his parents sometime in January 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R&#8217;s mother is HM. Born in 1995 she is a young woman of 21 who has had a difficult and troubled life; as a child she came to the attention of social services sporadically throughout the majority of her childhood (between 1999 &#8211; 2011) because of the neglectful parenting she received and concerns about sexual abuse. When HM had a baby in May 2012, from a previous relationship, she was only seventeen. As a result of the volatile relationship between HM and her partner, poor home conditions and their inability to meet the baby&#8217;s needs, HM and her son were placed in a mother and baby unit under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>. Unfortunately, as she accepted herself, HM was not able to parent the baby. Despite the support offered to her HM was not able look after the baby or to attend to him without prompt and she left the mother and baby placement in March 2013. Care and placement proceedings ended with final orders being made in August 2013; the baby was adopted outside of his birth family. </p>

HM is vulnerable and still a very young woman; as a result of the diagnosis by her doctor, and at the request of her lawyers, she gave her oral evidence to the court by way of video link from a vulnerable witness suite. HM was present throughout the hearing as was R&#8217;s father RF. HM and RF live together, and, throughout these proceedings, they have, in the words of the local authority &#8220;presented as a couple.&#8221; In other words, their partnership continued and they have remained living together.  </p>

He has two daughters aged 7 and 5 from a previous relationship, they both live with their mother but regularly spend time with their father and stay with him on alternate weekends. There is no doubt that RF is committed to his girls, and there are not, nor have there ever been, any concerns about his ability to care for them; there has never been any social services involvement in respect of those two children. RF and their mother remain on good terms and she is, according to the guardian, full of praise for him as their parent. As a result of these proceedings HM has absented herself from their home when RF&#8217;s daughters are present.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To return to R, on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015, the local authority had a referral from a community midwife in regarding HM&#8217;s pregnancy. They carried out an initial assessment, which, in turn, recommended a core assessment, by 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015. At that time HM did not co-operate with the local authority and would not give them RF&#8217;s contact details. During the pregnancy, as it turned out apparently without RF knowing, HM did not always engage with the midwifery service and she missed three ante-natal appointments. </p>

A police investigation was instigated during which HM was interviewed and statements were taken from various hospital witnesses.

The court heard from three experts instructed in this case; two Consultant Paediatric Radiologists, Drs Chapman and Halliday and a Consultant Paediatrician, Dr Rose. The court heard from HM and RF.

There was no reason, apart from his premature birth which would have made him, to some extent, more vulnerable than a full-term new-born baby, to expect R to remain in hospital for very long; he was healthy and was expected to be feeding and growing quite normally within a matter of weeks. </p>

There was a feeding chart on which it was recorded when and what he was fed with, how often his nappy was changed and when he was washed and put in clean clothes. As the practice was to handle him as little as possible nappy changes were usually carried out when he was fed, unless he cried and needed changing.

By her own admission she found it very difficult and had limited success in managing to feed R. She had also found it difficult to express milk, and found the whole experience stressful. That was the observation of the nursing staff at the time, and it is her own evidence that she set herself high standards and really wanted to breast feed him so that when she couldn&#8217;t she became frustrated and angry with herself. HM became stressed when changing the baby&#8217;s nappies because she was so disorganised and it was her own evidence that she had difficulty in being properly prepared making nappy changing stressful and upsetting for her when she became <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;flustered&#8221;;</span> the word she used in her written evidence.

R was fed at half past nine; she fed and changed him at half past ten and again at half past one on the morning of 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016. The fact was that feeding R was not going well and was a protracted business, the baby was taking the breast for periods of 5, 10 and 30 minutes. I have no doubt that it was stressful as HM was not meeting her own expectations of herself and by four in the morning she had asked one of the nurses to take over his care; according to the nurse in question (V) HM asked her to take over his care because, she said, she was falling asleep whilst holding R and was afraid she would drop him. V had made a note of this on the nursing records and she told me that she had an independent recollection of HM saying this; she could recall HM sitting on the bed and saying she was falling asleep with R in her arms. V told me that it was something remarkable for her as she could not remember any new mother ever having said anything like that before, that she was falling asleep and going to drop her baby, so it had stuck in her mind. The evidence is that HM was concerned that she would drop him. </p>

When the baby woke at half past eight his mother was alerted and fed him. Each time his mother had fed him that night and in morning, she winded him. HM had a preferred method for winding R. The family support worker who has been present during many contact sessions since February described and demonstrated HM sitting with the baby on her lap using one hand to rub his back and the other under his chin with his neck and chin between her thumb and forefinger; the rest of her hand was holding the top of the baby&#8217;s chest. That was the method HM first clearly demonstrated when giving her oral evidence but did not repeat when asked to on further cross-examination. It is a perfectly acceptable way of winding a baby but it is the local authority&#8217;s (and the interveners&#8217;) case that the bruising seen on R&#8217;s chin and neck area on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 was caused by HM handling R in such a manner with too great a degree of force. </p>

HM had also been encouraged to breast feed and Y&#8217;s evidence was that staff had been concerned about how HM was managing from the day before. Other staff from whom I heard, including Nurse D, gave evidence that, despite having a cold, she had been told that every effort would be made to enable her to stay on the ward to establish breast feeding. There was no reason for her to leave the ward that morning, and if, as she said, she was so determined to breast feed it is inconsistent with that avowed determination that she should have chosen to go home; she must have had a reason for doing so.</p>

Whatever the cause of these marks it is agreed that they were bruises and that they did not occur naturally. The initial explanation that they may have been caused by the baby lying on the loose end of the NGT was later discounted; this conclusion is supported by the nurses&#8217; evidence that no such bruising had been caused to other premature babies with NGT on the ward; nor did any nurse who cared for R, including washing his face and neck, observe that the loose end of NGT had caused any marks before, nor were any such marks observed after the bruises had faded and when the tube was still in place. Both his parents, in their written statements prepared for these proceedings were firmly of the view that the bruises were not caused by the NGT because they were seen to be on both sides of the baby&#8217;s neck. </p>

(I shall return to the expert evidence in more detail below). As it is notoriously difficult to time bruises the evidence is that they could have been caused during a period when HM was looking after R. It is the local authority&#8217;s case that it is likely she used her preferred method of winding with her thumb and finger supporting him around his neck under his chin; and that she absented herself from the ward that morning, when she realised what she had done. The court was struck by the evidence given of HM&#8217;s tiredness and seemingly lethargic approach to being on the ward with her baby overnight. The tiredness and apathy observed by the nursing staff and the effect that it had on HM&#8217;s ability to nurse and feed her baby was recorded several times in the nursing records.  I was told that it was in contrast to, and noticeably different from, other new mothers who were excited to be spending the night looking after their babies; one could have expected this to be the case for HM too, particularly on the 18th January, which was the first night she was to spend with her new baby son, R. </p>

I was told that, in any case, the nurses on SCBU often took pictures of the babies on the ward to have a record of a baby for her parents of events, such as their first bath, for which the parents could not be there as their baby was still being cared for in hospital; the nurses did not ask for permission to take such pictures. Whatever procedure should have been followed, the poor quality of the pictures made it even more difficult for the expert witness to reach any conclusions about their cause or make any real attempt to age them. </p>

At around quarter to nine that evening C completed a set of observations on R, she did not undress him and it is her evidence that that was the only physical contact she had with R during that night. HM recalled in her statement that at about nine after an unsuccessful attempt at breast feeding she bottle fed R. At about half past ten a student nurse K  saw HM coming out of the flat with R on her shoulder saying that he would not feed, HM appeared to be very anxious and upset and told K that R would not feed or stop crying; she was struggling to express mill and had difficulty in the baby latching on; she seemed very tired and upset. K went to get a bottle and after he had it R seemed much happier. About half an hour later K approached the Junior Ward Sister H to tell her that she had seen HM rocking R in a fast and rushed way that had made her (K) feel uncomfortable; she told the court that she had been concerned about the baby and his mother because of her being stressed. H recorded that K had told her that HM was handing the baby in a rough way, or &#8220;roughly&#8221; and that was the word she had used in the record because, she believed, it was the word K had used to her. </p>

At around two in the morning of the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January C had gone to check on the baby and found neither asleep, HM was very tired and lethargic and did not want to talk, C asked if she had changed the baby&#8217;s nappy and HM said she had not because there was no smell; C explained about the importance of nappy changes and advised HM to do so which she then did, C left the room. Around about this time K heard R crying and saw that his mother was changing his nappy; as he was still crying about five minutes later K asked a qualified nurse to check on him, she went back to find HM distressed and saying that she could not get R to settle.

R was seen in the HDU and in Nursery 1 from about half past two until after half past six by several members of staff. His cot was described as being in the middle of the floor, when in Nursery 1, situated in front of the linen cupboard. The witnesses had difficulty in remembering exactly what time he was seen and where; this is hardly surprising as apart from the state of the baby&#8217;s clothing and his mother&#8217;s distress there was nothing of particular note. It was the practice of the staff to take about an hour or less for a break and none of the witnesses could remember precisely when they had done so that night. R was observed by staff on the ward all the time he was out of the room where he had been with his mother and no-one saw anything to cause concern about his legs, quite the contrary. At around half past six Sister H checked on R who was still in Nursery 1 with C; he was sleeping. At about quarter to seven C wheeled R back to the room where his mother lay sleeping and left them there both fast asleep. He was not seen again by any nursing staff until around half past seven when C checked in on them.</p>

She noticed his leg was a little bit swollen; she said in her oral evidence and in her statement that she was not worried as she thought it might have been caused by blood being taken as, she said, this had happened before. Whatever she may have thought she did not report this obvious sign of distress in her baby at the time. She was seen by C at half past seven and again at twenty to eight and did not mention anything at all to her. On C&#8217;s visit she saw HM trying to breast feed R who was not interested and his mother was becoming stressed, she gave HM some advice about when to change his nappy. C left HM changing R nappy at about twenty to eight (she was going off shift) R was crying and moving around but as this was not more than a baby having a nappy change C said she had no reason to think that there was anything wrong. She did not examine him.</p>

The evidence is that the high-pitched crying observed by nursing staff on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January was associated with a baby in distress in looking to be fed and to suck for his food; an atavistic need that was not being met that had nothing to do with him suffering physical pain.</p>

Dr Chapman&#8217;s evidence that it was possible for him to distinguish between soft-tissue swelling and blurring of the muscle/fat interface and by so doing reach a conclusion as to the minimum number of hours that the fracture had been present was based on his retrospective review of 10 cases is poor science; ten examples about which the court has no detail is poor evidence and his hypothesis is unsupported by any research as the research base that does exist shows soft-tissue swelling per se to be a poor indicator of timing.  </p>

She said that a femoral fracture had other significant features including that it is the longest bone in the body so that the length of the damage results in blood and then fluid leaking into the surrounding soft tissue covering a greater surface area than with injury to other bones in the body; R&#8217;s femur was displaced which would result to a greater degree of swelling than an un-displaced bone (this was agreed by Dr Chapman); and that in an adult a fractured femur results in rapid swelling, which is often seen following a road traffic collision within 30 minutes or so from the impact.</p>

It happens very quickly after that there is an increase in swelling partly due to the tissue damage and considerable amount of swelling from bleeding from the marrow and considerable fluid to heal. These are the three components of swelling that occur sequentially &#8230;there is a difference between an abnormal looking thigh which occurs quite quickly and the outpouring of blood and swelling of soft tissue. If your thigh is foreshortened due to displacement there is a rapid change in circumference followed by continued swelling from bleeding and tissue damage&#8221;</span>.</p>

His view would have remained as originally expressed, that the fracture occurred sometime after 04:00 because that was the last time he was seen to be acting normally by Sister H and the HCSW who had fed R at 04:30 so that the likely time of injury would be the point at which R was exhibiting signs of pain which is at 07:00 on the account of his mother, HM. </p>

Nurse B described the baby enjoying the unrestricted movement he had in his limbs when she was changing his nappy and had lifted his legs free of the Babygro. She told me that the babies she nursed generally liked to do that, and, what is more when she was telling me about this it was obvious that she enjoyed seeing the babies wriggling and moving about as they kicked and flexed their limbs. Nothing in her evidence led me to conclude she had harmed, or would have wanted to harm R. B is an experienced nurse whose dedication to the babies in her care was clearly based on her affection for them as well as her obvious sense of duty. I found her evidence in respect of the respect of the reason for R&#8217;s high pitched crying, namely that he was looking to feed and had need for it which was not being satisfied, to be wholly convincing; HM conceded that she was not able to feed him easily even if she had been there at the time; he was not being offered a bottle at the time (as his mother had not given permission as she wanted to breast feed) which might have satisfied his need to suck; and, he was able to be comforted when handled in a comforting way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, the high-pitched crying, associated with fretfulness and R looking to suck continued into the next day as witnessed by Nurse D. The explanation put forward by Dr Chapman does not have the evidential foundation on which he based a large part of his reasoning; namely, that R was injured several days prior to 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2016 when &#8220;high pitched crying&#8221; was first recorded. It is simply not supported by the clinical evidence in the observations of the nursing staff that were caring for R, even Dr Chapman at his most hubristic would have to concede that radiology alone cannot form the basis the courts finding in respect of when the fracture occurred. Dr Chapman was alone in putting forward this explanation and the evidence does not support his reasoning. Thereafter, until the morning of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> no-one noted any sign of pain or discomfort when his nappy was changed and his legs moved in and out of his babygro and he was handled when being cleaned or nursed. </p>

After that he was more content and there was no further high-pitched crying noted. R continued to have his nappy changed every few hours as before and there is not one record or reference to R displaying any discomfort when his legs were handled. If there had been a fracture it is, as Dr Rose observed, inconceivable that it went unnoticed over a period of a few days. If there had been a undisplaced fracture of the left femur the reason why it would not have become displaced on frequent, albeit gentle, handling over a period of days is abstruse and so it is highly unlikely that it could have been so; even if the clinical evidence had supported Dr Chapman&#8217;s theoretical explanation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The combined evidence of Drs Rose and Halliday was, as submitted by Ms Ruth Henke QC for the local authority, more convincing, drawing as they did on their current clinical experience. Dr Rose&#8217;s dismissal of Dr Chapman&#8217;s view on the degree of force needed to cause the fracture was, indeed, rooted in common sense; if the femur of a premature baby could sustain a fracture by the application of a degree of force just beyond normal, then there would have to be a regular flow of babies with fractured femurs because the of the comparative frequency of carers use handling which is a little rough, just beyond normal, whether through weariness, ignorance or carelessness. There is no such known phenomenon, and, in Dr Rose&#8217;s thirty-five years of experience in considering comparators (premature babies on a neo-natal ward) he had encountered only one fractured femur, when a doctor had clearly used unacceptable force. </p>

She gave similar evidence; even given that R&#8217;s bones <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> [my emphasis] have because of the demineralisation due to his relative prematurity, she stated it would have to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a significant force [to have caused the fracture to his femur]. We have much more fragile babies than this on a neonatal ward and fractures are pretty rare. For a 32 week old to get a fracture, we just don&#8217;t see it, even if [the handling of the baby]is a bit rough&#8221;.</span> When fractures do occur it is of the weaker bones, such as the ribs and the wrists, not to the femur which is one of the strongest bones in the human body. Dr Halliday could not recall ever having come across a fracture of a femur in such circumstances. It is more likely than not that the degree of force used to fracture R&#8217;s femur would have been beyond normal handling, it would have to have been outside the acceptable force one uses when handling such a small baby and was, therefore, excessive even if not deliberate.</p>

Although HM said that she was unconcerned as she thought it was a result of a blood being taken from his foot this is flatly contradicted by RF whose evidence was, and remained, that she had called him about half past seven and was upset; according to him it was he, not she, that was unconcerned. He told me that she told him that there was something wrong with the baby&#8217;s leg and that it was swollen.

If, as she claimed, she was not bothered because it was as the result of blood being taken for a sample, there is no explanation either for her distress or to look for a reasons on Google. It does not explain why she left it until after eight to bring to the attention of a member of the nursing staff. Her evidence about this was contradictory and untruthful, on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2016 in the first police interview she denied that any nurse had come into see her at half past seven, saying it was not until much later and that she did not bother trying to speak to a nurse at the time because they were all on hand-over. In her statement dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016 she claimed that she twice attempted to speak to the nurses by going out of her room but was unable to attract their attention because they were in hand-over.

HM&#8217;s explanation that she did not think anything of it because she assumed that he had had bloods taken was, and remains, unconvincing and her evidence was further undermined by inconsistency such as whether she had seen a swollen foot, in her written statement she said she had, and her oral evidence that she said had not.</p>

E has no reason to lie about this and had a good recall of events of that morning giving a detailed description, and I accept her evidence. I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that HM had a reason for delaying telling anyone about the baby&#8217;s leg and the pain he had exhibited for well over an hour, and that reason, and her inaction, were consistent with someone who knew she has caused an injury she had hoped she could hide. When she realised she could not she phoned RF to try to find an alternative explanation. It is neither her evidence, nor his, that she told him about her theory about the blood sample being taken; and I accept his evidence that HM had been upset when she phoned him; The only reason for that is that she was well aware that there was something seriously wrong with her baby.</p>

When she returned R was being examined by two nurses and E said when his mother looked at the baby&#8217;s leg she said it looked worse.  E said HM did not describe the leg as &#8220;swollen&#8221; until after this point, it may have been the first time that she said so to any nurse but she had described it as swollen to RF around half past seven which would have been a good thirty minutes after she said that R had cried out in pain, there is likely well have been some swelling at the time she phoned RF; this would be consistent with the expert medical opinion of Dr Halliday whose opinion it was that swelling would begin almost immediately: what is relevant here is that HM later (after she had had a cigarette) described the leg as worse, which is consistent with developing swelling associated with a fracture.  Only HM could tell what was worse about the baby&#8217;s leg. The picture of an injury which was getting &#8220;worse&#8221; and of swelling which is emerging is consistent with the medical evidence of an injury occurring at about seven o&#8217;clock and the resulting swelling becoming more noticeable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is evidence, not only that HM was finding it difficult to breast feed R, which caused her to feel frustrated and upset, but also that she found it difficult to manage to look after him at all for any length of time at all. HM had appeared to be very tired, and often lethargic; on the two occasions she roomed in overnight she had asked the nursing staff had taken over the care of R. This would not be worthy of remark or comment had she done so after several nights during which she had been kept awake looking after R, but on each occasion (on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>/19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and again on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> /23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January) and again she had not been looking after R on previous nights. The court is not aware of the reasons for her lethargy, but it is a matter of common sense that being so tired, whatever the cause, must have increased her feelings of frustration and added to her distress at the difficulties she experienced attempting to breast-feed. These feeling must have contributed to the less than gentle way she was seen to be handling R by the student nurse (K) who had felt concerned enough to report to the Ward Sister (H) about what H recorded as &#8220;rough handling&#8221; or HM handling R &#8220;roughly&#8221;. I accept that the nurse accurately recorded what she was told by K at the time. There is, too, the observations of her distress as a result of attempts at breast feeding, changing R&#8217;s nappy and trying to settle him (all of which are set out above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This frustration evidently carried over into her general care of R who was found in a state of some neglect on the night of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> /23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>. The evidence the court heard was that when R had been wheeled out of the room, known as flat 1, where he had been cared for by his mother, by C at around half past two or three in the morning, R was asleep and he was covered by a blanket; just as he was seen asleep in the middle of Nursery 1 shortly afterwards by K. When Sister H took the blanket off to examine R &#8211; to see why the apnoea monitor was going off &#8211; she discovered the baby saturated in milk, uncomfortable and cold. When Sister H gave evidence about this she, herself, was distressed to recall the &#8220;state&#8221; the baby was in; the last person to have fed him was his mother who had been given a bottle to feed him. It could only have been HM that she had left him in this &#8220;state&#8221; which must have happened as she tried to feed him with the bottle. She then covered him up and, when he was asleep, asked C to take him out of the room to let her have some sleep. The obvious signs of neglectful and inadequate care were to continue into the morning, when HM went off to have her cigarette leaving R with a HCSW (SE) he was discovered to be in clothing again described as soaking; when his nappy was removed his bottom was dirty, still covered with faeces that had not been removed when she changed his nappy at seven that morning.</p>

I conclude that HM caused the fracture to R&#8217;s femur and then sought to hide what she had done for well over an hour. It is not possible for me to say what precise mechanism was used as HM has not told us. It is most likely that the fracture was inflicted at around seven in the morning when R cried out, as she herself said, in pain. HM was probably changing his nappy and became momentarily very angry about having to clean R again, her difficulties in caring for him with ease or confidence and her continued inability to soothe him, settle him and to feed him. When his leg began to show signs of real injury, looking red, twisted or oddly shaped and beginning to swell she realised that he had hurt him seriously. She did not tell the nursing staff but called RF in fright and distress to look for an alternative explanation, perhaps that she could proffer when the injury was discovered as it inevitably would be; whatever she was doing she further delayed letting the staff know.</p>

Again she was remarkably tired and had exhibited signs of distress and frustration. It is most likely that she caused the bruising when she held him far too firmly in the position she favoured for winding him and which she demonstrated when giving evidence.

Each nurse who handled him explained exactly how she did so; not one handled R in a way that could have resulted in him receiving any bruises to his face or neck. Bruises are notoriously difficult to age; nor can one reliably read from their appearance when the injury which caused them took place.

HM&#8217;s inability to parent safely must be as a result of the poor parenting she received herself, at least in part.

They have forwarded to HM&#8217;s solicitor forms for HM to sign in order to consent to the referral; as the SSWA expressly permits individuals to refuse to consent, so recognizing the autonomy of the individual; and, her consent is required to protect her information rights (data protection) and confidentiality. The local authority has contacted, a (named) woman&#8217;s worker, who is said to provide a service similar to PAUSE (which has not been rolled out in Wales) who is in place to offer HM support following these proceedings. The court is concerned that HM takes up and engages with any support offered to her for herself and for R; as it is all too easy to foresee RF being placed in a very difficult situation if he made aware that HM is homeless and unsupported. It would place him in a very real human dilemma which could undermine R&#8217;s placement with his father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While the woman&#8217;s worker who has been identified is able to provide a wide range for support and is prepared to offer support to HM, the court has been made aware that HM was referred to the self-same worker at the end of the proceedings concerning her first child (now adopted outside his family) which, as the local authority acknowledges will have a negative association for HM: with that in mind the local authority has an alternative service they can offer to HM. In March 2016 she had referred herself to the youth service run by the local authority and had support from worker (MC), as HM did not keep up her contact the case was then closed but the court is aware that MC remains willing and able to provide the same level of support as the woman&#8217;s worker if HM would prefer to work with her. Formal referral will need to be made and once done MC would available immediately to support HM.  Another form of support for HM is through a multi-agency referral to the adult/mental health teams. Either of these workers could support HM in making such a referral (through her GP), and with attending the necessary GP appointment, as well as attending any service or support group the mental health services consider appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority has assured the court that they will help HM find alternative housing to the temporary accommodation offered at the last minute by HM&#8217;s brother. Her support worker would assist her; this may include supported housing schemes for vulnerable women which exist in the area. The local authority has told the court that they will support HM with her housing application by providing a supporting letter, which will confirm the basis of HM&#8217;s homelessness. If Housing Options recommend that HM source private rent options, the Local Authority will consider financial assistance once all other avenues have been fully exhausted by HM (such as if HM were to make an unsuccessful application to the Bond Scheme, or if the landlord does not accept the Bond Scheme they will then consider financial assistance). The local authority has told the court that to provide HM with such support will enable her to meet her own wellbeing outcome for housing. The local authority has accepted that ensuring she has appropriate housing will reduce the risk of her returning to the family home and undermining the care plan for R; and the need to provide her with practical and emotional support in what will be a difficult time for her.</p>
