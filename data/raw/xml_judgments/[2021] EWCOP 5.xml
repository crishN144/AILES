They are difficult questions for an individual to answer to someone that they have only just met. Many people, whether or not they have capacity, would find such questions intrusive and impertinent. AG, however, after a reluctant start, answered my questions fully. I apologised about three times on separate occasions about the intrusive questions that I was going to ask and hoped they weren&#8217;t going to be embarrassing or difficult. After the third time AG said, &#8220;just get on and ask me the questions you want to know the answer to.&#8221;&#8221; </p>

For example, AG&#8217;s understanding is that the present case is about only one issue, namely whether she is &#8220;intelligent enough to live on my own&#8221;. She has fixed ideas that are often unreliable but which inform her thinking about decisions affecting her future. For example, she has consistently stated that she was duped into going to the care home by a relative and that, if only she were allowed to leave, she could return to a fully independent life. In fact, she was wholly unable to cope in the community even with considerable professional assistance.  </p>

In relation to decisions about the conduct of litigation, residence, care, and property and affairs including termination of the tenancy, there can be little doubt that the presumption of capacity is displaced. AG does not have insight into her own limitations, or her need for care and assistance. Her very simplistic belief is that since she was previously able to care for herself, find accommodation, and manage her affairs, she can do so in the future. She does not understand that she has dementia or that her cognitive functioning is impaired. Therefore, she expresses herself with confidence, even though her beliefs are patently ill-founded. She has no ability to process information relevant to more complex decision making such as would be involved in deciding where to live, the conduct of litigation, ways of providing the care she needs, or the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of managing her property or affairs. Her ability to retain anything more than basic information is severely impaired, and she is unable to weigh and use information relevant to these decisions. </p>

AG was not consistent in her account of her own marriage status (I am told that she remains married) but Dr MynorsWallis says that he was satisfied that she demonstrated a basic understanding of the marriage contract. What he considered was absent was any ability to understand, retain, weigh or use more complex information relevant to decisions about marriage and divorce, such as the financial implications.

A person may lack capacity in relation to decisions about residence, care or their financial affairs, but have capacity to make decisions about marriage. However, in this case, when determining capacity to marry, some consideration is required of AG&#8217;s capacity in relation to decisions about care, residence, and financial affairs. AG herself sees marriage as a way of changing her care and residence.

She believes that becoming married would enable her to work, to look after CI, and to be fully independent. In fact, she is clearly unfit to work, and she was admitted to the care home because she was utterly unable to look after herself in the community even with considerable assistance. AG has no insight into her cognitive limitations or her physical health needs, and no real understanding of the financial and other implications of her entering into marriage so that she and her spouse could live together as she envisages. AG&#8217;s view of her status as a married person is not at all grounded in reality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">I remind myself that the test is status specific not person specific, and that the wisdom of any particular marriage decision is irrelevant. However, applying the capacity tests from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, I agree with Dr Mynors-Wallis and the parties that AG lacks capacity to make decisions about marriage, and about divorce. Due to her inability to understand, retain and weigh information, she has fantastical beliefs that the act of getting married will result in her living independently in the community, free her of the need for care, and enable her to work. This is what married life was like for her in the past, and her impairments due to her frontal lobe dementia result in an inability to understand that marriage in the future will not return her to that same level of functioning and independence. AG is unable to retain information about her present married status &#8211; she does not consistently recall whether she is married, divorced or widowed. She cannot weigh or use relevant information to allow her to consider the advantages and disadvantages of marriage so as to make a decision about marriage. Dr Mynors-Wallis reminded himself, as I do, that the test for capacity for marriage should not be over-complicated, but he considers that AG&#8217;s dementia &#8220;means that she doesn&#8217;t have capacity to fully weigh up the pros and cons of a marriage&#8221; and she is &#8220;unable to retain key necessary information to make a decision about marriage&#8221;. I agree that AG does not have capacity to enter into marriage. I am also satisfied that she has no understanding of what divorce would entail financially or in relation to her status, not even in broad terms. In my judgment it is necessary to make a finding on AG&#8217;s capacity to enter marriage because the finding that she has capacity to engage in sexual relations may well bring the contemplation of marriage, already remarked on by both respondents, into sharper focus.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">Having found that AG lacks capacity in relation to decisions about litigation, residence, care, financial affairs and property, and marriage, but does have capacity to make decisions about contact with others and engagement in sexual relations, it is apparent that the applicant will have to reconsider the care plans for AG. The previous position that AG did not have capacity to engage in sexual relations had significant consequences for AG, for CI, and for the management of the care home. Restrictions were put in place to prevent AG entering CI&#8217;s room for example. Any form of physical intimacy between them could potentially have been viewed as an assault upon AG given the view and interim findings that there was reason to believe that AG lacked capacity to consent to sexual relations. Those restrictions will now be reconsidered and the safeguarding adults protection plan will be withdrawn. The care home will follow the CQC&#8217;s guidance on &#8220;Relationships and Sexuality in Adult Social Care Services.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="text-align:right;margin-left:0in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">The applicant will also consider what options are available to AG in terms of accommodation and care and support packages, including the possibility that she and CI could reside together under some arrangement whereby sufficient care can be provided. A best interests meeting is to be convened in February, and further evidence filed and served regarding AG&#8217;s wishes and feelings as well as proposals for decisions on residence and care that are in her best interests. In the meantime, I am satisfied that it is in AG&#8217;s best interests to continue to reside and receive care and support at the care home in accordance with her assessed needs. There is no dispute that those arrangements amount to a deprivation of her liberty but that such deprivation is necessary and proportionate and in her best interests. I direct that the applicant has authority to terminate AG&#8217;s tenancy agreement on her behalf but only if all parties agree or the court so orders. I have approved the agreed consequential order, accordingly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.03in">It is regrettable that delay in resolving her case has prevented AG and CI from sharing intimacy when, as the court has now found, AG does have capacity to engage in sexual relations. However, the need for a new expert to look at this case afresh, has been proven. I am grateful to the parties&#8217; representatives for dealing collaboratively with the difficult situation that arose from the last hearing. I am grateful to Dr Mynors-Wallis for the great care he has taken with his assessment of AG and his report. I shall reserve the case to myself for the consideration of best interest decisions. </p>
