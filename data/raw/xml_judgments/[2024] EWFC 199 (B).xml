This is due to the property being specifically excluded from being shared, or later property being the result of &#8216;conversion&#8217; also being excluded by virtue of paragraph 18. H&#8217;s case as to W&#8217;s needs is that they are met, even based on a roughly 65/35% split, on his construction of the PNA and in respect of fairness and &#8216;needs&#8217; as per the framework. </span></p>

There was a lack of legal advice, lack of disclosure and those things make the PNA materially doubtful. He invited the court to consider whether if there had been legal advice, disclosure as to the value of the pensions, would the terms of the PNA have been different? </span></p>

I do not accept that the proximity between signing and the marriage is such that it would cause undue influence or emotional haze, as it was put, not least because I heard evidence that the agreement was drawn up at least a month prior. I also find as a matter of fact that W was the one who drafted the agreement, albeit with input from H, and that they ought to take joint credit for it and equally to be jointly bound by its terms, freely entered and not on the face of it perverse. </span></p>

To argue that the asset was somehow brought outside of the protection afforded by paragraph 18 by virtue of the family spending time there is to ignore the purpose and scope of the PNA.

Instead, I found that even with 35% of the total nominal &#8220;pot&#8221;, W would have enough now and in the future for her needs, and when she does decide to retire, there would be an argument she would then be over-housed and could downsize, as appears to always have been the plan and indicated from the PNA itself. </span></p>

That is not something which H ought to be penalised for, as a matter of law, but it is invidious. W made the point that aged 44 when the marriage began she was &#8220;not thinking about retirement&#8221; whereas now at 58 she is from her own evidence. Respectfully, the indication from the PNA is that her intention was always to downsize or otherwise treat the London flat akin to a pension. I cannot comment on the financial merit of this approach, it is one she was free to follow as an adult. </span></p>
