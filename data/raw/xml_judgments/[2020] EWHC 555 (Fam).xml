That is in many years&#8217; time.  She would receive nothing else. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.11in">In my view that agreement is not, under English law, of any relevance or effect at all, for a combination of three reasons.  First, the wife had no legal advice whatsoever prior to, or at the time of, signing it.  Although she has academic legal qualifications, she is in no sense a matrimonial or family lawyer.  Second, there was no prior disclosure of the husband&#8217;s means at all.  Third, and most conspicuously, the wife was at the time continuously deceived as to the husband&#8217;s second family and children in Moscow.  Frankly, under English law that agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. </p>

She currently rents in the Northwood area, being unable to rent on the open private market more centrally.  However, the Russianowned premises were in Highgate and that is the area to which she and the children are accustomed.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.11in">Some representative particulars have been produced of flats in the Highgate and London NW5 and NW6 areas.  These satisfy me that the wife reasonably needs about &#163;2m with which to purchase a flat, and &#163;200,000 for stamp duty.  A reasonable figure for acquisition and moving expenses, redecorating, and re-equipping such a flat is &#163;50,000, and I assess the wife&#8217;s overall housing need at &#163;2,250,000.  Within such a sum there is a margin for trading down when the children are fully independent, and the wife may need to liquidate some capital to support her in older age. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.11in">Additionally, the wife seeks a further capital sum to reflect capitalised future periodical payments.  The figure suggested in the wife&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s open proposal of 6 February 2020 was &#163;1,731,600 representing &#163;3,700 per month multiplied by an actuarial future life expectancy of 39 years.  That calculation was not done on a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span>-type basis and is on any view too high.  Using the <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> table in At a Glance, Mr Campbell suggested a figure of about &#163;770,000, representing capitalised maintenance of &#163;40,000 (&#163;3,333 per month) over the life expectancy.  Either approach depends on assuming the wife&#8217;s income need to be about &#163;72,000 per annum (&#163;6,000 per month) for the rest of her life as claimed in the form E, and deducting the wife&#8217;s own net earnings of &#163;2,500 per month.   </p>

I am not prepared to do that.  The wife may be able to take enforcement proceedings directed at those shares in Spain, but it is not appropriate that I should make any such order at this stage of substantive adjudication of the claim.  The wife does not want those shares, she wants a lump sum.  Further, I could not transfer the husband&#8217;s half interest in a quasi-partnership without at the least giving notice to the partner, who is unlikely to be willing to share as a partner with the wife, who is his sister from whom he is estranged.   </p>
