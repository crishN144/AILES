The Applicants are litigants in person and as the issue before me principally concerns the LA&#8217;s duties, the LA has taken the lead. I am very grateful to Ms Gray, acting on behalf of the LA, for the assistance that she has given me.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The First Respondent is the child&#8217;s mother, &#8220;the Mother&#8221;. She is a Romanian national and travelled to the UK when 8 months pregnant. AK was born at XX Hospital on 8 April 2020. The Mother had come to the UK with the express purpose of giving birth here and relinquishing the baby. The Mother spent one night in hospital with AK but has had no contact with him since. He was initially placed in foster care and then moved to live with the Applicants.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Through the adoption process the Mother has declined to give any details of the Father. However, the LA has discovered that the Mother gave his name and date of birth when she was admitted to hospital for the birth. At the prompting of the social worker she has written a letter to AK, which can be given to him when he is older, in which she again names the Father but gives no contact details for him, or any way other than via his name, by which he could be identified. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The LA social worker, Ms Hornby, has spoken to the Mother on two occasions and made multiple other attempts to meet her. The Mother has made entirely clear that she does not wish to participate in the court hearings and wants the baby to be adopted and placed into a loving home. It is clear from Ms Hornby&#8217;s evidence that the Mother is fully aware of this hearing but has chosen not to attend. The Mother&#8217;s position has been clear, unequivocal and consistent ever since AK&#8217;s birth. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When AK was born the Mother was interviewed with an interpreter by the initial social worker, Ms Healey. The Mother told Ms Healey some of the background and more is set out in the letter she wrote to AK. The story that has been given is consistent in both accounts and in what she has said to Ms Hornby. Ms Hornby gave oral evidence to the court, and it was her clear opinion that the Mother was being truthful in her account.  </p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Mother said that she comes from the Roma community in Romania, as does the Father. The Mother is now 23 years old and she started a relationship with the Father which lasted over a year. When she told the Father that she was pregnant the Father wanted her to have a termination. However, she was too far into the pregnancy to have a legal termination in Romania. The Father made clear to her that he wanted nothing to do with the baby and ended the relationship with her. Shortly thereafter he started a relationship with another woman to whom he is now married with a young baby.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Mother has explained that in the Roma community having a baby in these circumstances would be a disgrace to the family. Both she and AK would be ostracised from the Roma community without any family support. She told Ms Healey and Ms Hornby that if her father found out about the baby, he would shave her head and be violent to her. I note that in the letter to AK the Mother says that her father would not physically harm her, but Ms Hornby said that she thought the Mother was saying this to protect AK from the truth. Ms Hornby was convinced that the Mother felt a genuine physical fear of the consequences if her father and wider family became aware of the pregnancy and birth.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Mother&#8217;s version is entirely supported by her mother, Ms G, who travelled to England with her when she was pregnant and has supported her through the birth and the adoption process. They have concealed the pregnancy from other members of the family who live in England, including the Mother&#8217;s aunt who lives close by.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Mother has consistently refused to give any details either of the Father, or her wider family. It has therefore not been possible for the LA to contact them or make any investigations in respect of them. The Mother has been clear that she wishes AK to be adopted by a family in the UK and to be given a loving home by them.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the first hearing, the court set the matter down for determination of the Part 19 application.  The question of whether Cafcass should prepare a welfare report in respect of the child was left open for enquiries to be made with the High Court Cafcass team.  This led to a proposal from Cafcass that there might be advantages to joining AK as a party, leading the court to join AK by an order on the papers of 30 October 2020.  However, the order was subsequently stayed on the joint application of the Local Authority and Cafcass who noted that the appointment of a Guardian would trigger an obligation to notify the Romanian Central Authority of these proceedings under Article 37 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 (&#8220;the Vienna Convention&#8221;); thus rendering the Part 19 application academic. </p>

There are two main reasons why it might be considered appropriate to notify the consular authorities. The first is to seek further information about the birth father and the wider family. This could include seeking assessments of such family members to see whether they might be suitable people to care for the child. The second is to seek the views of the Romanian authorities more generally on placement and future legal process, including whether the proceedings should be transferred to Romania.  </p>

Put another way, with what degree of objective justification might such a person complain if they later discovered they had been excluded from the decision?

Notification can only take place if there is someone to notify. In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child&#8217;s existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind. </span></p>

There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child&#8217;s established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement. </span></p>

We were so unaware of what was going to come. A year into our relationship, we moved in together for a while. The minute he found out that I was pregnant, he decided to leave us. After a while, he became romantically involved with someone else and started a new relationship. He now has a baby girl. No one from my family ever knew that I was pregnant. I have concealed this, because I feared my Dad&#8217;s reaction. My Mum works in the UK. This is where you were born. I came over on holiday to see her and, on the 8th April 2020, I gave birth to you. The minute I opened my eyes and saw you, I realised that you really are the spitting image of your Dad.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Mother&#8217;s account has been consistent throughout and appears to be supported by Ms G and the surrounding circumstances. The Mother and Father had a relatively short relationship and, according to the Mother, the Father has made absolutely clear that he does not wish to have a relationship with, or responsibility for, the child. There is therefore no established family life between them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I also accept what I have been told about the Mother&#8217;s fear of her own father if he knew about the child, and of being rejected by her community. She has made very considerable efforts to keep the birth from her wider family and to ensure the child is brought up in the UK. Again, this is supported by Ms G who has indicated that she does not know of any members of the family would be able to look after AK.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In those circumstances the interference with the Father and the wider family&#8217;s Article 8 rights is a matter I give relatively little weight to. There is no family life between them and AK, and there appears to be very little prospect of such family life being created.  The fact that the maternal grandmother is supporting the proposed adoption and keeping the birth from the wider family strongly supports a conclusion that the wider family would not provide for AK&#8217;s welfare.  </p>

Ms Hornby has said in her statement that, in her view, trying to identify and contact AK&#8217;s father would cause the Mother significant emotional distress. She told me that she believed that the Mother was genuinely scared of the community, including her father, finding out about AK&#8217;s existence. The Mother has gone to great lengths to hide her pregnancy and the birth from the wider family, both by coming to the UK and then ensuring that her aunt does not know about the birth. It is impossible to judge the level of risk to the Mother if her family came to know about the child. However, the nature of the risk is that it is not possible to carry out the type of investigations that would allow a more detailed assessment of the level of risk to the Mother, either from actual violence or social ostracism.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the evidence before me I accept that there would be a serious negative impact on the Mother, if either the Father or her wider family were informed about the birth. I come to this conclusion both because of the Mother&#8217;s statements, but also because of the lengths that she has gone to to keep the birth a secret.  </p>

Again, it is not possible to assess the strength of this factor and it may well vary between families. However, having accepted the Mother&#8217;s fears as being genuine, the cultural factors militate further against notification. </p>

What is in my view clear is that it would be almost impossible to do so in a way that guaranteed the Mother&#8217;s wider family were not aware of what had happened. Given the minimal likelihood of either the Father or the wider family wishing to care for the child, I do not consider it appropriate to investigate this issue further.  </p>

The process of notifying the Romanian authorities and them trying to identify the Father could be a lengthy one. It is strongly in AK&#8217;s interests for this matter to be settled reasonably expeditiously. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As set out in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ABC</span> I have to consider all these factors together in a holistic assessment. In my view the factors here point strongly in favour of not joining the child and not seeking the assistance of the Romanian authorities to find the Father and the wider family. The Father does not have parental responsibility in English law. The evidence strongly suggests that he would not wish to care for the child and that there is little likelihood of the Mother&#8217;s wider family wishing to do so. The Mother is in genuine fear of her family finding out about the birth and I accept it would cause real distress and possibly very serious consequences if they did find out. It might well be that even if the Romanian authorities were notified, they would not be able to find the Father in </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">any event. Balanced against all those factors is that the fact that AK has a loving home in the UK, and it is clearly in his best interests for court proceedings not to be delayed. Therefore, on the first reason for notifying the Romanian authorities I consider this to be a clear cut case where it would not be appropriate to notify and there is no good reason to join the child as a party. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I turn to the second reason for notification, namely to invite the Romanian Central Authority&#8217;s view on placement and whether proceedings should be transferred to Romania. I am more concerned about this reason than was the Local Authority. It must be remembered that AK is a Romanian citizen and is not a British citizen. Although there is no duty under the Vienna Convention to notify, for the reasons set out above, that does not mean that the Court can simply ignore the fact that it would be making an order about a foreign national without the relevant authorities of that state being informed. As Baker J made clear in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JL </span>there remains a discretion to notify where the Vienna Convention does not require it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In my view, it will be the unusual case where a court would choose not to notify the relevant authorities of the other state where a foreign child is in the process of adoption. In effect, here the citizen of one country is going through a process by which he will become a citizen of another country, in circumstances where he is too young to express a view, and the first country is not being informed. However, I accept that this is an unusual case. AK is unable to express any view on the situation. For the reasons I have set out above, I consider it to be both in his best interests and those of the Mother, that the Romanian authorities are not notified because of the risk to the Mother, the lack of benefit to AK from doing so and the inevitable and possibly prolonged delay. For those reasons, I will exercise my discretion not to notify the Romanian consular authorities.  </p>
