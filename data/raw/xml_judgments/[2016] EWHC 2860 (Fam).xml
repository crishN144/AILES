	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am here concerned with the best interests of SK, an 11-year-old boy who is suffering from end stage high grade recurrent osteosarcoma and metastatic lung disease.  The overwhelming weight of medical evidence before the court is that his condition is terminal, although for reasons I shall come to, this is not accepted by his mother and is a prognosis that his father clearly struggles to accept.   The primary issue before this court is whether SK should now receive the palliative care treatment regime proposed by his doctors as a means of managing his symptoms and pain as his life comes to an end, and potentially prolonging his period of survival, or whether the objections of his parents to that course of action, and their proposals for an alternative based on their belief that he is not dying, should prevail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that the Trust contends that the declaration in respect of palliative intravenous or, alternatively, oral chemotherapy should be made expressly subject to SK agreeing to co-operate with such treatment.  The Trust does not seek by that contention to suggest that SK is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span>&#8217; competent in relation to his treatment.  Rather the Trust seeks to recognise the fact that, as the Trust argues, SK has become heavily drawn into his mother&#8217;s views on treatment for reasons I will come to, and within this context to give effect to the conclusion of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, Mr Power, that seeking to force SK to accept treatment during the final weeks of his life in a manner that will place him in opposition to his mother, from whom he will draw valuable emotional support during that period, cannot be said to be in his best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that this alternative plan is advanced by the mother on the basis that she <span style="font-style:italic">fervently</span> disputes the diagnosis of late stage recurrent osteosarcoma with metastatic lung disease and persists in her view that SK suffers from myelitis although, more recently, she has contended that he is suffering from leprosy or &#8220;bone TB&#8221;.  Both parents contend that SK has been simply &#8220;labelled&#8221; from the outset as a &#8220;cancer patient&#8221;, resulting in doctors having little interest in considering alternative diagnoses.  </p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The treatment plan advanced by the parents is also based on the mother&#8217;s contention that there is no evidence at all that SK is dying and that, accordingly, to treat him by means of palliative care at this point in time is entirely inappropriate and will, in the mother&#8217;s passionate submission, act to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sign him off from society</span>&#8221;.  The mother has in the past told Dr A that she feels that palliative care is, effectively, a species of euthanasia.</p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the specific treatment plan of the Trust, the mother (and to a lesser extent the father) raises multiple objections to that plan in any event.  The mother believes that the palliative chemotherapy proposed will not work and will &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">switch on</span>&#8221; genes that will cause SK&#8217;s tumour to progress.  In relation to pain management the mother states that she has &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">serious concerns over the use of controlled, off label drugs in children due to their unreported side effects and negative cumulative effects</span>&#8221;.  During her cross examination of the doctors in this case, the mother asserted that there is also a risk that SK will become dependent on pain killers and that there is a risk that such painkillers will mask other conditions and prevent the proper identification of his condition. With respect to the principle of palliative care, the mother expressed an almost visceral objection to this.  Her more reasoned arguments in this respect centred on palliative care not being necessary and placing the family at a &#8220;legal disadvantage&#8221;.  More emotionally, she claimed that palliative care, in effect, signed her child&#8217;s death certificate.  I pause to note that I gained the very clear impression that the unifying characteristic of the mother&#8217;s fierce objection to the proposed treatment plan, comprising the key elements of psychological input, palliative chemotherapy and provision of painkilling drugs, was its close association with SK&#8217;s terminal prognosis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the context of the parents&#8217; firmly held position in respect of the treatment plan advanced by the Trust, in addition to the declaration sought by the Trust, the Trust seeks an order prohibiting the parents from preventing or impeding the effective delivery to SK of psycho-oncology services, symptom management and further treatment, and of palliative intravenous or oral chemotherapy should SK agree to co-operate with the same.</p>

Each of these second opinions support the diagnosis made by SK&#8217;s treating clinicians.  I heard oral evidence from both Dr M and Dr A.  I also heard oral evidence from the mother and from the father, the mother having filed a statement and the mother and father having filed a joint statement, to which joint statement is exhibited the extensive documentary evidence on which the parents rely in support of their case. &#160;Finally, I have had the benefit of a report from SK's Children's Guardian, Mr Power. &#160;In circumstances where the mother and father did not seek to dispute the contents of Mr Power's report save, of course, for its conclusion, neither parent wished to ask questions of Mr Power and he did not give oral evidence.</p>

Much of the background contained in the evidence filed by the Trust is disputed to a greater or lesser extent by the mother.  In her statement, and when asking questions of the witnesses the mother was prone to look back over the history of the matter rather than concentrating on the current issue before the court.   In particular, the mother disputes whether the medical regime applied to SK since his initial diagnosis in 2012 has been appropriate.  Indeed, as I have already alluded to, the mother disputes the diagnosis that SK has received and which has been, on the evidence before the court, confirmed on a number of occasions since 2012.  </p>

The mother holds a BSc in psychology, an MSc in clinical neuroscience and a PhD in neuroscience.  She used to work in the health care sector.  However, on occasion, and I noted in particular when confronted with the what the doctors say is the inescapable fact of SK&#8217;s terminal prognosis, the mother tended to seek sanctuary amidst allegations of past medical malpractice, allegations of cover-up by medical professionals fearful of legal liability and allegations of conspiracy between doctors and government bodies.   The mother has also in the past claimed to hear the voices of children who have died from osteosarcoma in the care of the Trust, imploring her to fight their cause.  The mother told me that she had had a vision of SK as an adult and firmly believes he will survive.</p>

Further, whilst the father too questions the diagnosis of osteosarcoma given to SK in 2012, I gained the impression that his current doubts in this regard are now driven more by his understandable inability to quiet the flattering voice of hope than by the more systematic and reasoned objections to the diagnosis raised by the mother.  The father&#8217;s presentation in the witness box was characterised by a quiet and overwhelming sadness for the plight of his beloved son.  I agree with the observation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that, by comparison with the mother, the father&#8217;s position in this case may be more nuanced but that, in the face of an apocalyptic prognosis, the mother and the father speak with one voice. </p>

The surgery to resect SK&#8217;s left humerus and insert an endoprosthetic replacement was performed on 7 May 2012 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital by Professor Briggs.  The pathology undertaken during surgery confirmed a poor response by SK to the chemotherapy.  Following the period of adjuvant chemotherapy subsequent to the surgery, SK had a further CT scan which revealed that his lung nodules were stable.

The mother concedes in her statements that she refused to consent to the surgery and to the second line chemotherapy, the latter refusal being based on her contention that the Trust was unable to provide evidence of the efficacy of that treatment.

Professor Briggs expressed concern that the tumour was becoming potentially inoperable.  In August 2016 a further MRI scan of the tumour resulted in a conclusion being reached by the multi-disciplinary team that it would no longer possible to perform a complete surgical resection of the tumour leaving no residual tumour at the margins.  A nuclear PET scan also demonstrated active lesions in SK&#8217;s chest.  The mother continued not to accept SK&#8217;s diagnosis.  That this is the case is clear from the part of her statement of 21 October 2016 that deals with this period.

She reports that when she first saw SK on 23 September 2016 he asked for pain relief but then refused it when it was brought to him when his mother was present.  He clearly stated to Dr A that oxycodone would kill him and that his mother had told him that oxycodone kills people.  The mother did not dispute this evidence.  Dr A was able provide SK with a balanced explanation of the benefits and risks of oxycodone, after which SK expressed a willingness to use that medication as needed.  However, three days later he again refused on occasion to accept medication for his pain.  When Dr A asked SK his reasons for refusing, the mother answered in SK&#8217;s place by repeating a key objection oft voiced by her, namely that pain relief may mask the disease process and would not assist when trying to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">work out what is really going on</span>&#8221;.  On 11 October 2016 SK again spoke to Dr A about the pain medication being bad for him and that it would hurt him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear to me that SK&#8217;s denial that he is in pain at times when his physical presentation as hunched over directly contradict these denials is a further manifestation of his adoption of his mother&#8217;s position regarding the use of opiate painkillers.  I am satisfied on the evidence available to the court that SK&#8217;s position in respect of his treatment has been heavily influenced by, and indeed is likely to have become subsumed within, the stark and immovable position adopted by his mother.   The position is best articulated by Dr A in her statement:</p>

The long reaching and devastating effects of this diagnosis are palpable.  But the complicating factor in this situation is that SK lives within a unique family dynamic.  His mother has a persistent fixed false belief around his condition and aspects of his supportive care.  She is a highly educated woman who works within the health sector and she presents her concerns about SK&#8217;s health in a plausible and well-articulated manner.  SK has been exposed to her opinions and beliefs for many years and has conceded to them, except when he is in extreme pain&#8230;SK has demonstrated distress when exposed to even mild conversation conflict between his parents and professionals with SK always siding with his mother. [His mother&#8217;s] opinions regarding his underlying condition and her assessment and management of pain are shared frequently with SK.  The alternative diagnosis of leprosy and bone cysts, amongst other diagnoses, have been mentioned since I have been involved in SK&#8217;s care.  They are mentioned in front of SK.  [His mother] has said several times that SK cannot have osteosarcoma because she says that he does not have pain and everyone knows children with osteosarcoma have pain.  As a result of her strong beliefs on his condition, pain perceptions and medication, it is difficult to discern SK&#8217;s fully informed and uninfluenced perspective on any of these issues.  He is heavily influenced by his mother.&#8221;</p>

This will increase the likelihood of the wound becoming infected, which would also significantly reduce his life expectancy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I have borne carefully in mind SK&#8217;s statements concerning chemotherapy and the use of opiate painkillers, I am satisfied that those statements are heavily driven by his mother&#8217;s views.  Further, it is important to bear in mind that SK has been willing to accept the administration of opiate based pain-killers on occasion when the rationale for the same has been explained calmly to him and has indicated to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">people don&#8217;t know how painful it is</span>&#8221;.  His presentation demonstrates that he is in pain.  Within this context, if able to articulate a point of view independent of the influence exerted by his mother I am satisfied that that point of view would be that he wished to be as pain-free and comfortable as possible over the time now available to him.  Within this context, I am satisfied that his point of view would be that treatment that achieved that end would be acceptable to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, and examining SK&#8217;s best interests from a broad perspective, encompassing medical, emotional, sensory and instinctive considerations, I am satisfied that it can only be in his best interests for his pain to be properly managed as it gets worse.  Indeed, it would be inconceivable, in circumstances where I accept SK&#8217;s diagnosis and the prognosis in respect of the progression of his terminal illness, for the court to reach any other conclusion that the proper management of his pain, as defined by Dr A, is in his best interests.  Whilst I have born in mind SK&#8217;s statements regarding the use of painkillers, once again I am satisfied that those statements derive from his mother&#8217;s influence and are not a reason to reach a different conclusion in respect of his symptom and pain management.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, the palliative chemotherapy proposed in the treatment plan has, in addition to the possibility of extending SK&#8217;s survival, the aim of managing his pain.  Within these contexts I am satisfied that such intervention is, <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span>, in SK&#8217;s best interests.  However, in respect of the proposal for palliative chemotherapy I also recognise that there are significant complications in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, whilst SK has shown recently that he is at times amenable to the administration of appropriate pain medication, he maintains a firm opposition to palliative chemotherapy.  Whilst that opposition, I am satisfied, is driven by his mother, I must nonetheless bear in mind that SK&#8217;s best interests include family and social factors.  In the last months of his life SK is going to need, more than he has ever done, the love and society of his parents.  In circumstances where SK&#8217;s opposition to chemotherapy is of a different order of magnitude to his position in respect of painkillers, the court must be very careful to avoid a situation that places SK in opposition to his mother from whom he will, for all the concerns I have expressed above her, draw valuable emotional support.  Further, whilst in some cases an order compelling treatment may assist a child who finds him or herself in SK&#8217;s situation by providing an external &#8216;excuse&#8217; for taking a stand against a parent&#8217;s mistaken view, the reality in this case is that there is now too little time left to achieve such an outcome.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, I must bear in mind Dr M&#8217;s realistic concession that palliative chemotherapy may not have the desired effect.  The court must consider the nature of the medical treatment in question, what it involves and its prospects of success, including the likely outcome for the patient of that treatment.  Dr M is candid in her assessment of the chances of palliative chemotherapy working.  Further, I must also bear in mind that even if it does bring some relief from pain, whether by simply shrinking the tumour or shrinking it to the extent that surgery to relieve pain may be performed, SK is likely to experience some unpleasant side effects from the treatment.  Within this context, I also must recognise that, irrespective of his mother&#8217;s influence, SK&#8217;s position may be that he does not want to receive unpleasant treatment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, whilst I am satisfied that palliative chemotherapy should be declared to be in SK&#8217;s best interests such that he can be administered the same notwithstanding his parent&#8217;s lack of consent if he agrees to this, I am further satisfied that the Children&#8217;s Guardian is entirely correct when he advises the court that seeking to <span style="font-style:italic">compel</span> SK to accept treatment during the final weeks of his life in a manner that will place him in opposition to his mother, from whom he will draw valuable emotional support during that period, and in circumstances where the prospect of success of such treatment are by no means certain, cannot be said to be in his best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, SK&#8217;s best interests also include the psychological aspects of his welfare. As I have already noted, as his condition progresses I am satisfied that the emotional demands placed on his young mind by his illness and by his terminal prognosis will only increase.  Within this context, I am satisfied that it is plainly in SK&#8217;s best interests for him to continue to receive psycho-oncology input to assist him to deal with the psychological impact of his situation.  If this input results in him becoming more amenable to the administration of palliative chemotherapy, then that is all to the good.  However, in any event I am satisfied that it is in SK&#8217;s best interests for him to be provided with this service notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s emphatic statement in the witness box that she would not attend the same. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching my conclusion that the treatment plan is in SK&#8217;s best interests I have also paid careful regard to the fact that there is strong presumption in favour of taking all steps to preserve life because the individual human instinct to survive is strong and must be presumed to be strong in the patient.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, in reaching the conclusion that the palliative treatment plan is in SK&#8217;s best interests I have born very much in mind the evidence of Dr M that, with active treatment in the manner described in the treatment plan, it may be possible to extend SK&#8217;s survival by a number of months and the evidence of Dr A that the provision of effective palliative care can, in addition to improving a patient&#8217;s quality of life, extend their survival by means of proper management of symptoms.  Whilst I accept that the strong presumption in favour of taking all steps to preserve life is not irrebutable, and that the steps proposed by the Trust will, in relation to palliative chemotherapy result in side effects and, in relation to the administration of opiate painkillers carry a small risk, within the context of the strong presumption in favour of taking all steps to preserve life I am again satisfied that the steps proposed by the Trust are in SK&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have listened very carefully to the views of the parents in this case and I have accorded them weight.  I have borne carefully in mind that they know SK better than any other adult in the courtroom.  However, for the reasons I have set out in this judgment, I am not satisfied that their views should prevail in this case.  Whilst the mother in particular advances a carefully constructed alternative treatment plan, I regret that I cannot be satisfied that that plan can be said to be in SK&#8217;s best interests at this time.  The primary reason driving this conclusion is that the mother&#8217;s plan is based on her mistaken belief that SK&#8217;s diagnosis is incorrect and her view that he is not dying.  In circumstances where I have, regrettably, had to find the opposite, I cannot reach the conclusion that the plan carefully constructed and advanced by the mother and the father is one that could be said to be in SK&#8217;s best interests.   Further, I bear in mind that fact that, in circumstances where SK&#8217;s treating team take the view that the plan advanced by the mother is not in SK&#8217;s best interests, the court has no power to <span style="font-style:italic">require</span> doctors to carry out medical treatment against their own professional judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I am satisfied in this case, given the very strong views that have been expressed, in particular by the mother, regarding the treatment plan proposed by the Trust, that without an order in place there is every chance that the treating clinicians in this case will be faced by refusal or withdrawal of consent by the parents in respect to the palliative treatment regime I am satisfied is SK&#8217;s best interests.   As SK enters his last months, it will be entirely antithetic to his best interests for treatments put in place to ease his suffering to be interrupted or disrupted.  Such a situation could only add to his discomfort and distress.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that this is a further reason to make an order in the terms sought by the Trust is in SK&#8217;s best interests.  Further, in light of the mother&#8217;s somewhat equivocal position in the witness box when asked whether she would obey an order made by the court, and the father&#8217;s tendency on occasion to follow the mother&#8217;s lead that it is necessary to include a provision in the order prohibiting the mother and the father from preventing or impeding the treatment that this court has determined to declare is in SK&#8217;s best interests on all of the evidence available to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A Child) </span>Lady Justice King made clear that the test to be applied in cases of this nature is simply what is in the best interests of the child at the particular time in question, having regard to his welfare in the widest sense, not just medical but social and psychological.  In this almost unbearably sad case I am wholly satisfied that the palliative treatment plan advanced by the Trust is manifestly in SK&#8217;s best interests as the proper means of ensuring that that SK&#8217;s pain and other symptoms are adequately managed for the remainder of his life and that, during that period, he is assisted to maintain the best quality of life possible given the stage his condition has now reached and his prognosis.</p>

The ease with which such a question can be asked belies the brutal complexity of the tragic circumstances that give rise to it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The stark reality is that parents faced with a terminal illness befalling their child have to deal with that horror in the best way they can.  That will take many forms.  As I have already observed, in this case the father relies on hope and takes refuge in the possibility that there may yet be a miracle.   Whilst the mother objects fiercely to psychological input designed to assist SK to come to terms with his situation, to palliative chemotherapy and to drugs to ameliorate SK&#8217;s increasing pain, the unifying characteristic of each of these objections is their very close association with SK&#8217;s terminal prognosis.  Within this context, the mother&#8217;s objections are, I am satisfied, manifestations of her pain and inability to come to terms with SK&#8217;s diagnosis.  Neither the mother nor the father in this case are anything other than loving parents who are simply battling to stay upright in the darkening storm that has overwhelmed their family.  They should be accorded understanding and sympathy, as they have been and continue to be by the caring and conscientious medical team responsible for SK&#8217;s care.</p>
