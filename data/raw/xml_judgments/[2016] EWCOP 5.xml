	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are before the court two linked appeals from an order of District Judge Glentworth sitting in the Court of Protection in Leeds on 13 July 2015.  The appeals are brought against the refusal of an application brought by North Yorkshire County Council (&#8220;NYCC&#8221;) for authorisation for the deprivation of liberty of a man (&#8220;MAG&#8221;) at the home where he has lived since 2006.  The judgment supporting the order under appeal is reported as <span style="font-style:italic">North Yorkshire County Council v MAG, GC and A Clinical Commissioning Group</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/64" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 64" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 64</ref>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31 July 2015 NYCC issued an application for permission to appeal accompanied by a Notice of Appeal; a similar application and Notice of Appeal was soon thereafter issued by A Clinical Commissioning Group (&#8220;ACCG&#8221;) (3 August 2015).  The two public bodies make common cause, and have run complementary cases.  The applications for permission to appeal, and the proposed appeals, are opposed by the Official Solicitor acting on MAG&#8217;s behalf.   GC, mother of the subject of these proceedings, has made no formal statement in relation to the appeals, and was not present at the hearing.  The hearing before me (listed pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">rule 172(6) COP Rules 2007</span>) on 1 December was set up by HHJ Moir, as a combined hearing of the applications for permission to appeal, with appeals to follow.  I indicated at the outset of the hearing that I would hear full argument from the parties on the applications and appeals.  I am indebted to counsel for the clear and effective presentation of their arguments. I granted permission to the Official Solicitor to rely on matters set out in the full written argument of Ms Weereratne QC notwithstanding that there had not been full compliance with the rules (<span style="font-style:italic">rules 176(3)/(4)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">179(5) COP Rules 2007</span>).  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This appeal concerns MAG, who was born on 2 November 1980; he is therefore now 35 years old.  As a result of perinatal trauma, he suffers from autism, ataxic cerebral palsy, hearing and visual impairments and a learning disability.  He has a complex presentation, which includes behaviour which poses a risk to himself and others.  Proceedings in the Court of Protection were issued by NYCC on 7 September 2011, by which (as DJ Glentworth&#8217;s judgment records), NYCC sought declarations that MAG lacks capacity to: </p>

The key issue before the court which led to the order under appeal concerned MAG&#8217;s deprivation of liberty which was and is inextricably linked with his place of residence and care package (see [7] below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MAG has lived in his current home since 2006.  NYCC is responsible for meeting MAG&#8217;s accommodation needs, which are in part (25%) funded by them, but largely (75%) funded by ACCG.  The property is a one-bedroom ground floor flat, which is too small to accommodate the use of a wheelchair; there is no scope for sleeping night staff. MAG has a support team of 11 workers and up to 4 workers are involved in his care each day. He is able to access the community on a daily basis but there is no outside space which he can use at the property; the property is in a town centre, and MAG derives pleasure from sitting at his window watching the world go by. DJ Glentworth summarised (at &#167;7) MAG&#8217;s use of his home as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8220;MAG cannot stand independently and when he is at home in his ground-floor flat he mobilises by crawling and pulling himself along the floor and up on to chairs and his bed. He uses a wheelchair outdoors and is secured when in it by the use of a Crelling (Houdini) harness which serves as a protection for him and others. He is unable to use his wheelchair indoors because there is insufficient room to enable him to manoeuvre it. He has 1:1 support at all times and 2:1 support in the community save for those times when an experienced and willing member of his care team takes him out in his wheelchair. Since December 2011 he has received 35 hours of 2:1 support each week (increased from 28 hours). At all other times he remains in his flat.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8220;The corridor leading from the bedroom to the lounge and kitchen is too narrow to move a wheelchair into those rooms. He moves around the flat on his bottom and using his hands and knees. This has resulted in him sustaining painful bursitis in both knees and he has calluses to his knees and ankles. Ms Hutchinson [Registered Nurse Learning Disability] advised that MAG's current property does not meet his needs and that he should be able to live in a property which ensures he can live a life with dignity and comfort and which does not cause him physical or emotional harm&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8220;I note that when MAG was at the residential care home whilst his property was refurbished he mobilised within the care home using his wheelchair. I am not satisfied that, if he had the option of using his wheelchair within his home, he would choose not to use it. In his present accommodation he is deprived even of that option&#8221;.</p>

The judge later found (at &#167;39) that NYCC&#8217;s failure &#8220;in its attitude towards the search for less restrictive accommodation&#8221; had caused significant delay and lengthened these proceedings. The judge referred to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s stance on the type/quality of MAG&#8217;s property as imposing a &#8220;disproportionate deprivation of liberty in this case&#8221; (&#167;33).  The judge then went on to set out her conclusions (at &#167;41 and &#167;42) as follows:</p>

This may be all that is available at present but I am not satisfied that NYCC has taken the steps necessary to ensure that there is no breach of its obligations. I am aware of the steps which have been taken recently. However, MAG's needs were identified by the assessment in 2006. It is clear that the Tenancy does not meet those needs and that should have been clear when the property was identified by GC in 2006. In 2013 the Commissioners accepted a move would be in MAG's best interests and would be less restrictive. This is a question of MAG's liberty and I do not accept that I can authorise the deprivation of that liberty on the basis that nothing else is available. He has been in this unsatisfactory situation for a prolonged period. NYCC has been extremely slow to accept its responsibilities in relation to re-housing him. These proceedings started in 2011 and it was not until 2 August 2013 that it accepted it owed a duty in this respect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge identified the questions to be asked in this case (at &#167;14 of her judgment see [11] above); these questions had been formulated by counsel for the Official Solicitor and set out in his position statement for the hearing.  The questions as crafted by counsel had the potential to send the judge off course, and regrettably I believe did so.   All substantive decisions in the Court of Protection are governed by the best interests test, and yet the judge did not pose such a question for herself.  She went straight to consider &#8220;whether the elements of the care package which involve a deprivation of liberty are lawful&#8221;.  In my judgment, there was a need to break her decision-making down into two separate questions which required consideration in this case, namely:</p>

The deprivation of liberty arising on the implementation of the care package for MAG is a necessary consequence of the least restrictive available option which best promotes his needs (see also [72] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re NRA &amp; Others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/59" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 59" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 59</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The passage quoted in full above from the supplementary judgment does not, in my view, explain paragraph &#167;28 of the principal judgment.  DJ Glentworth sought to make a distinction between welfare decisions (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span>) and decisions involving deprivation of liberty (as here), but I find her reasoning unconvincing.  She identifies no passage in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN </span> which purports to limit its scope, nor does she identify any proper basis for asserting that the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN </span>as to the limits of the Court of Protection&#8217;s role is irrelevant where <span style="font-style:italic">Article </span>5 is engaged.  Her reasoning and conclusion is the more surprising given that deprivation of liberty issues which arise in these circumstances (under <span style="font-style:italic">section 4A(4) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">section 16(2)(a) </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>)<span style="font-style:italic"/>arise specifically in the context of the court&#8217;s consideration of welfare and proportionality which in turn specifically engage the fundamental principles confirmed and discussed at length in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span> (see also Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re NRA &amp; Others</span> (above: [25]) at [41(i)]: &#8220;the determinative test on an application for a welfare order to authorise a deprivation of liberty is a best interests test&#8221;).  If there is any doubt (which in my view there is not) it is useful, as Ms Morris argued, to check this against the directly analogous situation if MAG had been resident in residential care.  In such circumstances, NYCC would have had to apply for standard authorisation under <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule A1</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>; standard authorisation would have to be in P&#8217;s best interests (para.12 and 16(3)), and a &#8220;proportionate response&#8221; to the likelihood of &#8220;the relevant person suffering harm and the seriousness of that harm&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">para.16(5)</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule A1</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>).  Ms Morris makes good her submission that the requirement of proportionality must similarly apply to a determination under <span style="font-style:italic">section 4A</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">section 16</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span> applies across all welfare determinations, including those which involve deprivation of liberty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If there were any legitimate challenge on public law grounds to the actions of NYCC, Miss Morris further contended that proportionality would be directly relevant, and a proportionate response would be one (a) whose objective justifies the limitation imposed, (b) is the least restrictive alternative and (c) strikes a fair balance between (for instance) the individual and the state.  When assessing whether a fair balance has been struck, the court should afford the decision-maker a margin of appreciation, and its role is therefore confined to that of carrying out a review of that decision (see <span style="font-style:italic">R(Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2001/26" uk:canonical="[2001] UKHL 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] UKHL 26</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 AC 532" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 AC 532</ref> at [27], and <span style="font-style:italic">R(P) v Mersey Care NHS Trust</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/994" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 994 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 994 (Admin)</ref>).  She further argued that a court should afford a margin of appreciation to a public authority charged with making decisions about the allocation of its limited resources, as to which those who lack capacity have no greater claim simply by virtue of that lack of capacity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span> at [46]: &#8220;the public authority, as with the authorities involved in the present case, will have to have regard to the interests of a very wide group of service users who are, in the nature of things, competing with each other for the allocation of often scarce resources&#8221;).  Insofar as DJ Glentworth sought to apply public law principles in her determination, her judgment contains no reference to the margin of appreciation to which NYCC was entitled. In fairness, I am not sure that she was addressed on the point.  </p>

The judge contemplated (indeed intended) that by refusing the authorisation NYCC would have to take urgent action to locate and provide alternative accommodation for MAG (&#8220;NYCC must take the steps necessary to ensure that there is no breach&#8221;); this, in my judgment, was the essential purpose which drove the judge&#8217;s conclusion in this case but it placed wholly unjustified pressure on NYCC as a public authority.  As Mr Stonor observed, the import of the judge&#8217;s decision was that NYCC must move MAG from his home (where he has been for 9 years) forthwith.  A hurried move would have in fact been wholly contrary to the expert advice before the court, which was to the effect that any house-move for MAG would have to be done slowly and carefully; this would be a project with a long-term goal (as Ms Weereratne reminded me in her submissions) requiring a &#8220;lengthy and detailed piece of work&#8221; &#8211; per Christine Hutchinson.    In adopting the line she did, the judge wrongly overlooked this evidence and placed NYCC under the sort of &#8220;impermissible pressure&#8221; which the President deprecated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span> at [82] (see [33](iv) above), the effect of which could have been detrimental to MAG.</p>

Of greater concern to me is that such a suggestion would doubtless have been deeply offensive to the conscientious care staff offering, in the view of the jointly instructed experts, good quality of care to MAG; Ms Hutchinson had, for example, told the judge:</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span>, the hearing of the key issue took place in 2013; in the instant proceedings the key hearing only took place in March 2015.  These proceedings (concerning MAG) are now in their fifth year following 12 directions and similar hearings. What lies behind this delay is difficult to determine; all parties who have volunteered a view have unsurprisingly diverted responsibility away from themselves.  Whatever the reason, these proceedings have been ongoing for far too long and I suspect that they could have been concluded within a fraction of the time and the current estimated combined costs of more than &#163;230,000. </p>

This was a case in which she had made interim deprivation of liberty authorisations from November 2011 through to July 2015; she was conscious of the ramifications of the refusal of the authorisation.  The grant of an interim order pending appeal is well within the discretion of the court, and I therefore propose to say no more.    However, the upshot was that MAG was unlawfully deprived of his liberty in his home.  To their immense credit, the care workers continued to work on the case, with MAG, albeit that there must have been a question about the frustration of the contract, and the validity of any insurance for their activities.  Ironically, by refusing the protection of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>, MAG lost the right of review of his situation.</p>
