Another refers to a probability of paternity of over 99.96 per cent which is described as "virtual proof of paternity".  </p>

The estate further asserts that in any event, under the law of Turkey, no reliance can be placed (for limitation reasons) upon DNA tests done in 2004 and that if any DNA tests are to be relied upon, the body must be exhumed which, I understand, no party would wish avoidably to happen.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purpose of the present case and decision, I summarise those principles very briefly as follows.  I must first consider whether there is another more appropriate forum (<span style="font-style:italic">vis</span> in this case the proceedings in Turkey).  If there is, then these English proceedings should be stayed, unless the applicant can show circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should, nevertheless, not be granted.  By more appropriate forum,   Lord Goff&#160; meant (see his principal (a)) "i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all parties and the ends of justice."</p>

That topic is not at all within the jurisdiction or competence of this court nor even, as it were, on the agenda here.  However, it is only the courts of England and Wales which can grant to the applicant what she seeks here, namely, a statutory declaration of parentage pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section.55</ref>A of the English Family Law Act, 1986. </p>

Further, an email from the General Register Office, now at bundle p.E25, makes absolutely clear that the applicant will never be able to achieve the re-registration of her birth to show the name of her father without such a declaration.  The email states:  </p>

Further, as I have stated, the pleaded position of the estate in Turkey is that the applicant is now time&#160;barred altogether from claiming or obtaining any finding as to paternity there.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in my view, the submission of Ms.&#160;Haren on behalf of the estate that they should not have to litigate the factual issue of paternity concurrently in two jurisdictions does not lie easily with their contention in Turkey that, in any event, it cannot be litigated there at all.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">To contend in England that the issue as to paternity should be decided in Turkey, coupled with a simultaneous contention in Turkey that the issue cannot be decided there, being time&#160;barred, is, to my mind, a patent tactical manoeuvre.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is said by Ms.&#160;Haren that the balance of convenience of witnesses favours litigation in Turkey.  I cannot accept that.  There is, indeed, only one living person who knows the truth of these matters, paternity being settled at the moment of conception, and that is the mother.  She lives here and has explained in a statement that her health and other circumstances (she has to care for her own aged mother) would not permit her to travel to Turkey.  The other key witness is the applicant herself who can testify that the deceased recognised and treated her as his daughter, albeit that his family in Turkey were unaware of that fact.</p>

If any question arises as to the reliability of the samples or of those reports, that is better investigated and tested by oral evidence here, where the samples were taken, the tests done, and the reports produced.  </p>
