The judge also made orders pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91 (14)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> which meant the father required the leave of the court to make an application either for R to live with him or to spend time with R. The &#8216;leave&#8217; requirement was to last until 27 August 2019 in respect of spending time with R and until 27 August 2020 in respect of whom R would live with.  </p>

It will also be immediately apparent at the findings made in respect of the mother were of a very serious nature indeed to the extent that the finding at x) is couched in the language of the threshold criteria set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. It is implicit in the finding but is clear from the judgment that the harm the judge concluded that R had suffered and was at risk of suffering in the future was attributable to the care given to R by the mother. It&#8217;s equally clear that that care was not what it would be reasonable to expect the mother to give to him. That highlights the potential public law dimension of the case.  </p>

He did not lodge an appeal in respect of the supervision order. This was because an appeal in respect of the supervision order would lie not to this court but to the Court of Appeal and given his principal complaint related to the child arrangements order, he focused his efforts (and his financial resources) on challenging the order which was of most direct relevance to him and to R and the mother. This appeal highlights a difficulty that both litigants and the court face where in complex private law cases there is an interface with public law which can be dealt with at the same level of the judiciary at first instance but where the paths part company for appellate purposes. However the local authority were identified as respondents to the appeal and on 8 October 2018 Mr Justice Baker (as he then was) directed that </p>

That counsel for the father and for the mother should appear pro bono in such a complex case as this is in the finest traditions of the legal profession. Up and down the country, counsel, solicitors and legal executives fill the gaping holes in the fabric of legal aid in private law cases because of their commitment to the delivery of justice. Without such public-spirited lawyers how would those such as the father and mother in this case navigate the process and present their cases? How judges manage to deliver justice to the parties and an appropriate judgment for the child without such assistance in cases like this begs the question. It is a blight on the current legal aid system that cases such as this do not attract public funding. So far removed from the stereotyped &#8216;fat-cat,&#8217; the legal profession in cases such as this are more akin to Boxer in George Orwell&#8217;s &#8216;Animal Farm&#8217; always telling themselves &#8220;I will work harder.&#8221; </p>

The effect of her evidence was that R would suffer significant harm if his relationship with his father was lost. She considered that the harm he would suffer in his mother&#8217;s care could be ameliorated by undertaking therapeutic work to enable the mother better to meet R&#8217;s emotional needs. She considered that if the mother did not make progress in her capacity to meet R&#8217;s emotional needs the harm he may suffer in her care could outweigh the harm that would be caused by removing him from her care. The decision to terminate contact and to end the proceedings without further investigation carried with it the inevitable consequence that R would remain in the care of his mother and be exposed to the risk that Dr Duprey identified. The combined benefits of facilitating the re-establishment of contact and addressing the mother&#8217;s capacity ought to have led to the conclusion that further enquiries were required to address those issues. The court placed insufficient weight on the medium to long term harm that R might suffer as compared to the short-term harm that he would suffer by the continuation of the proceedings or further work on contact. </p>

This is because the central reason for providing for indirect contact via the mother was to avoid the harm that continuing involvement of social workers in R&#8217;s life would cause and the central reason underpinning the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order was to avoid R being exposed to ongoing proceedings and the harm that would cause. One of the principal reasons for ordering that there should be no direct contact was because of the harm that was being caused to R by continued involvement with social workers in relation to contact and continued exposure to the court proceedings and the tension and conflict arising therefrom. Thus unless the father succeeded on his arguments in relation to direct contact he would not succeed in relation to indirect contact and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91 (14)</ref> and vice versa.  </p>

The judgment records that regular contact took place during July to November 2015 albeit not without difficulty in particular towards the end of that period. It is the appellant&#8217;s case that at that point the mother alleged that the father had threatened to kill R; which R had written in a notebook. The mother made an application to suspend child arrangements. It appears that this allegation was also not found to be true or was not pursued.

At that point the view of the social worker was that contact had been positive and that the mother was unreasonably preventing contact and this could cause significant harm to R. It is also asserted by the appellant father that the local authority concluded that the allegation that the father had threatened to kill R was unfounded and that R had himself been primed to make the disclosure by his mother; he himself telling them that.

At that time she was clear that R very much values and enjoys the time he spent with the father; he spoke openly and spontaneously about the activities he enjoyed doing with his father and showed no hesitation in speaking to her about it. At that time she considered his attitude was very positive and perhaps indicated a greater level of stability likely due to the involvement of social care and the court. She raised concerns about the parenting capacity of each parent and the harm that R was exposed to. Given his clear autistic traits he had a particular need for stability consistency and clarity in his relationship with his parents. Her main concern related to the mother&#8217;s capacity to allow R to developmentally separate, to have his own emotional experiences validated and to develop his own ideas and beliefs, especially in relation to his father. She concluded that R&#8217;s welfare was best met living with his mother but having regular contact with his father with a high level of monitoring from children&#8217;s services. She strongly recommended that initial conversations be had with both parents around the possibility of engaging with some family therapy intervention at some point in the future. </p>

All legal representatives agreed that it was not in R&#8217;s best interests for the court to make findings of fact in relation to the allegations indicating that they were not likely to affect the outcome of the plan. His Honour Judge Thorp agreed.  An agreed threshold was part of the order. It is expressed in terms of R having suffered emotional harm because of ongoing conflict between the parents in arranging contact. It records that the mother has made repeated allegations which have not been substantiated by the local authority and no findings have been made. It records that R has suffered emotional harm by being drawn into the conflict. It also records his suffered emotional harm in the mother&#8217;s care due to her emotional influence, but this is attributed to R being able to detect from the mother&#8217;s demeanour that she is frightened of the father. On the basis of that agreed threshold a supervision order was also made in conjunction with the child arrangements orders.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">It is of course easy with the benefit of hindsight to criticise threshold being agreed on such a basis. The proceedings were now some 18 months old, serious allegations had been made by the mother against the father (including several to the police) and serious allegations of emotional abuse or alienation had been made by the father against the mother. On the other hand contact appeared to be moving forwards in a positive way with the support of the local authority and as Ms Phillips argued on behalf of the Guardian, it is hardly surprising that all parties thought it would be counter-productive to contact to embark on a highly contentious fact-finding at that </p>

It is never easy to know when to embark on fact-finding and when to let sleeping dogs lie. Some dogs remain asleep for very lengthy periods and allegations fade into the background. Other dogs who have appeared to be soundly asleep can quickly awaken and deliver a nasty bite as the allegations re-emerge with full force. Differentiating between the two is never easy and there are no clear markers which point to one rather than the other. It is of course essential that the social work professionals, the lawyers and the judge expressly consider the issue and the respective benefits of or harm that fact-finding might result in or engender and that this is openly recorded. This approach would be consistent with the practice set out in PD12B and PD12J, paragraph 18 and would ensure that the issue is not overlooked. </p>

There were then difficulties, although the social workers and support workers continued to put in substantial efforts to move it forwards. Contact continued to be positive when it happened but there were increasing difficulties in arranging it. In early 2017 shortly after there had been another overnight contact the mother stopped overnights and shortly thereafter stopped contact altogether. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">In May 2017 the father issued an application to enforce the child arrangements order. At that stage he was not seeking a change of residence but rather the reinstatement of contact. At that stage he did not wish to have the mother penalised. On 14 September 2017 the local authority applied for an extension to the supervision order. Those applications came before His Honour Judge Thorp on 12 October 2017. I&#8217;m not sure why it took five months for the father&#8217;s enforcement application to be listed for case management although it appears there may have been an earlier hearing in July at which some interim orders were made. I do not have a copy of that order. The mother was represented and opposed the resumption of contact and sought to suspend the order of 20 July 2016 (see paragraph 12 for of the order of 12 October 2017). The Guardian supported the resumption of contact with the assistance of the local authority. The court refused the mother&#8217;s application to suspend contact and expressed the view that there should be contact between R and the father and the court expressed the view that the local authority should assist the parties in enabling contact to take place including by supervising. The mother was warned that if she did not comply with the court&#8217;s orders this might affect her case in future. A further case management hearing was listed on 13 December 2017 to include consideration of whether there should be a fact-finding hearing. R was a party to both sets of proceedings. </p>

The court was informed that the local authority were meeting to discuss whether care proceedings should now be commenced. She sought an adjournment.

I am not clear how it was that the issue of an intermediary only came up at this hearing. In any event the hearing was adjourned and relisted for case management on 27 March.

Part of the reasons underpinning this was that Dr Duprey had opined that further direct work with R would cause harm to him. It appears likely that by that stage the local authority had not only taken the decision that they would not issue care proceedings but in accordance with the care plan dated 9 May 2018, that they had decided not to seek an extension of the supervision order still less to seek a care order. The care plan records that they considered there were insufficient grounds to issue proceedings. The care plan records that they were of the view that no further work is needed or can be done with the family that will provide any meaningful change to the current situation and that further involvement from social services could have a detrimental effect on R [G248]. The father apparently opposed the proposal for a combined hearing and had proposed more specialist expert involvement if the court made a finding of parental alienation.  </p>

His Honour Judge Thorp concluded that it was only during the final hearing that the mother fully understood the proceedings. During the final hearing, as set out at paragraph 17 of the judgment, His Honour Judge Thorp had available five ring binders (I suspect lever arch files) of evidence.

His lengthy and comprehensive judgment addresses issues of the utmost seriousness in the private law arena. He ultimately concluded that R should live with his mother but have no direct contact with his father. The findings that are incorporated within the judgment make clear that he envisaged that R would thereafter have no relationship with his father or the paternal family. He identified a glimmer of hope in recent small changes in the mother&#8217;s approach but I think it is fair to say that the balance of the judgment envisages the likelihood being that R would have no relationship with his father or paternal family for many years to come.  </p>

Whether or not the court makes an order for contact, direct contact will not occur in the short term and very probably over the longer term. Given R&#8217;s present position, there is a high risk that the mother will not encourage him to have contact with his father, that she will not promote indirect contact, and there is a risk that she will continue to encourage R in his present view. While I accept that R is presently&#8221; content not to see his father a lack of relationship with him will cause significant harm in the future. He will also suffer harm if he cannot have contact with the paternal family... That having been said, I take into account the history of the proceedings. Many (though far from all) of the problems have arisen around attempts at overnight contact and, for periods, contact has worked. If R knows that he is being listened to, and if the mother knows that he is staying with her, I agree with the children&#8217;s Guardian that there is at least some prospect that indirect contact will work. As I have indicated, there is also a risk arising out of the enmeshed relationship itself-that is that R will not fully develop his own personality and that in itself will cause him harm.&#8221; </span></p>

I have already addressed the fact that if it does not, then that will be very harmful to R in the short and long term. There is also a risk of significant harm to R if an order for contact is made. Once again, I have dealt with this issue when addressing the evidence of Dr Duprey and the children&#8217;s Guardian, and I accept their evidence. It is clear that even discussing the issue of contact causes ME considerable distress, and forcing R into contact at this time will also cause him significant harm. He is firmly set against seeing his father and is resistant to doing so. His behaviours in March and May of this year demonstrate that an order for contact may cause him not only emotional harm may cause him to put himself at risk. At present none of the parties have put forward a feasible solution to the difficulty-indeed the lack of such a feasible solution forms part of the father&#8217;s main case on transfer of residence.&#8217; </span></p>

It is clearly not possible for contact to take place without further intervention, and further intervention with R is likely to be damaging to him. He has been through many years of litigation and uncertainty, and needs some time to settle in his mother&#8217;s care without the pressure upon him of seeing his father. In my judgment it is in his welfare interests for there not to be an order for direct contact. Neither is there any practical way for contact to resume.

Ultimately he was faced with two equally unattractive options, neither of which was obvious and each of which saw R exposed to the risk of suffering further harm. Ms Phillips submits that if His Honour Judge Thorp was careful enough to have made a proper and correct assessment of the mother in making the findings how can it be said that his assessment of the parties and the welfare impact is fundamentally flawed? I have to say I do not read Ms Hylton&#8217;s skeleton as suggesting that the judgment is somehow deficient or fundamentally wrong. Ms Hylton&#8217;s argument is much more nuanced. Plainly a judge can get many things right in a judgment but none of us are infallible, and we may also get things wrong however many other things we got right. In matters of evaluation of facts and the exercise of pure discretion appellate courts have accepted that the grounds for intervention are narrow indeed. On matters of fact, the appellate court will only interfere where the conclusion is one that was not reasonably open to the judge on the evidence. On matters of pure discretion the appellate court will only intervene where the discretion has been exercised in a way that is outside the parameters within which reasonable disagreement is possible. However on matters of evaluation the appellate courts clearly can and do intervene if a matter has been given weight it cannot reasonably bear or where a matter has been given clearly insufficient weight or overlooked. Where such flaws are immaterial to the outcome no intervention will follow. However where such flaws are significant and clearly material to the outcome the appellate court may well conclude that the decision was wrong. </p>

She submitted that the Guardian had supported the ideal of ongoing contact but the reality was that no viable plan to move matters forward had been constructed and thus he reluctantly concluded that no contact should be ordered as it was not in R&#8217;s best interests to continue to try. Ms Phillips noted that the local authority had given evidence about how they could put Dr Duprey&#8217;s recommendations into effect. She said their response was that they had undertaken the CFIS work with the mother and R. The inference was that there was nothing further they could do. Ms Phillips however accepted that the local authority had not made the sort of enquiries that Dr Duprey had spoken of and to that extent there was a gap in the evidence before the judge. Ms Phillips emphasised that the local authority had been heavily involved historically through section 37 Children Act directions and subsequently through the supervision order. They also had reached the conclusion that any further work with R would be harmful. They had also reached the conclusion that the mother would not cooperate with them in any further work and so did not see how they could conduct further work. The Guardian was clear that any ongoing proposal of work with R would be harmful.  </p>

Ms Phillips submits that the findings of fact clearly were not determinative in the father&#8217;s favour and cannot be viewed in isolation of the judge&#8217;s other conclusions in respect of the mother which included that there had been difficulties with communication and her understanding because of her deafness and that he rejected the father&#8217;s case that the mother had hatched a plan to end his relationship with R.  I entirely agree with Ms Phillips that the findings of fact cannot be viewed in isolation nor are they determinative in a way which operates against the mother. However that does not lead to the conclusion that they were not relevant to the welfare outcome; either in how the welfare outcome was to be reached or in its actual determination. </p>

Her opinion on the need for therapeutic intervention in order to ameliorate the risk of future psychological harm was also likely to be particularly important.  The core of Dr Duprey's conclusion was that R should have contact with his father and that work be carried out with both parents to enable contact to move forwards. She considered that the therapy that had been carried out to date had been wrongly focused on R and that it should have been focused on the parents in particular the mother. She said she thought there was the possibility for some shift with more intensive work and more long term work with the mother. She thought it might take place over a period of six months, albeit said it would probably more given the mother's additional needs. She thought it needed a specialist in the field of parental alienation and she was concerned about the local authority not playing any role in the family's future and thought they may be best placed to identify local agencies or experts who can help. She was clear that she thought the local authority should remain involved with the family albeit the focus should not be on R. In her evidence she confirmed that even if that work could not be done, she did not think that contact should not take place. She clearly thought that responsibility for the adverse shift in R's position was linked to the mother's having become more fixed in her position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">It is not clear why Dr Duprey did not express an opinion on whether the making or not making of findings against the father or mother would make a difference to her opinion in May 2018. In her 2016 report, she had opined that R and the mother were somewhat enmeshed and there was a risk that R would struggle to develop his own separate identity to his mother and was likely to develop a pattern of prioritising the needs of others above his own. She said her main concern related to the mother's capacity to allow R to developmentally separate and to have his own emotional experiences validated and to develop his own ideas and beliefs especially in relation to his father. At that point contact was taking place and she recommended continued regular contact with the father. She recommended that more intensive reflective work was undertaken with both parents but especially with the mother. She went on to say that if the mother continues to show very little capacity to develop her understanding of R's emotional world, despite additional focused intervention, it may be that the concerns around her parenting capacity outweigh the potential effect of separation on R. She said she was not optimistic about the capacity for much perspective shift from either parent particularly the mother. Given the conclusions that His Honour Judge Thorp reached in relation to the mother's attitude to the father and the likelihood of R continuing to suffer significant harm whilst in her care it is almost impossible to reconcile that finding with the statement that Dr Duprey in 2016 had thought there would be no difference to her recommendations whatever the fact-finding process delivered. In her oral evidence she said [G4] it was an incredibly difficult situation to make any clear recommendations about. She recommended R remain with his mother because of the worry about the impact of separation on him. That concern led her on balance at the moment to recommend that he should stay with his mum. In her evidence she talks about her concerns about the impact on R of ongoing proceedings and conflict being harmful. She also is clear in her recommendation that R should be having contact with his father, that he was positive about it and that he benefited from it. The majority of her evidence focused on the issue of the impact on R of being moved from his mother's care, his exposure to parental conflict and the reasons for him expressing the views he was (both as to the allegations and his antipathy to contact). During questioning by Ms Hylton, she expressed the view that if the mother had primed for alienating R that it would be very concerning and the nature of the allegations put it at the extreme end of the spectrum of influencing children. She said that aspect of the priming would be very serious emotional abuse of R. Her evidence was that if R remained in the care of his mother he would continue to suffer significant emotional harm on the basis both of what had happened and what was likely to happen in the future [G45] she thought that without intervention with the mother that the emotionally harmful behaviour would continue. When she was asked about the harm arising from no contact, she said that the absence of conflict and the stress would be a benefit. She agreed that growing up without knowing his father was a negative and said she felt terminating contact was too extreme and she did not recommend it. What she did not do though and she does not appear to have been asked by anybody in either her report or her oral evidence was to articulate precisely in psychological and developmental terms the possible or likely consequences for R of: </p>

Dr Duprey was very clear in her evidence that R should have contact with his father and that further work should be undertaken to progress that with the mother in particular. Although she had not specifically identified resources she was clear in her evidence that this should be undertaken and thought the local authority would be best placed to do that. I do not think that the failed contact in May 2018 and the fact that it took place after Dr Duprey gave evidence undermines the overall either the specific conclusions she reached or the overall thrust of her advice.   </p>

Neither saw that as a window of opportunity for therapy though. This must arise from the fact that the Guardian in particular had concluded that there was no further possible therapeutic way ahead identified. Of course if there was a therapeutic way ahead, or the possibility that such a way ahead existed but had not been identified, if there was thought to be a change, even if subtle in the mother&#8217;s capacity to recognise R's needs, surely this was the time to move with the therapy identified by Dr Duprey. Such insight as the mother had gained through the process surely needed nurturing with careful ongoing work rather than being left untended. Given her previous position it was far more probable, and implicitly recognised by the judge, that the mother would continue to behave in the way her historical record suggested she would than for the hope to blossom into realisation and action.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">Whilst the judge acknowledges and indeed characterises the lack of contact as being very harmful in the short and long-term he compares this to the significant harm that would be caused by discussing or forcing R to have contact. Whilst I do not underestimate at all the powerful evidence of R's response to attempts at contact this is clearly a short-term issue that might be capable of being addressed; indeed Dr Duprey considered that it could be and even if it could not be, thought that contact should still be pursued (albeit I accept this was before the May 2018 attempt). Although the evidence as to the medium to long term harm was not articulated as clearly as it might have been the overall effect of the evidence was of very considerable medium to long-term harm arising from a number of sources. This was not simply a case of harm arising from a lack of contact. To that had to be added the harm being done to R himself as a result of the false narrative he had absorbed about his father and thus his genetic heritage. In addition to this was the harm that had been identified arising from the enmeshed relationship. The clear conclusion of Dr Duprey was that if there was not a change in the mother&#8217;s capacity to meet R&#8217;s needs the harm that he would suffer was so great that it might outweigh the very considerable distress and harm that everybody agreed would result from his being separated from his mother. That the child psychology expert had characterised the ongoing harm as potentially outweighing the harm of separation seems to me to be a very powerful indication of the extent of the potential harm she foresaw. In particular given that the court was not contemplating any means by which the mother&#8217;s capacity might be improved by taking up the recommendation of Dr Duprey, that the mother in particular undergo intensive therapy, the inevitable conclusion was that because the mother would not change without therapy therefore R was likely to be exposed to emotional harm of sufficient magnitude that might require his removal from his mother's care. The harm that His Honour Judge Thorp refers to is not identified as being of this magnitude. It must of course be recognised that His Honour Judge Thorp was faced with a question to which he had not been provided with a clear answer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">Although in paragraph 115 His Honour Judge Thorp returns to the issue of harm when looking at the capability of the parents of meeting his needs and refers to there being concerns about the enmeshed relationship between the mother and R the principal concern is identified as the mother's ability to meet R<span style="font-family:Arial">&#8217;</span>s need to have a relationship with his father. In her 2016 report [G108-110] Dr Duprey&#8217;s concerns about the mother's ability to allow R to developmentally separate were much wider. In her 2018 report her recommendations as to the mother's need for therapy were not limited to her views as to the father but were more broad-based in terms of the mother's capacity to reflect on R's emotional needs. Her conclusions at para 4.16 [G183] deal with the mother&#8217;s capacity to develop her understanding of R's emotional world and if that did not develop the concerns about her parenting capacity would outweigh the potential effect of separation. It does not seem to me that these concerns from the expert in child psychology are reflected in the conclusions as to the harm that R had suffered and the harm he was at risk of suffering. To the extent that they are referred to [para 116] they do not appear to have been given the weight it seems to me that they deserved. This may be because (as I have set out above) Dr Duprey had not been asked or had not of her own volition fully articulated the psychological consequences for R of the continuation of the enmeshed relationship, the holding of false views about his father, and the lack of any relationship with his father or his paternal family. Given the mother's relative isolation in terms of her social and family circle this assumed even more significance. </p>

As Ms Phillips and Mr Egleton emphasised and as is clear from the judgment, there was no formulated proposal before the court to take the matter forward. They rightly emphasise that the opinion of Dr Duprey and the views of the Guardian and others was that R was suffering emotional harm from involvement with social workers and attempts at contact. His Honour Judge Thorp rightly laid considerable emphasis on this in paragraph 116 of the judgment. I was told in submissions by Ms Phillips that the Guardian had made enquiries through Cafcass of whether a child contact intervention programme in particular the high conflict intervention might be available. I was told that due to both a lack of space and an indication that it was considered the parties were too far apart meant this was not available. Ms Phillips though, frankly accepted that the local authority had not pursued enquiries into possible resources. This it seems was as a result of a crisis within the local authority but also no doubt due to the fact that the local authority had moved from considering the issue of care proceedings all the way through to the threshold not being met and there being no ongoing role for them. It does not appear that Dr Duprey&#8217;s recommendation that R and the parents needed a high level of local authority support and that they may be able to identify and access (or at least identify) resources which would be able to deliver the sort of therapy that Dr Duprey had identified as necessary in contrast to the work that had been done by the local authority which Dr Duprey considered was wrongly focused both in respect of the work done with the mother and with R. That is not a criticism of the local authority because in her first report Dr Duprey had not fully set out her recommendations and it does not appear she had been asked to clarify the precise nature of the programme of therapy that she thought was required. Nor had the father identified a therapist who might be able to do the work Dr Duprey recommended. The reason for this seems to be a combination of the fact that it was only during her evidence in May that Dr Duprey clarified the sort of work that she was talking about and that the conjoined fact-finding and outcome hearing had led to the father nailing his colours to the mast of a transfer of residence. Had a fact-finding taken place separately and had the parties been able to reflect upon the conclusions in particular the conclusion that R had suffered and was likely to continue to suffer significant emotional harm from the mother&#8217;s parenting of him it seems inconceivable that the court would not have had before it before finally determining matters proposals from at least the father but also almost inevitably from the local authority of a quite different sort to that which the judge was faced with.  </p>

The judge approached the matter on the basis that any further work would involve R in it. That does not appear to me to be a full reflection of what Dr Duprey was saying. Her evidence was clear that the emphasis needed to be on work primarily with the mother but also with the father. This would clearly be a precursor to work with R. It seems implicit in her evidence that if the mother made progress, R himself would not then be exposed to such a degree of hostility and would not then himself be likely to be so opposed or upset by the idea of contact. This is noted in paragraph 126 where His Honour Judge Thorp said that Dr Duprey&#8217;s evidence was that the resources for such work do not appear to be available. On my reading of the evidence, her view was that they had not been identified rather than that they were not available. He also notes that work with the mother would take some time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.22in">Whilst the judge in paragraph 129 clearly refers explicitly to the harm that would be caused by continuing the process of seeking to establish contact and whilst he does refer back to his earlier conclusions on the risk of harm to R of there being no contact and him remaining in the sole care of his mother the central (albeit not only) factor in the welfare checklist was the risk of harm. This requires the balancing of the harm (short and perhaps longer term) to R of seeking to progress contact as against medium to long-term harm arising from the various sources which would come into play in the event of no contact; inextricably linked with no further therapy for the mother. For a combination of reasons, I do not consider that this balancing exercise took place in the way it ought to have. This was to some extent due to the fact that no one had elicited from Dr Duprey the sort of explicit assessment of the likely nature of the harm and its consequences for R; it was also in part attributable to the fact that the parties and the court had not, because of the conjoined hearing, focused so clearly on the consequences of the fact-finding and the imperative need for identification of resources to provide the therapy Dr Duprey had identified was necessary both to further contact but also to reduce the risk of emotional harm arising from the mothers inability to identify R's emotional needs. As I have referred to before given Dr Duprey had indicated that this harm was so significant it would potentially outweigh the harm of separating R from his mother the absence of this from the evaluation of the balance of harm as an explicit component and the absence from the evaluation of the balance of harm of the full extent of the other aspects of harm lead me to the conclusion that ultimately the evaluation the judge undertook failed to give due weight to (a) the consequences of the findings as articulated in ground one; (b) the long-term harm that R would suffer by not having a relationship with his father and the paternal family as opposed to the short-term disruption of restarting contact) (c) did not give due weight to the ongoing long-term emotional harm that would be caused to R by him remaining in the mother&#8217;s care in the context of the serious findings of her emotional abuse of R, her denial to R of a relationship with his father and the paternal family, and Dr Duprey's concerns about the emotionally neglectful parenting that R will receive from his mother in the future. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Grounds ii) and vi)</span></p>

Although she frankly concedes that the father did not seek an adjournment, he having opposed a conjoined hearing and for financial reasons being anxious for a final decision to transfer residence being made, she justifiably made the point that this was not a situation that the father wished to be in but rather had been forced on him by the adjournment of the fact-finding on 21 March and the subsequent decision to undertake a conjoined hearing. Ms Hylton had earlier referred and His Honour Judge Thorp refers to it in the judgment to the possible need for a more specialist expert to be instructed had findings of alienation been made against the mother at the conclusion of a fact-finding. Thus the absence of an application to adjourn further consideration was not a live issue during the hearing because the court had listed a conjoined hearing.  A proposal from the father was not available because of the way in which the evidence had emerged and the way the hearing was progressing. Since the conclusion of the hearing the father has identified resources which would potentially be able to carry out the sort of work that Dr Duprey had referred to. </p>

The Guardian had made enquiries of a child contact intervention which as I have referred to earlier had been ruled out. The local authority as Ms Phillips frankly acknowledged had not undertaken the sorts of enquiries of the resources available in their area will stop again as I have averted to earlier this seems to have been a consequence of the change in tack to seeking no order and no further local authority involvement together with changes in social work staff. Given the findings of fact made by His Honour Judge Thorp that R had suffered significant emotional harm in the care of his mother and was likely to continue to suffer significant emotional harm in the care of his mother taken together with Dr Duprey&#8217;s evidence that if the mother did not through therapy improve her capacity to meet R&#8217;s emotional needs that the ongoing harm R might suffer would outweigh the harm of separating him from his mother the local authorities position as articulated in the care plan could not it seems to me have been maintained. Because the findings emerged in a conjoined judgment of course it was not possible for the local authority to respond to the findings by an amended care plan or an alternative proposal whether to issue care proceedings or to seek a continuation of the supervision order with a fleshed-out proposal for the work that would need to be undertaken with the mother father and perhaps with R to address the risks. </p>

No doubt the judge was influenced by his understanding of the position of Dr Duprey but most particularly the Guardian that his decision on findings would not influence the welfare outcome.  However standing back it is impossible to reconcile the finding of fact the judge made which was that in terms the threshold criteria for public law intervention had been met with the conclusion that findings of fact would have made no difference. Taken together with the evidence of Dr Duprey that absent therapeutic intervention with the mother the risks of emotional harm to R of remaining with his mother might outweigh the risks of emotional harm of separating him from his mother I cannot reconcile the conclusion that the fact-finding outcome would have no impact on the welfare outcome.  </p>

Whether it is characterised as His Honour Judge Thorp having not given due weight to the possibilities of obtaining further information, or not giving due weight to the consequences of his findings of fact in particular how they sounded in terms of the local authority&#8217;s position or whether it is characterised as a disproportionate decision on the facts as they stood does not matter.  </p>

Had His Honour Judge Thorp continued the process of considering contact, notwithstanding his clear and plainly correct decision on residence, he would no doubt have wished to keep that particular issue undetermined. In particular having regard to Dr Duprey&#8217;s evidence about the potential change in the balance of harm were the mother not to engage in or benefit from therapeutic intervention to assist her in meeting R&#8217;s emotional needs I&#8217;m quite satisfied that this order should fall away in conjunction with the discharge of the no direct contact decision.  </p>

He deals with who he wants to live with initially but also considers his views on contact. He concluded that R has at times been positive as to contact and had enjoyed it when it took place. However he noted he had been highly resistant to it and the evidence established that his current feelings were clear and strongly held. His Honour Judge Thorp noted that the views of a 12-year-old child would in many cases be given a very high degree of recognition. He noted that by reason of R&#8217;s ASD his understanding is not the same as it would be for another child of his age. He also explicitly noted that his views have been affected by the hostility of his mother towards his father and by him being provided with information which is not true. Notwithstanding those caveats His Honour Judge Thorp accepted the evidence that demonstrated the high levels of distress caused by trying to encourage him to have contact with his father. </p>

It was clearly an exceptionally difficult case on its facts. The procedure which the court had in essence been forced to adopt to determine the fact-finding and welfare imposed a further difficulty on all concerned. With the benefit of hindsight and a different perspective it seems clear that the findings of fact that the judge made inevitably required further consideration to be given to the way ahead; particularly from the local authority and the father&#8217;s perspective.  The judgment itself is plainly carefully crafted and considered. However even the best of judges (who also happen to be fallible human beings) in comprehensive and careful judgments can occasionally get things wrong. </p>
