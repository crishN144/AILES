	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">However, the position that has now emerged since my judgment of last Friday, the 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2014, is, in my view, one of great gravity, and in order to put it into context I must, as briefly as possible, summarise the facts.  The case concerns a sibling group of seven children who are full siblings of each other.  They now fall into two sub-groups.  The five eldest range in age from 13 to nearly seven; the two youngest are aged about three-and-three-quarters and just two.  There was a long hearing before a High Court judge, Charles J, in May 2012.  The applicants in these proceedings and at that hearing were the local authority, the London Borough of Haringey.  For reasons which are very fully explained in the judgment of Charles J of May 2012, he decided that the five eldest children should be placed in the care of the London Borough of Haringey on care plans which contemplated that they would be fostered throughout the remainder of their childhoods, but not adopted.  The two youngest children were made the subject of placement orders which authorised the London Borough of Haringey to place them with a view to adoption.  At that time all the children, although living in a number of different settings, had contact with each other, although the seventh and youngest child was merely a baby.  The case therefore raised, in obvious and stark form, the question whether or not, and to what extent and by what means, there should be long-term contact between the various children both before and after the contemplated adoption of the two youngest. </span></p>

As I&#160;understand it, an expert who had given advice in the case very strongly recommended that there should be ongoing long-term direct contact [that is, face-to-face contact] between all seven children in the overall best interests of them all.  At paragraph 158 of his judgment Charles J said:</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I have explained in my first two judgments, this case proceeded in the court room until part way through the hearing last Friday morning on a clear understanding on my part, shared by the Queen's Counsel then appearing on behalf of the local authority, Miss Sarah Morgan QC, that arrangements for direct contact between all the children were still current.  As I described in my judgment of the 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2014, it came as a considerable surprise and shock to me and to many other people in the court room (and, I infer, also to Miss Morgan herself) when during the course of that hearing she was passed a note to the effect that there had actually been a "goodbye" or "farewell" occasion of contact between all seven children as long ago as Saturday the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013.  It is impossible to overstate the profundity and implications of that for the future course of this case and the future lives of all seven of these children.  Until that moment I personally had totally understood and assumed that the contact was continuing and that the issue for the court to decide in the present applications was whether, after thoroughly investigating and weighing all relevant factors, that contact should later be drawn to a close.  The reason why the local authority say that direct contact must end is an understandable reason.  They say that it is of the utmost importance for the two youngest children to preserve and protect the confidentiality of the family and whereabouts in which those children are to live.  There is an obvious problem when a sibling group of children meet that things may be said, or slip out, such that one or more of the elder children learn the identity of the adoptive family or their whereabouts; and that that information might very rapidly find its way to one or both of the parents of the children or generally into the public domain, and the adoptive placement might be imperilled. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">All of that is a familiar problem and risk in cases of this kind, and one which I readily understand.   But there is another side to it which requires very careful consideration also.   That is the very point that had been described, and indeed ruled upon, by Charles J after that long hearing in May 2012, namely the importance of, and "high priority" which needed to be given to, maintaining an inter-sibling relationship between all seven of these children.  It is my experience that social workers and others sometimes overlook in these tragic situations that relationships between siblings may be the most enduring of all relationships in many people's lives.  Put bluntly, these children are all likely to be alive long after most of us in the court room, and prospective adopters and others, are long since dead.  So there is always very considerable importance  in these tragic situations of fragmented families in very carefully considering whether or not, and if so, how, long-term inter-sibling contact can be maintained even after adoption.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At all events, the application by the local authority before the court is effectively to vary the subsisting order by Charles J as to long-term direct contact so as to enable it to be terminated.  However, as I said in paragraph 23 of my judgment of the 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2014, "It may not be possible now to unscramble the egg".  It is not for me at this short hearing to prejudge what the final decision will be as to direct contact at the three-day hearing that has been fixed to start on the 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2014.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It provisionally appears to me that the failure goes even further.  Since amendments were made to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in 2008, local authorities have been required to appoint an "independent reviewing officer" for the case of every child whom they are looking after.  By <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>B of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the first listed of the duties and functions of the independent reviewing officer are to "monitor the performance by the local authority of their functions in relation to the child's case".  The whole point and purpose of the system and machinery of independent reviewing officers is precisely to keep the local authority (who are no doubt extraordinarily busy and overworked) on their toes and to be asking awkward questions.   An independent reviewing officer clearly had been appointed in relation to all seven of these children, although I do not currently know the date when she was appointed.   In all or most of the minutes of meetings throughout 2013 that are exhibited to the statement of Miss Walker dated the 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2014 there are clear references to a named independent reviewing officer being present at a whole series of meetings.  Specifically, the independent reviewing officer was present at a meeting on the 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013 in the minutes of which the following passage appears:</span></p>

She and her five older siblings had regular contact but a decision was made to stop this contact and she has not seen her siblings since July.  It is not clear how this decision was made and it is a concern that contact should stop without adequate preparation.  [The social worker] will discuss restarting contact with the siblings with her manager and the IRO will also ask that it start again.  Ideally contact should take place again and then a farewell contact arranged for all the siblings at a time appropriate in terms of the adoption plan."</span></p>

It is true that the minutes then record that the IRO will ask that it start again, but they go on clearly to contemplate that contact would take place again "and then a farewell contact arranged &#8230;".   So the question inevitably arises, how was it that the independent reviewing officer, whose statutory duty was to monitor the performance by the local authority of their functions in relation to these children, was not saying loud and clear at the meeting, and subsequent to the meeting, that there could not lawfully be a farewell contact unless and until this matter had first been raised with the court?

First, he stresses that the local authority have taken very seriously the thrust of my order last Friday requiring them to produce a statement and all relevant minutes and records.  He says, and I readily accept, that considerable resources, time and effort have been thrown into addressing the concerns which I expressed last Friday.  Second, he says, however, that despite a "thorough trawl" through the minutes and records it remains the position that the local authority cannot identify when, where or by whom the fateful decision was taken, nor can they explain why it was not fully and properly minuted.  He has said that the lesson for the local authority is "the need for an audit trail" and at that point said that there had been "systemic corporate failure".  Third, he submitted that the main lesson to be learned is that local authority minutes need to include with every minute the current contact arrangements and the details of any relevant court order.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I cannot help feeling that this is, frankly, a very elementary point that one would have thought was part of the basic training of any social worker. Precisely because local authorities are under-resourced and over-stretched, and precisely because individual social workers and other staff members may come and go from a particular case (and I am very conscious that the present social worker was only first involved in this case last October), it is of the utmost and blindingly obvious importance that reliable, detailed records need to be maintained of every important decision, when it was taken, by whom it was taken, and why it was taken.  I would have thought also that it was blindingly obvious that if there is a court order having ongoing impact on a case (as an order for contact does) then that should be very prominently attached to every file and, frankly, every important minute or record in a case such as this.  On behalf of the local authority, Mr Howling has repeated the apology that is expressed in the statement of Miss Walker at paragraph 21 that I have read.  He says that an apology is due on two levels.  One is to the court, and the other is to the children concerned.  I am, frankly, least bothered in this case about an apology as such to the court.  But as these children grow up, and when they are adult, each of them will need a clear narrative and explanation as to events that took place in their lives and, so far as the present matter is concerned, how it came about that the five eldest lost all direct contact with the two youngest.  In my view, some very clear and abject documents need to be prepared by this local authority, addressed to each of these children, explaining to them these events and how it all came about, and apologising to them.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Apologies are also due to the parents of these children.  It is perfectly true that both parents are currently serving prison sentences for, as I&#160;understand it, offences against some of these children.  It is perfectly true that under the order of, I think, Charles J, neither parent is currently entitled to any direct contact with any of their children.   But they remain the parents of the children and they share parental responsibility for these children with the local authority.  They continue to be concerned about the welfare and wellbeing of their children.  The mother, in particular, has made recent statements in which she repeatedly implores that direct contact be maintained between all seven of her children.  It is unclear whether she knows even now that that contact had already been broken.  I do not know her reaction to it, for her solicitors and counsel have not yet been able to obtain instructions from her because of the difficulty of access to her in prison.  But she and the father knew and know that in May 2012 a High Court judge, for the reasons he gave, made the order that he did with regard to direct contact.  They were entitled to assume that the London Borough of Haringey would obey the order of the court.  They, too, would be justified in feeling surprise and shock, and probably much more extreme emotions, on learning that, in defiance of that order, that contact has now completely ended.  So, in my view, the London Borough of Haringey owe and must convey abject apologies also to the parents of these children.</span></p>
