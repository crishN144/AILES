When the total costs of both sides are looked at including the appeal, the figures are truly horrendous, and the situation is made even more worrying by the fact that all the parties are funded out of public funds.</p>

Later that month, SW and TW underwent full medical examinations in the investigation of sexual abuse.  The mother had pressed for these examinations; the Local Authority and the police had ultimately supported them taking place, and a social worker was in attendance with the mother. It is now accepted by the local authority that these examinations were not necessary, they were disproportionately intrusive; the authority accepts that it failed to protect the children from this invasion of the children&#8217;s privacy. In December 2014 at a child protection conference, recommendations were made that there should be "formal investigations into the allegations&#8221; which had been made by the mother; these investigations were to be carried out by the police and children&#8217;s services. At no stage did the decision-making at this conference, or generally, include the father.  At no time was he consulted about the investigation into the complaints, and was given no opportunity to contribute to the investigation or the decisions.</p>

That said, in April 2015, TW underwent a further medical examination at the insistence of the mother, this time under general anaesthetic. The Local Authority now accepts that it should have taken steps to prevent the mother from presenting TW for further medical examination, particularly as the November 2014 examination had revealed no diagnostic signs of abuse.  It is now acknowledged that the children&#8217;s mother was, by her actions, causing the children significant harm.

The children moved initially to live with MT, their maternal grandmother, where they remained for a few months.  No one in the Local Authority&#8217;s social work department took steps to notify the father of this important event in the children&#8217;s lives, though inevitably &#8211; albeit after a delay &#8211; he discovered from another third party.  In August 2015, MT issued proceedings under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> for a child arrangements order; the father made a cross-application.  Within those private law proceedings, a <span style="font-style:italic">section 37</span> report was ordered.  Social work and other expert opinion garnered in the case was to the effect that the children were being exposed to further harm in the care of the maternal grandmother who was expressing implacably hostile views about the father and was opposed to the father playing a role in the children&#8217;s lives, a stance which she was unable or unwilling to shield from the children.  In late-September 2015, the Local Authority finally issued public law proceedings; these proceedings have been concluded at this hearing.  In early 2016, the children were placed with a paternal uncle, before ultimately moving to live with the father himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the issue of damages, in September 2016, the father&#8217;s then-instructed counsel filed a lengthy skeleton argument setting out the father&#8217;s aspiration to recover from the Local Authority damages in the region of &#163;100,000-&#163;140,000, or more.  These figures were advanced on the basis of admitted (and further) breaches of <span style="font-style:italic">Article 6</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">8 ECHR</span>, and of an alleged breach, subsequently added but no longer pursued, of the father&#8217;s rights under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 3 </span>ibid. (i.e. prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment).  It is unfortunate that at the stage at which the father&#8217;s ambitious objective was made known to the parties and the court, there was no meaningful opportunity for some careful judicial investigation of the merits of such an exceptional claim, and/or for some steps to be taken to moderate or even judicially mediate the claim, in fulfilment of the &#8216;overriding objective&#8217; (note in particular <span style="font-style:italic">rule 1.1(2)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">1.4(2) CPR 1998</span>).  Some of that award was intended to reflect an element of recovery of costs disguised as damages; as I indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">CZ v Kirklees</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>that is an unprincipled approach (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/11" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 11</ref> at [58(iv)]).

An unwarranted cost to the public purse of an expensive trial has, in the main, mercifully but narrowly been avoided.</p>

Both parties submitted detailed argument on costs at this hearing, ranging across the full gamut of issues &#8211; of principle, quantum, the <span style="font-style:italic">Part 36</span> process (including the fact that the <span style="font-style:italic">Part 36</span> offer was in respect of only part of the claim), litigation conduct generally (both sides), the complication of apportionment where the lawyers have been paid on an &#8216;events&#8217; basis (i.e. by which fixed fees are paid on the happening of certain &#8216;events&#8217; in the litigation), non-compliance with orders for the delivery of costs schedules, and the period for which costs would potentially be recoverable. Overshadowing those arguments was the identifiable likelihood that the Legal Aid Agency will successfully recoup from the award of damages the sums which it has expended on the father&#8217;s public funding certificate for the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> and/or the <span style="font-style:italic">HRA 1989</span> proceedings.    On the second day of the hearing, the Local Authority proposed a pragmatic solution, which was that the Local Authority would contribute the sum of &#163;1,000 towards the father&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref></span> costs; Mr. Bagchi QC did not argue vigorously against that proposal.  Given that the father is unlikely to benefit either from the damages or the costs, I am persuaded that a very considerable amount of costs would be saved by not spending more court time with the parties debating the issue and I am content to adopt the pragmatic course proposed.  I formally assess the costs award in the sum of &#163;1,000.</p>
