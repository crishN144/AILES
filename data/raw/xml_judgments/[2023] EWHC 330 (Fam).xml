Likewise, PP&#8217;s mother (&#8220;AP&#8221;) provided her consent however, the Trust formed the view that lawful parental consent could not be guaranteed at all critical points in time. It was not realistic to rely on the father&#8217;s consent alone. Equally, AP&#8217;s consent could not be relied upon as there was a real risk that she would either withdraw her consent or be unable to remain at the hospital to provide her consent as necessary. The Trust referred to AP finding it difficult to support PP to attend all her medical appointments, to their volatile relationship and that AP was reported by staff as &#8220;exceptionally agitated&#8221; on a recent occasion.</p>

I also authorised a deprivation of liberty to facilitate and administer the treatment provided that any such deprivations of her liberty were the least restrictive necessary and that appropriate steps were taken to minimise any distress to her.</p>

The reach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 97</ref> was extended to all courts on 27 September 1999.

In the usual way, the assessment weighs the consequence of the happening of harm against the degree of risk. If the consequence of identification of the child were judged to be especially grave it would not take proof of much additional risk to justify anonymising the professionals.

Everyone knows that the core constitutional responsibility of the judiciary is to uphold and implement the rule of law. This requires the judiciary to try disputes in court fairly, justly and impartially, whether they are private law cases between individuals, or public law cases between individuals and the state. It is one of the main pillars supporting a functioning democracy. That pillar will collapse if the people cannot observe cases being tried, or cannot understand from the judgments how they have been tried.

I have explained before that the fact that financial remedy proceedings are heard &#8220;in private&#8221; merely prescribes a mode of hearing, which certain members of the public are allowed in to watch, but not others. It has nothing to do with secrecy as to the facts of the case, and provides absolutely no support to the creed that FRC litigants have an &#8220;entitlement&#8221; to privacy (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gallagher v Gallagher (No.1) (Reporting Restrictions)</span> at [31] &#8211; [32]).</p>

After all, such a silver-tongued advocate would plead: &#8220;we have always done it this way&#8221;. But it is for the very reason that such blatant wrongness can be so artfully justified that the principle of open justice should be affirmed most trenchantly in financial remedy proceedings and anonymisation only allowed in unusual or exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances are where the weighing exercise shows such an imbalance that it can be safely be said that there is a &#8220;compelling justification&#8221;, and that it is &#8220;strictly necessary&#8221;, for there to be a departure from the normal rule of full reporting.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Lord Blanesburgh explains, it is precisely because the method looks so harmless and unremarkable that it is so dangerous. The method&#8217;s longevity merely demonstrates a collective &#8220;see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&#8221; by the judiciary and practitioners over decades. But now the candle has been grasped and the lawfulness of the practice has been called into question. If standard anonymisation in FRC cases is to be formally ordained I predict it will act as a pathfinder for routine anonymisation in other fields and it will only be a matter of time before most cases are thus processed. A formal standardisation of anonymity in the FRC would, without doubt, be eyed with much interest by many who would leap to have comparable secrecy in other fields. As I have sought to explain, anonymisation renders most judgments unreadable, bland and sterile. It is my prediction that were anonymisation to become standard fare a vital pillar of the constitution will be seriously, if not terminally, damaged. It is for this reason that I do not think that Lords Moulton, Shaw and Blanesburgh were guilty of exaggerated alarmist rhetoric.</p>
