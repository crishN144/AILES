"Relevant information" is said in paragraph 4.19 to include "what the likely consequences of a decision would be (the possible effects of deciding one way or another) &#8211; and also the likely consequences of making no decision at all". Paragraph 4.46 of the Code of Practice adds that "it is important to assess people when they are in the best state to make the decision, if possible". </p>

Thus the test for lacking capacity involves two stages. The first stage, often called the "diagnostic test", is whether the person has such an impairment or disturbance. The second stage, often known as the "functional test", is whether the impairment or disturbance renders the person unable to make the decision. S. 3(1) provides that, for the purposes of s. 2, a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable (a) to understand the information relevant to the decision; (b) to retain that information; (c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or (d) to communicate his decision whether by talking, using sign language or any other means. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.24in">Importantly, capacity is both issue-specific and time specific. A person may have capacity in respect of certain matters but not in relation to other matters. Equally, a person may have capacity at one time and not at another. The question is whether, at the date on which the court is considering capacity, the person lacks the capacity in issue. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.24in">Furthermore, in assessing the question of capacity, the court must consider all the relevant evidence. Clearly, the opinion of an independently-instructed expert will be likely to be of very considerable importance, but in addition the court in these cases will invariably have evidence from other professionals who have experience of treating and working with P, the subject of the proceedings, and sometimes from friends and family and indeed from P himself.. As Charles J observed (in the analogous context of care proceedings) in A County Council v KD and L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> at paras 39 and 44, "it is important to remember (i) that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and (ii) it is the court that is in the position to weigh the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence&#8230; the judge must always remember that he or she is the person who makes the final decision". Thus, when assessing the ability of a person to (a) understand the information relevant to the decision (b) retain that information, and (c) use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, the court must consider all the evidence, not merely the views of the independent expert. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.24in">Finally, I reiterate the further point, to which I have alluded in earlier decisions, including PH v A Local Authority, Z Ltd and R <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/1704" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 1704 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1704 (Fam)</ref> and CC v KK <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2012/2136" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCOP 2136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 2136 (COP)</ref>. In a case involving a vulnerable adult, there is a risk that all professionals involved with treating and helping that person &#8211; including, of course, a judge in the Court of Protection &#8211; may feel drawn towards an outcome that is more protective of the adult and thus, in certain circumstances, fail to carry out an assessment of capacity that is detached and objective.&#8221; </p>

The Official Solicitor has considered, as a matter of public policy and statutory construction, whether the applicant, and this court, have any proper role to conduct a capacity assessment of [AA]&#8217;s decision making in respect of AEA. There is an argument that unlike sexual relations which involves another partner, the state&#8217;s role should be limited and circumscribed. But, on balance, the risk of death/hypoxia of AEA leads to the conclusion that unlike most other selfstimulatory practices, a capacity assessment is not inconsistent with public policy and the language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.&#8221; </p>

Nevertheless on the current understanding of the impact of AA&#8217;s diagnosis of ASD and on the basis of his assessment of AA, Dr Ince is of the view that AA&#8217;s engagement is a manifestation of his ASD. Moreover Dr Ince is of the opinion that because of his ASD, AA is more likely to be preoccupied with and obsessively engage in AEA than would otherwise be the case. Furthermore Dr Ince is satisfied that AA&#8217;s ASD renders him incapable of weighing relevant information about AEA and cross-transferring information from one specific situation to another.  </p>

I have concluded it is not. I accept it would set the bar too high in comparison to capacitous adults who engage in the practice of AEA. </p>
