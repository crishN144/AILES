I indicated at that time, and in the Order which followed the judgment, that if any party sought to argue the question of costs, they could informally apply to me in writing (within a defined timetable), and that I would resolve the issue in writing.   </p>

Indeed, this case is a paradigm example.  On the information available at the time of this application, it was in my judgment reasonable for the Applicant to conclude that if they notified the Second and Third Respondent of the intention to apply for an order this could have exposed PR to undue or inappropriate pressure from them (see [9](i)-(iv)).   PR had disclosed aspects of her home life with her parents which gave the professional safeguarding and care agencies considerable concern about her future well-being should she return there.  PR was concerned not to disclose certain information to her parents (see [9](iii)). </p>

So, as I further accepted when reviewing the substantive case, it was not at all surprising &#8220;that HHJ Hallam felt herself compelled to exercise the inherent jurisdiction to protect PR when the application was first presented to her&#8221; (see [9] above). </p>

In fact, the injunction was maintained at PR&#8217;s request.  It further responded to the changing attitude of PR to the protective regime which the court had created around her on the Local Authority&#8217;s application.  In those circumstances, the Local Authority successfully sought to conclude the proceedings as soon as practicable, when it was apparent that they became &#8220;counter-productive&#8221; to its objectives.  That said, PR remains living away from home. </p>

Given the limited scope of the disclosure of documentation to the Second and Third Respondents, the potential for meaningful negotiation as to outcome was limited.  As it happens, the hearing on 2 July was required to determine, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, whether the court should have made the orders which it did (see [4] of the earlier, substantive, judgment).  I am not unsympathetic to the fact that the Second and Third Respondents have been put to expense in responding to this application, but see no justification for foisting that bill upon the Applicant. </p>
