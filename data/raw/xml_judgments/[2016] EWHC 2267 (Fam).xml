	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a little boy E (that is not his true initial) who was born in Scotland in August 2014. His mother has many difficulties and has never been able to look after him. Initially E was placed with foster carers in Scotland. In December 2015 E was placed by the relevant Scottish authorities with a maternal aunt who lives in North East England. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 April 2016 E was brought to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in what has been described as a near death condition. He was very seriously ill. A CT scan revealed a right subdural haematoma. His condition rapidly deteriorated and became life threatening. A further CT scan showed some extension of the subdural haematoma. An intracranial pressure measuring bolt was put through his skull and revealed high intracranial pressure. His condition was critical. Urgent neurosurgery was necessary to relieve the pressure. A consultant neurosurgeon, Mr Patrick Mitchell, performed a craniectomy, removing from the right side of E&#8217;s head a piece of his skull approximately 10x12 cms. This allowed the brain to swell without raising the pressure. In his subsequent report (see below), Mr Mitchell explained that the craniectomy was deliberately fashioned behind the hairline to minimise the cosmetic impact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Later the same day, 14 April 2016, and after he came out of theatre, E was examined by Dr Alison Steele, a Consultant Paediatrician and Designated Doctor for Safeguarding and Looked after Children for Newcastle. In a report dated 19 April 2016 Dr Steele listed no fewer than 75 marks, bruises and lesions on E&#8217;s body. The local authority issued care proceedings in the Family Court on 15 April 2016; an interim care order was made the same day. E was discharged from hospital into specialist foster care on 6 May 2016. He has continued to make physical and emotional progress in the care of his foster carers and is thriving. Although these are early days, it seems likely that he will suffer no long-term neurological deficit. All in all, E has made a remarkable recovery. Photographs of him taken on 18 May 2016 show an alert, focused and active child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The care proceedings continue in the Family Court. The final hearing is fixed for 26 September 2016. I understand that there is no realistic prospect of his mother resuming the care of E. His maternal aunt apart, no family carer has been put forward. Long-term fostering for a child of E&#8217;s age is simply not appropriate. In all probability the judge hearing the care case will, if threshold is established (which on at least some basis seems likely), be faced with a stark choice: rehabilitation of E to his maternal aunt or adoption outside the family.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not concerned with the care proceedings and, beyond what I have already said, know little about them. Nothing I say can be allowed to have or will have any impact on the outcome of the care proceedings, which have to be determined by the judge exclusively on the basis of the evidence adduced at the final hearing of those proceedings. Nonetheless, for reasons which will become apparent in due course, I cannot avoid hazarding some view as to the likely outcome of the care proceedings. In the light of all I have read and heard I am satisfied that, for present purposes, I can properly and therefore ought to proceed on the footing (a) that the local authority will in all probability establish &#8216;threshold&#8217; (though to what extent and in what terms is more difficult to predict, and I do not venture a prediction) and (b) that there is a distinct possibility that the proceedings will end up with the court approving a plan for adoption and making a placement order in relation to E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 April 2016, the local authority issued an application seeking to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to various questions to do with E&#8217;s medical treatment. I need not go through the subsequent proceedings in any detail. With the approval, appropriately given, of Cobb J, the Family Division Liaison Judge, the matter has been dealt with by Her Honour Judge Hudson, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge. For present purposes all that I need note is (a) that on 15 April 2016 Judge Hudson gave the local authority permission in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and (b) that the one matter with which I am concerned (see below) comes before me pursuant to an order made by Judge Hudson on 28 June 2016.</p>

I had a report from Mr Mitchell, in the form of a letter dated 1 June 2016 answering questions which had been put to him. In addition to her report dated 19 April 2016 to which I have already referred, I had further reports from Dr Steele dated 6 May 2016, 22 June 2016 (a short letter) and 6 July 2016. The local authority&#8217; evidence was in the form of a statement from E&#8217;s social worker dated 4 July 2016. The report of E&#8217;s guardian, Ms Maggie Singer, is dated 5 July 2016. In addition, I had position statements or skeleton arguments from Mrs Fiona Walker, who appeared on behalf of the local authority, from Mr Barry Speker, who appeared on behalf of The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust), and from Ms Elspeth Thomson, who appeared on behalf of E. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">When we did the craniectomy the tissue layer that forms the bone was dissected off the bone flap and left in place. In time this layer generates new bone. I would expect him to have substantially complete bone coverage of the defect between 5 and 10 years after the operation to remove the bone. There are no particular functional implications of allowing this to happen unless he were to develop symptoms associated with alternate bulging out and sinking in of the scalp before bone formation occurred. This can be associated with a syndrome known as the syndrome of the trephined. In this syndrome postural changes, such as from lying to sitting to standing can provoke brain shifts that lead to headache, sickness or transient functional changes like vertigo or drowsiness. In reality though this syndrome is rare, particularly in children who are not tall enough to have large postural hydrostatic pressure shifts. There is a theory advanced by some rehabilitationists that a global functional improvement is seen following a cranioplasty but this has yet to be demonstrated with hard evidence.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The plate is not likely to make much difference to the child&#8217;s own perception. The cosmetic defect will largely be covered by hair, which can be kept long, and by the time the child starts become self-conscious it is likely the natural bone formation will be well underway. The larger effect is likely to be on social interaction and the psychology of adult carers. If the condition is explained to other children, they are likely to react with cruelty and revulsion rather than understanding and adults are likely to react with overprotectiveness. These factors clearly can have an effect on the child&#8217;s development and are the usual reason for doing cranioplasties is in this age range.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">In the previous discussion you mentioned the fact that the deficit was behind the hairline helped with cosmetic issues and that the fact that a dural matrix was placed over the incisions in the dura at the initial operation reduced the infection risk.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The craniectomy was deliberately fashioned behind the hairline and above the temporalis muscle to minimise its impact on cosmetics and jaw muscle function. The dura was opened at the time of surgery to allow more room for brain swelling. The openings in the dura were covered with a synthetic dural material. The reason for this is not to reduce the infection risk but to make dissection of the plane in which to insert the cranioplasty easier and thus reduce the risk of brain injury during a subsequent cranioplasty operation. These measures are intended to minimise the impact of a cranioplasty if he were to have one, and to minimise the cosmetic impact of the craniectomy while waiting for a cranioplasty, or alternatively, if it is decided that he should not have one.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The decision on whether to have a cranioplasty is not one that I make personally. My role in this is to advise parents and carers of the issues and risks involved, and to perform the operation if they decide to have it done. Craniectomy in this age range is relatively rare. Traditionally, the approach was to perform a cranioplasty by replacing the child&#8217;s own bone flap but since the aftermath of the Alder Hey scandal, we have not been able to retain human body parts for this purpose. Artificial bone cranioplasties are available and we believe that they do remodel a child&#8217;s head grows but unfortunately the material from which they made is relatively fragile and is not strong enough to be used until the skull is of a substantial thickness, usually around the age of seven. These are therefore not available for someone of [E]&#8217;s age. This leaves titanium as the only option, and that has the problem of not growing with the child. </p>

However, it is his opinion that the risk of injury arising because of the craniectomy remains extremely low if he is in a normal functioning family environment.  It is Mr Mitchell&#8217;s opinion that the principle advantages of such a procedure are cosmetic and psychological.

[He] rapidly tried to replace his helmet and is clearly now used to wearing this through the day. [He] apparently sleeps very well at night when his head protection is removed.

Conversely it <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be (one cannot put it higher than this), that future adopters, if that is in fact where we end up, could, as Ms Thomson puts it, &#8220;be dismayed that a significant yet not urgent decision had been made about &#8220;their child&#8221; without taking into account their views.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These factors, in my judgment, point to a very clear conclusion. It is, in substance, that for which both Mrs Walker and Ms Thomson contend. The decision is not one I need to take or should take. I agree with Ms Thomson when she submits that, on the basis of all the medical evidence, there is no clear cut answer as to the right option at this stage, that it is a personal decision for carers, and that, as the decision can be left, it should be left to whoever is entrusted with E&#8217;s long term care. As Mrs Walker puts it, and again I agree, the decision is such a significant one that it ought to be taken by whoever claims E and will be his parent. There is, as she says, no need for the court to decide at this stage and I ought therefore, she submits, to leave it to whoever will be E&#8217;s full time carer(s).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judges do not necessarily know best. Usually a child&#8217;s long-term carers, whether parents, adoptive parents or long-term foster carers are much better placed than a judge to decide what should happen to their child. In the realm of private law &#8211; and this issue, despite the public law context in which it happens to arise, is in truth one in the private law realm &#8211; the court, the State, usually becomes involved only because the child&#8217;s parents or carers have been unable to resolve the difficulty themselves, either because they cannot agree or, as sometimes happens in medical treatment cases, because they prefer to leave a particularly agonising decision to a judge: see, on the latter point, <span style="font-style:italic">In re Jake (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2442" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2442 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2442 (Fam)</ref>, para 46. There being no particular urgency in this case it would, in my judgment, be inappropriate &#8211; indeed wrong as a matter of principle &#8211; for me to be arrogating to myself a decision which ought to be left to E&#8217;s long term carers. I therefore decline to make any order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one final matter I should mention. I confess to having been somewhat surprised &#8211; in fact I expressed the point somewhat more forcefully in court &#8211; when I read Mr Mitchell&#8217;s reference to what had happened in the aftermath of the Alder Hey scandal. Mr Speker, with his great experience of such matters, and having enlisted the willing assistance of Mr Mitchell and his colleagues at the Trust, who in turn consulted clinical colleagues in other centres, was able to provide a detailed response shortly after the hearing had concluded. Mr Speker also referred me to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Tissue Act 2004</ref>, to various regulations including The Human Tissue Act (Ethical Approval, Exceptions from Licensing and Supply of Information about Transplants) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 and The Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations 2007, to <span style="font-style:italic">Failure of autologous bone-assisted cranioplasty following decompressive craniectomy in children and adolescents</span> by Grant et al, J Neurosurg (Pediatrics 2) 100:163&#8211;168, 2004, and to chapter 58, Cranioplasty, by James Tait Goodrich, in a leading neurosurgical textbook, <span style="font-style:italic">Principles and Practice of Paediatric Neurosurgery</span> by Albright et al, 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> edition, 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This material, and Mr Speker&#8217;s response, were of absorbing interest. Grateful though I am to Mr Speker and the others, I must resist the temptation to explore the matter in any detail. It suffices to summarise what Mr Speker told me: there is, he says, nothing in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2004 Act</ref> which expressly precludes reusing a piece of skull removed from a patient, though the manner in which such piece of bone is stored and retained must be consistent with the detailed provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and related regulations; there is no national system or protocol on the point; and there is no consistent message from the literature. He indicated that the Trust will further explore the issue, taking into account clinical assessment and patient need.</p>
