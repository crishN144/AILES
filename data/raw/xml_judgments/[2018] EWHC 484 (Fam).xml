That order registered pursuant to the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (BIIR) an order of the Nanterre District Court in France, by which the parties were divorced, dated 18 February 2015. The respondent to the appeal is Dominique Mensah (the husband), who lives in France.</span></p>

The wife did not have legal representation during the hearing, but it was clear through her command of the documents and the way she made her written and oral submissions she understood the issues in the case and was able to get across what she wanted to say. Ms Perrins represented the husband and provided a helpful chronology and skeleton argument, as well as admirably clear oral submissions.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The position is complicated by the fact that the wife obtained an English decree of divorce after the divorce in France. The English Decree Nisi was granted on 14 January 2016 and Decree Absolute 7 April 2016. The husband says he was not served with any of the papers in the English divorce proceedings. On 7 December 2017 the papers were disclosed to him from the English divorce file. The wife says he knew about the English divorce proceedings. The husband&#8217;s position is it is clear from considering the documents the wife did not make full disclosure to the English court about the divorce proceedings that had taken place in France. He has made an application to set aside both the English Decree Nisi and Decree Absolute on the basis they are a nullity, as there was no subsisting marriage to dissolve at the time those decrees were made.</span></p>
