	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application to commit Mr Ireland for contempt of court made by Mr McCarren can fairly be described as one amongst a blizzard of applications made by Mr McCarren arising out of concluded litigation under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> concerning his son, S.  Those proceedings were finalised on the basis of a child arrangements order made by DJ(MC) Carr on 1 July 2021.  Since that date, Mr McCarren has engaged in litigation in two Divisions of the High Court and has launched complaints to multiple regulatory agencies with a view to demonstrating that the decision in the family proceedings was erroneous.   The bundle for the application currently before the court contains a table that purports to summarise the individual sets of legal proceedings in which Mr McCarren has been, or is currently, engaged.  Mr McCarren does not accept the accuracy of that table but on his own evidence the scope of his former and current litigation is expansive.  At the heart of each of the sets of proceedings commenced by Mr McCarren, and each of the complaints he has made to regulatory agencies, is his contention that he has suffered a grave injustice at the hands of the Family Court.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, the procedural background to the matter might best be described as labyrinthine, ranging as it does over protracted private law proceedings and the multiple incidences of ancillary litigation launched by Mr McCarren during, and in the context of the outcome of, those family proceedings.  It is, in places, difficult to follow the course of the proceedings in circumstances where Mr McCarren is in the habit of issuing serial interlocutory applications in addition to commencing new substantive proceedings (a Case Summary from the family proceedings dated 16 June 2021 contained in the bundle lists no less than <span style="font-style:italic">twenty-eight </span>separate interlocutory applications within the private law proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>).  The effect of this is to confuse and obfuscate the procedural position.  The following account, however, represents the history of the family proceedings relevant to the current application by Mr Ireland to strike out Mr McCarren&#8217;s application to commit him for contempt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have noted, Mr McCarren has a son, S, with his ex-wife.  Mr McCarren first made an application for a child arrangements order in respect of S in 2017.  A final order was made in those proceedings by consent, subject to the determination by the court of certain narrow issues between the parties.  In 2018 Mr McCarren made a further application for a child arrangements order in respect of S and a further child arrangements order was made, again largely by consent.  Mr Ireland acted as solicitor for Mrs McCarren in that second set of family proceedings.   In 2019 Mr McCarren launched a third application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, seeking overnight contact with S.  Mrs McCarren cross-applied to vary the existing child arrangements order and for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> requiring Mr McCarren to obtain the permission of the court before making any further applications in respect of S.

By an order dated 28 August 2020, and upon the application of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, DJ(MC) Carr gave permission for the joint instruction of Dr Kate Hellin to prepare a psychological assessment of the parents.  That order was made by consent, with both parents agreeing to the instruction of Dr Hellin.  Dr Hellin prepared and filed her expert report with the court on 18 December 2020.  In short, Dr Hellin concluded that Mr McCarren demonstrated a narcistic personality, with limited insight or empathy and an obsessive, ruminative and rigid cognitive style with elements of paranoia.</p>

Those applications included an application by Mr McCarren on 20 December 2020, two days after the filing of Dr Hellin&#8217;s report, to exclude the evidence of Dr Hellin and to remove the Children&#8217;s Guardian from the proceedings, both of which applications were refused by the court on 28 January 2021.</p>

DJ(MC) Carr treated that letter as an application for permission to withdraw under FPR 2010 r.29.4 and invited written representations from the parties.  An order dated 4 May 2021 further records that, notwithstanding his letter of 23 March 2021 indicating his withdrawal form the proceedings, Mr McCarren had also issued a C2 application dated 22 April 2021 for permission to instruct an expert psychologist and an independent social worker and for directions for further disclosure and the filing of further evidence.  In the circumstances, DJ(MC) Carr refused permission to Mr McCarren to withdraw proceedings. On 14 May 2021 each of the applications made by Mr McCarren on 22 April 2022 was dismissed.</p>

Whilst Mr McCarren attended the commencement of that hearing, the order of DJ(MC) Carr records that Mr McCarren left the hearing during the course of the court giving its reasons for refusing an application by the Mr McCarren to adjourn the final hearing and refusing again each of the applications that had first been made by Mr McCarren on 22 April 2021 and dismissed by the court on 14 May 2021.  The order records that Mr McCarren did not return to the final hearing and did not give evidence at that hearing.  In addition to making a final child arrangements order, DJ(MC) Carr made a non-molestation order against Mr McCarren in favour of Mrs McCarren and a costs order in favour of Mrs McCarren in the sum of &#163;10,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McCarren appealed the final orders made by DJ(MC) Carr on 1 July 2021 on the basis that Dr Hellin&#8217;s report was biased (he alleging that Dr Hellin and Mrs McCarren had both worked for the same NHS Trust for an overlapping period) and that the report of Dr Hellin was of insufficient quality. On 27 January 2022 Mr McCarren&#8217;s application for permission to appeal was dismissed by Deputy Circuit Judge Jordan as being totally without merit.  In the circumstances, the order of DJ(MC) Carr of 1 July 2021 remains operative, including the order made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Within this context, on 28 June 2022 this court has recently refused an application by Mr McCarren for permission to commence further proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in respect of S.</p>

As I have noted, both prior to and following the judgment of DJ(MC) Carr, Mr McCarren launched multiple sets of litigation aimed at those he considers to be responsible for what he considered, and considers, to be a miscarriage of justice in the family proceedings.  Primarily, Mrs McCarren, Mr Ireland and Dr Hellin. At times, the litigation pursued by Mr McCarren has also touched others involved in the proceedings.  The litigation ancillary to the family proceedings pursued by Mr McCarren has ranged across actions in defamation against the mother, the maternal family and the mother&#8217;s General Practitioner, applications for non-molestation orders against the mother, civil actions in the Kings&#8217; Bench Division for &#8220;fraud and deception&#8221; against the mother, Mr Ireland and Dr Hellin (albeit it is not entirely clear whether those actions were ever in fact issued), an application for committal for contempt against Dr Hellin, and proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/40" uk:canonical="1997 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Protection from Harassment Act 1997</ref> against Mr Ireland.   Most recently, Mr McCarren has issued a C2 application form naming Mr Ireland as the respondent and which seeks to &#8220;deem the evidence of an unregulated court expert as inadmissible&#8221; in the now concluded family proceedings.  Mr McCarren has also made complaints to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the Information Commissioner, the Charities Commission, the British Psychological Society and to Members of Parliament.</p>

I will come back to the role that the costs order made during the claim under the Protection of Harassment Act 1997 has played in the current application before the court shortly   It would appear from a recent statement dated 5 May 2022, that Mr McCarren intends now to make a further application claim for harassment in the Kings&#8217; Bench Division against Mr Ireland, he stating that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28 October 2021, Mr McCarren applied to commit Dr Hellin for contempt of court, before replacing that application with a revised application against Dr Hellin on 15 February 2022 following the loss of his appeal on 27 January 2022.  That latter application was dismissed by Deputy Circuit Judge Jordan on 24 February 2022 as totally without merit.  Mr McCarren appealed that decision to the High Court, which appeal was dismissed by Mrs Justice Arbuthnot on 7 April 2022, again as being totally without merit.</p>

The allegedly &#8220;unregulated expert&#8221; referred to in that application is Dr Hellin. The application purports to be made under FPR 2010 r. 18(1)(c) and issued one day after this court refused Mr McCarren permission to issue a further application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on 28 June 2022.  The application is issued under one of the case numbers associated with the family proceedings.  It names Mr Ireland as the respondent to the application, even thought Mr Ireland is not, and never has been, a party to those proceedings (as expressly conceded by Mr McCarren in his application to commit Mr Ireland for contempt).</p>

Within this context, Mr Ireland issued a statutory demand for that sum.  In March 2022, Mr McCarren applied to set aside the statutory demand.

Within that context, the Court of Appeal made clear that the bringing of a committal application is an appropriate and legitimate means of drawing the courts attention to a serious (as opposed to purely technical) contempt.  However, the Court of Appeal made equally clear that a committal application must be proportionate and may not be pursued for an improper or collateral purpose.  Within this context, Carr LJ observed that, whilst holding that a personal desire for revenge is not a good reason for striking out a contempt application as an abuse of process:</p>

There was here no finding by the Judge that the Appellants were using the Contempt Application to secure any such advantage. Specifically, the revenge that he identified on the part of Mr Chernukhin was for Mr Deripaska's past failure to drop the criminal proceedings against him (see [109] and [157] of the Judgment). I do not consider that <span style="font-style:italic">Integral </span>is an example of subjective motive being relevant to the question of abuse.

I accept the submission for Mr Deripaska that it was not for the Judge to determine the question of breach outright for the purpose of the Abuse Application. Nor should this court attempt to do so for the purpose of this appeal. However, the merits were undoubtedly a factor relevant to the question of abuse and an assessment of whether or not the Contempt Application was properly arguable was required. Whether or not the Contempt Application was (at least) properly arguable should have informed the correct outcome on the Abuse Application&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Proceedings for civil contempt are sometimes described as "quasi-criminal" because of the penal consequences that can attend the breach of an order (or undertaking to the court). They are criminal proceedings for the purpose of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("Article 6"). The charges raised have to be clear; the criminal standard of proof applies; and the respondent has a right to silence. There must be a high standard of procedural fairness.&#8221;</p>

In the course of any proceedings one or more applications may be issued.  If an earlier claim issued by the person against whom the order is made was, itself, totally without merit and if individual applications made within that claim were also totally without merit, there is no reason why both the claim and individual applications should not be counted for the purpose of considering whether to make an ECRO in the course of a subsequent claim.</p>

That will require an evaluation of the party's overall conduct. It may be easier to conclude that a party is persistently issuing claims or applications which are totally without merit if it seeks repeatedly to re-litigate issues which have been decided than if there are three or more unrelated applications many years apart. The latter situation would not necessarily constitute persistence.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">[31] Third, only claims or applications where the party in question is the claimant (or counterclaimant) or applicant can be counted (although this includes a totally without merit application by the defendant in the proceedings). A defendant or respondent may behave badly, for example by telling lies in his or her evidence, producing fraudulent documents or putting forward defences in bad faith. However, that does not constitute issuing claims or making applications for the purpose of considering whether to make an ECRO. Nevertheless, such conduct is not irrelevant as it is likely to cast light on the party's overall conduct and to demonstrate, provided that the necessary persistence can be demonstrated by reference to other claims or applications, that an ECRO or even a general civil restraint order, is necessary.</p>

A CRO does not extinguish a litigant's right to access the courts; it merely regulates the process by which access is obtained, and it does so only in a way that is deemed a proportionate response to the identified abuse, whether existing or threatened. This variation in the procedure required for access to the courts is not a denial of the human rights of the person subjected to the order, either generally or under Article 6 of the ECHR, notwithstanding that such orders have also often been described as "draconian"&#8221;.</p>

As I will come to when I turn to consider the merits of the application to commit to the extent permitted for the purpose of determining the application to strike out, it is well established that it is not a contempt of court to publish the contents of an order made in proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, in this case the final child arrangements order made by DJ(MC) Carr under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on 1 July 2021.

Further, the remaining orders exhibited to Mr Javaid&#8217;s statement comprising the non-molestation order made by DJ(MC) in favour of the respondent mother on 1 July 2021, the order of Deputy Circuit Judge Jordan dated 27 January 2022 dismissing Mr McCarren&#8217;s appeal against the orders of DJ(MC) Carr dated 1 July 2022 would not fall within the ambit of FPR 2010 r.12.73 having regard to the application of FPR Part 12 as specified in FPR 2010 r.12.1. </p>

It is unclear whether Mr McCarren is alleging that it is the provision of the documents by Mr Ireland to his solicitor that is a contempt of court, that it is an instruction on the part of Mr Ireland to Mr Javaid to exhibit the documents to the statement that is a contempt of court or the provision by Mr Javaid of the documents to the court on Mr Ireland&#8217;s behalf that constitutes the contempt.

For example, if the allegation is that Mr Ireland is in contempt for giving the documents to Mr Javaid (as Mr McCarren belatedly confirmed it to be in his statement dated 6 July 2022) Mr Ireland might seek in response to argue that this action came within FPR 2010 r.12.73(1)(a)(iii) as he was giving the documents to a professional legal adviser for the purpose of answering Mr McCarren&#8217;s application to set aside the statutory demand for costs owed, each of the orders disclosed evidencing a costs order made against Mr McCarren.  The point here is not the merits of such a pleaded defence, which may or may not succeed if advanced, but rather to demonstrate that an alleged contemnor will only have a fair opportunity to answer the case against him if that case is pleaded with sufficient precision and particularity at the outset of proceedings in the application to commit.  Whilst as I have noted, Mr McCarren belatedly confirmed he relied only on the provision of documents by Mr Ireland to Mr Javaid as grounding the contempt, it not consistent with the demands of fairness for a defendant at risk of potentially penal consequences to have the case against him clarified only months after the issue of proceedings.</p>

Within the foregoing context, and in addition to the lack of clarity regarding the documents and the actions of Mr Ireland relied on, it is further unclear from the application to commit the precise legal basis on which it is alleged that Mr Ireland is in contempt.  In particular, it is unclear whether Mr McCarren is alleging that the contempt is constituted simply by the absence of an order permitting disclosure or that Mr Ireland is in breach of FPR 2010 r.12.73.  If the latter, the application does not particularise the provisions of FPR 2010 r.12.73 on which Mr McCarren relies.  Further, and as I will again come to when I turn to consider the merits of the application to commit to the extent permitted for the purpose of determining the application to strike out, FPR 2010 r.12.73 does not itself prohibit the dissemination of information from family proceedings.  Rather, it is a permissive provision which specifies what information may be provided to specified persons in accordance with the rules or with the permission of the court. Whilst Mr Chiffers sought to rely on s.12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1963 in his Skeleton Argument, as I have noted no breach of that provision is pleaded in Mr McCarren&#8217;s application, nor dealt with in the purported evidence in support of the application.  Once again, the point here is that the alleged contemnor will only have a fair opportunity to answer the case against him if that case is pleaded with sufficient precision and particularity at the outset of proceedings in the application to commit and that it is not consistent with the demands of fairness for a defendant to have the case against him clarified only months after the issue of proceedings.</p>

However, no such amendment was sought by Mr McCarren at the hearing.  Further, given the extent of the lack of clarity and precision in the application to commit I am satisfied that it would not be possible to amend the application without causing significant prejudice to Mr Ireland in circumstances where he would be required, having regard to the extent of the failure to comply with the rules identified above, meet a substantially amended case over 6 months after the application to commit was made. Finally, as I will come to when I turn to consider the merits of the application to commit to the extent permitted in the current context, I am satisfied that the application would not have a reasonable prospect of success even if rectified.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[50] In my view, notwithstanding CPR 32.6 , CPR 81.14 requires attachments to a statement of case to be exhibited to the affidavit required by 81.14 (1) if they are to be relied on in support of the application. Part 81 is a self contained part of the Rules applying to the specific circumstance of an application for permission to commit, itself a quasi-criminal procedure, and must take precedence over the more general provisions of CPR 32.6 . If CPR 81.14 requires more of the applicant than might otherwise be required, it must be complied with. CPR 81.14 (1) (b) requires the exhibition of &#8220;all&#8221; documents relied on. &#8220;All&#8221; means all. It may be that, in litigation between parties such as these, the requirement is somewhat technical. So be it. It is not a requirement with which is difficult to comply; and in other cases, such as the case of a litigant in person or where the alleged contemnor has mislaid the documents, it may be particularly important. A person whom it is sought to commit to prison needs to be provided with a full package of the documentation, which is to be marshalled against him, so that he may know and have a copy of exactly what is relied on.&#8221;</p>

This conclusion is consistent with the fact that an application to commit has potentially penal consequences and, thus, must be supported by cogent evidence in the required format, in this instance an affidavit sworn on oath or affirmation by a deponent before a person authorised to administer affidavits.  This service of an affidavit with the application is a <span style="font-style:italic">cardinal </span>aspect of the procedure governing proceedings for alleged contempt.  The court is, of course, still required in a given case to ask itself whether the procedural omission will lead to injustice to the defendant if allowed to pass.  In this case, I am satisfied that the answer to that question is yes.  </p>

As I have already noted, the statement provided in support of the application did not provide a particularised and detailed account of the alleged contempt.  Moreover, and almost up until the date of this hearing, Mr McCarren continued to file statements without the permission of the court that further obfuscated and confused his case with respect to the contended for contempt.  In the circumstances, in this case not only was the defendant provided with a statement that failed to sufficiently particularise and detail the basis on which the application to commit was made but was faced thereafter with multiple serial statements re-formulating and reframing the case right up to date of this hearing.   That course of conduct is not capable in my judgment of curing the failure to comply with FPR 2010 r.37(4)(1) in this case.</p>

On the evidence before the court, I am satisfied that Mr McCarren&#8217;s purpose in bringing this application is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to secure compliance with a court order or bring to the attention of the court a serious, as opposed to technical, contempt of court.</p>

Rather, on the totality of evidence before the court I am satisfied that his purpose is to seek to continue to litigate the proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and to pursue his various grievances against those involved in those proceedings, in particular Mr Ireland and Dr Hellin.

In his statement dated 6 June 2022, filed ostensibly in support of the application to commit, Mr McCarren ranges across the conduct of the judges who dealt with the proceedings, the instruction, by consent, of Dr Hellin to provide an expert psychological assessment and the alleged adverse role in the family proceedings played by Mr Ireland.  As the statements provided by Mr McCarren progressed, including that in support of his latest C2 application, they moved even further away from the objects of ensuring compliance with a court order or seeking to bring to the attention of the court a serious contempt and towards an increasingly acute preoccupation with the role of Mr Ireland and Dr Hellin in the outcome of the family proceedings.  The statement in support of the latest C2 application issued by Mr McCarren evidences Mr McCarren&#8217;s view that he needs to stop what he considers is Mr Ireland&#8217;s pernicious influence in the family proceedings:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have, of course, considered the assertion by Mr McCarren, made in his statement dated 6 July 2022, that he is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> using the contempt proceedings as a collateral attack on the decision in the family proceedings and those involved in that decision.  However, in addition to the matters set out above, the fact that Mr McCarren&#8217;s purpose in bringing the application to commit Mr Ireland is not to secure compliance with a court order or to bring to the attention of the court a serious contempt in the form of disclosure without permission of (or, as contended for during submissions by Mr Chiffers, on a desire to ensure that the proceedings concerning his son remain private or a desire to protect the integrity of the court process) is further reinforced by Mr McCarren himself engaging in the conduct about which he now complains.  Whilst by his current application Mr McCarren relies on what he contends is the wrongful disclosure of information from the family proceedings in the form of disclosure of court orders, as summarised above Mr McCarren has himself disclosed a range of information from the family proceedings without seeking the permission of the court in the statement in support of his most recent C2 application naming Mr Ireland as a respondent.  In my judgment, this further supports the contention that Mr McCarren&#8217;s purpose in bringing the application to commit Mr Ireland is other than securing compliance with a court order or seeking to bring to the attention of the court a serious contempt or, as Mr Chiffer&#8217;s formulated the point on Mr McCarren&#8217;s behalf, to protect the privacy of Mr McCarren and S and the integrity of proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </p>

As I have noted, prior to his application to commit Mr Ireland, Mr McCarren pursued a civil action in the Kings&#8217; Bench Division for &#8220;fraud and deception&#8221; against Mr Ireland and an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/40" uk:canonical="1997 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Protection from Harassment Act 1997</ref> against him.   Within this context, Mr McCarren&#8217;s latest C2 application, whilst purporting to be made in the family proceedings and aimed at excluding the evidence of Dr Hellin after the fact, names Mr Ireland as the respondent even though he is, and has never been, a party to the family proceedings.  As I have noted above, on 28 October 2021, Mr McCarren applied to commit Dr Hellin for contempt of court, before replacing that application with a revised application against Dr Hellin on 15 February 2022 following the loss of his appeal on 27 January 2022.  That latter application was dismissed by Deputy Circuit Judge Jordan on 24 February 2022 as totally without merit.  Mr McCarren appealed that decision to the High Court, which appeal was dismissed by Mrs Justice Arbuthnot on 7 April 2022 as being totally without merit.   I am satisfied that these matters further support the conclusion that Mr McCarren&#8217;s purpose in pursing a committal application against Mr Ireland is a collateral one and not one of securing compliance with a court order or bringing to the attention of the court a serious contempt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, as also made clear by Carr LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Navigator Equities v Deripaska</span>, the question of whether or not the application to commit is at least properly arguable will inform the question of whether the application constitutes an abuse of process.  The question for the court in this respect is whether it is properly arguable to the criminal standard of proof that the alleged contemnor has committed a serious (as opposed to merely technical) contempt of court.  As I have noted, Mr McCarren seeks to rely on FPR 2010 r.12.73 as the legal provision that renders Mr Ireland&#8217;s provision to Mr Javaid of the orders exhibited to the latter&#8217;s statement dated 11 March 2022.  However, as also noted above, FPR 2010 r.12.73 is permissive in its terms and itself contains no prohibition on the communication of information relating to proceedings held in private.  Whilst Mr Chiffers sought to rely on s.12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1963 in his Skeleton Argument, as I have noted, no breach of that statute is pleaded in Mr McCarren&#8217;s application, nor dealt with in the purported evidence in support of the application.  In any event, it is well established under the authorities cited above that the publication of a court order made in family proceedings will not constitute a contempt of court.  Again, whilst Mr Chiffers seeks, belatedly, to rely on the rubric on the order of 1 July 2022 prohibiting the identification of the parties and the children, again this is not pleaded in the application to commit (in addition to the difficulties presented by the fact that the order on which the rubric appears does not contain a penal notice and was not personally served on Mr Ireland). Within this context, I am satisfied that Mr McCarren&#8217;s application to commit Mr Ireland cannot be said to be properly arguable.  </p>

As I have noted, in this case Mr McCarren continued to file and serve, without the permission of the court, lengthy statements with multiple exhibits up to the date of the hearing re-framing and expanding his case, which statements required consideration and to be addressed.  The only item I do consider excessive is the figure of &#163;750 for perusal of counsel&#8217;s skeleton arguments, which figure should be reduced to &#163;375.
