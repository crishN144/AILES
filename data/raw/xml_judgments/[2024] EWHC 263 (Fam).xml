I also circulated a draft my letter to the child at the centre of the application, who I will call Elena, so that all parties &#8211; but particularly her mother - could tell me if there was any part of it that caused them anxiety before it was given to Elena later that day. There was not and the parties were grateful for the tone adopted, which was one of sympathy for all. I now provide my reasons for making the order.</span></p>

I do not agree. I do not think that a judgment of that sort is in Elena&#8217;s welfare interests now and I think it unlikely to assist her in future. The extremely unhappy situation that has arisen affects three generations of this family and is likely to remain a source of pain for some time. Much healing is needed and it is better, in my judgment, to go no further than justice requires.</span></p>

Their jointly and strongly held view was that Elena needed a speedy conclusion to the proceedings and certainty about her future. She had endured around a year and a half of interrogation by professionals, and the knowledge that she was the focus of court proceedings. In October 2023, she had told the Guardian that worry about the outcome of the court case was making it difficult for her to concentrate on her schoolwork. Whilst she had previously been keen to meet the judge, and had indeed met Arbuthnot J in August 2023, she did not want to meet the judge who would make the final decision. In the Guardian&#8217;s opinion, Elena was suffering from significant frustration, litigation fatigue and a degree of anger that her wishes and feelings were not being accorded respect. Finally, the outstanding information was likely to come in during the course of the hearing and the Ukrainian Consul could update the court when he gave evidence.</span></p>

On 18 May 2022, at an ex parte hearing, Mrs R was granted permission to apply for a Child Arrangements Order that Elena live with her, and a Prohibited Steps Order was made. Elena was made a party, a Children&#8217;s Guardian was appointed, and the proceedings were transferred to the High Court. Later that month Newton J made her a ward of court. A three day final hearing was listed to start on 6 March 2023. </span></p>

They considered that her disclosures were Elena&#8217;s truth. The possibility of past unconscious influence of Elena by Mrs R cannot be discounted but the mother&#8217;s allegation is one of deliberate alienation. I am entirely satisfied that that did not occur. I also find that in difficult circumstances, Mrs R has done all she can to encourage Elena to love, see, write and speak to her mother, and to stay in touch with her grandparents on both sides. I find that she has also fostered Elena&#8217;s Ukrainian roots and her linguistic and cultural links to her homeland. I am confident that she will continue to all these things to the best of her ability, taking into account Elena&#8217;s wishes and feelings.</span></p>

It does not follow that I consider the mother to have been untruthful: I do not. She spoke with passion and almost palpable sincerity, barely pausing for breath, and the words poured out of her at a speed with which the interpreter could scarcely keep up. It was obvious that she was convinced of the truth of what she was saying. In her mind, there was no harmful care in Ukraine, until she set foot in England Elena had been a loving child who told her mother that she loved her several times a day, and the three of them had been a happy family. In this context a plot orchestrated by her sister, or story telling on the part of her daughter, were the only possible explanations. Mrs R is, I believe, very far from being a cruel person but the situation is undoubtedly cruel for this mother whose overwhelming love for her only child has no current outlet.</span></p>

At the end of the hearing, the mother renewed her submission that I adjourn a final decision until that clarity was available. I did not agree. Elena is aware of the position and it is one she shares with many others. Her welfare needs are a stable present and an end to these proceedings. This court cannot give her certainty about the future but it can, and in my judgment should, provide her with certainty about where she lives, who she lives with, and who are the decision makers in relation to her upbringing, for as long as she is in England and a child.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The mother had no clear plan for how any meeting could or should be achieved given Elena&#8217;s strong opposition. She seemed to think that the adults around her should simply &#8220;get a grip&#8221; (my expression), command her to attend and she would do so. The professionals working with Elena, and those who have case managed these proceedings, have taken the view Elena should have with her mother only such contact as she wishes and feels she wants to have. I share that view. Elena is not subject to undue influence and her Guardian and social worker tell me that she is a child who knows her own mind in this regard. There is a high risk that forced contact, even if that could be achieved, would do more harm and no good. Conversely, if the mother is able to respect Elena&#8217;s desire for distance, and her wish that she be allowed to determine when, where and how contact is restarts, then there is a good chance that in time trust and contact will be restored. At present, there is no identifiable, practical alternative.</span></p>

In addition to making the SGO, I discharged the wardship order, varied the prohibited steps order and extended it to 2028 when Elena will be 16, ordered that Mrs and Mr R will hold her passport and travel documents, and directed that an unanonymised copy of this judgment be provided to the Secretary of State for the Home Office and Mr Yurkin.</span></p>

It is greatly in Elena&#8217;s welfare interest, and that of the whole family, that she is in communication with the person who loves her most in the world. Giving her the time, space and control she needs before she can take the first step will be testing for the mother. This court wishes them both well and commends the compassionate, generous hearted actions of Elena&#8217;s Special Guardians.</span></p>
