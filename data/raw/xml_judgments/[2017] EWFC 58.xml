He has not sworn to its truth but it is undoubtedly admissible evidence.  As he went into the witness box, I reminded his counsel that the law is that he does not have to give evidence unless he wishes to do so.  His interpreter took the oath and he then took the oath.  His counsel then asked to speak to her client.  As this was a committal, I permitted her to do so although I recognise that this was an unusual way to proceed.  When I came back into court, I was told that he had elected not to give evidence after all.</p>

The difficulty with that submission is that I did not warn the Father that I would be entitled to draw adverse inferences before he decided not to give oral evidence.  I am therefore clear that I cannot do so.  I do not do so.</p>

The Father was born in Libya although I believe he is now a British Citizen.  He currently resides at Flat 3 Acacia House, Church Hall, Douglas Road, Wood Green.  The Mother was born in Malta but she is also a British citizen. She lives at 18A Stratton Road, Pewsey, Wiltshire.  </p>

In 2012, the Father took the children to Libya having secured the Mother&#8217;s agreement based on the ill-health of the paternal grandfather.  Unfortunately, the grandfather died before they arrived.  The Father remained there with the children.  The Mother joined them.  She says he did not allow her to bring the children back and she had to return on her own but, in November 2012, the Father returned the children of his own accord.</p>

It seems to be common ground that the meeting was intended to be in Tunisia but the Father took the children into Libya.  He says the grandmother was unable to cross the border into Tunisia due to the weight of numbers trying to leave Libya.   The Mother alleges the Father then refused to return them despite the maternal grandfather even sending flight tickets.  The Father says he missed the flight due to problems near the airport.  </p>

He says it was to sort out problems in the marriage and he brought Y as a &#8220;surprise&#8221;.  Ms Lennox, who appears on behalf of the Father, argues that this demonstrates his bona fides. The Mother removed the passports.  Y has lived with the Mother since although it appears that there have been difficulties with his behaviour.</p>

In an unsigned &#8220;position statement&#8221; prepared for a hearing on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017, the Father said he did not bring the girls back as he did not want them to go through the same difficulties as Y.

She made the usual requests to the authorities in Libya and Tunisia to take steps to assist in returning the girls.  The Father said the girls were residing with the paternal grandmother in Green Square, Tripoli.  He gave phone numbers on which he said they could be reached and said there was access to the internet via his brother, Marwan&#8217;s phone.  He gave his full agreement to them leaving Libya and flying to the UK.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Judge heard oral evidence from the Father.  She made a finding of fact that the Father was not using his best endeavours to achieve the speedy return of the girls to England and that he was frustrating and impeding their return.  She said he could do far more but his protestations that he wishes them to return are hollow words.  Those findings do not assist me, as they were made to the civil standard of proof, namely the balance of probabilities, not the criminal standard.  A number of mandatory orders were made to the Father, supported by a penal notice.  Some of these are the subject of this committal application and I will deal with them in due course.   The most important, however, was an order that the Father was to bring about the return of the children to this jurisdiction by 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017.  The Judge also provided that the children would then reside with the Father pending further hearings.  The children have not, however, been returned.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The case was subsequently heard by Holman J on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017, MacDonald J on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 and Hayden J on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017.  All three judges made further orders designed to secure the return of the children and to ensure regular telephone contact between the girls and their Mother prior to this occurring.  At all times, the Father&#8217;s case has been that he wishes the children to return forthwith.  It is clear that the Mother has been unable to speak to the girls at all since March 2017 despite orders that she should be able to do so.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017, the Father told Holman J he had not been able to speak to his family either since 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017.  He also asserted that, as a matter of Libyan law, the girls could only leave Libya if accompanied by him.  He signed a document giving his full consent to the girls returning.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Inevitably, the court ordered a report from an expert on Libyan law as to whether the girls could leave Libya without the Father.  Mr Andrew Allen of Outer Temple Chambers provided his expert opinion on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017.  He said that Libya is not a fully functioning State and the justice system is unable to function effectively.  UK court orders are not recognised as of right in Libya.  The Father is considered to be the natural guardian of his children although the Mother would be viewed as the physical custodian.  The default position is that a minor child needs the permission of her guardian (the Father) or, in his absence, the nearest male relative, to leave the country.  Mr Allen is not aware of any principle that requires the Father to accompany the children physically.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is right that he then says that he has reached the tentative conclusion that there is no legislation governing this principle and that, in consequence, sharia law applies.  He repeats that the father must give permission but is not physically required to accompany them.  He adds that, given the parlous state of affairs in Libya, it may be that someone needs to accompany them on a practical level. </p>

The Mother has sworn an Affidavit dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017.   She says that the Father&#8217;s case is that he has not spoken to the girls since 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2017 and has not spoken to his family since 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017. She does not believe him.  She says that he asked her why she told the girls that he was going to prison.  She says that this proves he has had contact with them.  She says he has told her he will go to prison rather than bring them back.   </p>

In all areas where her evidence conflicts with that of the Father, I accept her evidence in its entirety.  She told me that she has attempted to contact the Father&#8217;s brother, Marwan, who lives with the paternal grandmother.  He responded in March/April, saying he did not want anything to do with this matter.  She added that every message she has sent has been seen by him and he saw a message she sent on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2017.  This is important as, if the Mother can contact him, so can the Father.  She said that the last time she spoke to the girls was three days before the Father returned to the UK.  I do not believe that is a coincidence.  The contact stopped when the Father became aware of these proceedings.  She told me that, when the Father went to Libya in December 2016, he told her that he could bring the girls back in three days and that the passport was &#8220;all ready&#8221;.  I accept this evidence.   He did not, however, bring them back although it was not contrary to any order when he did not return them in March 2017. </p>

That is speculation and I do not find that proved to the criminal standard of proof.  She added that it was not true that the Father could only get one child out at a time and I remind myself that this is most certainly not what the Father said at the time.  </p>

He gave oral evidence to support it.  I accept his evidence entirely but it does not advance my knowledge of the case.   On the Father&#8217;s instructions, Mr Netto sent various messages to the girls, Marwan and the paternal grandmother via various means, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Viber.  He got no response.  Indeed, it appears that none of the messages have got through.  If the Father is orchestrating the matter, I am not surprised by this at all.  The surprise to me is that there have been no publicly visible posts on Facebook by Z for many months.  It is said by the Father that this may be due to power cuts in Libya but this does not stand up to scrutiny.  The Mother tells me there have always been power cuts and even on the worst day this summer the electricity was only off for 16 hours, meaning that it was on for 8 hours even then.  Moreover, I do not accept that you need electricity to use a mobile phone other than to charge it occasionally.  Mr Netto did manage to get hold of a friend of the Father&#8217;s named Mohammed in Libya.  He told Mr Netto in Arabic, via the Father, that he had been to the Tripoli property three or four days ago and nobody appeared to be at home.  I do not know whether this is true or not.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Father did not give oral evidence but, as is his right, he filed a statement dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017. He told the court that he desperately wants his daughters returned to England.  He makes the fair point that Libya is a war zone but this entirely loses its force when it is remembered that he took them there after the disorder had commenced and without the Mother&#8217;s permission as she thought they were staying in Tunisia.  He says he has had no contact with them for months.  I cannot accept this.  It is his case that Libya is a male dominated society such that only he can bring the girls home yet he contends that he does not even know where they are and the paternal grandmother has just disappeared with them without his knowledge.  She has not even told him where she has gone.  He postulates they have moved to live with one of the Mother&#8217;s eight sisters but he does not know any of their addresses.  Moreover, he says they all live in the Tripoli area.  Given his case that the area where the grandmother was living was safe, it is difficult to see how these other places can be safer.  It is nonsense.  I reject it in its entirety.  Either the girls remain in the grandmother&#8217;s property and the reports from his friends are lies or he has deliberately moved the girls to make it more difficult to find them and bring them home. I cannot say to the criminal standard which it is but I can say so that I am sure that he is in complete control of what is going on.  </p>

Their guardian is the Father.  She will do what he says and I find she has been doing so, including preventing the Mother even speaking to them which is a wicked thing to do. He ends by saying that he is more than prepared to fly to Libya.  Two points arise.  First, he says he does not know where they are so it is difficult, on his case, to see the point of that.  Second, he has had the chance to bring them back twice and has not done so.  I do not believe he would do so now if I was to allow him to go.  I reject his written evidence and I make my findings to the criminal standard of proof.  It follows that I reject his assertions that he wants these girls returned.    </p>

On 7 April 2017, the Father&#8217;s then solicitors sent two such screenshots but the first is a general map of Tripoli that shows nothing.  The second is virtually unreadable, certainly in my copy.  In his most recent statement, he says that he found it extremely difficult to find the exact location and was hampered by only having a small phone.  The difficulty with this explanation is that it was not the explanation he gave in his statement on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 when he said he was &#8220;hesitant to provide a screenshot as I fear it will put my daughters at risk.&#8221;  The only way, however, that it could put his daughters at risk, at least in his eyes, was if it made it easier for the Mother to find them.

The height of his case in this regard is the opinion of Mr Allen at Paragraph 27.1 where Mr Allen says that his conclusion that there is no legislation in Libya governing this question is only &#8220;tentative&#8221;.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am, however, quite satisfied that this does not give the Father a defence for reasons I will explain.  The order of Holman J was in the following terms:-</p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;In so far as it is lawful and possible under the law of Libya for any person other than the Father to accompany the children&#8230;, the Father must use his best endeavours to procure and promote that (the children) leave Libya forthwith and in any event by no later than 4pm on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2017&#8221;. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am sure that the Father has not complied with that order.   He has done absolutely nothing to procure or promote their return.  Indeed, I am sure he has done the opposite.   I have made a finding of fact that the Father has deliberately ensured the children have had no contact with their Mother.  Indeed, I find that he has instructed the grandmother either to disappear or to become uncontactable.  It follows that, far from &#8220;procuring and promoting that the children leave Libya forthwith&#8221;, he has done the opposite.  The allegation that he has breached the order of Holman J is therefore proved to the criminal standard of proof.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The order of HHJ Robertshaw directs him to bring about the return of the children.  MacDonald J&#8217;s order repeats that provision.  The order of Hayden J directs him to cause the children to be returned.  I am quite satisfied that he has done nothing at all to bring about the return of the children or to cause them to be returned.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am also satisfied that it is wrong to place weight on Mr Allen&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;tentative&#8221;.  In fact, Mr Allen&#8217;s report is clear.  He says that the default position under sharia law is that a minor child needs the permission of her guardian (usually the Father but in his absence his father or nearest male relative).  He is not aware of any sharia principle that requires the father to accompany the children physically.  I am satisfied that Mr Allen would be aware of such a fundamental requirement if it existed.  Indeed, in Libya today it would be quite impractical.  Many adult fathers have been killed or displaced.  The Father&#8217;s own evidence was that there were very lengthy queues of people at the border wishing to leave Libya.  I simply cannot accept that all children present in those queues had their fathers with them. The requirement is one of permission from the child&#8217;s guardian which in this case is the Father.  The Father has given his permission.  Moreover, the closest relative present is Marwan and he can clearly accompany them to Tunisia.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My view as to this is supported by the actions of the Father himself.  If his case was correct, he would not have had to hide the children and refuse to cooperate with just about every order made against him.  I find to the criminal standard that this Father has failed to comply with not just the order of Holman J but the other three orders as well.  </p>

They are so serious that I am entirely satisfied that only a custodial sentence will do.  I am equally satisfied that it is not appropriate to suspend the sentence given the wilful and sustained contempt and the deliberate concealment of the children since March.  If it had not been for that, I would have been minded to suspend the sentence to give you a last chance to comply but you have taken the opposite course, namely one of deliberate concealment of the children.  It would be quite inappropriate to merely prevent you applying to have contact to Y in accordance with the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hadkinson</span>.  A fine would not be appropriate.</p>
