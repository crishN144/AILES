	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an urgent application made on behalf of BP who is 83 years of age. BP was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in December 2018. He is deaf but is able to communicate through a &#8220;communication board&#8221;. Today&#8217;s emergency application, brought by BP&#8217;s litigation friend, his daughter FP, seeks to achieve his discharge from the care home where he is presently living and a declaration that it is in his best interest to be returned to his home with an appropriate package of support. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is generated by the decision of SH care home to suspend all visits from any family members to BP and indeed to the others living in the home. The restriction also extends to any other visitors (see para 9 below). That decision was activated at 5pm on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020. It is contended that this application is urgent because the current constrictions imposed by this care home and, of course, many others, is said to constitute an unlawful interference with BP&#8217;s rights, guaranteed by Articles 5 and 8 ECHR. </p>

Until that point he had been living at home with his wife Mrs RP, the second respondent to these proceedings. The couple appear to have managed satisfactorily, without any identifiable support but it gradually emerged that BP was sometimes being verbally and, it is said, occasionally physically aggressive towards his wife. It is important to state that this was a manifestation of his Alzheimer&#8217;s. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Plans were tentatively made to provide respite care for BP but, before these could be brought in to effect, he fell ill and was admitted to hospital on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019. He had become very dehydrated. He was discharged from hospital to SH care home and his placement there was authorised on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 as a necessary and proportionate deprivation of his liberty. BP resents having to live at the care home and has consistently and unambiguously expressed his wish to return home. The &#8216;standard authorisation&#8217; was due to expire 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2020 but has since been extended until 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2020, pursuant to the order of HHJ Raeside 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">BP was assessed by Dr Brett du Toit, Medical Practitioner, on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019, as lacking capacity to make decisions about his accommodation and care needs as a result of his cognitive impairment.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding his conclusion, Dr Brett du Toit considered that BP understood most of the relevant information, &#8220;on balance&#8221;, regarding his dementia, his accommodation, his medication, his care needs, his vulnerability and risk of misadventure. Furthermore, BP was thought to be able to retain enough of the information for long enough to &#8216;attempt&#8217; to weigh the decision. BP could also communicate his decision to the assessor. Where BP fundamentally struggled, in terms of the capacity assessment, was in his ability to give appropriate weight to his care needs and properly appreciate the risks he faces if left unsupervised. BP also was considered to have an incomplete understanding of his illness overall. Dr Brett du Toit notes that BP does not believe he has dementia or memory problems and ultimately found that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;there was sufficient cognitive impairment on testing to prevent effective judgement of his health and safety if living independently&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There had in fact been an earlier assessment undertaken whilst BP was still in hospital. That assessment was conducted by a Ms Leah Majasi-Ncube. The report is dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019. The conclusion was that BP was able to understand but not retain or weigh information in a manner which would enable him to take informed decisions about his care. The family are divided as to whether it is in BP&#8217;s interests to return home with a package of care or to remain in the SH care home. It is an invidious and upsetting situation but one that many families must address. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">BP was, until the crisis presented by the Coronavirus pandemic, receiving regular visits. His daughter FP has visited him six days a week since BP was first admitted. In her evidence she told me that she would stay usually for over an hour and read the paper to her father. AP, BP&#8217;s son visits four times a week with BP&#8217;s granddaughters every Wednesday. BP&#8217;s wife manages to visit three times per week and BP&#8217;s other daughter KH, has face to face contact with BP at least once per month. In addition, BP receives visits from his extended family and friends. He is self-evidently a popular and much-loved man. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, BP&#8217;s deafness limits some of his options. BP does not use a telephone, face time or Skype. There can be no doubt that the change to BP&#8217;s quality of life from 5 o&#8217;clock on Friday 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 was seismic. Additionally, the restriction extended to the Mental Capacity Assessor visiting. Thus, there is need for heightened vigilance to ensure that BP&#8217;s fundamental rights are not eclipsed by the exigencies of the Coronavirus pandemic. Fundamental to my consideration of the issues presented by this case is Article 11 UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (&#8216;CRPD&#8217;) which provides:</p>

The essence of the guidance is that people should stay at home, with very limited exceptions and for very tightly constrained purposes. At his age and with his underlying health problems BP is vulnerable to the most serious impact of the Coronavirus. In my view, it is necessary to state the risk BP faces, were he to contract the virus, in uncompromising terms: there would be a very real risk to his life. Manifestly, there are powerful and competing rights and interests engaged when considering this application. </p>

First, the deprivation of liberty could be imputable to the state due to the direct involvement of public authorities in the applicant's detention. Secondly, the state could be found to have violated article 5 in that its courts, in the compensation proceedings brought by the applicant, failed to interpret the provisions of civil law relating to her claim in the spirit of&#160;article 5. Thirdly, the state could have violated its positive obligations&#160;to protect the applicant against interferences with her liberty carried out by private persons.&#8221;</p>

(i) These will include the duty to investigate, so as to determine whether there is, in fact, a deprivation of liberty &#8230; (ii) If, having carried out its investigation, the local authority is satisfied that the objective element is not present, so there is no deprivation of liberty, the local authority will have discharged its immediate obligations. However, its positive obligations&#160;may in an appropriate case require the local authority to continue to monitor the situation in the event that circumstances should change. (iii) If, however, the local authority concludes that the measures imposed do or may constitute a deprivation of liberty, then it will be under a positive obligation &#8230; to take reasonable and proportionate measures to bring that state of affairs to an end. What is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances will, of course, depend upon the context, but it might for example &#8230; require the local authority to exercise its statutory powers and duties so as to provide support services for the carers that will enable inappropriate restrictions to be ended, or at least minimised. (iv) If, however, there are no reasonable measures that the local authority can take to bring the deprivation of liberty to an end, or if the measures it proposes are objected to by the individual or his family, then it may be necessary for the local authority to seek the assistance of the court in determining whether there is, in fact, a deprivation of liberty and, if there is, obtaining authorisation for its continuance.</p>

That is not a sentence that I or any other judge of my generation would ever have anticipated writing. The striking enormity of it has caused me to reflect, at considerable length, before committing it to print. Article 5 protects the fundamental human right both to liberty and, it must be emphasised, to security. It requires powerful reasons to justify any derogation. Those reasons must be confirmed on solid and compelling evidence before any court finds them to be established. The spread of this insidious viral pandemic particularly, though not uniquely, threatening to the elderly with underlying comorbidity, establishes a solid foundation upon which a derogation becomes not merely justified but essential. Ms Harvey referred me to the relevant case law concerning the procedure for a contemplated derogation. In particular, my attention was drawn to Lawless v Ireland 332/57; Greek case 176/56. I am clear that on a proper construction of these authorities it is not necessary to signal notification of derogation to the Council of Europe. </p>

Staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) for activities that bring them into close personal contact, such as washing and bathing, personal hygiene and contact with bodily fluids.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The plan advanced by FP was that her father should come and live with her. She has been self-isolating so as to prepare for his return. The arrangement is that Mrs RP would move out, in light of the safeguarding concerns I have referred to above and that FP would care for her father alone. Ideally, care support would reinforce FP&#8217;s care but, all recognised that, in the present circumstances, this could not be secured. FP realistically acknowledged that her father is prone to what is termed &#8220;misadventure&#8221; and should be watched vigilantly. Though she could not quite bring herself to acknowledge it, she recognised that her offer of 24 hour per day single handed care for her father is not, in truth, a realistic option. FP said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;everyone is a loser in this situation!&#8221;</span>. Both in and out of court, which in this case meant on or off Skype recording, efforts were made to explore the possibilities for contact. It is not necessary for me to work through them in this judgment. Their significance is that the care staff and the family, with the help of their advocates, began to absorb some of the stark realities of their present situation. A great deal of effort was made to see whether it might be possible to unlock a fire door and provide for a visit at a suitably safe distance. In the end and for a variety of reasons that was not possible. The plan that was ultimately put together provides for BP&#8217;s education in to the world of Skype with creative use of a communication board and the exploration of concurrent instant messaging. Additionally, the family can, by arrangement, go to BP&#8217;s bedroom window which is on the ground floor and wave to him and use the communication board. All this will require time, effort and some creativity. I am clear that there is mutual resolve by all concerned. When I asked FP what she thought her father would want if he was addressing this question objectively with his full faculties intact, she unhesitatingly told me that the last thing he would want would be to burden her or her family. Approaching this challenging situation from that perspective appeared to give FP some comfort. I am entirely satisfied that this is a balanced and proportionate way forward which respects BP&#8217;s dignity and keeps his particular raft of needs at the centre of the plan. Equally, I have no doubt that this application, for all the reasons that I have alluded to, was properly brought. It has been important to recognise that in addition to his Alzheimer&#8217;s BP&#8217;s deafness is a separate and protected characteristic, as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/148/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 148(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>. As such, it requires to be identified and considered as a unique facet of BP&#8217;s overall needs.  </p>

On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 I recognised the reality that capacity assessments would, of necessity, for the time being require to be undertaken remotely. There is simply no alternative to this, though its general undesirability is manifest. Assessments in these circumstances will require vigilant scrutiny. This said, with careful and sensitive expertise, it should be possible to provide sufficient information. In response to an identified question, answered with the benefit of consultation with the profession I was able, in the guidance document, to state the following:</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Suggested solution: In principle, yes. The assessor will need to make clear exactly what the basis of the assessment is (i.e. video access, review of records, interviews with others, etc.) Whether such evidence is sufficient will then be determined on a case by case basis. It is noted that GPs are rapidly gaining expertise in conducting consultations by video and may readily adopt similar practices for assessments. Careful consideration will need to be given to P being adequately supported, for example by being accompanied by a &#8220;trusted person.&#8221; These considerations could and should be addressed when the video arrangements are settled. It should always be borne in mind that the arrangements made should be those which, having regard to the circumstances, are most likely to assist P in achieving capacity.&#8217;</span></p>

That is a difficult task for a member of the family who is emotionally involved in the issues that are disputed within the family and it seems to me an impossible task for AF to carry out in this case. One only has to look at her statements to see that she is clearly wedded to a particular answer. You do not see within her statements a balanced approach or anything approaching it, such as: "This is the problem. These are the relevant factors for and against". That is not a criticism. Rather it seems to me that it is a product of the result of there being long-standing family disputes and the existing clear divisions of opinion within the sibling group as to what will best promote UF's best interests.&#8221;</span></p>
