It is made in relation to an application made by the husband, Mr S, for an order that the wife's solicitor, Raymond Tooth, be debarred from acting for her in these proceedings.  The wife is Mrs S.  The husband is today represented by Mr Philip Marshall QC  and Ms Charlotte Hartley.  The respondent wife is represented by Mr Martin Pointer QC  and Mrs Rebecca Carew Pole.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">A divorce petition was issued by the wife in September 2016.  This application arises out of the fact that following initial contact between the wife's and the husband&#8217;s solicitors, the husband raised the point that Mr Tooth was one of six solicitors his representative had consulted in November 2015 with a view to, he says, choosing which firm would be a good fit for him were family litigation to occur in London.  When that litigation was in prospect, in February 2017, and it transpired that the wife had instructed Sears Tooth, he objected on the basis that Mr Tooth was privy to confidential and privileged information which was such as to conflict him from acting for the wife.</p>

	      <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">in the context of family litigation it is hard to conceive of a situation where the risk of disclosure would not satisfy that test where the Court had concluded that detailed, confidential financial information and/or privileged information had been disclosed to a solicitor by one party to a marriage which was, or might be relevant to a potential dispute between them.  In most cases that would create a real risk where that solicitor was subsequently instructed by the other party.</p>

	      <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">a party advancing such an application may decline to waive privilege or confidentiality, or may elect to partially waive privilege.  If he partially waives privilege the Court may order full disclosure in relation to that transaction in order to determine an issue such as an application for an injunction like this, and the Court may take steps to ensure that the privilege is not waived for all purposes, but to ensure that the cat can be put back into the bag.  In cases such as this the question should be considered at the directions stage, in particular where, as here, partial disclosure in the form of the attendance note has been made.</p>

Relevant considerations might include, firstly, whether the information had been imparted during an exercise designed either wholly or in part to conflict out other solicitors who the respondent might seek to instruct; whether there are other firms who might now be able to act for the respondent; whether the application was made promptly; the additional expense and delay that might be occasioned to the respondent if they were obliged to instruct new solicitors; whether any such expense could appropriately be off-set by the applicant.</p>

The issues are, firstly, can the husband prove that a meeting took place between Raymond Tooth and OE on 30 November 2015?  Secondly, if it did can the husband prove that any confidential or privileged material was communicated to Raymond Tooth and his assistant during that meeting?  Thirdly, but a subset of the preceding item, can the husband prove that such material is or may be relevant to the current dispute or contemplated dispute?  Fourthly if such information was provided, can the wife, or Raymond Tooth, establish that there is no real risk of disclosure? Lastly if there is such a risk is there any reason for not granting an injunction?</p>

He had partially waived privilege by the disclosure of the attendance note and he could have gone further.  Mr Pointer QC ultimately accepted that the effect, for the purposes of this court, is simply that the evidence before the Court is more limited than it might have been.

Complete pictures tend to provide a more reliable foundation for judges to base their findings on.  In those rare cases where the solicitor retained no notes at all and could not recall the information allegedly provided or the advice given, I suppose it would be conceivable in such a case to adopt a special advocate  type measure so that any privilege waived could be completely ringfenced from the solicitors, counsel and parties and so that confidentiality and/or privilege could be protected.  Whether that would be proportionate is a question I shall not express any views on.</p>

The following matters demonstrate this: the appointment in Raymond Tooth's diary that was put there by him following some contact by OE and not crossed out, a telephone message from some point in the afternoon by OE in which he gave his number, the Google search for the premises of Sears Tooth -- I do not consider the time differences to be of any particular significance to OE&#8217;S credibility, they may arise from the use of different time zones on his devices -- OE&#8217;S recollection of the interior of the premises (the piece of artwork, the obtaining of a card and the layout of the conference room) and the combination of OE&#8217;S own evidence and Mr Tooth's evidence persuade me that an appointment was booked and that OE attended for it and some form of meeting took place.</p>

It seems from the chronology that the overall picture that emerges is this was all part of long-term planning by the husband for possible future litigation in England. If there was something on the horizon though, at the particular time it seems to have been more related to the situation of the children than the divorce, which from the husband's point of view was done and dusted nine years before.  Those circumstances do not suggest that in initial meetings there would be detailed disclosure of confidential information as opposed to some general discussions about the approach of the lawyer and general discussions of jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">OE did not disclose, in either his statement or in his oral evidence, that in fact he or the husband had seen HFC on 21 October and, more importantly, that the husband had signed a retainer letter with HFC on 23 November, a week before the meetings.  As the husband's representative for these purposes in London, it is inconceivable that OE was not aware of this and indeed more likely than not that he had made the recommendation to the husband to instruct HFC following the meeting they had had on 17 November. Although Mr Marshall QC says that OE could still have been looking for a better fitting lawyer than HFC, I have to say I consider that improbable.  If he was, why not say so in his statement, that he retained them for the interim whilst he continued the search?  Given it is now known that there were two meetings with HFC, including a second one with the husband's Russian lawyer, I am not prepared to accept this explanation.  I am satisfied that the husband selected HFC because he thought they were the best fit.  Indeed he remains with them now, over two years after his initial meeting.</p>

Perhaps they were arranged in advance of 23 November, I have no evidence on when they were booked, and perhaps OE went through with them just to double check his selection of HFC.  I consider it more likely than not though that by this stage there was also an element of ejecting those solicitors out of the pool of lawyers who the wife might consult.</p>

OE said in his statement at paragraph 5 that his earlier meetings overran, that is his earlier meetings with the firms Mischon de Reya and Stewarts Law.  This was not his account in evidence, which put the Stewarts meeting finishing at 1.30 to 2 pm.  He dealt with his arrival in both his statements and in neither did he say anything about a gap between the solicitors' meetings.  </p>

That seemed to me to arise from his realisation that in his evidence he had created a window of time that was inconsistent with his earlier account.  Why he would call Sears Tooth to say that he was running late is hard to fathom when on his own account he was not.  The haircut story seemed to mirror the new explanation he had given slightly earlier in his evidence of having a manicure to fill the gap between the end of his Sears Tooth meeting and the time on the attendance note.</p>

The most obvious example was that he clearly and firmly, but erroneously, asserted that Natasha Slabas was present at the meeting.  I think he had simply looked at the Sears Tooth website and identified someone he thought had attended and then embellished his account by making reference to that person having an Eastern European connection.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">The what I have termed an attendance note at B19 could be capable of corroborating his account, in particular if I was satisfied it was both contemporaneous and accurate.  The timing on it at C10 puts it at either 6.02 pm or 7.02 pm GMT.  OE said this time may be when it was last amended, but it tells me nothing about when it was started, nor does it, or he, tell me what the amendments were to it.  It could be as much some aide memoire, put together after all the meetings concluded with some points he wanted to relay to the husband, as anything else. Curiously the meeting with Raymond Tooth comes second in his note before the single entry for what he said arose from his prior meeting with Stewarts.  If these were truly contemporaneous notes that seems odd. Given my general concerns about how reliable and accurate a historian OE is, I cannot even determine whether what he ascribes to Raymond Tooth is accurately ascribed.  It could have come from any of the meetings, or indeed nowhere, as the presence of Ms Slabas did.</p>

Why would a bulletproof jurisdiction be of relevance to the husband?  He had his divorce and was not contemplating further divorce jurisdiction.  It might be of interest on the children, I suppose, in determining habitual residence and the ability to bring proceedings in England.  What does the comment "no generous deed" tell me?  It could relate to the wife and children living in England, it might relate to maintenance.  But even if OE had said the husband had paid the wife large sums, how could that be confidential?</p>

There is no dictated or handwritten file notes, no bill.  Mr Tooth described the process of making up a file and how it would be retained.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much of what OE said about Mr Tooth's attitude could derive simply from his public image.  It is not consistent with what Mr Tooth or his assistants say about his attitude with clients, it is more caricature that a person who has not known him as a client might have.</p>

He said he had a telephone call with him.  He said, "I did a verbal report, I read them out to him", but he did not say why he had recommended HFC.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence overall of Mr Tooth of the requirement for passport identification to be brought, of how files are made up with the handwritten and dictated notes and their storage is consistent with a brief and non-specific meeting at which little, probably not even the name of the principal, was disclosed.  I very much doubt that the husband would want detailed disclosure of highly confidential information to a significant number of firms, in particular I doubt it would be authorised after he had retained his first choice firm.  I very much doubt that OE was given free rein to disclose the husband's highly sensitive financial and other dealings.  Anything he was authorised to disclose would have been carefully vetted, particularly at this stage.  The absence of a briefing note suggests to me that not much would have been disclosed.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">The clear impression of strategising and manoeuvring emerges from the judgment of Mr Justice Peter Jackson, all designed to further the husband's goals, often involving the deception of the wife and designed to strengthen the husband's position in any future litigation and weaken the wife's.  The timing of the meetings with the six firms fits in with the later manoeuvring over the children being put in touch with lawyers early in 2016.  The way the situation with the children was created suggests very careful planning and manoeuvring by the husband.  The failure to be frank about the meetings with HFC mirrors the incomplete disclosure about the involvement with Dawson Cornwall in the children's case.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am led to conclude that the meetings with at least some of the six firms, probably all of those seen on 30 November; given the first three seen on the 17th or earlier clearly involved more serious consideration by OE and the Russian lawyer, the later ones were at least in part motivated not by a genuine consultation but a conflicting exercise.  </p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">I cannot conclude the whole process was.  Indeed if it had been there are some other obvious names that would have been seen.  Indeed, even by 30 November there may still have been some lingering or vestigial genuine reason for completing the survey of firms, but by 3 o'clock on 30 November 2017 I am satisfied that OE was not seriously considering instructing Sears Tooth and this undoubtedly influenced the nature of the meeting and the information given.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is probably self-evident by now that I thought that OE was rather blas&#233; about the need for accuracy in matters evidential.  He seemed very relaxed about the fact that he had got it wrong about Natasha Slabas.  He later said in his evidence he did not think it mattered much about being accurate.  He said he was unaware of the need to be 100 per cent careful.  I think that attitude generally infects his evidence.  He is rather casual about details and seemed quite prepared to elaborate to suit the point he is trying to sell.  I do not believe I can rely on the accuracy of his account.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course there are aspects of it which are true.  There are aspects which are patently false.  The latter does not mean the rest is false.  The former does not mean the rest is true.  He has of course a potential motive to exaggerate or fabricate because part of the purpose in seeing Sears Tooth may have been to conflict them out.  In any event, his boss certainly did not want Sears Tooth acting and so as his head of his family office he has an obvious motive to do his boss' bidding.  The failure to disclose the earlier instruction of HFC and their retention simply adds to the picture of OE as being a witness who cannot be relied upon.  To maintain he saw Sears Tooth with a genuine intent to consider instructions when he knew HFC had been retained and not to disclose that shows a lamentable attitude to the affirmation that he took to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. In saying what I have about OE I do not believe it was done with anything other than the Husband&#8217;s approval &#8211; this was not an agent going rogue but an agent doing his master&#8217;s bidding.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall Mr Tooth I conclude was the better witness.  He conceded points which supported the meeting likely having taken place.  He remains adamant he cannot recall anything about the meeting, which would be consistent with a short but uninformative meeting. I find it hard to ascertain why Mr Tooth would say he could not recall it if he could and why he would not have declined to act.  As a solicitor with 50 years' practice and with the reputation he has, what is one client more or less, why risk your reputation, indeed potentially more, if he was found to have misled the Court over the matter?</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the balance of probabilities, I do not find that any confidential material was imparted to Raymond Tooth or that any privileged information or advice arises.  On balance I do not accept that the meeting was anything like that described by OE.  I conclude that it was a very brief meeting which perhaps OE was attending to complete the job of going around the firms he had been instructed to with the parallel intention to conflict them. Whilst I cannot determine precisely, or even fairly closely, what was said and how the meeting developed, I conclude at most it may have been more in the nature of a brief and theoretical discussion, rather than the detailed, fact heavy, assets discussed, advice heavy meeting that OE seeks to portray.  Mr Tooth described how some meetings were more general, about the law and how his position might depend on how the client put matters to him.  It might of course have been far less than that, a perfunctory and very brief meeting which contained nothing of substance.</p>

The application for an injunction is dismissed.</p>
