On that occasion I heard evidence under oath from the three grandparents.  I gave them the clearest warning that if I found them to be in contempt of court, there was a high degree of likelihood that I would impose a custodial sentence because any breach concerning such a young child would be a grave contempt of court.  </span></p>

The Local Authority are involved because of concerns they have about the longstanding drug abuse of both parents.  The child was permitted to live with her mother at the grandparents' home on the basis that that may afford some degree of protection to the child, and she would not be exposed to drug taking by either one of her parents or that she would not be at risk of harm in their care if and when they were under the influence of drugs.  </span></p>

Part of that obligation was that the grandparents should take all steps within their control to ensure that Farah is returned immediately to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  </span></p>

He saw a car.  He became aware that his son-in-law was in that car.  He asked his daughter where she was going, and she told him that she was going to meet with the social workers.  He said he presumed that his granddaughter was in the car with her father.  What has now come to light, and what he did not tell me, was that on Friday 24 January, he arranged, by Western Union money transfer, to send the sum of &#163;500 to his daughter in Barcelona in Spain.  I was further told today that yesterday, the day after the hearing last before me, the maternal grandmother sent a further sum of &#163;500 to their daughter in Barcelona.  The grandfather told me in evidence today that not only did he see his daughter leaving the house, he helped her fold the child's buggy so that it could be placed in the taxi.  He did not tell me that on Wednesday.  He did not, in the account that he gave to me today, tell me initially that his daughter had told him that they were going to see the social worker.  He only gave that account when reminded of it by me.  What he told me today was that his daughter told him:  "Everything has been sorted and we're going".  He did not tell me that on Wednesday.  </span></p>

He told me on Wednesday, and maintained it today, that at no time did he see his granddaughter, he just presumed she was in the taxi with her father.  But when I asked him when did he discover the child was not at home, he could not answer and said he did not know - this being the child that he had, on Wednesday and today, described as their precious gift.  I simply cannot believe and do not accept that if the grandfather did not know the child was in the car, the first thing he would have done on returning to the house was to look to see where the baby was - their precious gift.  </span></p>

I take the view that in sending that money, especially yesterday, the grandparents are flouting the order that was made by Russell J on 24 January, because they are not taking all steps they can to secure the return, they are taking steps positively to support their daughter and son-in-law and granddaughter live in Barcelona.  </span></p>

Yet when pressed by Mr.&#160;Jarman, counsel for the Local Authority, repeatedly he said he could not remember what he spoke to his daughter about just yesterday.  He was evasive and defensive in his answers and I do not believe him.  He claimed that the maternal grandmother was in an adjoining room during the course of this conversation.  He did not tell her their daughter was on the telephone.  He did not think he needed to, he said.  Again, I do not believe him and he is lying.  </span></p>

I asked him why, when given that alleged explanation, he did not ask his daughter why they were taking the baby with them at three o'clock in the morning.  He could not answer, despite being given repeated opportunities to do so.  </span></p>

I was told, both by the grandfather on Wednesday and today, and by the grandmother on Wednesday, that they and the paternal grandmother have regular conversations with their daughter and their son-in-law by Skype.  They spoke with them by Skype last night.  They will speak to them by Skype this evening.  They are content for the Local Authority and others to be present during that Skype conversation.  That is all well and good, and I trust it takes place with the social worker and/or other professionals present.  </span></p>

He claims not to recall, or be confused about, the events of 16 January and other occasions.  Again, I&#160;do not believe him.  I do not believe that this grandfather would not clearly remember the events of 16 January.  Given my findings in respect of the grandfather and his evidence, I consider him to be a totally unreliable witness and to be a dishonest one.  He has lied to me repeatedly on serious matters.  I ask myself rhetorically:  what reasons might he have for lying?  There is, in my judgment, only one reason why he is lying, and that is to protect his daughter and to prevent their whereabouts being discovered and, most importantly of all, the baby, Farah, being returned to this jurisdiction.  I am satisfied so that I am sure that the grandfather is lying.  I am satisfied so that I am sure that he knows the location of the mother, the father and the child.  I am satisfied so that I am sure that he is withholding highly material evidence from this court.  Accordingly, I have not the slightest hesitation in finding him to be in contempt of court.  That is my judgment.</span></p>
