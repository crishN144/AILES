The parties are both French nationals, the father having been born in Paris and the mother in Haiti.  The children are also all French nationals and French is their primary language.  The family lived together in France until July 2012 when they removed to this country.  The parents&#8217; relationship came to an end in March 2013 and the mother applied to the court in this country for permission to remove the children from the jurisdiction here to live with her back in France.  An order was made by a district judge on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2013 recording that the parties were agreed about the new location once a house had been bought in France for the family.  In August 2014 the mother and the children moved back to live in France.  The father accepts that thereafter the children were habitually resident in France. </span></p>

Prior to the children&#8217;s departure to England, and over the first few days after their arrival, the parties engaged in a lengthy email exchange arguing about a range of matters.  Translations of all the relevant emails have been put before me.  Initially, they argued about whether the father could keep the children for two further days.  It was the mother&#8217;s request that he do so;  the father refused.  The mother asked again;  the father refused again.  In so doing, he alluded to the fact that he was paying what he described as an &#8220;enormous amount of maintenance&#8221;.  </span></p>
