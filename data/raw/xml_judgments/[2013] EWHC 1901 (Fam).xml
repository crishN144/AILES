He was conceived after his mother (Ms M) met his biological father (Mr F) on an internet website where Mr F was advertising his services as an unpaid sperm donor.  The central dispute between the mother and the father is whether the conception was the result of artificial insemination (as he says) or sexual intercourse (as she says).  If conception was the result of sexual intercourse (known as natural intercourse or NI) Mr F will be the legal parent of the child, but if it was the result of artificial insemination (AI) the question of parentage depends on the effect of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref>.</span></p>

After a very short time Mr H, who never sat down, left and Ms M and Mr H went to Mr F&#8217;s nearby flat where he provided her with sperm with which to inseminate herself.  Ms M says that in the process Mr F attempted to seduce her but that he desisted.  In the month afterwards, arguments between Ms M and Mr H continued.</span></p>

Happily, many children are born to individuals or couples who have faced challenges in conceiving.  Some births follow treatment at licensed clinics and others originate from informal arrangements.  Either way, those involved must often be confronted by profound feelings and powerful forces.  These include, relevantly to this case, a yearning for children, a need for friendship and a hunger for sex, forces that can overpower and defeat routine social conventions. </span></p>

Even in the field of regulated fertility treatment there are clear examples: laboratory error (</span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16998996"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust v A</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> [</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt">2003] 1 FLR 1091; incorrect clinic procedure (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Re E &amp; F</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1418" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1418 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1418 (Fam)</ref>); deception (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Re R (a Child)(IVF: Paternity of Child)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 AC 621" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 AC 621</ref>).  Nonetheless, regulation is broadly successful in protecting participants from exploitation and from health risks, while providing some certainty about legal relationships.  Codes of Practice limit the number of times a person can donate sperm: in this country a donor can normally donate to a maximum of 10 families (see HFEA donation policy).  In comparison, participants in informal arrangements have to judge all risks for themselves.  They may not be in a good position to do so.  Those seeking to conceive may be in a vulnerable state and not all donors are motivated by altruism.  </span></p>

The website in this case (which I will not name as it has not participated in the proceedings) is a case in point.  It charges not inconsiderable fees to those looking for donors while projecting a rose-tinted account of successful, problem-free conception.  It supplies a document entitled &#8216;Donor Agreement&#8217; that purports to record agreement that the donor will have no rights in relation to the child and that the mother </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">and the child</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> will have no rights against the donor in any circumstances.

It has taken a high toll on the well-being of each of the adults and has threatened Mr F&#8217;s career.  The costs are enormous.  The parties have spent almost &#163;300,000 in legal fees: in round numbers, Mr F &#163;200,000, Mr H &#163;13,000 and Ms M &#163;81,000 (of which &#163;61,000 relates to the period since she became legally aided on 1 May 2013).</span></p>

I found him to be a generally reliable witness and I accept his evidence in almost every respect.  He did not want to have children at his age, but was swept along by his wife&#8217;s wishes.  Once Mr F came onto the scene, he was effectively out of his depth, and powerless in the face of what developed into an intense extramarital affair.  His only decisive intervention was to insist upon Ms M having a termination, a stance he now regrets.  After the breakdown of the marriage, Mr H has remained on reasonably amicable terms with Ms M, but I do not accept the suggestion that he has tailored his evidence in her favour.</span></p>

Most of these contacts had to be kept secret from the other women involved.  The sheer logistical challenge alongside his professional life will have been a burden that he would have been likely to have laid down if he had not been driven on by some degree of compulsion.  He even kept up and refreshed a posting on a different website, from which he never received any custom over a period of years, and despite the volume of applications the main website was reliably producing. </span></p>

Nor does the reverse burden of proof dilute the meaning of consent itself.   Insofar as this is in any way hard on Mr F, who could for a short while at the beginning have been forgiven for believing that he was going to be meeting a united couple, it should be borne in mind that he made no effort whatever to find out what Mr H actually thought when they very briefly met.

It went almost without saying, although the circuit judge chose to say it, that the optimum outcome of the contact application could be determined only by reference to the findings made at the fact-finding hearing; but the effect of the direction for a separate fact-finding hearing was that the costs incurred by the mother in relation to that hearing can confidently be seen to be wholly referable to her allegations against the father. There was, in that sense, a ring fence around that hearing and thus around the costs referable to it.

He remarked that issues of fact arose in most disputed cases in relation to children and that his decision in the instant case should not be taken as an indication that it was appropriate to make an order for costs in the vast run of such cases. He held, however, that the mother's case fell into "a separate and unusual category". It was devoted exclusively to consideration of the serious and relevant allegations made by the mother against the father, most of which were established.

It is easier to see unreasonableness where the central issue is one of pure fact and when the untruthful party knows very well what he or she is doing, or where a local authority has been guilty of misconduct, as in </span><a href="http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed79507"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">G v E and Manchester City Council and F</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#160;<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/3385" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 3385 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 3385 (Fam)</ref></span></a><span style="font-size:12pt">.  In contrast, in a welfare determination, the court should be ready to entertain genuine arguments about a child&#8217;s welfare, even if one view must in the end prevail.  The range of reasonable approaches may be wide and in normal circumstances, it will not be appropriate to describe the approach of the unsuccessful party as having been reprehensible or significantly unreasonable.  But the underlying principle for an award of costs is the same, even though the circumstances in which it must be applied will differ.  For a recent example of an order for costs against an unreasonable litigant in contact proceedings, see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Re G (Children) </span><span style="font-size:12pt">CA (CIv) 9 July 2013.</span></p>

In the case of Mr F, he bears the lion&#8217;s share of responsibility for the proceedings happening at all.  As early as November 2011, he claimed that the conception was by AI and that accordingly he was not the child&#8217;s parent.  But while this was the big lie, Ms M for her part increased the complexity and cost of the case by her lesser lies.    </span></p>

Ms M&#8217;s campaign began in July 2011, some months before legal proceedings were signaled and issued, and her approach undoubtedly put Mr F on the defensive.  However, while this may reduce Mr F&#8217;s responsibility for costs, it cannot extinguish it: despite the difficulties, he should have told the truth and, if he had, most of the costs would not have been incurred.  </span></p>

Mr H has been a victim of both his former wife and of Mr F but has chosen to apply for a costs order against Mr F alone.  I do not believe that it would be just to increase Mr F&#8217;s liability to pay Mr H&#8217;s costs by selecting the indemnity basis for assessment.  </span></p>

However, he is entitled to a discount in the light of Ms M's own misconduct.  I consider that in round terms a reduction of one quarter is appropriate.  By coincidence, some three-quarters of Ms M&#8217;s cost have been occurred since she became legally aided.  In the circumstances of the case, justice will best be done by ordering Mr F to pay her costs from that date, with Ms M bearing her own costs before then.</span></p>
