	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I have noted, the father has not attended the final hearing and is not represented before the court.  This reflects a pro-longed pattern of non-engagement by the father in these proceedings.  The father did appear before this court by way of video link from prison on 19 June 2020.  At that hearing I made clear to the father the steps he needed to take in order to engage with the proceedings and directed that he provide a statement of evidence by 31 August 2020 addressing each of the mother&#8217;s applications, the father having stated he intended to seek legal advice upon his release from prison. Notwithstanding the father&#8217;s stated intention to secure legal advice and, indeed, to pursue his own application for a child arrangements order, none of the directions given by the court were complied with by the father.  The father failed to attend a hearing before this court on 5 October 2020 despite the solicitor for the child having written to the father with a copy of the order of 19 June 2020 explaining the directions made by the court.  The father has also failed to comply with further directions made by the court on 5 October 2020 with a view to facilitating his participation in these proceedings.  He has been served with the application of the Children&#8217;s Guardian for an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </p>

During that telephone call the solicitor for the child re-iterated to the father the directions that had been made by the court, including direction that he provide a statement to the court, and reminded him of the date of this final hearing.  The solicitor for the child also advised the father to take independent legal advice.  The solicitor for the child confirmed all of this in an email to the father on 1 March 2021.  Despite the solicitor for the child emailing the father again on 9 March 2021 and writing to him at the address he gave to the solicitor on 1 March 2021 on 11 March 2021, the father has made no further contact, has not </p>

I am satisfied that the father has had proper notice of this hearing, that he has been provided with the notice of the applications and the relevant documents and that he is well aware of the opportunity the court has provided him to file evidence in this matter.  The father has not contacted the court to advance any reasons for his non-attendance.  Within this context, I am satisfied that it is reasonable to conclude that the father either knows, and has accepted, the consequences of this final hearing proceeding in his absence or that he is indifferent to the same.  Further, in circumstances where the father failed to attend previous hearings before this court and has not answered the correspondence sent to him by the solicitor for the child at the email and postal addresses the father <span style="font-style:italic">himself</span> supplied, I am satisfied that a further adjournment would not be likely to secure the attendance of the father.   </p>

By contrast, I am satisfied that significant prejudice would result for both G and the mother were this matter to be further adjourned.  These proceedings have now been ongoing for some 18 months, with significant delay caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic and by the non-engagement of the father.  It is plain from the papers that this delay has strained the mother&#8217;s psychological wellbeing and that G is aware of her mother&#8217;s concerns and anxiety.  It is well beyond time for these proceedings to be resolved and for G to benefit from some certainty with respect to her future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is plain from the material before the court that the father has a significant offending history.  On 25 July 2014 the had father received a caution for pursuing a course of conduct amounting to harassment for sending 500 text messages in 24 hours to the mother, some of which caused her distress. On 28 October 2015 the father was accused of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm by using a vehicle to assault a person, resulting in injury.  During 2015 the father also came under investigation for sexual offences against a child.  Within that latter context, and on the advice of police and Children&#8217;s Services, the mother stopped contact between the father and G and moved home with G.  Within this context, the father has had no contact with G since 18 July 2015, when G was 2 years old and has not exercised parental responsibility for her during that time.  G now has no recollection of her father. </p>

The father was found to have groomed a 14 year old girl and tried to have a sexual relationship with her in full knowledge of her young age.  Police records indicate that when the father became aware that the victim had made known the sexual abuse the father contacted the victim and made threats towards her.  The father was sentenced to two years imprisonment and made the subject of a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.  On the same day the father was convicted of dangerous driving and battery, having punched a female victim to the face and driven his car at that female victim.  In discussions with the Children&#8217;s Guardian more recently, the father sought to justify his sexual offending by asserting that his victim had claimed to be older than she was and that he had not realised that she was, in fact, only 14 years old. </p>

The Facebook entry included a statement that the father wished for his ex-partner to be chopped up or her head removed, albeit the father asserted to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that he was not responsible for that part of the post.  Whilst accepting this conduct was wrong, the father was not able to articulate for the Children&#8217;s Guardian why he pursued such a course of conduct.

With respect to children the risk arises specifically in respect of those children aged between 13 and 15 years of age.  The nature of the risk presented by the father is that of sexual grooming and involving a girl in sexual activity with concomitant emotional and psychological harm.  The Probation Officer considers that the degree of harm would depend on the extent to which the father was able to exercise power over, or influence or manipulate the victim.   </p>

The Probation Officer advises that there is, in this context, the potential for serious harm. The report of the father&#8217;s Offender Manager dated 11 March 2020 concludes that, in the context of his most recent conviction for harassment of a former intimate partner, the father presents a medium risk of serious harm. As I have noted, the father has failed to attend court to challenge the foregoing evidence.  There is no evidence before the court to demonstrate that the father has engaged in any therapeutic of other work designed to address his offending behaviour or to reduce the risks he has been assessed to present towards adolescent children and former female partners.   </p>

Neither do I believe that this could be safely managed without potentially compromising the safety of [the mother] or G at any time in the foreseeable future and in fact the risks of doing so would increase, given his criminal profile, as G approaches adolescence.  I therefore believe that the previous Child Arrangements Order needs to be discharged as there is no realistic prospect of any contact or any sort taking place through her childhood and the court should consider making an order for no contact&#8221; </p>

Within this context, Ms Lennon submits that the change of name proposed by the mother is reflection of reality and that, time having passed, to suddenly be known by a different surname would not be in G&#8217;s best interests.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian does however highlight a concern that support will need to be available for G to assist her to deal with the longer term issues of identity arising out of the fact that she has no relationship with and has, to date, been given no information with respect to the father.  Whilst the mother asserts that she will source professional guidance when it becomes apparent that the same is required, the Children&#8217;s Guardian is concerned about the lack of such resources in the area in which the mother and G reside. </p>

However, through Ms Lennon, the Children&#8217;s Guardian now accepted that the test is in fact that articulated in this judgment below.  The Position Statement of the Children&#8217;s Guardian was provided to the father at a hearing on 20 June 2020 which the father attended.

It is clear from the arguments which have been advanced in the courts below and even to some extent your Lordships' House that the father and mother see the present dispute largely in such terms. They are mistaken. Once the dispute has arisen, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. The attitude and views of the individual parents are only relevant insofar as they may affect the conduct of those persons and therefore indirectly affect the welfare of the child.&#8221; </p>

Accordingly, factors that may be said to have significance by analogy or on the facts of a particular case, for example, the factors that the court considers within the overarching question of welfare upon an application for a parental responsibility order (the degree of commitment which the father has shown to the child, the degree of attachment which exists between the father and the child and the reasons of the father for applying for the order) may be relevant on the facts of a particular case but are not to be taken to be a substitute test to be applied (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Parental Responsibility Order)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/969" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 969" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 969</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 339" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 339</ref>, at paras [15] and [16]). </p>

He obtains it in accordance with the statutory scheme and may lose it in the same way. In both circumstances it is the welfare of the child that creates the presumption, not the parenthood of the unmarried father. The concept of rival presumptions is not helpful, although I entirely accept that the fact of parenthood raises the welfare question, hence the right of a parent (with or without parental responsibility) to make an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> without permission (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 10(4)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>). There is also ample case-law describing the imperative in favour of a continuing relationship between both parents and a child so that ordinarily a child's upbringing should be provided by both of his parents and where that is not in the child's interests by one of them with the child having the benefit of a meaningful relationship with both. A judge would not be criticised for identifying that, as a very weighty, relevant factor, the significance of the parenthood of an unmarried father should not be under estimated.&#8221; </p>

Within this context, any decision of the court that maintained an obligation to promote contact between G and the father, which maintained that part of G&#8217;s surname that derives from the name of the father and/or that maintained the father&#8217;s parental responsibility for G would necessarily involve, particularly with respect to contact and her surname and either now or in relatively short order, a significant change to G&#8217;s current circumstances, namely the introduction of G to the fact that she has a father and to his identity and the commencement of contact with a person she knows nothing of and has never met and the use of a surname she knows nothing of and has never used.  These would be very significant changes for G.  Further, such changes in G&#8217;s circumstances would bring with them the need for challenging and potentially destabilising and disrupting conversations with G regarding those changed circumstances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within the latter context, in my judgment a further significant factor in this case is that whilst the father has on a number of occasions expressed his opposition to the applications made by the mother, and evinced an intention to apply for a child arrangements order, he has in fact taken no positive steps to oppose the applications of the mother or to pursue applications designed to secure his involvement in G&#8217;s life, despite being given ample opportunity by the court to do so.  In particular, notwithstanding the repeated direction of the court, the father has presented no evidence in opposition to the court, has not attended this final hearing and has not issued an application for a child arrangement order under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Within this context, the very marked change of circumstances summarised in the foregoing paragraph, and the concomitant need for challenging and potentially destabilising and disrupting conversations with G by way of explanation, would necessarily take place without any guarantee that the father would thereafter engage with G or maintain any or any consistent involvement in her life. </p>

Whilst I accept that the risk assessments available to the court were conducted over 12 months ago, there is no evidence before the court that the father has, either whilst serving sentences of imprisonment or since his release from his last period of incarceration, engaged in any therapeutic or other relevant interventions to address his history of criminal behaviour or the risks he has been assessed as posing to adolescent children and former partners as recently as March last year.

I am further satisfied on the basis of the father&#8217;s offending history and the risk assessments available to the court that the risk of harm he presents to G is likely to increase as she reaches adolescence and the risk harm to the mother is unlikely to decrease from its present level absent work by the father in circumstances where the mother falls into the category of an ex-partner.  In addition, I am satisfied, having regard to the nature and extent of the father&#8217;s past conduct towards the mother and other former partners, as evidenced by the father&#8217;s caution and convictions, that the latter risk is likely to be significantly exacerbated by any difficulties that were to arise in respect of contact were a child arrangements order to be made, or in respect of decisions relating to G&#8217;s upbringing were the father to retain parental responsibility for G and therefore require to be consulted in respect of such decisions. </p>

I have also borne very carefully in mind that, as now reflected in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>(2A) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, it is presumed in the interests of a child whose parents are separated that he or she should have contact with the parent with whom he or she is not living.  However, it is also clear that that obligation is not absolute and that that presumption is a rebuttable one, having regard to the totality of the evidence before the court. In this case, as I have found above, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that G has no relationship with and is at present unaware of the identity of her father, that the father has taken no steps, either in these proceedings or at all, to seek orders facilitating such a relationship and that the father at present constitutes a significant risk of sexual and emotional harm to G and of emotional and physical harm to the mother, which risk remains entirely unmitigated by acknowledgment by the father and therapeutic or other intervention consequent upon such an acknowledgment.   </p>

Having regard to the terms of PD12J, in the foregoing context I am in particular satisfied that an order for contact would expose G to an unmanageable risk of sexual and emotional harm.  Having regard to the nature and extent of that risk of harm, as indicated by the father&#8217;s criminal history and the risks assessments before the court and the father&#8217;s failure to date to undertake any work to mitigate those risks, I cannot be satisfied that the physical and emotional safety of G and the mother could, as far as possible, be secured before, during and after contact.   Further, having regard the nature of the father&#8217;s offences, certain of the statements he made to the Children&#8217;s Guardian regarding the same and the father&#8217;s failure to file evidence in or to otherwise engage in these proceedings, I cannot be satisfied that the father is motivated by a desire to promote the best interests of the child rather than using the process to continue a form of control over the mother.  </p>

I am further mindful that registration of her name represents acknowledgment of the formal biological link that exists between G and the father.  However, whilst always relevant and important considerations, these factors are not in themselves decisive.  This is particularly the case where there has been a very significant changes of circumstances for G since the original registration as set out above.  Within this context, I am satisfied that less weight attaches in this case to the fact that G was registered with a surname that incorporates the father&#8217;s surname and that registration represents acknowledgment of the formal biological link that exists between G and the father.  Further in this case, having regard to the evidence before the court I am satisfied that there are a range of countervailing reasons which point to a change of surname being in G&#8217;s best interests having regard to her welfare as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. </p>

G clearly identifies as being an &#8216;D&#8217; and considers her family to be that of her mother and her extended maternal family. In the circumstances, the change sought by the mother reflects the reality that has been in place for G for as long, or almost as long as she has understood the concept of having a name, with that part of the surname that she derives from the father being unknown to her, and accordingly holding no meaning for her at this time.  In this case the mother and the father are not married to each other and, in the circumstances, it is the mother who had control over the registration of G&#8217;s birth.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the lack of commitment demonstrated by the father to G as evidenced by his lack of engagement in these proceedings, the absence of any contact between G and her father since 2015 and the absence of any exercise by the father of his parental responsibility for G since that date are all factors that point to a change of G&#8217;s surname being in her best interests.   </p>

Within context of the rural community in which G resides, in which the father&#8217;s surname is not a common one, and the notorious nature of a number of the crimes committed by the father that have been the subject of some publicity, I am satisfied that retaining a surname that incorporates that of the father does place G at an appreciable a risk of being stigmatised by association in the future. Whilst not determinative as a factor, I do consider that this is a factor that the court is entitled to, and should take into account in the particular circumstances of this case having regard to the totality of the evidence before the court as a factor weighing in favour of allowing the mother&#8217;s application to change G&#8217;s surname as being in her best interests.    </p>

There is no evidence before the court demonstrating an attachment between the father and G.  Indeed, G has no memory of her father by reason of the termination of contact consequent upon the father&#8217;s sexual offending.  Likewise, there is no evidence before the court that the father has demonstrated the level of commitment to G that would support the making of a parental responsibility order.  First, the father engaged in offending behaviour that was entirely antithetic to his continued safe and consistent involvement in G&#8217;s upbringing and the exercise of parental responsibility for her. Second, the father has taken no steps since his convictions to address his offending behaviour or the risk he has been assessed to continue to present to adolescent children and former partners so as to permit safe contact and relationship building with G.  I am satisfied that this speaks to a lack of commitment on the part of the father to his daughter.  That conclusion is reinforced in my judgment by the fact that, third, within these proceedings the father has failed to engage, including failing </p>

In addition to these matters, having regard to the nature of the father&#8217;s convictions, and the risk assessments that are before the court, I am satisfied that were he to have parental responsibility for G there is a significant risk he would seek to use it to seek to control the mother in context of his historic harassment of her and other former partners.   In circumstances where the mother would have to consult the father with respect to decision making for G if he had parental responsibility, having regard to the conduct for which the father has been convicted and cautioned and the risks identified that the father has in no way taken steps to mitigate I am further satisfied that this would be intolerable for the mother and would act to destabilise her, with a concomitant impact on the stability, safety and security of G.   </p>

It is important to acknowledge that the father does not in this case have a history of making unmeritorious applications in this case. Whilst he has consistently opposed the applications made by the mother but failed to file and serve evidence in opposition, and has stated an intention to make an application but has not done so, these matters are not by themselves generally sufficient to justify an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.

It is plain that, absent the father taking steps to acknowledge and address that assessed level of risk by engaging in therapeutic or other remedial work, any application he makes for a child arrangements order will inevitably face significant hurdles.  Against this, the impact of such an unmeritorious application on the wellbeing of the mother, and hence the security and stability of G is likely to be considerable in light of the matters I have set out in this judgment.  Within this context, in my judgment it would not be in G&#8217;s best interests for the father to be able to issue an application for a child arrangements order without first being required to demonstrate to the court through the mechanism of a permission application that he has taken the steps that are, on the evidence before the court, the obvious precursor to such application having a chance of success.  Absent this step, there is plainly a risk, particularly in light of the father&#8217;s convictions for harassment, that G will be disturbed needlessly by applications that have minimal chance of success because the father has </p>
