	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I have before me an application by Suffolk County Council for the committal to prison for alleged contempt of court of Kaine Hancock.  The allegations arise in the context of an order made on 3 April 2014 by Eleanor King J, as she then was. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The background, which is uncontroversial, is that on 20 August 2013 His Honour Judge Newton, as he then was, sitting at Ipswich County Court, as it then was, made final care and placement orders in relation to Mr. Hancock's son.  Mr. Hancock's attempts to challenge those orders foundered when, on 12 December 2013, Moore-Bick LJ refused him permission to appeal.  Thereafter, Mr. Hancock appears to have mounted a campaign of complaint about what had happened in the proceedings.  Specifically, on or about 27 or 28 February 2014 Mr. Hancock sent copies of a DVD to the local authority's offices.  I shall refer to that as "the DVD".  No doubt as a consequence of that, Eleanor King J made the order to which I have referred.  For the purposes of the application which I am considering at this stage in the proceedings, it suffices to indicate that para.2(b) of that order, referring to the DVD, prohibited Mr. Hancock from making the DVD, or anything on it, public in any way.</span></p>

The local authority's case is that that link was posted by Mr. Hancock and that the material he posted comprised, if not the DVD, then material on the DVD, sufficient in either case to constitute breach of para.2(b) of the injunction.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The evidence by the local authority in relation to this and other aspects of this application comes from a senior social work manager, Mr. David Francis Jacobs.  For present purposes, it is relevant to note that he has sworn two affidavits, the first on 6 March 2015 and the second on 4 June 2015.  In the first of those affidavits Mr. Jacobs, basing himself, as he told me in his oral evidence this morning, on notes he made at the time, and at a time when events were fresh in his mind, summarised what it was that he saw when he viewed the videolink on 14 February 2015.  In his second affidavit he contrasts that note of what he says he saw when he viewed the videolink with the DVD.  The reason for the exercise taking that form is that whereas the DVD is still in existence, the link has been removed.</span></p>

He has identified that in certain, as it seems to me minor, respects there may be discrepancies in relation to the fine detail of Mr. Jacobs' evidence.  But as to the substance, and taking at its highest in favour of Mr. Hancock the matters in relation to which Mr. Jacobs' evidence could be criticised, the fact remains that as to the substance, even if not in every point of fine detail, Mr. Jacobs' evidence seems to me at this stage to stand largely unaffected.  As to the substance, his comparison of the link and the DVD has survived the attack made upon his recollection.  The consequence is that since, in accordance with the relevant paragraph of the order, it is not necessary for the local authority to prove complete identity between the DVD and the videolink but only to prove that the videolink contained material on the DVD (see the words, "He shall not make the DVD, or anything on it"), the substance of the local authority's case remains unaffected.</span></p>

He has not specifically addressed me in relation to the second part of the defence on this count, namely, that there is no evidence linking Mr. Hancock with the person, whoever it may be, who put the videolink up.  However, the two are connected in this way.  Part of the local authority's case that Mr. Hancock is the person responsible for putting the videolink on the Facebook page is based upon the fact, as it would have it, that the link bears a striking similarity, in substance if not in every minute particular, with the DVD.  </span></p>

What my conclusion will be at the end of the case is, of course, entirely a different matter.  At present I am simply concerned with the question, "Is there a case fit to go to a trial?"  Recognising, as I do, the high standard proof required, the criminal standard of proof required, is this a case which unchallenged would entitle me as the fact-finder to find the local authority's case proved?  In my judgment, for the reasons I have explained, Mr. Tear has not satisfied me that the case suffers such defects as would entitle me to stop the matter at this stage.  Accordingly, we will proceed.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The matters arise, as I noted in my earlier judgment this morning, out of an order made by Eleanor King J, as she then was, on 3 April 2014.  Para.2(a) and (b) of that order contained injunctions in substance prohibiting Mr. Hancock from showing or making public a certain DVD or anything on it and, more particularly, from making public either papers relating to or the identity of his son, the subject of the underlying proceedings.  Paras.2(c) and 2(d) of that order restrained him from assaulting, threatening, intimidating, harassing or pestering employees of Suffolk County Council.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The five charges against him are, first, that he made certain comments on the public Facebook page of a Member of Parliament which identified his son by name.  The second allegation is that in breach of para.2(b) of the order he posted on the public Facebook page of the same MP, and thereby made public, a publically accessible link to the contents of the DVD.  The third allegation arises out of an outburst which took place immediately after I had left this court on the occasion of the last hearing on 20 May 2015.  I had no sooner left the court than Mr. Hancock started verbally abusing Mr. David Jacobs, the local authority's senior manager, who is the primary witness against him, that being, it is asserted and accepted, a breach of paras.2(c) and 2(d) of the order.  The fourth complaint charges precisely the same conduct as being in any event a contempt of court irrespective of whether it was a breach of the order.  The fifth complaint relates to, as it were, a prolongation of that particular outburst when, having left the court room, Mr. Hancock, in the court corridor outside, used threatening language to the MP's assistant.  That is not alleged to be, and is not, a breach of Eleanor King J's order.  But it is as a matter of principle plainly capable of being contempt of court.  She was vilified because she had given evidence in the case and a threat was made that, "I'm going to get a man to come to your office and sort you out".</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Tear on behalf of Mr. Hancock has suggested that in certain aspects, paras.2(a) and 2(b) of the relevant order are expressed more widely than is perhaps appropriate in the light of certain authorities.  Whether or not that is the case, Mr. Tear, of course, has to accept that it cannot amount to any defence, nor indeed, as it seems to me, more than fleetingly to any mitigation for a contempt of court.  The rule of law and civilised behaviour requires that there be, as the authorities make clear there is, an absolute unqualified obligation on everybody to obey an order of the court even if the order was wrongly made, the remedy being to apply to have the order varied or discharged.</span></p>

On 8 July 2014, Moor J found Mr. Hancock guilty of various contempts of a nature not dissimilar to those with which I am concerned today, in relation to which Moor J imposed an immediate custodial sentence, which in the aggregate amounted to a sentence of three months.  After approximately five weeks Mr. Hancock applied successfully to purge his contempt.  He described to the psychiatrist the unpleasantness of his experience on that occasion.  </span></p>

However, it can be said by way of mitigation that it has not been asserted by the local authority that any of that material has come to the attention of his son or that it has in any other way had a discernible impact upon his son.  That may be Mr. Hancock's good fortune but it is a powerful mitigating feature.  It applies to each of the first two charges.</span></p>

It would plainly be wholly wrong to sentence Mr. Hancock separately on each of those two matters, and since in relation to each of them the maximum sentence is the same, it is largely a matter of indifference whether he is sentenced on the one or the other.  So I treat those as being a single matter.  That single matter relating to Mr. Jacobs is, of course, closely linked both in time and place with the final matter, which is the verbal attack on the MP's assistant.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So far as those matters are concerned, the aggravating feature in relation to the verbal attack on Mr. Jacobs is that it was, as Mr. Hancock accepts, a plain breach of the order and, in any event, an outrageous way to behave in a court, whether or not the judge is still in the courtroom.  In a sense, the matter in relation to the MP's assistant is even worse because &#8211; and there has been no challenge to her evidence &#8211; it was not merely vilification of somebody because she was a witness, it was the uttering of a threat by way of trying to intimidate the witness, the threat being, "I'm going to get a man to come to your office and sort you out".  On the other hand, it is the fact, as I find, readily explicable in the light of the psychiatrist's report, that these were unplanned, unpremeditated, impromptu outbursts in relation to which, as I also find, Mr. Hancock very promptly made apologies, both to the court and to his victims, the following day.  It may be no thanks to him, and on the contrary, an indication of their magnanimity, that those apologies have to a significant extent been accepted by his victims.</span></p>

People have to obey the law, people have to comply with orders of the court, and if they do not do so, particularly in relation to breaches as serious as these, they can expect, especially if, as in the present case, it is the second time that the court has had to consider such breaches, not merely a custodial sentence but a custodial sentence which is immediately put into execution.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In relation to Mr. Hancock's behaviour in the courtroom and outside the courtroom, it was outrageous.  People who are lawfully in courts doing their jobs, as in the case of Mr. Jacobs, or attending the court as a witness, as in the case of the MP's assistant, are entitled to do so without fearing that they may be the subject of some verbal or other assault.  If that outburst had involved physical violence, Mr. Hancock needs to be in no doubt at all that I would be adopting a more stringent and less merciful approach.  The fact is it was, as I have said, unplanned and unpremeditated.  It was, albeit a very unpleasant and deeply offensive verbal attack, only a verbal attack, it did not involve physical violence, and there was a very prompt and, so far as I can see, and this would accord with my reading of the psychiatric report, a genuine apology.</span></p>

It is a fact that there are not available to the civil courts the community orders which I see might be appropriate for lower range breaches of protective orders in the criminal jurisdiction.  Be that as it may, this is not the first time.  These are significant breaches.  They are of their nature directed in their potential impact to a child, and they are aggravated in relation to the third, fourth and fifth by the fact that they were taking place in a court building.  It seems to me that a custodial sentence is unavoidable, both to bring home to Mr. Hancock the seriousness of his conduct and to make clear to others who may be tempted to behave in the same way that behaviour of this sort will not be tolerated.</span></p>

He has also pointed out that, of course, as a general principle of sentencing, one reserves the maximum sentence, which in this case is two years, for the worst conceivable kind of offence and that correspondingly one reserves sentences approaching the maximum for cases of very considerable gravity.  It is Mr. Hancock's good fortune that my sentencing powers are limited to two years, not merely two years per count but two years in the aggregate, because I cannot on one occasion impose an aggregate sentence amounting to more than two years.  So two years sets the upper limit of the bracket.</span></p>

I do not propose to sentence, for the reasons I have given, in relation to count 3.  In relation to counts 4 and 5, the appropriate sentence is in each case three months' imprisonment, those sentences to run concurrently with each other and with the sentences on the first and second counts.  It seems to me that a sentence of less than three months for behaviour of this kind would send completely the wrong message to Mr. Hancock and others tempted to behave in a similar way.  </span></p>

My reason for doing so in part is this.  It seems to me that the imperative objective which the court should be striving for in this kind of situation is to ensure as best it can that there is no repetition in future of the unacceptable behaviour.  That particular requirement in a case involving a child comes, if anything, ahead of the obligation of the court simply to uphold the rule of law.  Not least in the light of what I read in the psychiatric report, I have a real concern that if Mr. Hancock was to go immediately to prison, although that would no doubt, to use the common vernacular, put him out of circulation for a while, it would do little, if anything, to lead to a change in behaviour on his part in the future.</span></p>

They will be suspended on terms, on condition that there is no further breach.  The consequence is twofold.  If there is a further breach, if there is further misbehaviour, whether breach of the order or further contempts of court of the kind which we saw on the last occasion here, then there will be two consequences.  If a further breach or breaches are proved, you will be punished for those breaches.  You will in addition find the suspended sentence being activated.  If I can spell out the practical realities, I have quite deliberately taken what I have deliberately described as a merciful course on this occasion.  If there is any repetition, you should not expect that on the next occasion a judge will be persuaded to take the same merciful course.  And therefore your expectation must be that if there is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">any</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> further repetition of this during the course of the next 15 months, however seemingly trivial, you will immediately go to prison for the six months I have ordered, and, in addition, and probably consecutive to that, you will be sentenced, probably to an immediate custodial sentence for a further period.</span></p>

The psychiatric report, as I say, is insightful.  Some of it, I suspect, makes very painful reading for you, but it does seem to me, as I have said, to put its finger on important aspects of your character and personality which go to the question of can you behave yourself in future.  It is very much in your interest that, if you can access professional help to assist you with those matters, you do so.</span></p>
