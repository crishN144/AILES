	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application made by Ted Jennings seeks a declaration that it is lawful for him to use an embryo created using his sperm and the eggs of his late wife, Fern-Marie Choya, in treatment with a surrogate. The embryo was created in 2018 when Mr Jennings and Ms Choya were undergoing fertility treatment to fulfil their wish to have children of their own. The embryo is currently stored at the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health (&#8216;CRGH&#8217;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Tragically, and without warning, Ms Choya died in February 2019 whilst she was 18 weeks pregnant with twins. There is one remaining embryo which Mr Jennings wishes to use with a surrogate, he says to fulfil their joint wish for this to take place in such circumstances. He accepts there is no written consent by Ms Choya for that to take place but says they were not given sufficient information or opportunity to give that written consent and, if they had been, the court can infer from all the evidence Ms Choya would have given it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application was served on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8216;the HFEA&#8217;) and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (&#8216;the Secretary of State&#8217;). The HFEA is an interested party and has filed evidence from its Chief Executive, Mr Thompson. The Secretary of State decided not to participate in the proceedings.</p>

There was insufficient time on 5 May 2022 for Ms Richards Q.C., on behalf of Mr Jennings, to reply to Ms Gallafent Q.C.&#8217;s submissions on behalf of the HFEA. Directions were made for written responses. Ms Richards filed hers on 20 May 2022 and on 26 May 2022 the HFEA informed the court no further submissions would be made in response on their behalf.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The HFEA oppose the declaration sought on the basis that there was not a valid written consent by Ms Choya at the relevant time to use the remaining embryo in the way sought by the declaration in the event of her death. The statutory scheme requires such consent to be in writing and the HFEA submit Ms Choya had sufficient information and opportunity to give that written consent.</p>

Ms Richards Q.C., Ms Dobson, Ms David and their instructing solicitors all acted pro bono, which I have no doubt greatly assisted Mr Jennings in being able to make this application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jennings and Ms Choya had been in a loving and committed relationship since 2007. They married in 2009 and wanted to have a family of their own. They experienced difficulties in conceiving naturally, sought fertility advice and underwent three cycles of IVF treatment at the Hammersmith Hospital in 2013 and 2014 which were not successful. Ms Choya conceived naturally in 2015 and 2016 but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage due to ectopic pregnancy. Mr Jennings and Ms Choya underwent further cycles of IVF treatment, re-mortgaging their home to fund private treatment at CRGH.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Their final cycle of treatment was in late 2018. At that point they only had one embryo, so prior to the embryo transfer underwent two further batching cycles to acquire more embryos to enable them to have more than one child. Once they had two embryos in storage they proceeded with the single embryo transfer in November 2018. A positive pregnancy with twin girls was confirmed in November 2018. Ms Choya developed complications in her pregnancy at 18 weeks, which resulted in a uterine rupture, and she died on 25 February 2019. It is the remaining embryo that is the subject of this application.</p>

A partner-created embryo is defined as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Embryos created using the gametes of a man and a woman who declare that they have an intimate relationship&#8217;</span> (see paragraph 12 Schedule 3A to the 1990 Act). At section 6.2 the WT form asks whether the woman consents to eggs and embryos being used for training purposes in the event of her death or mental incapacity. It then states, under the heading <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Other uses for your eggs or embryos&#8221;: &#8220;If you wish your eggs or embryos to be used in someone else&#8217;s treatment if you die or become mentally incapacitated, please speak to your clinic for more information.

In the final WT form, dated 21 May 2018, Ms Choya did not consent to embryos created using her eggs being used for training purposes in the event of her death or incapacity. This is because, according to Mr Jennings, she and Mr Jennings had only one normal embryo remaining in storage and it was their intention that this embryo would be used with a surrogate in the event that IVF treatment was unsuccessful. In his statement Mr Jennings states:</p>

Our emotional journey was going from the helplessness of the infertility compounded by the feeling of unjustness given all the other medical issues already faced. We eventually got to the position of accepting that having given IVF our best shot, this would be the last time and the final embryo would be saved for surrogacy.&#8221;</span></p>

She relies upon a number of matters to support that position, namely: (i) The written consent Ms Choya provided to the use of the embryos in treatment services to her and Mr Jennings in accordance with Schedule 3 paragraph 2 (1)(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>. It was not withdrawn and is not automatically revoked on Ms Choya&#8217;s death. (ii) Ms Choya completed the WT form for Mr Jennings, ticking the box to record his consent to the embryos being used in Ms Choya&#8217;s treatment in the event of his death. Ms Richards submits this demonstrates Ms Choya contemplated use of the embryos in the event of one of their deaths. (iii) The evidence that Ms Choya wanted the embryo to be used in treatment with a surrogate in the event their fourth cycle was unsuccessful. This had been discussed between Mr Jennings and Ms Choya, discussed in general terms with Dr Seshadri and discussed with the wider family (which is supported by their statements) and they resolved that if the fourth treatment was unsuccessful they would use the single embryo remaining in storage in treatment with a surrogate.</p>

This case concerned the issue of whether the HFEA had acted lawfully in refusing to permit a mother to export her dead daughter&#8217;s frozen eggs to the United States. Part of the rationale for concluding that decision was flawed was because it failed to take account of evidence (which was not written) of the daughter&#8217;s wishes about posthumous use of her eggs (paragraphs 63 &#8211; 68). The court concluded the HFEA could make appropriate inferences from that evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, Ms Richards submits the only reason Ms Choya did not record her wishes in writing is because she was not given an opportunity to do so. The pro forma WT form created by the HFEA was unclear about what steps were required to enable a man to use partner-created embryos in the event of his wife&#8217;s death. She submits it is not clear from the wording <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;if you wish your eggs or embryos to be used in someone else&#8217;s treatment if you die or become incapacitated, please speak to your clinic for more information&#8217;.</span> This wording lacks clarity if it was referring to the situation where a woman wanted embryos to be used by her partner following her death. The WT form doesn&#8217;t contain an option, like the MT form, for a woman to consent to posthumous use of either her eggs or embryos created using her eggs by her partner. Ms Choya provided consent for the embryo to be used for the purpose in paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 3, however she did not record in writing her wish that it be used in treatment with a surrogate for the purposes of paragraph 2 (1)(b). In his statement Mr Jennings sets out that they were unaware of the need for this step to be done, making it clear that if they had known this needed to be done it would have been done. In any event, Ms Richards submits the form that Ms Choya would have been taken to if she had asked for more information is unsuitable for the situation here. Section 6 of the WSG form (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Woman&#8217;s consent to the use and storage of eggs or embryos for surrogacy&#8221;</span>) is entitled <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In the event of your death or mental capacity&#8221;</span> and then provides a requirement to name the surrogate. Ms Richards submits it is very unclear what form someone in Ms Choya&#8217;s position completes to provide the necessary consent to enable her male partner to use the embryos in the event of her death. She submits there is a gap in the process, there is nothing in the Guidance to tell clinics to explain as a matter of routine to complete the additional forms which results in this case in Ms Choya not being given the proper opportunity to give this consent.</p>

The issue of consent is the cornerstone of the legislation, not the requirement for it to be in writing. The evidence is Ms Choya would have wanted Mr Jennings&#8217; to be able to use the embryo with a surrogate in the event of her death. There is no evidence to the contrary, as a result the application does not seek to get round the requirement for consent or to undermine respect for personal autonomy. The only reason the consent was not recorded in writing was through lack of opportunity caused by the lack of clarity in the HFEA forms and the failure of the clinic to provide the relevant information. If this application was refused the interference with Mr Jennings&#8217; Article 8 rights would be significant; he would lose his only opportunity to realise his joint aim with Ms Choya to have a child together. Finally, there are no sufficiently weighty countervailing interests to justify the significant interference with Mr Jennings&#8217; Article 8 rights. There is no conflict between individual rights and granting the application would not undermine the core objectives of the legislative regime.</p>

In her oral submissions regarding the WT form completed by Ms Choya she submitted section 6 of the form specifically refers to the relevant forms which act as prompts for the clinicians and patients. There are two different types of use, namely donation or surrogacy. When looked at logically there are only two options, donation or surrogacy; the latter can only be for the benefit of the birth partner otherwise it would be donation. She submits the clinic cannot anticipate every situation, there is an obligation on the patients as well. She submits it is clear from this form these options exist. She relies on the evidence from Dr Seshadri that this issue is generally raised as part of the nurse consent consultation and submits that to have all the necessary consents relating to either donation or surrogacy would make the form unwieldy, hence why it is managed by the prompts in the current form.</p>

These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns.

The evidence in this case was that there was no such conversation with the clinic. Dr Seshadri&#8217;s evidence sets out the appointments she had with Mr Jennings and Ms Choya. Her statement deals with the issues of CRGH&#8217;s consent procedure in very generalised terms, referring to the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;consent process will </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">usually</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have at least two stages&#8217;</span> (emphasis added), the first is to provide the information and the second stage involves confirmation that the patient still wants to go ahead, followed by completion of the consent forms. She continues &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">These forms [WT and MT forms] are discussed as part of the nurse consent consultation. I understand from my colleagues that there is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">usually</span><span style="font-style:italic"> some reference to the option of completing additional forms during this consultation, but the take up is very low &#8211; probably because we treat relatively young people in good health. If a patient were to express an interest in the donation of their gametes or embryos in the event of their death, they would be advised that further screening would be necessary because they would be considered a donor and would need to consent and screen in accordance with HFEA donation requirements&#8217;</span> (emphasis added)<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> In dealing with the MT form Dr Seshadri notes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It is much easier for a male patient to consent to the use of their sperm by their partner after their death, as no additional testing is needed and they can consent directly on the MT form&#8217;. </span>There is no statement from the nurse who had any meetings with Mr Jennings or Ms Choya at the relevant time. The written records are as set out in paragraph 14 above, the forms had been completed prior to that appointment and there is no record of any discussion about other forms. This accords with the evidence from Mr Jennings.  He states in relation to this part of the WT form <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There was no confirmation box to tick to say that you had read the paragraph or its implications with the staff we met at CRCG, nor of it being brought to our attention&#8230;No one at CRGH raised the fact that whilst I had provided consent to posthumous use of our embryos, Fern had not completed the additional paperwork necessary to record her consent to posthumous use of the embryos&#8217;.</span></p>

There is no evidence Ms Choya was given any information about this by the clinic, they are not prompted to do this by the HFEA&#8217;s own Code of Conduct or Guidance for Clinics. The WT form is not clear on the face of the form that the term <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;someone else&#8217;s treatment&#8217;</span> and the reference to the surrogacy form relates to posthumous use by her partner of a partner-created embryo.

Ms Choya was adamant that the girls should be saved in the event there had to be a choice between her and the children. This demonstrates that she would have wanted Mr Jennings&#8217; to have their children in the event of her death. The fact that they had not discussed specifically the posthumous use of the embryo in the event of Ms Choya&#8217;s death is because, in my judgment, it was not raised by the clinic or obvious from the forms Ms Choya was asked to sign. The fact that Ms Choya changed her position in relation to use of the embryos for training in the WT form she signed on 21 May 2018, when considered with the other evidence, it provides support for the conclusion in relation to Ms Choya&#8217;s consent regarding the embryo in the event of her death. She wished that embryo to be retained for that purpose in the context, as Mr Jennings describes, where they had gone through a number of unsuccessful IVF treatments and this was the last remaining embryo.</p>

However, the court needs to consider the wider statutory scheme, in particular the mandatory requirement for relevant information <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;as is proper&#8217;</span> to be provided before someone gives consent. As Ms Richards observes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the logical conclusion of [Ms Gallafent&#8217;s] argument about the role of written consent is that even if the HFEA forms contained no reference at all to posthumous consent and even if a clinic repeatedly failed to ask a couple to complete any forms, the Court could be powerless because it would go &#8216;against the grain&#8217; of the legislation. That cannot be correct, and does not flow from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, or from any Article 8 compliant reading of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>&#8217;</span>. I agree. Consent is a critical issue within the statutory scheme but what is important is to consider the role and purpose of consent in the statutory scheme, which is to ensure that gametes and embryos are used in accordance with the relevant person&#8217;s wishes. The reference to written consent is an evidential rule with the obvious benefits of certainty but it is not inviolable where the circumstances may require the Court to intervene.</p>

Mr Jennings&#8217; Article 8 right to respect for the decision to become a parent in the genetic sense has been interfered with. The interference with that right is not proportionate on the facts of this case. Whilst the requirement for writing undoubtedly pursues a legitimate aim, in the circumstances of this case, where, on the findings the court has made, there was a lack of opportunity to Ms Choya to provide that consent in writing, in circumstances where I conclude she would have given that consent, the interference with Mr Jennings&#8217; Article 8 right would be significant, final and lifelong. There are no weighty countervailing factors to justify the significant interference, there is no conflict of individuals&#8217; rights and permitting the application would not undermine a fundamental objective of the statutory scheme, namely the requirement for consent.</p>

In my judgment the court can and should read down the requirement in Schedule 3 to dispense with the requirement for written and signed consent in this limited situation where a person has been denied a fair and reasonable opportunity in their lifetime to provide consent for the posthumous use of their embryos and there is evidence that the court concludes, directly and/or by inference, that if that opportunity had been given, that consent by that person would have been provided in writing.
