The latter application was granted on an open-ended basis by a District Judge at a hearing of which the father had no notice.  In August 2014, the father, who is currently based in Dubai, responded with an application to discharge the prohibited steps order and for a "live with" child arrangements order.</span></p>

The family home, a mansion bought in 2011 for &#163;5.5 million, is in the name of a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.  Ms Ingledew described it as the most luxurious property she had visited in 20 years of professional life.

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">On 18 February 2015, this court made a financial order at a hearing at which not only the parents but two other entities (including the BVI company) were represented.  Having heard from no less than six counsel (three Queen's Counsel and three junior counsel) the Deputy District Judge accepted undertakings from the father to pay the bills on the family home and the children's school fees and ordered him to pay the mother monthly maintenance pending suit of &#163;6,500 and a monthly litigation fund of &#163;16,000.  The net effect is that for every pound of maintenance for the family a slightly larger sum is due to be paid for the maintenance of just one of the four legal teams.  In fact, since the order was so recently made and the undertakings given, the father has ignored it altogether.  Apart from a payment of &#163;3,000 in May, he has paid nothing.  In four months, arrears of &#163;113,000 have accumulated.  The effect on the mother, and consequently on the children, is obvious, and their school places are under threat.  Yet this is a man who was as recently as June 2013 given an unsecured loan of $1 million by a billionaire friend.</span></p>

He started work at the age of 18 and has worked ever since.  In the course of his evidence, he now claims not to have been working at all since January.  He said that there had been changes in the global situation that led him to decide that it was time that he</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> "took another direction ... it's not for me any more.  There&#8217;s no joy in it." </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> He then described going for a job interview with a London-based company on the first night of the hearing.  If he is taken on, they may allow him to work in Dubai.  In that case, he would choose to continue his tax exile, with all its limitations on his availability to the children, rather than work in England.  </span></p>

Another two-day hearing is scheduled for July to deal with a raft of interim and case management issues, but there can be little optimism that this will take matters much further.  The children will therefore not get the benefits of the end of litigation unless the parents take note of Ms Ingledew&#8217;s warnings, or at least reflect on whether they want to go on running up legal bills in this way.</p>

This relationship, which involves gifts from the father to the girlfriend, some child maintenance and much high-end international travel was concealed from the mother and children until the end of 2014, when it was suspected by E, who told her mother.  In May 2015, the girlfriend visited London for a termination of pregnancy.  The only information that the father gave about this relationship before he entered the witness box appeared at Paragraph 58(p) of a witness statement dated 26 February 2015.</span></p>

The couple has travelled abroad, with the solicitor taking the mother for a weekend in Barcelona in December and going with the mother and children to Paris during the February half term.  The solicitor spent Christmas in the family home with the mother and children and is a regular overnight visitor to the home.  As the father is in flagrant default in paying maintenance, the solicitor has been offering necessary financial support to the mother to cover some bills and expenses: instead of the client paying the solicitor, in this case it is the other way round.  The propriety of the mother's solicitor acting for her in the circumstances has been referred to the Solicitors Regulation Authority by the solicitor himself and by the father's solicitors, and I return to this below.</span></p>

In September 2014, HHJ Nathan made an order for fortnightly weekend contact against the mother's wishes.  Before that, the father had not seen the children since leaving the family home seven months earlier.  After the order the arrangements were broadly successful for about five months.  The father then requested time with the children during the February half term, but this was declined.  Instead, the children went with the mother and her solicitor to Paris</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> "on the spur of the moment"</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, as the mother put it</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  After that, the children spent the last weekend in February with the father, who became unwell, no doubt from accumulated stress, and was admitted to hospital on Sunday 1 March.  Communication between these parents is so poor that he did not contact the mother but arranged for the children to be returned to her by a friend after they had spent several hours at hospital with him.  The father then returned to Dubai and dropped off the radar, apart from the few offensive text messages to the mother and text messages to the children.  It is again a sign of the parents&#8217; current inability to communicate in a civilised way that the father did not notify the mother that he was not coming for contact and the mother did not ask for an explanation when he did not come.  In the middle of May the father's solicitor wrote peremptorily requesting a week's contact at the half term holiday later in the month.  This was refused without explanation.  The mother&#8217;s excuse in evidence was that the children needed to be at home revising for exams.  Finally, on the weekend preceding this hearing the parents were incapable of arranging for the father to see E for a few hours, even with the active involvement of Ms Ingledew.  Last Sunday, instead of spending time with their father after his arrival in the UK, the children went sailing with the mother and her solicitor.  The mother says that the children had refused to go for contact despite her best efforts.  As matters stand, it is now 14 weeks since the children have seen their father.  There was lively Whatsapp messaging between E and her father until 22 May, the day on which the children saw Ms Ingledew.  Since then, the father has been sending messages to both children but neither has replied.  </span></p>

The father was 21 and the mother 17.  They set up home together immediately and bought a 5-bedroom home in Kent in 1996.  The father worked, the mother remained at home, the children were born and in 2008 the parents married.  By this time, there was no contact with the mother's family, with the father being engaged in bitter litigation with her brother over a property development project in Portugal.  This led to a county court judgment in the brother&#8217;s favour in March 2013, when the judge was highly critical of the father, and made a worldwide freezing order in respect of his assets.   That judgment remains unsatisfied.</span></p>

In January 2012, the father moved offshore to Dubai with the mother's support, meaning that he can only be in this country for 90 days a year.  However, in November 2012, she served him with divorce proceedings.  An unsuccessful attempt at reconciliation followed and in February 2014 the mother, and consequently the children, resumed a relationship with the maternal grandparents.

I am able to make findings about two of these.  In June 2012, the parents argued when the mother hid the father's car keys.  A scuffle broke out and the father injured the mother's arms after she tried to push him away.  The children were in the house and J found his mother in great distress after his father had left.  In August 2013, when the family was at its Portuguese house, the father lost his temper.  He threw the mother against a door and grabbed her by the throat.  This was seen by J, who told him to stop.  The father denies using anything other than defensive force.  Having heard them both, I prefer the evidence of the mother.  In relation to the first incident, she visited the doctor the following day.  After the second incident, she went to Relate for advice and support.  On both occasions, the father was very angry and his account is less likely to be reliable.  The mother makes certain other allegations as to which the evidence is inadequate for me to reach any conclusions.</span></p>

Ms Skoglund&#8217;s report from November 2014 describes the children as engaging, mature, polite and very well presented.  They are doing well at school.  The children spoke of the arguments that they had heard and witnessed, some involving violence by the father.  Broadly, they wanted to see him but the issue was surrounded by anxiety and the impact of the parental conflict was significant.  Ms Skoglund regarded them as resilient but vulnerable and struggling with the transition between their parents.  No evidence was found that the father intended to remove the children from the mother's care.  It was recommended that they should live with the mother and that there should be a fortnightly staying contact and holidays abroad.  The parents should both attend an SPIP.</span></p>

Two main themes are identified as being relevant to the children's current attitude: awareness of past violence and the impact of the financial situation on their daily lives.  In both these areas, the children hold their father responsible.  The children were also pleased to have resumed their relationship with their maternal grandparents, of whom the father strongly disapproves.  J is unduly vigilant about his mother's financial situation and is taking on a pseudo-parental role.  He told Ms Ingledew that he did not want to see his father.  He wants the proceedings to be over.  E seemed sad and at the end of the interview she began to weep, saying that she didn't know why her daddy doesn't come to see them.   </span></p>

They clearly favour their mother as their consistent carer and source of comfort.  They are critical of their father but in reality they crave consistency and comfort from him as well.

Ms Ingledew did not believe that there was a likelihood that the father would keep the children from the mother, but she did not recommend overseas travel with him at the present time because of the children's current views.  There needs to be a period of healing.  The father needs to address the family&#8217;s material needs and to reflect on a pattern of selfish behaviour.  On the mother's side, she has not sufficiently prioritised the father's role in the children's lives.  </span></p>

She gave advice about introducing the idea of the father's new child to J and E in a positive way.  She was in favour of there being a family assistance order under which she could help the parents and children to restore their relationships to an acceptable state.

He is a man of some intelligence who worked his way into money.  He inhabits an offshore wheeler-dealer world in which large sums of money flow between friends and business connections, with trusts and companies being set up with a view to maximising profit, minimising tax and obscuring ownership.  It is in some ways a pressured environment and there are highs and lows.  By this year, the father may have begun to experience some of the lows, but he is unlikely to be down for long.  I mention these things because they are relevant to the atmosphere in which family life is conducted.  The mother and children have benefited from the father's business activities, at least from the financial perspective, but his chosen lifestyle is not calm or predictable.  Apparently it does not even allow him to live in the same country as his children.</span></p>

Over the course of their lives, he has had a close relationship with them on a day-to-day, one-to-one level.  However, the breakdown of the marriage and the appalling state of the parental relationship has caused cracks to appear, worse in the case of J than E.  Ms Ingledew has explained the problem.  The children are anxious about the father being angry with them and with their mother.  I observed him to be a red-faced man whose face was often suffused with emotion.  I do not think that the children are frightened of him in general, but he must be alarming to them when he is aroused.  The second aspect of the problem is that the father is currently a failure in the children's eyes.  The family has operated on the basis that the mother is the homemaker and the father the breadwinner.  The children have seen the mother carry out her role consistently.  While the family was together, the father was an ample provider.  After the separation in 2012, support continued at a lower level.  This year it has stopped altogether.  It is not the purpose of this hearing to identify whether the father is unable or unwilling to support the family, though his history, lifestyle and connections may suggest where the answer lies.  What is relevant is that the mother is understandably very stressed by the financial problems that are multiplying and the children inevitably see this and are affected by it.  As a small example, the family watches television on a computer because the TV is broken and there is no money to repair it.  The children are also aware that their school fees are not being paid.  I doubt they discovered this by accidentally opening a letter in the way the mother describes, but the primary responsibility for the situation is the father&#8217;s.  He sententiously expressed the view that what children need is love and time.  Actually, like everyone else, they also need money.</span></p>

She is very close to the children and is naturally protective of them.  She has no work history and little direct knowledge of the father's business dealings.  Although she denied it, she is angry, and justifiably so, about aspects of the father's behaviour: the assaults, the concealment of the relationship and new child, and the flouting of the court orders.  Over the years, she has supported the father's relationship with the children and recognised its closeness.  Unfortunately, that has changed since the breakdown of the marriage.  From early in 2014, she has at best been compliant with the father seeing the children.  She has carried out her obligations under the order but the combination of the father stopping attending in March and making no meaningful payments this year has led her to withdraw her co-operation.  To a degree this is understandable, but it is relevant to the question of whether the children's current views are genuinely their own.  In difficult circumstances, the mother has, I am afraid, allowed the children, particularly J, to get far too involved.  The fact that her solicitor is in the home cannot help.  She has also become proprietorial about the children.  She does not prioritise their relationship with their father or give them the encouragement that they need.  Instead, she said: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"They have free will.  If they want to see [him], I will make it happen." </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">However unsatisfactory the father's behaviour, the mother's decisions in relation to the February half term, and in relation to more recent requests for contact show a lack of consideration, and the fact that the children are instead spending time with her solicitor throw salt in the wound.  If she wishes to encourage better behaviour from the father, her actions are calculated to achieve the opposite.</span></p>

I note that in 2009 a most improper threatening letter was written on the father's behalf by the private office of a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family in the context of the litigation with the mother's brother.  However, taking account of all of this, and however black the father is justly painted, I formed the clear view that he can be trusted on this issue.  He rightly appreciates that the children would never accept being separated from their mother.  Although E has said that she is afraid her father might take her away, I accept the evidence of Ms Ingledew that the children do not really believe this.  I do not disparage the mother's anxiety, but the evidence does not show the father to be an abduction risk and it is in the interests of the children for anxiety on this issue to abate.</span></p>

Likewise, it is not, in my view, in the children's interests for there to be discrimination as between the parents on the question of holidays abroad.  The mother would like to take the children this summer to the family villa in Portugal, which is under threat of repossession.  I understand that, but no child, J and E included, needs foreign holidays every year.

Firstly, the decisions are not ones for the children to make, though their views have to be carefully considered.  As the parents cannot agree, the court must decide.  Secondly, the matter must not only be approached sensitively, but also with determination.  I note that the approach taken by Judge Nathan rapidly re-established successful contact after a much longer gap than the present one.  Thirdly, the arrangements must make best use of the father's ability to come to England.  Fourthly, the forthcoming summer holidays offer a good time for progress to be made.  Finally, the children should go for contact together if at all possible &#8211; it is not fair to E to bear the brunt of the situation.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I refer to the solicitor&#8217;s response to the concerns raised on the father's behalf.  Four letters have been written asking for an explanation of the nature of his relationship with the mother.  The only reply has been this: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"The meetings between [the mother] and representatives of our firm are subject to legal professional privilege.  However, without prejudice to that privilege, we can confirm that no discussions concerning the case have occurred or will occur in the presence of or in the hearing of the children."  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">That entirely unsatisfactory and, I am afraid to say, disingenuous response (and the fact that every subsequent request for information has been ignored) demonstrates that the solicitor is in a situation where he cannot give independent professional advice to the mother.  </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Lastly, at the end of the hearing, the parties asked me to determine an issue about distribution of monies due to be received by the father and subject to a freezing order.  Those submissions revealed that in February, when the District Judge ordered the father to pay the mother &#163;16,000 for her monthly legal bills, the solicitor&#8217;s relationship with the mother was not revealed to the father or the court.  It was plainly a material and disclosable fact on such an application and I was surprised to hear a contrary submission.  I shall not direct the release of litigation funds at this stage.  The hearing in July will be an opportunity for the father to put his case on the issue.   </span></p>
