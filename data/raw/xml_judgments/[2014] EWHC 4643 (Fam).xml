She is, however, very nervous of any arrangement which would permit the father to take S to Saudi Arabia, where he proposes to work again if possible, or Greece, which is the land of his birth and where many members of his family live.  I shall refer to the reasons behind her nervousness later when I consider the arrangements again in the context of the wider background.</p>

She took further instructions, and I rose while she did so to give ample time for it, and the father&#8217;s definitive position, (and indeed his oral evidence), is that, albeit with a heavy heart, he concedes that S should stay here with his mother and he should see him as per the proposals in paragraph&#160;4(iii), (v) and (vi) above.  </p>

That guardian is Mrs&#160;Clark.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">So much for the outline positions in this litigation.  But this court&#8217;s rulings will not be the end of litigation for this family.  The father has issued divorce proceedings in Harrogate.  The mother has filed a defence and a cross-petition to that petition.  Both parties seek to establish the unreasonable behaviour of each other for the purposes of obtaining a decree.  I am told, although I have not seen the documentation, quite rightly, that the evidence they each rely on in support of their respective petitions mirrors the allegations each makes against the other in these proceedings, for a flavour of which see below.  I have invited the parties to consider the future of those proceedings and try to come to some arrangement where a divorce can be obtained on a more neutral basis, even if that means that they might have to wait for a period before a two-year separation can be established to illustrate but one comparatively neutral basis for obtaining a decree.  It would, in my view, be tragic for these parties, with the vast expense, and mostly emotional expense at that, irrespective of the financial cost, if they re-litigated all these matters in that forum.  It would be tragic for S also as his parents continue to war over his head. </p>

Those proceedings appear to fall into two categories, for the father brought what I shall call family proceedings there in January or early February 2014 to determine the arrangements for S, and criminal proceedings have also been brought by the authorities against, amongst others, as I understand it, the father and at least one of his sisters as well as certain psychiatrists, and a brother of the father.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father, as I have indicated, was born in Greece on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August 1974, making him 40 years of age.  The mother was born in Croatia on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March 1976 and she is thus 38.  The father came to this country in September 1995, I presume on the basis that he was a citizen of the European Union.  If I am wrong about that, it does not matter in the overall landscape.  The mother came to this country in September 1999 with her own parents, they being asylum seekers because of the acute problems occurring in Croatia at that time.  The mother was eventually granted permanent leave to remain in this country.  The parents met in 2000 and married in the United Kingdom by civil ceremony on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July 2001.  They married on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July 2009 in a religious ceremony of the Eastern Orthodox Church on the Greek island of Syros in the Cyclades where most of the father&#8217;s family live during the summer months at least, for, as I understand it, there is also a family house in Piraeus.  As I have already mentioned, S was born in October of that same year.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2010, the father was made redundant and he undertook an extended period of temporary work.  Although having more distinguished qualifications, he turned his hand to whatever was available.  In the summer of that same year, there was a family visit by him, the mother and S to Greece for about two weeks.  There was a similar trip in the summer of 2011, and then, in November of that year, the father secured employment in Saudi Arabia.  As I understand his evidence, initially one applies for bachelor status, which he did, and he was accredited in that status, but that meant he could not take his wife and child to live there.  He began, when the regulations permitted, to pursue a different status as a married man with the intention that the family would join him there, which, as I understand it, was more or less planned to occur in February of this year.  As will appear below, no such d&#233;m&#233;nagement occurred.  The father made a flying visit to the United Kingdom in December 2011.  In January 2012, the mother and S visited Greece to see the father&#8217;s family, and the father was there for a short part of it before returning to Saudi Arabia.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In February 2012, the mother saw a Dr. Baharaki on the island of Syros.  She is a psychiatrist.  For reasons I shall set out later when I consider the mother&#8217;s mental health, that was the first of a number of encounters with that doctor.  Two days later, on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February, the mother and S returned to the United Kingdom as planned.  In April of 2012, S began attending pre-school where he remained until 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January 2014.  I shall much later in this judgment have something to say about his progress there.  In June of the same year, the mother and S went back to Greece to see the father&#8217;s family.  They stayed for about four weeks.  The father was not present.  The mother was having a bad time.  She felt that she was not liked by the paternal family and was not treated properly.  The paternal family have made very considerable criticisms of her behaviour at that time, but I have had to investigate neither side&#8217;s account for the purposes of this hearing.  It is sufficient to record that the mother&#8217;s unhappiness was such that on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;July 2012 she saw another psychiatrist, Dr&#160;Mpotsis, who wrote in a short note that the mother was suffering from bipolar disorder in active phase requiring immediate hospitalisation.  He set a review appointment for some two weeks later.  I shall return to the issue of the mother&#8217;s mental health in due course when considering the wider landscape and more recent opinions about her.  In that July, the relationship between the mother and the father&#8217;s family deteriorated very significantly.  The family have alleged, amongst other things, that the mother stole &#8364;15,000 from them to go on what has been described in the papers as binge shopping.  The mother stoutly denies any such allegation but that is just one allegation amongst a welter, some of them relating to her alleged care, or lack of it, of little S.  On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July, the mother and S returned to the United Kingdom, and between 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;August the father came to London.  It happened to coincide with the Olympics held in London that year and, as I understand it, he and the mother spent a few days there, and the rest of the holiday in Newcastle.  The father made a return visit to the United Kingdom between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;October.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In December over the holiday season &#8211; that is Christmas and New Year &#8211; the family had a holiday together in Lanzarote with a little time spent in Newcastle.  From 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August to 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;September 2013, the father took S to Greece for a holiday.  The father says that the mother was no longer welcome there because of her previous behaviour, some of which I have hinted at above, but that time the mother instead visited Belgrade, returning to Newcastle on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August.  In October 2013, it is suggested that the father told the mother that he was going to Abu Dhabi for a conference.  His account is that it was a sort of social event rather than a formal conference and that he misled the mother as to its nature because she did not really approve.  It is the mother&#8217;s profound suspicion, indeed, embedded belief, that in fact the father took himself off to Greece for some time during this period, something which he continues to deny.  It is agreed, however, between them that he missed the fourth birthday of S on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;October, the father&#8217;s account being that he had no internet available to him, a somewhat surprising suggestion in the contemporary age, but there we are.  S was said to be profoundly disappointed that he had no contact with his father, even by Skype, at that time.  Whether or not that led to him misbehaving slightly with his father in due course, I do not know.  The aetiology of the child&#8217;s behaviour is beyond the remit of this inquiry.  It was, however, at this period that the father alleges that S said things to his father about the mother and her behaviour towards S which concerned him.  At the end of the month of October, the paternal grandmother found herself in the United Kingdom visiting her daughter, SE, who lives in Leeds.  They came over to Newcastle for two afternoons during the one week when the grandmother was here.  Mother permitted such contact to occur, despite her falling out with the family.  On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;November 2013, the papers show that the father consulted a Greek lawyer.  He expressed worries about his son and the care he was receiving at the hands of his mother.  In his oral evidence, the father told me that the Greek lawyer was known to him and, in fact, was the family lawyer.  It was, therefore, something of a surprise to me to see in clear terms in that lawyer&#8217;s statement that there had been absolutely no connection of any kind prior to the consultation on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;November with either the father or, indeed, any of the paternal family.  I have no doubt at all that the father&#8217;s evasive reply when this was put to him was intended to mislead me but it is difficult to see what mileage he can have from that misleading statement.  I suspect, in fact, that he was simply caught out trying to paint the lily; but I shall leave that to one side for, in such cases, one proceeds on the basis of evidence establishing on the balance of probabilities factors x, y and z rather than judicial suspicion.  It remains, however, something of an oddity.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;December, the father came to Newcastle for the Christmas and New Year period with the family.  He was due to stay until 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;January.  In fact, he appears to have stayed rather longer.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January 2014, he travelled with S to Greece with the mother&#8217;s consent, (for she had gone to Belgrade), but the mother&#8217;s consent was on the basis that it was for a one-week holiday.  The next day, on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January, the father had arranged &#8211; the papers do not reveal when, rather unhappily &#8211; for an appointment for S to be assessed by a Dr&#160;Zorzos, a child psychiatrist based in Athens.  This assessment took place without the mother&#8217;s knowledge or consent.  The assessment apparently lasted, according to the father&#8217;s oral evidence, some three days including all sorts of testing.  Apparently, not only the father but also the paternal grandmother was there; query others in that family.  In a document executed later but to which I shall refer, the father&#8217;s sister, ME as I shall call her, who lives in Greece, suggested that it was at this time, if not before, but certainly at this time that she and her mother and her brother assumed the care of S.  That very same day, the father and S went to the family home on Syros.  S was due to return to Newcastle on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January.  The mother travelled from Belgrade to London before going to Newcastle, as she had planned to do, so that she would be there to receive him but, on landing at London Heathrow, she picked up the father&#8217;s text message saying that S would not be returning for another week.  It is not clear to me whether or not she knew this but on that same day, 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January, as she was arriving in London, the father left Greece and returned to Saudi Arabia leaving S with his family.  On the next day, 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January, S was registered at a nursery school in Greece and attended, as I understand it, immediately.  I have seen a report from that school, albeit a brief one, and I shall refer to it later.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;January, the father made an application to the Court of First Instance in Piraeus for interim custody.  He asked for his suit to be heard without any notice to the mother.  On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>&#160;January, an interim custody application was filed at five to eleven in the morning.  The court ruled that the mother should be given twelve hours&#8217; notice of the hearing.  The father&#8217;s sister, ME, that very same day later in the afternoon, applied to the duty prosecutor in Piraeus for an &#8220;involuntary hospital examination&#8221; of the mother, apparently alleging in the course of it &#8211; and I have seen a translated copy of the statement &#8211; that the mother was resident in Greece, thereby giving the authorities jurisdiction to consider the matter.  The mother, knowing nothing at all of this, travelled from London via Belgrade to Greece, landing in Athens at 1600 hours.  One of the father&#8217;s brothers, NE, and brother-in-law, K, met the mother at the airport and took her initially to the paternal grandfather&#8217;s home in Piraeus, ostensibly, as she was told and believed, to meet with S.  He was not there.  ME and the father&#8217;s brother, NE, made the statements to the authorities to which I have referred, or at least I have referred to that of ME.  The statement of NE gave a supporting account to the history given by his sister.  The bailiffs allegedly served notice of the interim custody hearing on the mother by leaving a copy of it at the family home in Piraeus, although the mother says that she did not receive this.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;January at about ten in the morning, two plainclothes police officers came to the family home.  The mother was taken initially to the police station and then to be examined at a psychiatric hospital in the city.  The court in Piraeus heard the father&#8217;s application for an interim order at 11.30 that morning, and the court gave him interim custody until a hearing due to take place on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March.  The court directed that the mother be given 20 days&#8217; notice of that next hearing in March.  She was involuntarily admitted to hospital at about three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.  Initially, she was physically restrained by being strapped to a bed, and she was involuntarily administered drugs.  On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;January, in other words the same day, luckily the mother still having the use of a mobile phone, contacted her own family who themselves contacted the Slovenian Embassy, and a lawyer on behalf of the mother was urgently engaged to deal with the issues which had arisen.  The next day, on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January, following the intervention of the Embassy again, the mother was seen in hospital by a Dr.&#160;Popovich with another doctor, Dr.&#160;Perimenis.  Both of them concluded that, despite the assessment and assertion the day before by the hospital doctors that the mother was suffering from some mental illness, they found no such evidence and the physical restraints were removed.  The mother left hospital with the assistance of her Greek solicitor on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January.  The father has used terminology suggesting that she escaped, from which I infer he was considering her still to be a risk, and he relies extensively in many of his replies on the fact that this period is not investigated and he had no idea what the mother&#8217;s state was at that time.  On the next day, 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January, the mother was examined by a further psychiatrist, Dr&#160;Giouzelis.  That examination was arranged by her lawyer.  He, too, concluded that the mother had no mental health issues at that time.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father made an application to the court in Piraeus for full custody or permanent custody, as it has been called, of S.  On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;January, and again on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>&#160;February, the mother was examined by Professor Nestoros.  These examinations had been arranged by her Greek lawyer.  There is a psychiatric opinion in the documents to which I shall later refer.  He found no evidence of mental health issues or difficulties in the mother.  On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February she returned to the United Kingdom obliged, because of the interim orders, to leave S behind with the paternal family, although, of course, the father was not there, still being in Saudi Arabia.  It was on that same day that S was first seen by the doctor to whom I made earlier reference, Dr&#160;Baharaki.  The next day, on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, the first contact between the mother and S took place via Skype.  There was subsequent, if irregular, Skype contact between them.  On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February there was a further Skype visit, about a week later, and that gives a flavour of the intermittent nature of it.  I wonder what this boy felt at that time.  On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February, Dr.&#160;Baharaki confirmed (in the briefest of reports dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February) that S had been undergoing treatment for about a month for &#8220;possible neglect.&#8221;  The mother, as I have indicated at least inferentially above, was not present at this appointment, nor at any of the therapies adverted to in passing.  Indeed, she was not told of any such treatments, nor, indeed, of that consultation and assessment.  On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February, that same day, she issued her application through the Central Authority under the Hague Convention on the International Aspects of Child Abduction, hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the Hague Convention.&#8221;  On the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, she had another Skype session with S.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February, there was another report from Dr&#160;Baharaki who claims to have been told by the mother, (when the mother saw her in 2012), that the mother had given S Benzodiazepines, and Dr Baharaki reported on the behaviour of S which she speculated might be the result of neglect or the administration of Benzodiazepines.  I emphasise that the mother rejects these allegations vigorously.  On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;March, there was another Skype contact session.  On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, the hearing I mentioned earlier took place in the courts of Piraeus.  The mother was not present nor was she represented.  The father was not present but was represented.  The court was told that service of the notice of the hearing had been undertaken on the basis that the mother was a person of &#8220;unknown residence.&#8221;  That was clearly wholly dishonest for the family knew perfectly well that she was back at her home in Newcastle, intermittently being allowed the barest minimum of Skype contacts with S.  The judgment arising on that day was not handed down until 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March.  Also on that day there was a further medical report of Mr&#160;Zorzos, the child and adolescent psychiatrist.  I shall return to it.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, there was a second report of Professor Nestoros evaluating the psychiatric treatment of the mother in Greece both in 2012 and 2014.  This, again, is a matter I shall return to.  And on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March there was another Skype contact between mother and son.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, the mother made a conventional enough application in this jurisdiction for what is colloquially known as a return order.  The matter came in a without notice hearing before Mrs&#160;Justice&#160;Hogg on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March.  She warded S.  She ordered the father to return S to the jurisdiction forthwith, and for the matter to be restored to court once the boy was back.  The order was not sealed until the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> but was served on the father that same day.  It took several months to bring about the desired result of a return as will appear below.  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, there was another contact session by Skype.  Thereafter, the mother travelled to Greece and lived on a sort of hand-to-mouth basis for some six months whilst the United Kingdom and the Greek proceedings continued in parallel.  The mother, on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March in Piraeus, filed her own application for interim custody.  The next day, the father was notified of that application by the mother and of the proposed hearing two days later on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;March.  As I have mentioned a moment ago, the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March judgment was the subject of a judgment handed down at about five in the afternoon in the Greek courts and it confirmed temporary custody of the boy to his father.  On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;March, having become aware of the decision of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, the mother abandoned her application for interim custody and decided to, and did, apply to set aside or appeal the interim order referred to above.  That appeal was heard on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March but there is no documentation available to describe it.  The mother was present.  The court ordered that the mother have daily contact with S for one hour.  This was immediately thwarted by the father on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March taking S to Turkey for a holiday without informing the mother.  There is some dispute by him as to that sequence of events, and I shall advert to it again in due course.  On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March, the mother applied to have the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March decision revoked.  Again, on the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> of that month there was another hearing in Piraeus but no documentation is available to assist me as to its outcome.  On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;April, the first contact pursuant to the above order took place at the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home.  It continued to be at that venue, supervised by the paternal grandmother throughout.  I shall return to this. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;April, the parties&#8217; cross-applications were heard in Piraeus and both parents were present and represented.  The court accepted that the mother had not been properly served with notice of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;March hearing, and found that it could not be deduced that during the present dispute that the mother suffered from psychopathological disorders causing major danger to herself and others as had been earlier alleged, and, indeed, as had been found by the two Greek doctors who examined her on admission to the hospital earlier in the year.  But the court nevertheless went on to find that: &#8220;The mother&#8217;s behaviour was not compatible with the behaviour of the average, prudent mother who must bring up her child in a peaceful environment,&#8221; and that, &#8220;Any change of environment of the child would have negative consequences.&#8221; Thus, temporary custody to the father was confirmed.  Although that hearing occurred on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and the order was made and everybody acted on the basis of that decision, the judgment was not in fact issued until 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June.  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;April, a medical opinion was obtained from Mr&#160;Zorzos.  I shall speak of it later.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, the father applied to the United Kingdom court for a child arrangements order, a specific issue order to allow the little boy to remain in Greece permanently, a specific issue order to allow him to remain in Greece on an interim basis pending determination of the previous application, and for the return order to be stayed.  On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;May he applied in the English courts for the matter to be transferred in totality to Greece pursuant to Article&#160;15 of European Regulation 2201 of 2003, commonly called Brussels&#160;II Revised, but which I shall refer to hereafter as &#8220;the Regulation.&#8221;  The matter came on two days later before Sir Peter Singer.  He made a directions order in respect of the Article&#160;15 application under the Regulation and listed the hearing for July.  The return order was suspended without prejudice to the mother&#8217;s application.  On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;May, the father made an application for permanent custody to the courts of Syros.  It is difficult to see, unless it was to further inconvenience the mother, why the enterprise was shifted to Syros and the evidence does not, frankly, illuminate that slight puzzle, but, ultimately, it matters little.  On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June that application was presented to the court in Syros and the matter was set down for a full hearing on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February 2015.  Meanwhile, the interim arrangements were to continue according to the earlier orders.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June, the mother was served with that application for permanent custody, and it was then that she first became aware of the transfer to Syros.  Again, on that same day, a forensically overly busy one for this family, the father issued his divorce petition in England.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June, the decision of the court of Piraeus was made.  On the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, the date originally set for the hearing in Piraeus for permanent custody did not proceed because of the above transfer to Syros.  On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June, in this jurisdiction, there was a hearing before Mr&#160;Justice Keehan.  Amongst other issues, he considered the grant of an injunction restraining the mother by herself, servants, agents or otherwise from publicising this case online using petitions launched by friends, with photographs and widespread publicity.  I shall say something more of this publicity in due course but Mr&#160;Justice&#160;Keehan, although offered undertakings by the mother, declined to accept them because she was not in the jurisdiction.  Instead, he granted orders in the terms sought restraining such publication.  As I understand it, there has been no recurrence of such publication in breach of that order.  If there has, it has not been drawn to my attention.  On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July, S had his last session with Dr&#160;Baharaki.  Let me come now to England for a moment.  Between 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July, there was a full-scale hearing before Mr&#160;Nicholas Cusworth QC, to whom I earlier made reference, he sitting as a deputy on these dates as well.  He heard the father&#8217;s application under Article&#160;15 of the Regulation.  It is recorded in the chronology I have seen that, during the course of the hearing, the father suggested that he had evidence that it would not be in the interests of S to return to the United Kingdom because of the therapies he was undertaking.  That evidence was not produced at that time.  Apparently, on the second day of the hearing, the father disclosed that he had negotiated a three-month sabbatical from his job in Saudi Arabia with the possibility of a further three-month extension.  Also on the second day, he suggested that S was displaying sexualised behaviour (&#8220;dry humping&#8221; as it has been called) which the father associated with the mother&#8217;s contact.  On the final day of that hearing, the mother was served at court with the father&#8217;s divorce petition.  I have drawn the attention of the parties already to the fact that that is improper service.  I understand that she may have been re-served via her solicitors but that, too, would only be valid if they had instructions to accept service.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July, there was a further report from Dr&#160;Baharaki.  On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;July, the learned deputy handed down a judgment, which I have seen and to which I shall refer again, rejecting the father&#8217;s application under Article&#160;15 of the Regulation.  The return order was made afresh and the return date set for 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August.  There was a directions hearing to be listed two weeks after the child had returned, namely on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August.  At that hearing, as I have said, Mrs&#160;Clark was appointed the guardian of S.  On 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;August, the father returned to Syros from Saudi Arabia.  On the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, he took S to be examined by Dr.&#160;Alifieri on the island of Paros.  I have seen the report.  Once again, there was no consultation with the mother beforehand about this examination.  One of the consequences of it, however, was that the mother missed two contacts on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August, the father&#8217;s solicitors notified the mother&#8217;s by email of their intention to apply for a suspension of the return order.  On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August, the mother&#8217;s English solicitors received it.  The application sought a suspension of the &#8220;temporary&#8221; (sic) return on the basis that it was not in the interests of S to return &#8220;presently&#8221; because of the therapies he was undertaking in Greece, and evidence was filed in support from a speech therapist and an occupational therapist.  I shall come back to their reports later.  However, the father clearly had reconsidered the matter for, on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;August at 16.52, the mother&#8217;s solicitors in England were notified by email that the father was no longer seeking a stay but did want an extension of the period leading to a return.  </p>

On the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of that month, there was a hearing before the learned deputy again, and there was an agreed schedule for the development of contact between the mother and S, although it was agreed that, because of continuing disputes between the parties over the head of S who was witness to them, the maternal grandmother was to carry out the handovers, an arrangement made by the Guardian.  On that day at court directions were made for this hearing in Newcastle.   </p>

But in giving evidence to me the father was, not surprisingly, cross-examined thoroughly by Miss&#160;Dixon, the mother&#8217;s counsel, about the proceedings in Greece and their genesis.  I am thus, whilst not able to make findings in respect of some members of his family and what they may or may not have done &#8211; for example, his sister ME and one of his brothers, probably NE, who have not given oral evidence &#8211; in a position to make some findings about the father&#8217;s conduct in those proceedings.</p>

It is a rare assumption of responsibility on his part.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It is quite clear from his evidence that he deliberately orchestrated the family proceedings, the timing of them and the preparations for them.  For example, he consulted a Greek lawyer in November the previous year, and I have adverted to the lies he told me about the relationship with that lawyer.  He ignored her advice to have an assessment of S carried out in England, and I find his reason for ignoring it to be a wholly unsatisfactory one, namely that the mother would object and possibly disappear.  There is no evidence to support any sort of assertion that even if she did object, she would disappear with S.  He drafted in advance of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;January of this year, that being the date upon the document, a very lengthy statement about the mother, about S, and about the difficulties he asserted were arising for S from the mother&#8217;s alleged behaviour.  He instructed his lawyers to proceed in Piraeus whilst asking for the proceedings not to be served on the mother, and orchestrated, I find, the approach of his sister, ME, and his brother, NE, to the police in Piraeus, which approach, in the light of their statements of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>&#160;January, led to the mother being detained in the psychiatric hospital to which I have referred above. </p>

But such reliance by him does not stand up to scrutiny or justification when the entire sequence of their exchanges is examined, and in the light of the mother&#8217;s behaviour on her arrival in Greece, for her communications with him and others following that threat, albeit underpinned with urgency and increasing worry about the whereabouts of her son, are lucid and surprisingly, given what was happening to her, calm.  In any event, some of his preparations for this litigation, as I have adverted to above, predate the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January text from the mother and the threat it contained in one part of it.  </p>

S presented the picture of a child that had not received the necessary stimuli from his environment so as to be able to associate with children of his own age.  It was particularly difficult for him to express himself.  He did not know how to play games of his age and wasn&#8217;t able to communicate properly.

As far as fine movement is concerned, he had not achieved the stage she would have expected for a child of his age and in general had poor graphomotor skills.  She found that he &#8220;frequently appears to have an attention disorder,&#8221; particularly when he was trying to focus on writing, and that the observed attention disorder becomes more intense during periods of &#8220;sentimental stress or environmental changes that force him out of his routine.&#8221;  [I hope I may be forgiven for inserting a comment at this point.

It is frankly difficult, given the number of reports I have seen about this boy, to find any supporting evidence of this proposition amongst the reporters.

This assumption is corroborated by the fact that his improvement fluctuated without there being some sort of stability in his environment.  That is why at one point recently I requested a social report on the environment in which he is living, which is not required and which there is no time to pursue following the judgment delivered by the English court requiring S to be present in his family home in England on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014.&#8221;</p>

She found that he had a very strong personality from the outset, and tried to control the session he had with her.  She illustrates this.  She says, &#8220;Overall, he is of above-average intelligence-ability compared to other children of his age.&#8221;  She found that he was able, both in the practical domain as well as in his language ability.  She found that he had phonological problems in Greek (&#8220;meaning the clarity of speech sound but sounds like a native language speaker&#8221;).  She found him to have excellent verbal as well as visual memory skills of an above-average kind.  His motor skills were average, both in gross motor and fine motor function.  He was concentrating and had no attention deficit, and no social ability deficit.  He was well presented and a handsome little fellow, friendly to both of his examiners, perhaps a little overconfident, but at ease.  As to the suggestion that he had night terrors, she makes no comment but overall found that a specialist assessment tool used in her metier found him to be normal.  </p>

In the 22 months I have known S, I only saw his father on a couple of occasions when he was home from working in Saudi and therefore cannot comment on S and his father&#8217;s relationship.  S and his mother seem to have a great relationship and show mutual admiration for each other.  With S gleefully shouting &#8220;MUMMY&#8221; in his accent when his mother picked him up, something we miss hearing.  I do hope this letter will be of help to resolve the situation.

She had post-baby blues, a depressive illness starting when S was five months old, leading to the prescription of an hypnotic to improve her sleep followed by antidepressant medication which she took until the spring of 2011.  Shortly thereafter, in May of that year, she had moderate depressive symptoms with fluctuations leading to the prescription of Fluoxetine.  Things improved but then deteriorated when she was in Greece in February 2012 and July 2012, as is clear from the earlier entries in this judgment.  Dr Baharaki gave the mother, in February 2012, Mirtazapine.  On the descriptions of the mother at that time, Dr&#160;Hughes could find no evidence of a conversion attack nor of an histrionic personality (D107, paragraph&#160;6.5).  There was no evidence the mother was at that time suffering from alcohol abuse or Benzodiazepine abuse, the latter especially unlikely given that the doctor in February 2012 prescribed her one.  Dr&#160;Hughes concludes that these were depressive attacks.</p>

The documents available relating to that period in July 2012 include statements from the paternal family, but they do not establish any history that would account for a diagnosis that the mother suffered from mania.  Dr&#160;Mpotsis did not describe anything to account for his diagnosis of a bipolar disorder, nor is such a diagnosis consistent, says Dr&#160;Hughes, with the prescription by Professor&#160;Mpotsis of antidepressants, contraindicated for anybody suffering from a bipolar disorder.  That same professor also prescribed the mother Benzodiazepine, once again a bizarre prescription if, indeed, she was found to be addicted to or abusing them.  On her return to England, the mother again consulted her general practitioner and was medicated again on Fluoxetine changing to Citalopram in August 2013.</p>

She did state that she was going to end her life, however this statement was not followed with any planning, action or subsequent report of anything that would have hastened such an eventuality, but in fact she travelled to Greece hoping to return her son.  She travelled without incident in airports, on planes, through security arrangements without incident or suspicion of those vigilant around her (it is my experience that people demonstrating severe signs of mental illness are identified by border and flight staff and it is not uncommon for such to present unwell to people at emergency psychiatric services or police).&#8221;  (D109, paragraph&#160;6.9)</p>

He has had the advantage of being able to read a lengthy document prepared by the hospital on their behalf and bearing in mind the interests of those two doctors who are facing inquiries within the criminal jurisdiction.  Thus, he was able to see their account, insofar as they gave one, of what led them to come to their conclusion.  He reminds himself that she was seen by a Dr&#160;Renshaw, by her family and her Greek advocate and the Slovenian Embassy.  I have referred to Dr&#160;Popovich already who examined the mother on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;January and she could find &#8220;absolutely no symptoms of psychiatric illness.&#8221;  The relevant passage of her brief report, to be found at E49, reads thus:</p>

From the psychiatric clinical assessment of her mental functions which took place on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014, absolutely no symptom of psychiatric illness emerged (her feelings were normal and within natural fluctuations, her behaviour was calm and within limits, the content and coherence of her thought were normal, her judgment was correct and there were no disorders noticeable in her understanding).&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have already made it clear, by brief example only, that I find the father&#8217;s evidence in many ways unreliable, shifting and at times plainly dishonest, having given myself a very clear Lucas warning.  The only possible conclusion I can reach about the events of January this year to August are that he has been dishonest about them and that he cannot, at the moment, be trusted.  This includes, but is not limited to, not being able to trust him to return S to the mother should he be permitted to take S out of the jurisdiction.  Maybe, if and when trust is re-established between him and the mother, if it ever is, that will change, but as the evidence stands, I cannot trust him to take a holiday in Europe.  In reality, what he wants is a holiday in Greece which he proposes to take next summer if given permission. </p>

I remind myself that in the summer of this year, when the mother was permitted by the Greek court to have an extended number of hours per contact with him, it was immediately thwarted by the father taking S to Turkey for a holiday.  This was flagrant.  Even on the basis put by him in evidence, if I have understood it correctly, that he was already in Turkey when the order was made, he nevertheless failed, on being notified of it, to return to Greece until it suited him.</p>

The first is as to the widespread internet publicity about the case I referred to earlier, suppressed only by order of Mr&#160;Justice&#160;Keehan.  Even if she did not do anything other than encourage them to pursue this publicity, she appears, for whatever reason, to have paid little attention to the consequences of exposing S to this kind of publicity.  The second issue is her tendency, which I accept based on the evidence of the guardian, that she talks wholly inappropriately in front of S about marital and financial problems, to name but two areas of their lives.  This, too, must stop.  Apart from those matters I find her to be a truthful and compelling witness, especially when she made it clear that whatever her problems of trust with the father and his family, she would do her best to arrange contact of a kind we shall come to later when I consider with counsel the precise nature and extent of it, and that she would not interfere with the continuance of that contact, albeit on an amended basis from what has gone before.</p>

There is a large measure of agreement between the parents (and the guardian approves) as to the nature of contacts which will ensue.  In summary, the father is to have lengthy periods of staying contact, as it used to be called before 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>&#160;April of this year with the statutory amendments made at that time, three times a year at the major festivals and long holidays, and Skype three or four times a week in the early evening.  There should be alternating half terms.  The little boy can stay at the former matrimonial home, which will then be his permanent home, and the mother would leave to go and stay with her parents who live very nearby during staying contact visits if no other suitable venue can be found.  That arrangement must take account, of course, of the risk that S might receive a mixed message from these practicalities.  The mother will keep the father informed of all major events, including medical treatments, et cetera, in the life of S. </p>
