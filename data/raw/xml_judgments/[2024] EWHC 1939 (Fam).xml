The background was succinctly set out in a schedule attached to the order that I made then, as follows:</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:-0.03in;text-indent:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Arial">This case concerned a young person who asserted she was at risk of harm and at risk of a forced marriage at the hands of her parents. Whilst on a trip abroad, to country X, the young person escaped from her parents. The young person had no connection to country X. She was reported missing by her parents and located by the local police of Country X. She was taken to a children&#8217;s home where she remained for 5 months until she was able to return to this jurisdiction. The authorities of Country X did not return the young person to her parents due to the allegations she had made. There was also a request made by the High Court of England and Wales to the relevant authorities of Country X not to return her to the care of her parents. </span></p>

The relevant local authority was joined as a party to these proceedings at the first ex-parte hearing.  The orders made by the High Court of England and Wales included a Forced Marriage Protection Order, Wardship and Tipstaff Orders. Several requests were made to various authorities to assist with the young person&#8217;s repatriation and orders were made pursuant to the 1996 Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children. </span></p>

It is known that the young person&#8217;s parents had initiated proceedings in Country X to secure the young person&#8217;s return to their care. However, there was another set of proceedings during which permission of the court was required to secure the young person&#8217;s return to this country. </span></p>

The Forced Marriage Unit suggested to the parties to explore this with the local authority and/or the police and referred the parties to the Guidance from the President of the Family Division: liaison between the courts and British Embassies and High Commissions which states &#8216;The FCDO provides a facilitative role in relation to the return of the child but is not able to care for, take control of, or assist in procuring the return of the child.&#8217; </span></p>

The court was invited to issue some guidance and directions were made for the parties and any interested party to file and serve written submissions&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.</span></p>

Social Work England was invited to contribute but did not consider itself in a position to do so. The local authority involved in the case also declined an invitation to file a submission.</span></p>

Indeed, there are three significant recent documents to which I have been referred by all parties, which seek to set out and explain the parameters of the different agencies&#8217; responsibilities, and the limited extent to which those agencies can function when the person to be protected is situated in a different country with its own systems and agencies. Those guidance documents have evidently been carefully prepared and considered, and I certainly do not intend in what follows to adjust or amend them in any way. Insofar as there has been any lack of clarity amongst practitioners as to the workings of the guidance, I hope that by drawing together the agencies&#8217; responses to the questions asked below, and drawing certain conclusions, there can be greater understanding of what is possible, and what may not be, in any situation which arises.</span></p>

	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Insofar as it post-dates a number of decided cases in which judges of the Family Division have expressed the need for guidance about what can be done in situations such as these, I am clear that it does provide that guidance, at least in relation to the involvement of the FCDO. The document specifically details the assistance which may be provided by the FCDO in relation to obtaining information from the other jurisdiction where the person to be protected is located. </span></p>

Great care should be taken when considering whether any additional guidance should be issued by the Court, and to ensure that it does not conflict with the Presidential Guidance and is appropriate for all situations to which it might apply. In the FCDO&#8217;s experience, both the individual facts of cases where young people wish to be returned to the UK and the law and practice of other jurisdictions can vary considerably.&#8217;</span></p>

Such activities will however always be subject to the requirements of the domestic law of the country in question. The Foreign Secretary has discretion in deciding how to conduct international affairs, and the court cannot order the FCDO to exercise consular assistance. There is no general duty for the FCDO to provide consular assistance to British nationals. There may be limits to what the FCDO can do to help when a dual national child is in the country of their other nationality. </span></p>

Such a framework would need to be one of extraordinary flexibility if it were to be capable of application in every case, in each part of the world where these problems have arisen and will continue to arise. At present, it would also need to be entirely consistent with the guidance documents referred to above, and the product of input and consensus from all parties concerned.</span></p>

For this bespoke approach to be successful, however, all of the agencies which may become involved do need to be fully aware of their responsibilities and powers, and willing to engage without reluctance once the circumstances requiring intervention have been established.</span></p>

It is also clear (with Mr Gupta KC) that cases invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court relating to children, or where an application for a Tipstaff Order is applied for, must be commenced in the Family Division of the High Court, as the Family Court has no jurisdiction. Thereafter, it may become appropriate for cases to be transferred to the Family Court if residual issues no longer require them to remain in the High Court.</span></p>
