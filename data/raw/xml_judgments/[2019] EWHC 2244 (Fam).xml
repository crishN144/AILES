	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the light of X&#8217;s denial of paternity the mother asks me to revisit my decision as to the disclosure that H is not C&#8217;s father.  I decline to do so.  All the reasons that I set out in my first judgment still pertain.  It is only a matter of time, probably fairly short time, before somebody says to C that H is not his father.  Too many people know for the matter to be kept hushed up. There is no prospect of this issue being smoothed over and it remains far better that it is managed so as to minimise the potential damage to C.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">X&#8217;s answer has not eased my task.  It means that if C was to be told the whole truth he must be told that whilst his mother has named X as his father, X denies it.  This brings with it the scope for C to feel abandoned and rejected.  Those feelings may or may not be mitigated by the fact that H has, since June, reached the decision that he still wishes to remain in all senses C&#8217;s psychological father. </p>

That is wrong.  I expressly left it open as my judgment makes clear, particularly at paragraph 53.   </p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Much of the debate during this hearing has been about the effect and impact of X&#8217;s answer.  Plainly, if he had said that he accepts that he is the biological father and wanted to play a part in C&#8217;s life, it would have been very easy to decide that C should be told who X was at or about the same time that he was told that H was not his biological father.   </p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There are arguments both ways.  The father and the guardian argue that C should be told of X&#8217;s identity as part of the same process and that a two stage process separating the two strands, namely that H is not his biological father and the identification of X, would be harmful to C.  It is, they say, inevitable that C would ask at an early stage who X is and that H and the mother must be equipped to introduce X&#8217;s identity to C.   </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother says that I should stop the whole process because, she asks, how would C make sense of being told that X is named by his mother as his biological father but that X denies it.  Better by far, she says, to let his childhood continue with two adults as his devoted parents until such time as he fully understands the facts of life and would be able to comprehend the truth.   </p>

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The difficulty of the decision is enhanced by the fact that I can have little confidence that H&#8217;s use of the information of X&#8217;s identity when revealed would be in C&#8217;s best interests.  As I set out at paragraph 52 of my earlier judgment his anger and his desire for revenge cause me considerable concern.  He gave me little comfort in this hearing when he said that he would undertake not to use the information he gained <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">solely</span> (my emphasis) from these proceedings elsewhere.  Having said that he thinks he already knows the identity of X it is predictable that he might argue that identifying X in these proceedings does no more than confirm what he already knows.   </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not think it is a foregone conclusion that C would want to know X&#8217;s identity immediately upon being told that H is not his father.  It may be that at least for some time he would be satisfied with the knowledge that he has two adults in his life fulfilling the role of parents and to whom he is deeply attached.  Thus, it is said that C should only be told of X&#8217;s identity when C makes it clear that he wants to know who </p>

I disagree and refer to paragraphs 47 and 53 of that judgment.  At that time I did not, of course, know how X would respond.  Now that response has been received and Ms Ware&#8217;s appointment agreed, it is appropriate that the person on the ground who will know when C is ready and wants to know X&#8217;s identity should choose the moment.  </p>

That is a matter I have taken into account, as I have H&#8217;s statement that he will not believe the truth of what the mother says without a DNA test of X, which I have no power to order.  These are complicating factors, but I am confident that the course that I am taking is the least bad alternative.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Just the day before this hearing H issued an application for permission to take C overseas to France for a week&#8217;s holiday at the end of August 2019.  His request for such a holiday had been made through solicitors some days before the application.  The application was opposed by the mother on two principle grounds.  I can dispose of the second quickly:  she complained that C would be exposed, if taken to H&#8217;s holiday home, to a lot of very unpleasant gossip about her.  It is true that H had recruited many of the staff to make statements which are highly critical of the mother.  Bearing in mind that he is not actively pursuing an application for residence it is hard to see what the purpose of the statements was.  But, I have no reason to think that the makers of the statements would vent their criticisms of the mother before C and I have no doubt that if C was to go on holiday to France with his father he would have an enjoyable time as he has in the past, including last in February 2019.   </p>

The risk is that H, who feels so strongly about matters in this case, might remove C to where both he and his family have their main base.

I cannot assume that H&#8217;s emotions might not get the better of him and cause him to behave in a way that he claims now not to intend. </p>

I have read and re-read the report of Ian Edge.  True it is that a nonbiological father has no rights under the system of law that operates in the UAE but there is a weighty presumption that a child is legitimate.  If H was to claim that he was the father it appears to me from what I have read that there would be a substantial mountain for the mother to climb.  As an adulteress she could not take the risk of participating in UAE proceedings and she might well in consequence be regarded as a wholly unsuitable mother.   </p>
