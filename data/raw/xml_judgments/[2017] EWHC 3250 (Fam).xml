They married there in 2002; they lived in the city of Shiraz, and the mother describes the father as being from an influential tribe (Ghash Ghahaei) in that region of southern Iran.  The family moved to England in or about 2003, and sought asylum here.  They were granted asylum in 2009.  The two children of the family, the subjects of these proceedings, were born to the marriage in England.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother describes the marriage as abusive from an early point, certainly from the moment the parties arrived in this country. She asserts that the father was constantly intimidating and bullying towards her, and in due course the children; she describes at length in her statements her own distress, and the upset and fear of the children, caused by his behaviour.  On the written evidence of both parents (i.e. also taking account the October 2014 statement of the father) it appears to me that the marriage was volatile; on multiple occasions the police were called out to deal with incidents of alleged domestic abuse within the home.  I have seen extensive police CRIS (Crime Reporting Information System) records which generally tend to support the mother&#8217;s account in her written evidence.  At times the mother sought sanctuary with the children in a refuge, though invariably they returned to the father.  The mother says that she developed symptoms of depression, which she felt only seemed to aggravate the father&#8217;s taunts and abuse.  In 2013, the mother issued divorce proceedings, but discontinued the same, she maintains, on the father&#8217;s promise to modify his behaviour.  The proceedings were revived in 2014. At or about that time, the parties travelled to Iran.  There is a dispute as to the purpose and details of that trip. According to the mother, the father promised not to defend the divorce proceedings if she agreed to accompany him to Iran with the children; the father maintains that it was a routine holiday although separately (and inconsistently with this) states that in Iran his life was in danger as he had &#8216;illegally&#8217; converted to Christianity</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once in Iran in 2014, the mother claims that the father removed the children from her care, and he attempted to prevent her from leaving the country.  She asserts that she did in fact manage to leave covertly, with the children in tow.  She said that she partly disguised herself in, and hid the children under, a chador to do so.  The father followed the mother back to the UK; an inevitable confrontation ensued, and with the assistance of police and local authority the mother was once again relocated to a hostel. When interviewed by the police at that time (25 August 2014), the father is recorded as having asserted that: &#8220;in Iran it is easy for a man to get custody.  All is needed is for them to go to a court and then confirm it with the police&#8221;.  This is a point which he emphasised in his later witness statement in the Family Court; he denied, however, that he intended to do this.</p>

The mother had also applied for, and obtained, a prohibited steps order to restrain the father from removing the children from her care and control and from the jurisdiction; the father gave undertakings in this regard too.  The father issued proceedings under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> for contact.

The mother, fearful that this represented a further plan to remove the children from her care, reported her concern to the Hammersmith police.  The police took no action.  A few days later the mother received a telephone call from the children&#8217;s school to inform her that the father had not brought the children into school that day, nor on the previous day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It transpired that in breach of the earlier prohibited steps order, the father had left London with the children, and travelled to southern Iran, taking a convoluted route almost certainly to avoid detection in transit &#8211; via Liverpool, Dublin, Dubai, and Tehran (not initially at least to his home city of Shiraz).  The mother reported the children as missing to the Hammersmith police, and promptly made an application (albeit without the benefit of legal aid, while the Legal Aid Agency equivocated over the merits of her case) to the court for a location order.  Moylan J (as he then was) granted this order, though regrettably it was, of course, too late; the children were already in Iran by the time the case was heard, and they remained there, without contact with their mother, for the next seven months.  The children&#8217;s British passports were still in the custody of the mother&#8217;s previous solicitors following the earlier court process; the mother made the reasonable assumption based in part on what B had reported (confirmed later by the Iranian Embassy) that the father had obtained Iranian substitutes without her knowledge or consent.  </p>

In this endeavour, she was assisted by the abduction team of the Foreign and Commonwealth office, and by the British Embassy in Turkey.  </p>

He appears determined, according to the mother, that she be punished for removing the children from his care and from Iran. The father has contacted the school which the children used to attend in London seeking information about their whereabouts.</p>

If this happens, it is a near-certainty that the mother&#8217;s relationship with the children would cease, and she would never be able to retrieve them again.  By her actions in rescuing the children in the way she did in 2016, the mother has essentially forfeited her right ever to try to enter Iran again.   As earlier indicated (see [15] above), the father is believed to have obtained a custody order in Iran, he is actively pursuing criminal proceedings against the mother for the offence of kidnap, and there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest there.</p>

Forename or surname, it seems to me, the principles are the same, in general. A child has roots. A child has names given to him or her by parents. The child has a right to those names and retains that right, as indeed, the parents have rights to retention of the name of the child which they chose. Those rights should not be set to one side, other than for good reasons&#8230; &#160;Having said that, one has to recognise, in reality, that names do change. Children acquire nicknames and even nicknames sometimes take over from the name that they were given as their chosen name. Children do have diminutives and they may themselves, as they get older, prefer their third name to their first name and choose to be called by it.&#8221;</p>

Back in Iran, there is every prospect that the children would be subjected to physical and emotional abuse which they ostensibly reliably claim they experienced in 2016; they would return to an education system which they found to be inaccessible by reason of language and culture.  Quite apart from abduction, while the family remain in this country, they (particularly the mother) remains in my view highly vulnerable to attack from the father and in a state of hypervigilance and stress.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have alluded to in [42] above, I am conscious that the remedies sought by the mother represent significant infringements to the father&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s rights; parental responsibility is an important status of the adults and child concerned (see [40](i) above).  The change of the children&#8217;s surname and forenames will equally represent a significant and total severance with their past: &#8220;the blood of the name&#8221; will cease to flow in their veins (per Lord Jauncey: see [34] above); it will deliberately expunge traces of their father&#8217;s familial line. But in my judgment both remedies, while extreme, are necessary and proportionate to achieve the objective of ensuring the mother and children&#8217;s safety and emotional and physical well-being.  Relying on no more than the indisputable facts set out at [44] above, it is reasonably evident that the father has brought about this exceptional situation by his own misconduct.  Roberts J has already imposed orders which are binding on the current and former schools, and on the local education authority prohibiting them from disclosing any information about the children to the father; my order will enlarge this restriction on the exercise of parental right very considerably.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even if the children were not so content, the risk of harm to them, objectively assessed, is so significant in my view that this would have been likely to weigh heavier in the overall evaluation.  I am acutely conscious that this outcome essentially deprives these children of the benefits of a relationship with both of their parents; the significance of this cannot be under-estimated (see [40](vii) above). But that is not a relationship which can be safely conducted now; and it would be contrary to the emotional interests of the children for the possibility of it to remain open.  The children&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights to respect for their private and family life must take precedence over those held by their father (per <span style="font-style:italic">Yousef v The Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 210" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 210</ref>). </p>
