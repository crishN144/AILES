After extensive investigations, second opinions and independent expert evidence (solicited in these proceedings), the Trust have concluded that continued ventilation and clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH), is no longer in XY&#8217;s best interests. They seek declarations to that effect. Though I will return to the medical evidence, in detail, below, it is important to note that all the experts support the conclusion that drives this application. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Whilst in hospital, XY suffered a cardiac arrest. Dr A, Professor of Intensive Care Medicine and Consultant Intensivist, told me in evidence that had this occurred in the community, it is highly unlikely that XY would have survived. Resuscitation attempts were ultimately successful in restoring spontaneous circulation but XY sustained multi-organ failure over the subsequent days with renal, hepatic, gastro-intestinal and cardiac dysfunction, requiring intense support, including renal replacement therapy in the form of diafiltration. In the weeks that followed and as brain swelling reduced, there was progressive improvement and stabilisation of organ function, including kidney. Unfortunately, as XY was weaned from sedation, it became all too clear that there was a significant hypoxic ischemic brain injury, manifest as seizure activity and an absence of any meaningful response to environmental stimulation. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The treating clinicians were also able to be effective in managing the seizure activity, which responded to anti-epileptic medication. However, as XY has emerged from coma, in consequence of the withdrawal of sedation, the treating medical team has formed the clear opinion that he does not demonstrate any features of awareness or volitional purposeful activity. This condition has been, historically, categorised as a &#8216;persistent vegetative state&#8217;. It is a term which has been used in the case papers and in evidence, it excites a great deal of distress in families of patients in this condition. I watched as this family recoiled from the term. It has a dehumanising connotation which is, in my view understandably, perceived as offensive to the dignity of the patient. Both Professor Wade and Dr A are clear that it is not a term that illuminates anything diagnostically. These days, the consensus amongst the medical profession is that prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC) is a continuum which it is unnecessary, artificially, to demarcate by labels. XY, in the view of all the doctors involved in his treatment, is at the lowest point on the spectrum of prolonged disorders of consciousness. That is all they are required to say on this point. Given the wide medical consensus that I have referred to, the time has surely come to consign the phrase, &#8220;persistent vegetative state&#8221; to the past. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> XY&#8217;s children believe that their father has a greater level of awareness than do the doctors. They point to the fact that they spend many hours with him and the doctors see him much less frequently. They have taken videos which they believe demonstrate XY&#8217;s capacity to respond to command by making finger movements. XY undoubtedly has the capacity for reflex reaction but the doctors do not believe that he has any sentient neurological functioning. It is important to emphasise the respectful, courteous relationship between the family and the treating clinicians. Both have spontaneously and authentically paid tribute, each to the other, recognising the sincerity of different perspectives as to where XY&#8217;s best interests lie. Ultimately, XY&#8217;s family hope for a degree of recovery that the medical evidence simply cannot sustain. They go further than this however, they believe in the capacity of Allah to perform miracles. They further believe that questions of life and death lie entirely in the hands of Allah and not a doctor or a judge. </span></p>

It seems likely that XY already had a degree of cerebrovascular disease, attributable to a very heavy smoking history, hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and existing coronary artery disease. Dr Bell considered that this history contributed to the extent of the neuronal death and has, in turn, compromised any potential for recovery of neurological function. Dr Bell was clear that XY is extremely unlikely to make any progression on the spectrum of PDOC and will remain in his present condition. The prognosis for his survival i.e., as opposed to neurological recovery, is entirely predicated on the provision of sustained treatment in the form of assisted ventilation, clinically assisted nutrition and hydration and control of the underlying disease. He is also vulnerable to infective complications generated by the various tubes attached to him which, inevitably, breach the epithelial barrier. </span></p>

Understandably, the family have interpreted this as an improvement in XY&#8217;s general condition. However, all the doctors are clear that this is of no neurological significance, the responsive reactions being entirely generated by the spinal cord. The increased profusion has also improved organ function which is an improvement.

Dr A, whilst clear that XY is probably beyond pain, given his negative responses to pain tests and EEG results, nonetheless emphasises the burden of his ultimately futile treatment. XY has an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. He receives nutrition and hydration via a nasogastric tube. He has no effective cough and, in consequence, requires very regular deep suctioning of his bronchi. In addition, he requires to be turned frequently to avoid pressure sores. He is provided with intensive skin management. It is a testimony to the nursing care that he has remained largely free from bedsores since his admission eight months ago, though I note that the situating of the endotracheal tube has created sores on his cheeks. The suctioning carries with it unavoidable micro aspiration which has generated infections. These have responded to anti-biotic treatment. XY is colonised with klebsiella, pseudomonas and c difficile. This has caused episodic bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea. XY is doubly incontinent. He also suffers from increased contractions to the limbs, which is an inevitability due to his inability to move. </span></p>

Given the high degree of medical consensus amongst all the doctors involved, which I think can properly be described as unanimous, I invited Dr A to give evidence with Professor Wade having the opportunity to comment as the evidence proceeded (the procedure known as &#8220;hot tubbing&#8221;). Professor Wade agreed that XY&#8217;s organs, particularly his kidneys, have demonstrated recovery and for the reasons that Dr A indicated. He was, I think, really addressing his remarks to the family when he emphasised that unlike the other organs, the brain does not have capacity to recover. This is a concept that many families struggle with. The damaged cells are nerve cells (brain cells) known as neurons and neurons cannot regenerate. Having regard to the extensive brain injury in this case, Professor Wade concluded that the family&#8217;s hope that XY could be given further opportunity to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;recover&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> was entirely forlorn.

The danger in this, I am afraid, is that it risks generating confusion, misunderstanding and letting in the inevitable human tendency to filter only the perceived positives. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Professor Wade is plainly not describing pain in the way that it would be experienced by a sentient patient. His description however, on the face of it, would appear to go further than Dr A&#8217;s view that XY is &#8220;probably&#8221; unable to experience pain. However, on a more detailed analysis, I do not think they are saying anything significantly different from each other. Dr A said that it is always important to have the humility to acknowledge the limitations of medical knowledge. In this sphere i.e., understanding the occurrence and/or the nature of pain, he recognised that there is a dimension in which doctors simply cannot be sure. In my view, the best that can be said is that A probably cannot experience pain but if he can, it is likely to be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;in the moment&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and qualitatively different from pain as it is generally understood. In endeavouring to be precise, I emphasise that I do not, in any way, minimise the significance of this possibility. Indeed, I recognise that it weighs heavily on all concerned with XY, not least his family. Again, in wholly unambiguous terms, Professor Wade considered that both ventilation and CANH should be stopped: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;continuing with any of the interventions will prolong his life and leave him experiencing potential pain daily, all without benefit&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

Professors Wade and A and Dr Bell eloquently articulate the consensus. There can be no doubt that from the medical perspective, continuation of the present treatment is contrary to XY&#8217;s best interests. Dr A, who has forged a close and mutually respectful relationship with XY&#8217;s family, considers that if the court were to take a contrary view of the Trust&#8217;s application, he would feel obliged to stand back from treating XY. He would be unable to reconcile such a course with his clinical ethics, he would regard it as doing harm with no prospect of benefit. I emphasise that he stated his position diffidently and self-deprecatingly. He also told me that there would be other clinicians who would be prepared to take a contrary course if the court authorised it. </span></p>

The short answer is that it is not, ultimately, the doctors or experts who determine cases. Judges are required to survey a much broader canvas of P&#8217;s life than the treating clinicians are able to. Central to this is the obligation to analyse the available evidence of P&#8217;s beliefs, faith and the code by which he or she lived their life, in order to establish, with as much clarity as possible, what they might have wanted, by way of treatment, if they found themselves in this parlous condition. Every case is inevitably highly fact specific. The concept of &#8216;best interests&#8217; is far wider than the purely medical. </span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221; </span></p>

In this context, however, i.e., in an investigative, non-adversarial, sui generis process, such a constricted approach lacks the necessary nuance. It is medically impossible to exclude the possibility of pain in H&#8217;s case. There is no test, there can be, in the case of a young child, no formal assessment. The conclusions reached are based on observations alone to establish a negative i.e., what is thought not to be there.

In this achievement, they have conferred dignity on XY&#8217;s situation which, for some of the reasons I have referred to above has, on occasions, been tested. </span></p>

I have heard from four of his children and his wife. All the children have, at some point, been in the court room and also his youngest grandchild, still a baby, who has been impeccably behaved. XY is and has been a remarkable man. He has had an unslakeable thirst for life and a striking generosity of spirit. He was, for many years, a chef who thoroughly enjoyed his work. He took pride in the quality of the dishes he prepared. He was fastidious about the quality of his food and grew his own vegetables from an allotment which he carved from unpromising ground over many years. Many of the vegetables he grows are seeds that he propagates himself, having bought them abroad, usually in Bangladesh. The food he prepares for his family is a manifestation of his love for them. He was aware of each of his children&#8217;s favourite dishes and would prepare them, unbidden, when he thought they were needed. His delight in his thirteen grandchildren has been every bit as great as that in his children. </span></p>

His local community was central to his life and he was quick to identify and help those in need. He attended the mosque daily, frequently five times per day. His Islamic faith was profoundly important to him. I sense that his prayers were for others rather than for himself.  He also did important humanitarian work providing water to remote villages in Bangladesh. It is not without poignancy that one of the central issues in this case is whether he now should be treated with hydration. </span></p>

The family is hardworking, articulate, and suffused with the same ethical principles that they have told me about in their father. It bears repetition that Dr A has, on a number of occasions, paid spontaneous and fulsome tribute to their kindness, not only towards A but more widely and particularly to the nursing staff. They have won the affection and respect of all those caring for XY. </span></p>

Inevitably, not all their thoughts are reasoned or, indeed, entirely consistent. They are a family who are grieving. BC was sometimes ambushed by his emotions as he tried to tell me about the code by which his father lived his life. On the last day of the hearing, XY&#8217;s wife came into the witness box to read a statement to me. She does not speak English fluently and had not intended to give evidence. M had discovered his mother writing a letter at seven o&#8217;clock that morning. She told him that she had decided that she wanted to write to the Judge. It was resolved that she would come into the witness box, read her own letter and M would translate it for her. For both, it was an emotional experience. The grief of XY&#8217;s wife was almost palpable. If I may say so, sad though XY&#8217;s circumstances are, he is fortunate to be greatly loved, not only by his extensive family but, as I have been told, by his wider community. </span></p>

This is also present in the Torah and has resonances in the Bible. Thus, it is a facet of each of the Abrahamic faiths. All the family share this belief. By this I mean that each of them told me that A would wish to continue in his present circumstances, even if in pain, because he would have known that he would continue to provide succour to his family. I have come to the very clear view that whatever their understanding of the medical evidence might be, the loss of A is unbearably painful to this family and dominates their response. F told me that if she were in XY&#8217;s position, she too would wish to endure similar circumstances to comfort her own children by her continued presence. I accept the sincerity of her statement and consider it reflected her honest position. It is argued by Mr Mant, Counsel on behalf of the family, that F&#8217;s reasoning is entirely consistent with the way XY has lived his life, putting his family first at every turn. I find this to be a sensitive and well-reasoned submission.</span></p>

I am extremely grateful to them that they were able to organise it and for a report on it by Dr B, Consultant Neurophysiologist, almost immediately. Dr B reached the following key conclusions: </span></p>

The conclusions illustrate that adaptive changes are not evidence of improvement or deterioration of neurological functioning. Nonetheless, the family is essentially challenging the medical view of XY&#8217;s neurological function. If the responses they see are more than merely adaptive, as they believe, then that must logically point to a greater degree of neurological functioning than the evidence otherwise suggested. For this reason, perhaps mainly for them, I considered it to be worthwhile to obtain this final piece of evidence. It is important to recognise, as Professor Wade emphasises, that the EEG report does not provide evidence as to whether A has changed significantly or whether any change is in a positive or negative direction. The EEG reveals no change. Professor Wade observes </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;font-size:12pt">&#8220;behaviourally [XY]&#8217;s level of response is so low that change for the worst, is probably not detectable&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;font-size:12pt">. Neither does Dr B&#8217;s report give definite evidence of XY&#8217;s awareness or responsiveness. The EEG does not provide evidence of this. All that can be said ultimately is that the EEG does provide good evidence of how severely limited XY&#8217;s level of behavioural responsiveness is. Finally, Professor Wade notes: </span></p>

Prof [A] felt that experiencing the pain would be unlikely. I agree that [XY] has evidence of damage to his midbrain and brainstem structures and function; for example, he needs ventilatory assistance, which indicates quite severe brainstem dysfunction. This is consistent with the hypothesis that even basic nociceptive sensations may not be experienced or perceived. The lack of any detectable response on the EEG is also consistent with this&#8221;.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;font-size:12pt">One option that was explored at great length was withdrawal of ventilation but reintroduction of CANH after a period of intermission, required for medical reasons. I need not burden this judgment with those reasons. There is agreement that XY would not be resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest. It was suggested that alongside this, there would be no antibiotic treatment for almost inevitable infection, consequent upon micro aspiration. I should say that this second option was contemplated by the family but I did not sense any real enthusiasm for it. Its primary objective was centred upon what XY might have wanted in the circumstances that he found himself. His inevitable death on this alternative plan would not be in consequence of a particular action by man but more easily reconcilable with his Islamic beliefs. It was not constructed as casuistry; it was a sincere endeavour to reconcile the severity of XY&#8217;s medical situation with the sincerity of his beliefs. Many people would recoil from XY&#8217;s present circumstances and profoundly wish to be released from them as quickly as possible. Where those wishes are identified, the Court of Protection is vigilant to promote the individual&#8217;s autonomy. However, the Court is similarly obliged to promote the autonomy of those whose views many might disagree with. The essence of autonomy is the promotion of an individual&#8217;s right to take their own decisions. The important proviso is whether those decisions are lawful or whether they require others to act in a way that represses their own autonomy, morally and ethically. </span></p>

Ms Paterson KC, Counsel on behalf of the Official Solicitor, highlighted an important dissonance in the reasoning underpinning the alternative plan. In their assertion that XY would have preferred to remain in this profound disorder of consciousness, from which their lies no recovery, the family have attributed to him a degree of awareness which, I have found, is not supported by the evidence. Accordingly, their view that he would choose his present situation to afford comfort to them is based on their false premise of what his situation actually is. The severe brain stem dysfunction that XY has sustained is consistent with the view that perhaps even basic pain sensations may not be experienced or perceived. The continuing lack of any detectable response on the EEG is also supportive of this. Thus, in a very real sense, A is no longer there for his family. Grief, by its very nature, sadly, sometimes alters both reasoning and perception. </span></p>

Those principles incorporate honesty, integrity, duty and love of his family, as well as humanity more generally. The &#8216;alternative plan&#8217;, as Ms Paterson identifies, is predicated on an inaccurate assumption. The responses that the family believe they see are misinterpretations. They superimpose upon XY, that which he cannot achieve or experience. The distortion of these relationships, at the end of XY&#8217;s life, especially in such a close and loving family, runs counter to everything that each of them believes in. Of course, I include XY centrally in this. It does not sit in any way comfortably with the man he has been or the integrity that he has shown throughout his life. I do not believe, from all I have been told, that he would wish those who he has loved to believe that he was still there with them, in any meaningful sense, when the awful truth is that he no longer is. </span></p>

In short, it generates harm, not benefit and is irreconcilable with his professional oath. I entirely understand why he has come to that conclusion and for my part, in the light of my analysis above, cannot see how he could have arrived at any other. I would emphasise that his commitment to XY and his family has been unfailing. </span></p>
