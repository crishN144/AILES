I am further told that those threshold criteria included that the mother has had an extensive history of mental health difficulties, that these health difficulties were compounded by a history of illegal drug taking and excess alcohol, which induced psychosis; that she had self-harmed and that there had been suicide attempts; that she had not always been compliant with medication and had been a psychiatric in-patient several times.  It was also said that her previous relationships had been volatile and that she had been involved in prostitution.  </span></p>

The application was heard by Mr. Justice Hedley.  His order is drafted very carefully.  He expressed the view that, on a summary assessment, SA was likely to be habitually resident in England and Wales and that, if this were so, the court would order a peremptory return of the child to this jurisdiction.  The court then invited the Spanish authorities, should they remove the child from the parents, to place her in the care of the Local Authority in this jurisdiction.  He went on to express the view that, if this was to happen, it would be lawful for the Local Authority to travel to Spain to collect the child and return here with her.  He further invited the Spanish Court, if involved, to transfer jurisdiction to the Courts of England and Wales pursuant to Article 15 of Council Regulation EC 2201 of 2003.  In terms of orders, he merely granted the Local Authority permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and gave the Local Authority permission to apply for a care order. </span></p>

She said she never had any intention of returning to the United Kingdom.  She had signed a long term tenancy agreement in Spain and had given up her tenancy in the United Kingdom.

She said she did not have to explain herself and that, if she did not register, that was her right.</span></p>

The mother and father had no connections with Spain, other than having spent some holidays there and the mother having studied Spanish GCSE.  The father makes it clear that he was not intending to move there permanently.  I find that the mother&#8217;s intentions were exactly the same.  They had not previously discussed moving to Spain.  They had not spoken to anyone about it.  They had not made any preparations in advance, such as studying the language further or obtaining jobs there.  They just bolted there to avoid the care proceedings.  Although the mother says that she established a permanent home there, it is important to remember that she abandoned it as soon as she felt threatened by Social Services.  </span></p>

She says on more than one occasion that she is in hiding.  She refers to the fact that she &#8220;can&#8217;t get a birth certificate or a passport&#8221;.  She goes as far as to say that she will go all over the world if necessary.  This evidence is important and it is the antithesis of habitual residence there.  She specifically says that she will just keep moving, as indeed she did, when the Local Authority got in touch with the Spanish authorities in Alicante.  </span></p>

She has, at least until she was recently caught, continued to claim income support in this jurisdiction.  You are only entitled to do that if you are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.  Under no circumstances can you claim if you are resident in Spain.  I very much doubt the mother&#8217;s statement that she will never return here, not even if she loses this case.  Time will, of course, tell.  I am not though going to make a finding of fact that she is habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  I do not need to do so, given that I am entirely satisfied that she is not habitually resident in Spain.  It may be that, at this particular moment in time, she is not habitually resident anywhere.  In effect, she is still on the run from this country.  Her attitude to registering SA&#8217;s birth would suggest that this is the case.  </span></p>

At present, the father does not have parental responsibility.  Given that I have found that the mother is not habitually resident in Spain, I find that SA was never habitually resident in Spain either.  She was just there because her mother was there.  If the mother had moved to France to avoid the Local Authority, SA would not have become habitually resident in France.  Her birth was not registered in Spain.  Her parents had deliberately fled from the address at which they had agreed they would reside so that the authorities in Spain did not know her whereabouts.  Her parents were on the run and, therefore, so was she.  </span></p>

First, I have not made a finding that her mother was habitually resident here at that time, so it is impossible to see how SA could have been habitually resident here either.  Second, at the time of her removal from Spain, she had never been physically present in this jurisdiction.  I will leave it for others to decide definitively whether or not a young baby can be habitually resident in this jurisdiction, even if she has not ever lived here.  I do not need to decide that issue.  I merely conclude that Celine was not habitually resident here at that point.  Nevertheless, as she was not habitually resident in Spain, the Hague Convention does not apply to this case.  It would not be possible to institute proceedings under that Convention to secure her return to Spain.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Local Authority was clearly alive to the need to secure SA&#8217;s move to this jurisdiction lawfully.  Alexandra Fletcher, a senior lawyer employed by Bridgend, said that the Spanish social worker, Jose Seiquer &#8220;seemed content that the order of 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2012 permitted the Spanish authorities to return SA to the Welsh social workers&#8221;.  She says that she was concerned about this comment, but Jose responded that he was aware that he needed to take his own legal advice and &#8220;had to be careful that he did things right within the law or else he could be fined&#8221;.  She says that she was left in no doubt that he knew he had to make sure that everything was done properly.  It is difficult to see what more Bridgend could do.  Nevertheless, I accept that there remains a doubt as to whether there was the appropriate authorisation.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am, however, equally clear that, if there was not the appropriate authorisation, this does not mean that I must return SA.  If there is a wrongful removal in a child abduction case, but the child was not habitually resident in the requesting State, there is no automatic return, as the Hague Convention does not apply.  There can, therefore, be no requirement for an automatic return here.   Since her arrival in this jurisdiction on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2012, SA has been physically present here.  As she was not habitually resident in Spain, Article 13 provides that jurisdiction is based on physical presence.  I am therefore satisfied that this court does now have jurisdiction.  </span></p>

In this case the proceedings were issued one day before SA arrived here.  It follows that I find the current proceedings are flawed.  The Local Authority must issue fresh proceedings.  I give leave for them to do so.  I will dismiss the current proceedings.  I request the Family Proceedings Court and then the County Court to transfer the new proceedings to the High Court as soon as possible.  Indeed, having made the findings that I have, I am sure that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the threshold criteria are made out and that interim care orders should be made.  </span></p>
