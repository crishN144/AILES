AB is now estimated to be 22 weeks pregnant and therefore the cut-off date under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Abortion Act 1967</ref> of 24 weeks is imminent. The fact of AB&#8217;s pregnancy first came to the attention of the Trust in mid-April 2019. I appreciate this is not at all, a straightforward case but it would have been in everyone&#8217;s interests, and most importantly AB&#8217;s if this application had been made sooner.  </p>

AB was born in Nigeria and came to the UK in around 2007. She was adopted at a very early age (a few days) by CD and has considered her to be her mother throughout her life.  I believe she lived with her mother and her grandmother for some time, and then with her grandmother and her mother close by, but came to live with her mother (CD) in 2017 after her grandmother died. She was evidently very close to her grandmother, and was very upset and confused when she died. AB attended special schools throughout her childhood in England, and has undertaken some courses at a local college </p>

As such characteristics include an approximate IQ of 35-49 and someone who functions at a level roughly equivalent of a 6-9-year-old. The cause of her disability is not known, and therefore it is not known whether it has a genetic cause.  It is also not known whether any members of her birth family have any psychotic condition, which is relevant for the assessment of risk in proceeding with the pregnancy. There is no suggestion that there is any fluctuation in her condition such as would lead to fluctuating capacity.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AB speaks both English and Igbo, but her English can evidently be difficult to understand. The Trust has gone to considerable efforts to ensure that they can fully understand her and explain matters to her in an appropriate way. I have not met AB or heard her speak, but it is clear from the notes of her conversation with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s agent, which I will refer to below, that her language and communication abilities are significantly impaired. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In addition, AB has a history of behavioural difficulties. She is currently prescribed Risperidone and sertraline to manage her mood and behaviour. When she does not receive these her behaviour deteriorates. Dr N explained that the fact that AB responds to risperidone suggests that she may suffer from some form of psychosis, and this becomes relevant when I come to the risks related to her giving birth.  These behavioural problems date back to when she was a teenager and have varied over the years.  Her behaviour on occasions can be very difficult to control and there have been incidents of her smashing a TV and breaking other things, this seems to happen when she does not get her own way and is upset. The particular incidents occurred after the death of her grandmother. There is also evidence that she finds it very difficult to sit still, although the reporting on this is inconsistent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AB&#8217;s behavioural problems are highly relevant to my decision, because they go to the question of what would happen to AB and the baby, if the termination did not happen. CD says that the Trust has overestimated AB&#8217;s difficulties and that she is more capable, and less of a risk to the baby than the Dr N and the Trust think. However, there is an email in the papers from CD to Ms S at the local authority in February 2018, i.e. well before the pregnancy, in which CD is asking for more support for AB. In this she describes AB as follows; </p>

As a result, the exit house key has to be hidden. At the least opportunity, AB would leave the home. At one instance, in X Road, AB left home on her own and I had to search for AB for one hour and found her in R market area. The reason being that I came back from night duty, and she let herself out when I was asleep. As AB grows older, she gets more assertive about wanting to go out and not stay indoors. AB has a history of self-harm, hence all knives including table knives are locked up to reduce her risk. She has in the past used a sharp knife to smash our glass top of our electric cooker because she was upset. So, the reality about AB is that she needs a 24/7 supervision and needs more care input as opposed to her current care plan.&#8221; </span></p>

When she returned to the UK in April 2019 it became apparent that she was pregnant. The circumstances of her becoming pregnant are unknown, but there is no doubt that she did not have the capacity to consent. Although I am not going to make any formal declaration of capacity to sexual relations at this hearing.  I understand the police are carrying out a safeguarding investigation. Although I do not wish to pre-empt the police investigation or any formal decision made by the local authority, I have no doubt having heard her that CD has nothing but AB&#8217;s best interests at heart and is devastated by the fact that she has become pregnant.  </p>

The second was with the additional assistance of the Speech and Language service at the NHS hospital, to ensure that the best means possible were used to communicate with AB. Professor X was also involved in the capacity assessments. He has expertise as the Chair of Intellectual Disability at the relevant hospital. The assessments covered capacity to litigate; to consent to sexual relationships; capacity to make decisions about psychiatric assessments; and capacity to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy.  </p>

All parties in these proceedings accept that AB does not have capacity in relation to any of the issues before me, and no one was asserting a case that she did have capacity to consent to sexual relations. It necessarily follows that the pregnancy was as a result of rape and that has some relevance when it comes to best interests.  </p>

However, Dr N&#8217;s evidence was also that on one of the afternoons AB was left in the team&#8217;s care and was unable to feed herself.  This may have been partly because of being in unfamiliar surroundings. She seems to be more independent in her current care home, although there is no suggestion that she can look after herself, or go out on her own.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">CD is a devout Roman Catholic of Nigerian (Igbo) heritage. She is strongly opposed to abortion and said that within the community it is never spoken about, and there is a real stigma to having a termination.  CD said that she was always opposed to AB having a termination, although there is some suggestion that at first, she accepted that it would be in AB&#8217;s best interests. However, when it became apparent that the Trust was contemplating AB&#8217;s having a termination, CD made clear that she was strongly opposed and that if AB did have a termination CD said would not be able to support her through that. On 16 May AB was accompanied by her aunt to the hospital with suitcases, and has been living in a care home since then. My understanding of CD&#8217;s position is that if AB did have a termination, she would have AB back home. CD&#8217;s evidence was strongly focused on AB&#8217;s interests, and CD&#8217;s concern that AB would be very upset by having a termination and not know what had happened to the baby.  </p>

Given that I do not think that this is the critical issue in the ultimate balance I will not rehearse that evidence in great detail.  If AB has the termination it will be undertaken under general anaesthetic and will involve a two-stage process. There will be some pain and discomfort but this will be manageable. There is no reason to believe there would be any complications.  </p>

All three Trust witnesses thought that the termination would be less traumatic for her than the baby being taken away. I note the particular expertise in this regard of Professor Z and Dr N, but take into account the fact that her mother is plainly the person who knows her best. Her mother thought she would be potentially very upset about the loss of the baby. This is one of the real unknowns in the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">If she did have the baby then the likelihood would be it would be by caesarean section. Ms T was concerned about ante natal treatment for AB given her behavioural problems. Although I am sure that this would be very professionally managed, and would almost certainly be manageable, I was struck by Ms T evidence that she had never managed a pregnancy with someone with as severe learning difficulties as AB. This was equally the case for Professor X and Dr N. Ms T was concerned about how AB would cope after the caesarean given that it is major abdominal surgery. It seems to me that this adds to the risk of AB suffering a very traumatic experience after the birth, but if other factors led to a conclusion that she should have the baby would not be an insuperable issue.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr N gave evidence about the risk of postpartum psychosis. This is a very serious psychotic condition which would need to be treated with anti-psychotic medication and almost certainly in-patient treatment in a psychiatric unit. The impact of having such an episode should not be underestimated. The very experience can leave lifelong effects on patients and the impact of being admitted as an in-patient to a psychiatric hospital suffering a psychotic episode would be extremely traumatic for AB. The difficulty is that it is almost impossible to assess the likelihood of this happening. However, I did feel that both the Official Solicitor, and Mr McKendrick on behalf of CD, although less in his closing, underplayed the consequences for AB of taking the risk of AB&#8217;s mental illness being exacerbated by giving birth and the baby being taken away. This is an issue where the lack of capacity is very important. In expressing her wishes and feelings AB has no understanding of the risk she would be taking with her mental health if she proceeded with the pregnancy. I am the person who has to put myself into her position, to try to determine what she would decide, see the Aintree case to which I refer below.  </p>

I will read one extract, but there is much more. Mr McKendrick relied heavily on this. He referred me to parts where AB spoke on a number of occasions about wanting the baby and wanting to live with the baby, of the baby needing pampers, of it having milk and of her having some understanding that she would need help with the baby. I think it does show that SA has some understanding of a baby&#8217;s needs and probably of her inability to meet those needs, but not very much more than that.  </p>

But the very nature of her lack of capacity is that she does not have a full (or actually on the evidence very much) understanding of the nature of the decision. Ms S&#8217;s evidence was that her attitude to the baby fluctuates. From the Official Solicitor&#8217;s agent&#8217;s attendance note, she has no understanding, either of the birth process or more importantly what happens next. She has no idea that the baby is unlikely to be able to live with her, the consequences for her relationship with her mother, the potential mental health impact, or the emotional and psychological issues that arise. Her perception of the situation seems to be of the baby as an object, like a nice doll. </p>

Holding a baby for a few minutes and enjoying being with it may well have been a highly pleasurable experience for AB, as it is for many people, but it gives her absolutely no insight into what will happen to her life if this baby is born or the realities of living 24/7 with a small baby, or a toddler growing up.  </p>

The need for a judicial view on a point which might be seen to be pre-judging the care proceedings was, in my judgment, inescapable. My view, which I expressed at the hearing and which was embodied in my order (see below) was that there was &#8220;very little chance&#8221; that X would be able to keep her baby if it was born.

The evidence shows that she struggles to understand that she is pregnant or indeed what that means. She certainly cannot process the information about either the pregnancy, or giving birth, or the consequences of having a baby, whatever those might be. She cannot understand or process and weigh up the information she is given. Therefore, she falls within s.2(1)(a) and (c). This finding applies to all the relevant capacity questions. </p>

I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the state to order someone to have a termination, where it appears that they do not want it, is immensely intrusive and certainly interferes with her Article 8 rights. However, the very nature of the MCA is that the court is given the duty of deciding enormously difficult decisions which the individual may well not agree with, for the very reason that the individual does not fully understand the decision to be made.

CD accepts AB cannot be left alone, and could not be left alone with the baby. It was CD who raised the risks that AB posed to herself in the email in 2018. There is a world of difference between liking babies when they belong to someone else and live somewhere else and when they are living with you 24/7. I think it unlikely that the local authority would be able to tolerate the risk to the baby of living with AB. Therefore, if CD seeks care of the baby the consequence is likely to be that AB could no longer live with her mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">This is the point where I do not accept Mr McKendrick&#8217;s submissions. In terms of predictability of impact I think it is likely that AB would suffer great trauma from the baby being removed, that is the known experience of most women. It will be a real baby which she will probably have met and touched, and it will go. In contrast the pregnancy although real to her, does not have a baby physically before her, and the impact is in my view likely to be. As Ms Paterson puts it the baby is not a physical presence. The psychiatric evidence is that AB thinks in immediate and concrete terms. This also means that I reject Mr </p>

It does not seem likely to me that AB would understand such an idea in the abstract, and the removal of the baby would be deeply traumatic for her.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I accept that AB&#8217;s family may find her having the baby and it being removed more acceptable than termination, and therefore might be able to support her more if the baby was removed. However, I think hearing CD&#8217;s evidence she will support her daughter either way, and wider familial acceptance and support is too nebulous for me to put weight on.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">The Official Solicitor placed considerable reliance on this in his closing submissions. However, firstly, AB would still have the trauma of the baby taken away from her, within hours or perhaps a day or two in hospital. For most mothers this process is highly upsetting. Secondly, this might allow her to maintain contact and stay with CD, but this is highly speculative. It is equally likely the child would be placed for adoption and AB would have no, or only the most limited contact. Thirdly, the risk of psychiatric impact remains.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The Official Solicitor argues that allowing the pregnancy to continue and AB to have the child, would allow her to have the child born alive and then potentially to maintain contact with it. I accept that this might be a vindication of AB&#8217;s right to have a child, but I wonder the degree to which the Official Solicitor is imposing a philosophical judgement in the abstract of a person&#8217;s rights, in circumstances where the focus must under the law be on a real individual and a real set of risks and benefits. It is also effectively unknowable, whether in </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">AB&#8217;s wishes and feelings are plainly a relevant consideration. There are cases where wishes and feelings would be determinative, even where the person had no capacity. If AB&#8217;s wishes and feelings were clearly expressed and I felt she had any understanding (albeit non- capacious ones) of the consequences of giving birth, I would give them a great deal of weight. However, AB&#8217;s wishes are not clear. She likes being pregnant, she would probably like to have a baby, but she has no sense of what this means. As I have said I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll. I just do not feel I can give very much weight to those expressions of wishes and feelings. I also take into account that she has no idea of the risks with her mental health that she would be taking by continuing with the pregnancy.  </p>
