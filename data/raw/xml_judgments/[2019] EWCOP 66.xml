Subject to the issue of disclosure of the report sought by the police, this investigation is concluded.  I am told by Mr Palmer, who appears for the police today, that if the expert had concluded that AB lacked capacity to access the internet and social media, it is likely the criminal proceedings would be discontinued against AB.  Furthermore, if the court declined the police&#8217;s application for disclosure, then the police would instruct their own expert to undertake a capacity assessment of AB.   </p>

This third report does not deal with the question of whether AB had capacity on this issue in 2017 and 2018, the period covered by the index offences for which AB is charged.  Accordingly, in my judgment, that third report contains nothing of relevance to the police investigation other than for the police to know that: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in">It is, in my judgment, supremely important that those who are the subject of the Court of Protection are as frank as they possibly can be to those who are seeking to assess them and, accordingly, I would only consider disclosing the expert&#8217;s report to the police if the weight to be given to the public interest was so great as to outweigh the consideration of frankness by AB in the Court of Protection proceedings.  As it is, I have come to the conclusion that the expert&#8217;s reports are not relevant to the issue that the police have to determine for the purposes of the prosecution of AB, namely between 2017 and 2018, did AB have capacity to access the internet and social media?  As I have already said, the expert does not address that issue in any of her reports.  Accordingly, the application is refused. _________</p>
