During the course of the proceedings her position has changed.  By the end of the hearing she was seeking either (i) a declaration that the marriage was valid in reliance on the presumption of marriage based on a ceremony followed by cohabitation and, if the marriage is found to be valid, a decree of divorce; or (ii) a decree of nullity on the basis that the failure to comply with certain requirements of Syrian law is such that the marriage is not valid but is sufficient to entitle the Petitioner to a nullity decree.</p>

A few days before the ceremony in August 2007, the Petitioner had a traditional Henna party.  The ceremony itself, which was organised by the Respondent, was a large family wedding with members of both her family and the Respondent&#8217;s family (his parents and four of his brothers and sisters) attending.  During the ceremony they exchanged wedding rings and signed the marriage register.  There is a video and photographs of the ceremony, the latter having been put in albums, one with the name &#8220;Wedding Album&#8221; appearing on the front.</p>

The Petitioner later applied for a spousal visa after the Respondent had returned to England.  She applied there because the Embassy in Damascus was effectively closed.  When she and the Respondent went there at Easter 2007 they were told they would have to go to another Embassy.</p>

However, in order for a valid marriage to have taken place under Syrian law, as applicable to this case, permission would have had to be obtained from the Ministry of the Interior as the Respondent is not a Syrian national.  In addition, the general requirements as to the registration of the marriage would have had to be fulfilled.  It is accepted by both parties that these steps were not taken.  Importantly, Ms Khan states that &#8220;permission can be obtained as part of the registration process following the marriage&#8221;.

In advancing this submission, Ms Bhutta relies in particular on the evidence given by Ms Khan that the Syrian attorney whose opinion she has sought states that Syrian law has no concept of void/voidable/non-marriage and that the marriage is &#8220;non-approved&#8221;.  She submits that I should follow <span style="font-style:italic">Burns</span> and decide that, as a matter of English law, the Petitioner is entitled to a decree of nullity.</p>

He sensibly accepts that the weight of the evidence points to the ceremony having been a ceremony of marriage but submits that it is no more than a religious ceremony, the parties having failed to comply with the requirements of Syrian law to effect a valid marriage.  He also submits that the parties knew that the ceremony was of no legal effect under Syrian law.  The Respondent had been told this by the British Embassy in Damascus and the Petitioner was aware of this.</p>

Mr Daniels submits that the Petitioner&#8217;s evidence and her actions after the ceremony in 2007 do not support her case that she and the Respondent were intending to live together in England as a married couple.  Why, for example, he asks did she not come to England until November when she obtained her spousal visa in September?</p>

When being questioned by his own counsel he first said that he had played no role in the Petitioner&#8217;s application for a visa before saying that he had written a letter or letters in support, limited to stating that he would provide accommodation.  When being questioned by the Petitioner&#8217;s counsel about his alleged marriage in 1999, the Respondent first said that he had no recollection of a church ceremony and could not say whether the photograph produced by Archbishop Dawod was of him and FA without looking at the original.  The copy of the photograph is very clear and the Respondent almost immediately changed his evidence saying that he did recall the church ceremony and that it was a blessing.  When being cross-examined about the nature of the 2007 ceremony he agreed that it could well be the same as weddings he had attended.  He also admitted signing the church register.  In respect of the visit to the UK Embassy in Damascus in 2007, having asserted in his witness statement of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 that he had asked about the legal consequences of a &#8220;church blessing&#8221;, in his oral evidence the Respondent said he had asked about the consequences of a religious marriage.  </p>

There is, therefore, no reason for Archbishop Dawod to have provided the Respondent with what has been called the &#8220;Singlehood Certificate&#8221; dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2007 other than that he was asked to provide it by the Respondent to enable him to marry the Petitioner in a Syriac Orthodox ceremony.</p>

It is supported by the Church Register which the Respondent accepts he signed.  It is also supported by the photographs which depict what gives every appearance of being a wedding ceremony, as was effectively accepted by the Respondent during his oral evidence.  The Petitioner was able, without any apparent difficulty, to obtain a spousal visa which in my view also supports her case.  The Respondent lays great emphasis on the application being made in Istanbul rather than Damascus.  But he supported this application and the notes provided by the Home Office demonstrate that the authorities were given an explanation for the application being made in Istanbul.  If this explanation was false, as the Respondent asserts, it is difficult to understand why the application was processed so quickly.  An obvious lie like this would have been likely to alert the authorities to raise questions.  Further, as the application was supported by the Respondent, frankly, I find it unbelievable that he did not know and would not have expressly stated that he was supporting her application for a <span style="font-style:italic">spousal</span> visa.</p>

I should add that I specifically accept Archbishop Dawod&#8217;s evidence that the validity of the ceremony as a Syriac Orthodox ceremony is not affected by the identity of the witnesses.  I do not consider it necessary to decide whether the Respondent might have had some unspoken plan to seek to prevent the creation of a valid marriage by failing to comply with the registration requirements.  It is not necessary because the ceremony in which he freely participated was a marriage ceremony, as he well knew, and such an unexpressed intention could not alter the nature of the ceremony.</p>

I remain of the view that Ms Khan&#8217;s evidence, that the marriage is a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221;, is undermined by her comment that this is equivalent to an Islamic ceremony in the UK without steps having been taken to register the marriage under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref>.  As <span style="font-style:italic">MA v JA and the Attorney-General</span> demonstrates, this depends on all the circumstances of the particular case.  Further, as referred to above, to state baldly that a marriage is a non-marriage merely <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> a legal marriage has not been effected lacks sufficient reasoning especially when, as Ms Bhutta submits, it appears that Ms Khan may be conflating concepts of English and Syrian law.</p>

It was clearly recognised that the sentence itself effected nothing.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Hayes (falsely called Watts) </span>v. <span style="font-style:italic">Watts </span>(1819) 3 Phill. Ecc. 43,<span style="font-style:italic"/>a case in which the "marriage" had lasted 18 years but was said to be void ipso facto by statute for want of the father's consent, Sir John Nicoll, Dean of Arches, said: "&#8230; though the parties did intend to contract a valid marriage, yet either of them has a right to the benefit of a declaratory sentence.  No such sentence is necessary: but it is a matter of convenience to the parties that it should be given; and it is the duty this court owes to the public to declare the situation of the parties."  In <span style="font-style:italic">Bowzer </span>v. <span style="font-style:italic">Ricketts (falsely calling herself Bowzer)</span> 18 (1795) 1 Hag. Con. 213 Sir William Scott Ch., in a similar case, said,  214: "The marriage Act declares marriages in such cases to be ipso facto void - the sentence of the Ecclesiastical Court is declaratory only, it does not make them void."</p>

The critical difference is, of course, that if it is the former the Petitioner is entitled to a nullity decree and the remedies consequent on such a decree, while if it is the latter, she is not entitled to any remedies at all beyond perhaps a declaration that she and the Respondent are not married.</p>

Mr Moor says if it is not void in California, it cannot be void here, so no decree is obtainable.  Mr Scott says once invalidity is established, the role of the foreign law is largely exhausted and the lex fori, ie England, produces the necessary remedies.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.88in">&#8220;In my opinion, the question whether the marriage is void or merely voidable is for French law to answer.  My reasons are as follows: The validity of a marriage so far as regards the observance of formalities is a matter for the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci celebrationis</span>.  But this is not a case of forms.  It is a case of essential validity.  By what law is that to be decided?  In my opinion by the law of France, either because that is the law of the husband's domicile at the date of the marriage or (preferably, in my view) because at that date it was the law of the matrimonial domicile in reference to which the parties may have been supposed to enter into the bonds of marriage.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Brook </span>v. <span style="font-style:italic">Brook </span>9 H.L.C 193 a case in which the marriage in Denmark (by the law of which country, assuming it applied, it was valid) of two persons domiciled in England was held to be void on the ground that although the lex loci governed the forms of marriage its essential validity depended on the lex domicilii of the parties.  Lord Campbell L.C. said this at 207: "But while the forms of entering into the contract of marriage are to be regulated by the lex loci contractus, the law of the country in which it is celebrated, the essentials of the contract depend upon the lex domicilii, the law of the country in which the parties are domiciled at the time of the marriage, and in which the matrimonial residence is contemplated."  In the case of a void marriage, the matrimonial domicile contemplated will clearly be the same as that contemplated in the case of a voidable or non-voidable marriage, since the parties presumably intend to live together.  In the present case, the matrimonial domicile was clearly French, and it is, in my opinion, to French law that the question whether the marriage was void or voidable on the grounds alleged must be referred.&#8221;</p>

The only judge of the appeal court who had considered this issue, the others upholding the first instance decision that the marriage was valid, had dismissed this argument &#8220;with the curt observation that a putative marriage cannot be a marriage which is null&#8221;, pp. 87/88.

The reason for this is to seek to avoid changing a marriage from a void one to a voidable one and vice-versa because of their potentially different consequences.  However, the English court in determining the effect of the foreign law is applying &#8220;the words as understood&#8221; under English law.</p>

The case concerned a ceremony which had taken place in South Africa.  The evidence from the two South African legal experts adduced by the parties was, on one side, that the ceremony effected a valid marriage and, on the other side, that it effected a void marriage.  Bodey J preferred the evidence that it was a void marriage under South African law and found that, in South Africa, the petitioner would be entitled to a decree of annulment rather than divorce.  However, and despite the fact that the relevant defects were governed by South African law, being in respect of the formalities of marriage, Bodey J addressed the issue of whether the ceremony created a void (or voidable) marriage or no marriage at all.  Further, he determined this issue by reference to English law and English legal concepts and decided it had effected a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221; which did not entitle the petitioner to a nullity decree.  </p>

Counsel for the Petitioner argued that there was no such concept as a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221; in English law.  Counsel for the respondent contended that the ceremony was a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221; under English law:</p>

In concubinage and the like, no act of the requisite nature exists. In those places where a marriage requires a declaration before a registrar or priest, a private and secret declaration of consent does not create any kind of marriage, not even a void one &#8230; a void marriage is still a marriage in the sense that it has to be distinguished from the non-existent marriage or mere cohabitation of man and woman &#8230;&#8221;</p>

As referred to above, I consider that the effect of the expert evidence is simply that, as a legal marriage was not effected, there is no marriage.  It is clear that Syrian law has no separate concepts of a marriage being void or voidable or a non-marriage.  It would appear, in the circumstances of this case, that a marriage will either be legal or not legal &#8211; the marriage in this case is clearly not valid and has been described as being either a &#8220;non-approved&#8221; marriage or a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221;.  As described above, it would be simplistic merely to take the words &#8220;non-marriage&#8221; or even &#8220;non-existent&#8221; marriage and apply those words in an English law sense when Syrian law does not have the same terms.</p>

As referred to above, both parties knew they were participating in a marriage ceremony.  It was a ceremony which was capable of being made formally valid because permission could have been obtained as part of the registration process following the marriage.  It was a ceremony which was capable of conferring the status of husband and wife, if the parties had subsequently complied with the necessary formalities.  To adopt Coleridge J&#8217;s words, it is not &#8220;so deficient&#8221; that it can be described in English law terms as a &#8220;non-marriage&#8221;.  </p>
