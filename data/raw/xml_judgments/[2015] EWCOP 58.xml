		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;In May 2013 my father (Robin) and I noticed that Doreen had become increasingly confused and disorientated. We felt it necessary to contact the Emergency Mental Health Team, who advised us that Doreen needed to be admitted to a care home as soon as possible. During this time we made several phone calls and sent emails asking Lori to contact us urgently regarding her mother. It took almost 10 days before she responded. As it had become unsafe to leave Doreen in her own home, my father and I felt that we could no longer wait for Lori and we took the decision to admit Doreen to a place of safety. As we, as family members, found it difficult to contact Lori, I fear that the court and anyone else needing to contact her will also face such difficulties. As Lori resides in the USA, I have great concerns as to whether the court will be able to adequately supervise Lori so as to prevent any abuse of Doreen&#8217;s finances and ensure that all financial decisions are made in Doreen&#8217;s best interests.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the last few years Doreen and I have become very close and I am the first person she turns to if she has a problem. Over the last 2 years I have taken an active role in helping her to manage her finances. I co-ordinated her move from her council maisonette into a sheltered accommodation flat in May 2011. On behalf of my aunt I liaised with all parties concerned, including Oxford City Council, the removal company, rent/housing benefit department and the setting up of all required service providers with the relevant payment methods. My aunt and I have had many discussions about filing an LPA application or third party access for her bank accounts, but it was something we always &#8216;put off&#8217; for another time. It was during these many chats that my aunt and I discussed her savings in an ISA account. She told me that she had been subsidising her daughter&#8217;s monthly income for many years and because of this she did not want Lori to know about these savings. It has always been my aunt&#8217;s wish that I take care of her finances should she no longer be able to do so and, as I was effectively doing this, I assured her that I would be happy to do it. Doreen also made sure the rest of the family were aware of this.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of May 2013 Lori arrived in the UK to visit her mother. We arranged to meet to talk about the recent events concerning her mother. I explained that a few weeks previous I had felt it necessary to remove all of Doreen&#8217;s financial documents, passport, birth certificate, and credit/bank cards from her flat as the flat door was being left unlocked to allow the carers access, as Doreen could no longer manage to operate the locks on the door. We discussed her mother&#8217;s welfare and I informed Lori that I intended to apply for deputyship, as per her mother&#8217;s wishes. She seemed happy with this, as she was also aware that this had been her mother&#8217;s wishes. I am also the holder and executor of her will. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, when I told her that her mother had &#163;7,700 in an ISA account, her attitude towards me changed and she said she no longer wanted me to apply for the deputyship. This meeting took place at my home on the last day of her visit. The following morning I noticed that Lori had removed Doreen&#8217;s credit/debit cards, bank statement, passport and birth certificate from my home without my knowledge and took them back to the USA with her. During Lori&#8217;s visit she removed all valuables from her mother&#8217;s home and at no time did she make any effort to help pack up and dispose of anything else in the flat. Nor did she help with the terminating of the tenancy, contacting and closing all service provider accounts and handing back the keys, all of which was left to me to deal with.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was very shocked when Lori told me she no longer wanted me to apply for deputyship and she was going to do it herself. My aunt had never wanted her daughter to have control or knowledge of her money. Her fear was that, as she had been subsidising her income for many years, Lori would spend any money she knew her mother had. I believe that, had I not told Lori about the savings in the ISA account. She would not be applying for the deputyship now. I have concerns that Lori is knowingly acting contrary to her mother&#8217;s wishes. Lori has never been involved in her mother&#8217;s finances and therefore could not possibly know what her mother&#8217;s wishes and needs would be.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the above reasons I believe that to allow Lori deputyship would not be in her mother&#8217;s best interest and more importantly against her mother&#8217;s wishes. Although the wishes of my aunt would be that I would become her deputy, I no longer feel this is a viable option. Nor do I feel that making myself and Lori joint deputies is an option either.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, I ask the court to appoint the local authority, Oxfordshire County council, deputy to manage Doreen&#8217;s financial affairs. I believe that they would be best placed to make any decisions with regard to her finances and needs, and will always make these decisions with my aunt&#8217;s best interest in mind. I will of course be more than happy to be involved in any decisions that may need to be made with regards to her personal care and will of course continue to visit her weekly in the care home.&#8221;</p>

The reason why it was so difficult for Paula and Robin to contact Lori, when Doreen was unexpectedly admitted to hospital in May 2013, is that she and her husband were on vacation at the time.</p>

I do not feel that location should make a difference. If their concern is that there may be misappropriated handling of my mother&#8217;s finances I would say that could apply to everyone applying for deputyship, and living not only in England but in any country. It has saddened both me and my mother to read the accusations, speculation and lies that they have written, and I do not see that they have anything to prove that I would not take care of my mother&#8217;s finances in my mother&#8217;s best interests. I believe that I am the only one able to manage her request and wishes as she would want them to be handled. I have also had discussions with Oxfordshire County Council regarding the Council being appointed the deputyship and they informed me that they have sent a letter to the Court of Protection on my mother&#8217;s behalf.&#8221;</p>

Over the years she has given me money to help out with different things. &#8230; There was no subsidising of my monthly income in any way as Paula states in her objections.

I did offer to call Paula but mum said no as she didn&#8217;t want any trouble. It was a few weeks after this conversation that my mum and I were taking a cruise and she came to the USA. During her visit we at length discussed the situation with Paula. My mum was not happy. She said that Paula thought it would be a good idea if she went on my mum&#8217;s bank account in case anything should happen and they even went as far as going to the bank to get the powers of attorney papers. My mum told me that she did not sign them at the bank, as she wanted to think about it. Again she felt like she was being pushed into signing. My mum didn&#8217;t want to say anything to Paula to start any problems. Once back home it was decided that she was not going to put Paula onto her account and that she was not going to bring it up again. Hence that is why Paula was never made power of attorney,&#8221; </p>

Sometimes, they decide to stay at the home and spend the time chatting or, when it&#8217;s not raining, walking in the garden. They have their meals together. It is obvious that Doreen enjoys her daughter&#8217;s company because, even after Lori has returned to America, Doreen still talks very fondly about Lori&#8217;s visit.</p>

Although the Public Trustee concedes <span style="font-style:italic">Re Swain</span> stands for the proposition only that a committee &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ought</span> to be resident within the jurisdiction of the Court&#8221; [p. 614], it takes the position that this admonishment has never really been deviated from and ought to continue. I disagree. <span style="font-style:italic">Re Swain</span> and the cases therein referred to were decided in another era, at a time when communication and indeed travel were difficult and when many of today&#8217;s technological advances were not even dreamed of. Furthermore, that argument fails, in my view, to consider the requirement of the committee posting a security bond, something clearly contemplated in sections 2(2), 10(d) and 35(3) of the <span style="font-style:italic">Mental</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Incompetency Act</span>, RSO 1990, c M.9. Families today have a potential for being more widely spread out geographically and in my view strict adherence to <span style="font-style:italic">Re Swain</span> overlooks the realities of the 1990s. Such a strict adherence would, in my view, deny many people the opportunity of managing family affairs.&#8221;</p>
