The application is opposed by the Official Solicitor, who acts as litigation friend not only for LD but also for his mother KD, 42, who, by reason of mental ill health, also lacks capacity.

Concern about LD increased during 2007/2008 and there were reported incidents of anti-social behaviour to which police were called.

The court has on several occasions recorded that it is in LD&#8217;s best interests for him to have regular contact with KD.  That said, it is equally clear that she has needed much support herself, a proactive and creative approach by professionals seeking to engage her, and that she was frequently in conflict with those seeking to help LD.  Her own difficulties and the nature of her mental illness, combined at times with a lack of realism about LD&#8217;s needs, meant frequent conflict and disagreement between her and LD&#8217;s carers, with issues about his care, welfare and safety not always readily being resolved.</span></p>

Again, we accept the arguments of those respondents who pointed out that extended powers will sometimes still be needed.

Such orders can include relatively straightforward decisions (such as the sale of property), as well as major or difficult decisions (including some medical treatment decisions) or resolving disputes where people cannot agree (e.g. where an incapacitated person should live or who he/she should have contact with).  In deciding whether to grant permission for an application to be made for court intervention the court has to be satisfied that a court order or directions will benefit the person lacking capacity and it is not possible to resolve the matter without going to court.

However, the mother has demonstrated in the short time that she has enjoyed contact at [X] Court that she has become involved in disputes over LD&#8217;s feeding.  She attempted to persuade LD not to have contact with social workers and has breached the rules of the unit, e.g. inappropriate dress and entering other residents&#8217; bedrooms.  It may be possible for the court to make a declaration which would cover all eventualities in respect of contact.

Miss&#160;Trumpet, in her July 2008 statement, had spoken of KD&#8217;s &#8220;persistent negative beliefs regarding professionals&#8217; recommendations or suggestions&#8221; and her then conclusions that KD &#8220;will not engage in any care plan for any length of time&#8221;.  Dr.&#160;A, KD&#8217;s psychiatrist, was of the opinion in May 2009 that she was &#8220;very deluded and has been so for many years.

There is no suggestion he will return to his mother&#8217;s home or care at any point in the near future.  Historic concerns about her role in feeding are now precisely that and cannot be used to justify the appointment of a welfare deputy.  The reality is future feeding decisions will be a matter essentially for health professionals.  The director of Adult Social Care is unlikely to have any independent expertise or judgment in that realm.  Further, were at some point in the future surgical intervention by way, for example, of the insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to be required, the Official Solicitor, who has some professional experience of these issues, considers that such a decision would be likely to require the most careful consideration by relevant medical practitioners with appropriate multi-disciplinary input.  The protections and restrictions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 5</ref> and 6 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> will, the Official Solicitor argues, no doubt apply and, should a genuine dispute arise, that important medical decision should pre-eminently be a matter for determination by a court, rather than a representative of the local authority.  </span></p>

The Official Solicitor responded by pointing out that subsequent professional reflection confirmed the treatment was in fact not even required at that point.

The Official Solicitor was very aware of the potential for difficulty in relation to any &#8220;prohibition&#8221; of contact, arising under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/20/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(2)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and considered that a general authorisation of the local authority to regulate contact may in fact prove counter-productive, heighten KD&#8217;s feelings of exclusion and ultimately decrease the chances of a satisfactory re-establishment of contact between mother and son.</span></p>

It gave rise to precisely the kinds of issues and difficulties the Official Solicitor experienced in many, if not most, of the welfare cases in which he acted as litigation friend to an incapacitated person.  It was a very typical case in the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission.  Family members not acting in a patient&#8217;s best interests was not an unusual situation, especially where they themselves had mental health or other difficulties.  None of the issues of concern to which the local authority pointed in this case warranted the wholesale delegation to the local authority which was sought.

Mr.&#160;Norton shared the view of Miss&#160;Richards in relation to the discrete matters raised by the local authority.
