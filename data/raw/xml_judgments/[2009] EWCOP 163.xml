	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The entail was once the standard method by which the English aristocracy and landed gentry kept land in the family, as any reader of Jane Austen will know well. In <span style="font-style:italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> one reason for the desperate attempt to marry off the Bennet girls was that Mr Collins would inherit the estate under an entail. Even then the entail was not widely understood:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essence of an entail is that it creates an estate in land (called a &#8220;fee tail&#8221; or &#8220;entail&#8221;) which lasts for so long as the original grantee or any of his lineal descendants are alive. The original grantee takes a life interest and his descendants also each take successive life interests in land. The instrument creating the entail sometimes limited the gender of the grantee&#8217;s descendants entitled to a life interest (usually to males). The person entitled to the life interest is called the tenant in tail in possession, and the next person in line is called the tenant in remainder (or the remainderman). The common law was hostile to what were effectively inalienable interests in land and by the end of the fifteenth century allowed the legal process to be (ab)used in a collusive action (called a recovery) and a collusive compromise (called a fine) which cumulatively had the effect of barring the entail. Once the entail was barred it was converted into a fee simple.  These judge made rules were confirmed in substance but simplified by Parliament. Under the present law a tenant in tail in possession may bar the entail by a disentailing assurance (which must be made by deed) made during his lifetime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/3-4/74" uk:canonical="1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4) c. 74" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833</ref>; or by will under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/3-4/74/section/176" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 176</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref>. Thus all it takes to bar an entail is the execution of a simple deed by the tenant in tail in possession, or the inclusion of a suitable clause in his will. Accordingly the position of the remainderman is very precarious.</p>

Before 1926 the judges who exercised the Lord Chancellor's jurisdiction in lunacy had no statutory power to direct any settlement (even a revocable settlement) of any part of the patient's property. They were accustomed, in exercising the prerogative to manage the patient's affairs, to direct voluntary payments out of his income which they considered that he would have made if he had been sane, but in those days the court would never direct a payment simply because it was the sort of payment which the patient might well have made but only if it was a payment which he would undoubtedly have made unless he was a very oddly constituted person. The typical examples were subscriptions to local charities which any sane landowner would make as a matter of course and the expenses of educating the heir to the property in a suitable manner. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/171" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 171</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref> conferred on the court power to direct settlements of the patient's property; but what Parliament had primarily in mind in conferring the power to direct settlements of the patient's property, was not the execution of irrevocable settlements divesting him of any interest in the property settled, but the execution of revocable settlements, with reservation of a life interest in order to fill the gap caused by the inability of the patient to make a will. If he had made a will, the legatees under it might have died, and, if he had made no will, those who were presumptive next-of-kin when he lost his reason might themselves have died. This last consideration had become particularly important owing to the changes in the law of intestacy made by the 1925 legislation which gave intestates' estates to the Crown as <span style="font-style:italic">bona vacantia</span> if there were no surviving relatives within the degrees of descendants of the same grandparents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Section 103 empowered the court to direct the making of a settlement; and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1969</ref> introduced a power to direct the making of a will. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (WJG)</span> Cross J was considering the power to direct the making of a settlement. He held that the particular provisions under consideration were not for the benefit of the patient or his family. Thus the only power he had was the power given by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/102/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 102 (1)</ref> (c). It follows that the question he was considering was what &#8220;the patient might be expected to provide if he were not mentally disordered&#8221;. Accordingly <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself required the court to make the counter-factual assumption that the patient was not mentally disordered, and then to ask itself what, on that hypothesis, the patient might be expected to do. Cross J made it clear that the conclusions that he reached were conclusions reached as a matter of construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/102/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 102 (1)</ref> (c). In essence, the question was: given the counter-factual assumption that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> required to be made, were there any further assumptions that were necessarily inherent in that assumption? Cross J held (in effect) that there were not and that apart from assuming that the patient was not mentally disordered, he had to be taken as he was. In that case the patient was friendless and cared for at the expense of the state with no opportunity to spend his money, and no prospect of marrying and having a family. Cross J said:</p>

The court must take the patient as he or she was before losing testamentary capacity. Allowance may be made for the passage of years since the patient was last of full capacity, for sometimes strong feelings mellow into indifference, and even family feuds evaporate. The court should not give effect to antipathies or affections of the patient which are beyond reason. But subject to all due allowances, the court must seek to make the will which the actual patient, acting reasonably, would have made if notionally restored to full mental capacity, memory and foresight.</p>

There can be no doubt in my mind that the evaluation of best interests is akin to a welfare appraisal &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; pending the enactment of a check-list or other statutory direction it seems to me that the first instance judge with the responsibility to make an evaluation of the best interests of a claimant lacking capacity should draw up a balance sheet. The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit. In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of fool-proof contraception. Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the applicant is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221;</p>

In such cases it was for the court itself to arrive at a value judgment about what was in a person&#8217;s best interests after weighing all relevant factors in the balance.

A question arises: what is the effect of a will which the court orders to be executed on behalf of a person domiciled outside England and Wales, where that will relates only to immovable property in England and Wales? This depends on whether &#8220;any other property&#8221; in paragraph 4 (4) (b) means property of any description (movable or immovable) or is restricted to movable property, on the basis that immovable property has already been dealt with in paragraph 4 (4) (a). </p>

Nothing in the travaux pr&#233;paratoires leading to the passing of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, including the debates in Parliament, suggest that Parliament had any intention to change the law in this respect. Moreover, there is a general principle that in case of ambiguity in an Act of Parliament, it is to be assumed that Parliament intended the most continuity with the pre-existing law: Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of England vol. 44 (1) para 1436. It is common ground in this case that that principle applies and that any will which the court orders to be executed will have effect to the extent that it deals with immovable property within the jurisdiction. This is also the view expressed in Heywood &amp; Massey&#8217;s Court of Protection Practice para 20-014. I am content to proceed on that basis.</p>

First it brings together under one common framework the former powers of the court to make decisions both about a person&#8217;s property and his personal welfare. It thus applies to all manner of decisions from the relatively minor to the most important. Second, it applies not only to decisions that the court might make, but also to decisions that others (carers, doctors, deputies) might make. Third, the test of incapacity is finely calibrated. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The Act</ref> recognises that the test of capacity is issue specific. A person (&#8220;P&#8221;) may well have capacity in relation to some matters (e.g. what to wear or what to eat), while lacking capacity as regards others (e.g. what to do with his savings or whether to undergo an operation). A person&#8217;s capacity may also vary from time to time. At this point I should comment on one aspect of the statutory test of incapacity. One of the ingredients in the test is to ask whether P is able to &#8220;use or weigh&#8221; information in making a decision (section 3 (1) (c)). In their report the Law Commission explained the thinking behind this (&#167; 3.17). They said:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There are cases where the person concerned can understand information but where the effects of a mental disability prevent him or her from using that information in the decision-making process. We explained in Consultation Paper No 128 that certain compulsive conditions cause people who are quite able to absorb information to arrive, inevitably, at decisions which are unconnected to the information or their understanding of it. An example is the anorexic who decides not to eat. &#8230; We originally suggested that such cases could be described as cases where incapacity resulted from inability to make a true choice. Common to all these cases is the fact that the person&#8217;s eventual decision is divorced from his or her ability to understand the relevant information. Emphasising that the person must be able to use the information which he or she has successfully understood in the decision-making process deflects the complications of asking whether a person needs to &#8220;appreciate&#8221; information as well as understand it. A decision based on compulsion, the overpowering will of a third party or any other inability to act on relevant information as a result of mental disability is not a decision made by a person with decision-making capacity.&#8221;</p>

Indeed the paramount objective is that of P&#8217;s best interests. However, by giving such prominence to the above matters, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> does in my judgment recognise that having his views and wishes taken into account and respected is a very significant aspect of P&#8217;s best interests. Due regard should therefore be paid when doing the weighing exercise of determining what is in P&#8217;s best interests in all the circumstances of the case.</p>

Whether this further consideration actually should justify overriding P&#8217;s wishes might then be tested by asking whether, had he known of this further consideration, it appears (from what is known of P) that he would have changed his wishes. It might further be tested by asking whether the seriousness of this countervailing factor in terms of detriment to P is such that it must outweigh the detriment to an adult of having one&#8217;s wishes overruled, and the sense of impotence, and the frustration and anger, which living with that awareness (insofar as P appreciates it) will cause to P. Given the policy of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to empower people to make their own decisions wherever possible, justification for overruling P and &#8220;saving him from himself&#8221; must, in my judgment, be strong and cogent. Otherwise, taking a different course from that which P wishes would be likely to infringe the statutory direction in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s [1(6)</ref>] of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, that one must achieve any desired objective by the route which least restricts P&#8217;s own rights and freedom of actions.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the broad thrust of this, although I think that HH Judge Marshall QC may have slightly overstated the importance to be given to P&#8217;s wishes. First, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (6)</ref> is not a statutory direction that one &#8220;must achieve&#8221; any desired objective by the least restrictive route. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1 (6)</ref> only requires that before a decision is made &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">regard</span> must be had&#8221; to that question. It is an important question, to be sure, but it is not determinative. The only imperative is that the decision must be made in P&#8217;s best interests. Second, although P&#8217;s wishes must be given weight, if, as I think, Parliament has endorsed the &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; approach, they are only one part of the balance. I agree that those wishes are to be given great weight, but I would prefer not to speak in terms of presumptions. Third, any attempt to test a decision by reference to what P would hypothetically have done or wanted runs the risk of amounting to a &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221; rather than a decision of what would be in P&#8217;s best interests. But despite this risk, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself requires some hypothesising. The decision maker must consider the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision if he had capacity and also the other factors that P would be likely to consider if he were able to do so. This does not, I think, necessarily require those to be given effect. As the Code of Practice explains (&#167; 5.38):</p>

Even if they cannot make the decision, their wishes and feelings, beliefs and values should be taken fully into account &#8211; whether expressed in the past or now. But their wishes and feelings, beliefs and values will not necessarily be the deciding factor in working out their best interests. Any such assessment must consider past and current wishes and feelings, beliefs and values alongside all other factors, but the final decision must be based entirely on what is in the person&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would add that although the fact that P makes an unwise decision does not on its own give rise to any inference of incapacity (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (4)</ref>), once the decision making power shifts to a third party (whether carer, deputy or the court) I cannot see that it would be a proper exercise for a third party decision maker consciously to make an unwise decision merely because P would have done so. A consciously unwise decision will rarely if ever be made in P&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching a decision a third party decision maker will, if appropriate, take legal or other advice. The other advice may be medical, financial, or advice of any other kind. The court will, of course, act according to the law, and be assumed to have sufficient knowledge of the law (either before or after assistance from advocates) to make whatever decision it is called upon to make. But there is, in my judgment, no need (as envisaged by <span style="font-style:italic">D (J)</span>) to assume (a) that P has taken legal advice (which he has not) and then (b) to attempt to decide what P would have done with that advice if he had had capacity (which he does not). If P&#8217;s wishes have been formed without having taken legal advice in circumstances where a person with capacity would have taken legal advice, that may be a reason for giving them less weight than might otherwise have been the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one other aspect of the &#8220;best interests&#8221; test that I must consider. In deciding what provision should be made in a will to be executed on P&#8217;s behalf and which, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, will only have effect after he is dead, what are P&#8217;s best interests? Mr Boyle stressed the principle of adult autonomy; and said that P&#8217;s best interests would be served simply by giving effect to his wishes. That is, I think, part of the overall picture, and an important one at that. But what will live on after P&#8217;s death is his memory; and for many people it is in their best interests that they be remembered with affection by their family and as having done &#8220;the right thing&#8221; by their will. In my judgment the decision maker is entitled to take into account, in assessing what is in P&#8217;s best interests, how he will be remembered after his death.</p>
