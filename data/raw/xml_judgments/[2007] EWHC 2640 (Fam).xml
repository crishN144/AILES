	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings relate to the best interests of TG, who was born on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1929 and is therefore aged 78 years. Sadly, in recent times, Mr G&#8217;s health has not been good and, in particular, he suffers from dementia and cognitive impairment. His decline also follows a stroke in 2001. From some time in mid 2003 TG had been resident in a care home, namely the L Care Home. That placement was terminated by the care home staff giving notice in March 2006. However, before the authorities could find an alternative home for TG, he contracted pneumonia and septicaemia and was admitted to St George&#8217;s Hospital on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2006. Whilst TG was in hospital there was a dispute between the claimant local authority and two family members, JG and KR, as to his future care. JG is one of TG&#8217;s daughters and KR is her daughter. These two ladies put themselves forward as carers for TG on the basis that he would come to live with them once he was well enough to be discharged from hospital. TG had not previously lived with JG and KR and, for various reasons to which I will refer in due course, the local authority considered that TG was not best placed in their care but required 24 hour care in a residential home. A place in such a home, T Care Centre, was found for TG, but, before the local authority had achieved TG&#8217;s placement there, he was discharged by the hospital to the care of JG and KR on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings were commenced on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2006 when the claimant local authority applied to me as the &#8216;urgent applications judge&#8217; at a without notice hearing for orders designed to achieve TG&#8217;s transfer to the T Care Centre. On that date I made without notice orders requiring JG and KR to deliver TG to the T Care Centre by 2.00pm on 21st June. That time frame was extended by a further 24 hours under an order made the following day by Black J. Both orders made it plain to legally trained eyes that JG and KR had liberty to apply to the court to vary, discharge or set aside the order, and, in particular, the order of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June specified the precise court to which they could make such an application prior to noon on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June. No application to set aside the order was made and JG and KR complied with the orders and caused TG to be delivered to the T Care Centre on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2006.</p>

At that hearing I made final declarations as to TG&#8217;s capacity to make decisions for himself as to his care and residence. At that hearing also, the court set in train a process by which TG started to spend time staying for short periods with JG and KR on a trial basis. Those trial visits went well and in May 2007 he moved to live with them full time pending the present hearing.</p>

Given that the progress of his condition involves periods of deterioration which then establish a new, lower, level of functioning, it is accepted by all parties that should there be any further deterioration, the care plan, and the family&#8217;s ability to provide for his needs in those worsened circumstances, will have to be reviewed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The claimant local authority is the local authority [LLBC] for the area in which TG was living at the time that he was first admitted to a residential care home. JG and KR live in a different local authority area, WLBC. WLBC have been party to the more recent hearings in this case and accept that they will now take on responsibility for overseeing the health and welfare of TG who is a vulnerable adult now living in there area. WLBC has carried out its own comprehensive assessment of TG and his needs, together with the ability of JG and KR to provide for those needs. JG and KR anticipate that they will be able to work with WLBC in a way that has not been a feature of their relationship with the claimant local authority. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What has always been, and remains, controversial between JG and KR and the claimant local authority is the need for proceedings to have been issued in the first place and, in particular, the without notice orders that were made requiring TG to be placed in a care home rather than remaining in the family&#8217;s care. Despite the fact that there is a large measure of agreement as to the outcome of the case, I have permitted JG and KR to raise the issues that they wish to raise in relation to these controversial matters. They do so by way of complaints in general, but also in couching these complaints in terms of breaches of the rights that they and TG may have under the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular Articles 5, 6 and 8. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will shortly list the key issues raised by JG and KR, before rehearsing the evidence in relation to each issue and, in due course, setting out my conclusions. Before doing so it is right to record that a theme will readily be detected as running through much of the evidence and many of my conclusions. That theme relates to the failure on the part of the professionals, on the one hand, and the family, on the other to communicate with each other throughout this process. This failure to communicate, the responsibility of which is shared, in my view, by both the professionals and the family, directly led to the claimant&#8217;s decision to instigate these proceedings and to the confrontational, and at times largely intractable, circumstances thereafter. The adverse effect of this bilateral failure upon TG&#8217;s best interests is, to me at least, obvious.</p>

The claimants now see this as the most important adverse element in the case.

Some family members have alleged, in terms, that JG and KR&#8217;s motive for having TG in their care is so that they can obtain access to his funds for there own benefit. </p>

If the letter is correct, it is highly regrettable that, for a period of two months, social services failed to agree to such a meeting. This is the first example of a failure adequately to communicate between agencies and the family that might have alleviated the difficulties and averted bringing them to the head that they had reached when the letter was written.</p>

Apart from JG and KR no other family members were putting themselves forward. In April or May 2006 JG and KR had presented themselves as potential carers for TG. The evidence shows that the local authority offered to conduct an assessment of their abilities as carers. The local authority asserts that an appointment on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April for Bernard Hoffman to conduct this assessment was made but was cancelled by JG because she had not received a letter explaining the assessment process. Be that as it may, it is accepted that no further assessment of the family was either offered or arranged. PJ in evidence said &#8216;we had not assessed JG and KR as potential alternative carers. There was so much happening in the case at the time that assessing the family as carers had slipped down the priority list.&#8217; </p>

Having looked at the limited available evidence, my conclusion is that this was in part due to a failure of communication between the local authority and JG as to what was involved and why the assessment was taking place. This failure is not to be seen as all the responsibility of the local authority. Both the Official Solicitor and the Court experienced very substantial difficulties in engaging JG and KR in the expert assessment process once these proceedings had commenced. It was only after one last chance was given to them in January of this year, that the two ladies consented to meet the social work and psychiatric experts. This court certainly does not underestimate the difficulties involved for the social workers in seeking to engage JG and KR prior to the proceedings. I am keenly aware that a failure to communicate may involve failure to receive information as much as it may involve failure to achieve effective transmission. </p>

The purpose of the meeting was to try to resolve the apparent impasse as to where TG would go on discharge from hospital. When the social workers failed to attend, hospital staff made contact with them only to be told that they would not be attending, but would be seeking legal advice with a view to obtaining orders from this court. When, by lunchtime, no such orders had been obtained or notified to the hospital, the hospital invited the family to go to their home, which they did. Shortly afterwards TG was discharged from hospital to the family home in an ambulance.</p>

With respect to the claimant, that position is hard to understand. The assertion that the family had taken TG from the hospital on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June goes to the basis of the original claim and the orders that were made by me on that day. At an early stage in these proceedings the defendants filed their evidence from LL and JaG which expressly challenges the local authority account. At every hearing the family have protested that the basis of the original order was not made out. Indeed, at many hearings they have brought their witness LL, whose only role in the case is to talk about those very events. It is therefore difficult to understand how the Claimant can have concluded that this was not to be a factual issue at this hearing.</p>

It is profoundly unattractive for the claimant, having raised this matter prominently as part of its claim, and knowing how controversial the issue was with the defendants, to fail to marshal (if necessary by witness summons) evidence from the hospital.</p>

In fact, the accommodation is a two bedroom property which is now accepted as being suitable for TG and in which he has had his home for the past five months. On being asked about this point in evidence, PJ&#8217;s response was that the reference to a one bedroom, as opposed to a two bedroom, flat was simply &#8216;a typo&#8217;. </p>

PJ says that she and other workers had the intention of raising it with JG, but whenever they were in conversation with her, the conversation was driven by the family&#8217;s agenda onto other topics. Having observed JG on many occasions I can well appreciate that that was the case and do not underestimate the difficulty in communicating with both JG and KR. However, the assertion to the court in June 2006 that they continued &#8216;despite being asked not too&#8217; was not unimportant, yet, like the assertion that TG had been removed from hospital, it has not been substantiated at all in evidence. </p>

In my view this can lead (and experience as the applications judge confirms that it does lead) to practitioners making without notice applications which are not necessary or appropriate, or which are not properly supported by appropriate evidence. Also there is in my view a general practice of asking the court to grant without notice orders over a fairly extended period with express permission to apply to vary or discharge on an inappropriately long period of notice (often 48 hours). It seems to me that on occasions on this practice pays insufficient regard to the interests of both the person in respect of whom and against whom the orders are made, and that therefore on every occasion without notice relief is sought and granted the choice of the return date and the provisions as to permission to apply should be addressed with care by both applicants and the court. Factors in that consideration will be an estimation of the effect on the person against whom the order is made of service of the order and how that is to be carried out.  </span></p>

I appreciate that in many instances there is a very real urgency and there will not be third party evidence of allegations of abusive behaviour that are readily available but in others there will be.  A classic example, which occurs regularly, is that an applicant who seeks a return of children to his or her care fails to provide any third party evidence (eg from a school, a GP or records in their possession) to confirm that he or she is indeed the primary carer of the relevant children. </span></p>

The task is to evaluate as best it can the degree of urgency, the risks of intervening by way of making an order and the risks of not intervening at that stage.

In the present case, JG and KR typically never let an opportunity to complain and have their say about issues that affect TG and their care of him go by, yet they did not come to court to challenge the without notice orders during the window afforded to them to do so. Their explanation, and indeed the implication of their conduct, is that they did not understand that they had the opportunity to challenge the orders before they took effect. Given the importance of the issues involved if a lay party is in such a state of ignorance, I consider that the practice of using the tag &#8216;liberty to apply&#8217; in cases such as this should cease and be replaced by a recital within the order in plain terms to the effect that:</p>

I do not repeat that detail here.  I was and remain satisfied that JG is a highly confrontational individual who has been critical of each and every professional that she has encountered in relation to TG&#8217;s care. This feature represents a very significant detriment in JG&#8217;s otherwise positive abilities to care for her father. In evidence at this hearing the expert social work witness SS, described this feature as JG and KR&#8217;s capacity to &#8216;shoot themselves in the foot&#8217;. They are, I agree, in this regard their own worst enemy. Despite the exhortations contained in my judgment in March that JG would benefit from some counselling or psychological advice, that suggestion has not been taken up and there has been no apparent change. The one glimmer of hope during the present hearing occurred when JG asked SS the question &#8216;how do we prevent ourselves shooting ourselves in the foot?&#8217;. She did not, however, seem to accept his answer which was, again, to refer to counselling. However, the fact that the question was asked in the first place may be of some importance.</p>

Firstly, because it was plainly on the agenda as a result of the letter written by L Care Home in March 2006. It is also referred to in the claim form. Secondly, this court is charged with making a decision as to TG&#8217;s best interests at the end of the proceedings on the totality of the evidence. It would be both artificial and contrary to TG&#8217;s best interests, if a factor becomes more prominent in the course of the hearing, for the court not to be given evidence about it and to consider it.</p>

I am also reassured that the professional and family relationships being developed with WLBC seem to be on a different footing and of a different quality than those that were achieved with the claimant authority. </p>

But the case has neither been prepared nor conducted by the local authority as a detailed financial enquiry.

That being said, he accepted they both had TG&#8217;s best interests at heart and would not harm him. Following VG&#8217;s evidence the court heard again from JaG, who is in a particularly good position to comment upon the current care package, having looked after TG herself up until 2003. She had heard VG&#8217;s comments, but, from her first hand experience of seeing TG in  JG&#8217;s home, she gave a positive report of JG and KR&#8217;s ability to cope. </p>

He believes that there is value in the core of the care being provided to TG coming from the family, as this provides continuity for him. The household is a friendly home with people coming and going; TG is suited to this atmosphere. SS regarded the quality of care currently being provided as good.

His observations entirely accord with the description of JG and KR given by a wide range of people and experienced by their presentation in court. It is this area of the case which has caused the greatest concern during the latter part of these proceedings and needs to be addressed by JG and KR if they are to have the best opportunity to develop a co-operative and helpful relationship with WLBC.</p>

She has no plans to leave home, or set up home with the father of the child. Her plan is that the child will live with herself, her mother and TG. JG and KR consider that this will not be a problem, and, if anything, TG will enjoy the introduction of this new, very young, member of the family. </p>

In my earlier judgment I indicated that the court was impressed with KR as an individual and with her dedication to care for her grandfather during these, his twilight, years. I therefore accept that statement as a true description of her current list of her priorities. However, the baby has not yet been born. It would be both natural and appropriate for the baby to become the top of her list of interests, and in assessing this factor I have assumed that that will be the case. Despite that assumption, I remain satisfied that KR will continue to undertake her part in looking after TG, or, if she is unavailable, will continue to make sure that his needs are also fully met. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Before leaving the topic of the expected baby, it is necessary to record that on this issue there has also been a significant failure to communicate. It is not acceptable for JG and KR to hold the view that the fact that KR was pregnant should not be disclosed to those involved in these proceedings and to the court prior to the final hearing. Even if the pregnancy and resulting birth go well, KR will be indisposed for a period and, for a longer period, unable to lift and manoeuvre TG as she does now. It is not unusual in a pregnancy for regularly encountered complications to lead to a caesarean section being performed; in such circumstances KR&#8217;s ability to lift, having undergone major abdominal surgery, would be compromised for a longer period. In any event, the introduction of a baby into this small family in a two bedroom flat is a significant additional feature that requires to be brokered in to the care plan. </p>

KR is undoubtedly entitled to expect that her right to private life is respected under Article 8 of the ECHR, however that right is not absolute and must be balanced in a proportionate way, with the rights of others. Here it was both proportionate and necessary for this important information about KR to be disclosed within these proceedings so that those making decisions about TG&#8217;s best interests were informed of it.</p>

It is right to say that this suggestion was not supported by any party to the proceedings. In oral evidence SS explained that one of his prime motives for making this suggestion was that he anticipated that the next six months would produce yet further positive reports of JG&#8217;s and KR&#8217;s care and would therefore allow the court to endorse the current care package with even greater confidence than it may do at present. The implication was that such an endorsement based on a good track record of a year or so might well enable JG to be much less defensive, and therefore, more able to cooperate with the professionals. SS accepted my own suggestion that a final order could be made at this hearing, but that there be a requirement for the local authority to report to the court in six months as to progress, so that all would know that the judge would be told how matters were progressing; SS felt that this could well meet the need that he described. </p>

In endorsing the care plan, as I do, I have confidence that it is likely to be effective and will indeed serve TG&#8217;s best interests.

The document explains that in the ordinary case (where the Official Solicitor has had no prior involvement) there is inevitably a lead in period before any effective representation can be provided; the lead in being caused by the need to consider the initial documents and complete the necessary forms to secure funding for representation. In addition it is pointed out that in the early stages of a case the Official Solicitor, like the court, is unlikely to have any independent source of information outside the material provided by the Claimant authority. The explanation given for the difficulties faced by the Official Solicitor in attending (effectively or at all) early hearings in these cases is understandable. It is also of note, as the document from the Official Solicitor states, that under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, the incapacitated subject of the proceedings will not automatically be a party to the proceedings and it will therefore be a matter for the court to establish an appropriate practice with regard to his/her representation and status in the case.</p>

In those circumstances (for reasons that I have already reviewed) it was probable that, whatever the evidential quality of the Claimant&#8217;s original pleaded case, the court would have sanctioned the course that it did and provide for a period of residential care while attempts were made to engage JG and KR in the assessment process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">I have, however, concluded that a period during which TG was placed in a care home and not in the care of JG and KR is likely to have been justified had the matter proceeded on an &#8216;on notice&#8217; basis in June 2006. Put the other way, and in the context of the human rights claims, JG and KR have failed to demonstrate that a period in a care home was unwarranted or unjustified. In this regard I give prominence to the standoff that existed between the family and the authority/the court on the issue of assessment once the proceedings commenced. Given that TG had not lived with JG and KR before his move to them in June 2006, in the absence of an assessment process it is very likely that the court would have held that TG should be placed in a residential home for a period. Thus, whilst the without notice process was not justified, the interim status quo may well have been established at a care home even after an on notice hearing, this being based upon JG and KR&#8217;s general lack of cooperation and confrontational approach and upon their refusal to engage in any expert assessment process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Failure to communicate in the context of this case has involved a failure on the one hand by the local authority to transmit information adequately, correctly or on occasions at all. It has also involved, on the other hand, a failure by JG and KR to make themselves physically and emotionally available to receive any communication. In this latter regard, I remain of the view that I expressed in the interim judgment of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March as to JG&#8217;s presentation when dealing with professionals being one of forcefully expressed and unrelenting criticism.</p>

It is crucial that clear arrangements are made for the professionals and JG and KR to communicate with each other. It must be accepted that communication has been a significant problem in this case in the past and therefore extra time should be taken at this stage for the family and the social services to discuss and establish protocols and procedures by which they will discuss and inform each other of matters concerning TG.</p>
