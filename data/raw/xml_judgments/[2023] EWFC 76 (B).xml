W&#8217;s case is that she was not represented and that the proceedings were in Arabic, which neither she nor H speaks, and she says she was not admitted to the hearing until it was over. H was represented, but it is W&#8217;s perception that H&#8217;s lawyer did not mention to the Dubai court the pre-existence of the conditional order in England.</p>

As a result of the application by H, W&#8217;s application was stayed. DDJ Stuart, on 2 March, made an order which said that:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The expert evidence is an opinion from Mr Ousamma, a legal consultant in Dubai on the relevant Dubai law, and it says that W has the right to appeal the divorce order within 30 days of it having been made and it was his opinion that the divorce order in Dubai was likely to be revoked. Mr Ousamma doubted that the Dubai court dealing with the matter in February had sight of the English conditional order when it made its decision, because it is his opinion that the Dubai court would not make a divorce order in circumstances where W has a conditional order in this country and is likely to have a final order shortly. I should add that is the general state of the law in most of the countries that we deal with here. The court in one country respects an earlier order of another country.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">W&#8217;s counsel has helpfully set out the legal principles that apply. The court has power to make the conditional order final and this is usually an administrative act. None of the reasons why a conditional order should not be made final apply in this case and, for example, there is no application by H under section 10 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to have his financial situation sorted out before an order is made final and, indeed, there is no application to set aside the conditional order. On the other hand, the court will not make the order final if there are valid divorce proceedings in another country which should take precedence over the English proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973 (&#8220;DMPA&#8221;) applies. Section 5 sets out the grounds for the English court to have jurisdiction. One of them is that one of the parties is domiciled in this country. It is W&#8217;s case that she remains domiciled in this country. H says he is domiciled in Dubai and he does not accept that W is domiciled here either. However, the burden to show that a party has lost their domicile in this country is on the other party and H has not satisfied me that W has lost her domicile. The case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v R (Divorce: Jurisdiction: Domicile)</span> [2006] 1 FLR 389 supports this conclusion. I am satisfied that W&#8217;s domicile has remained in England, as evidenced by her expressed intention to return to live in this country and retaining property and bank accounts here.</p>

As it is set out in the DMPA section 5(6) and in schedule 1, paragraph 9, the court can decide which is the more appropriate court of the two, depending on the balance of fairness and convenience.</p>

She says that, although H has a business in Dubai, he still has business in this country, and in Dubai, other than that business, there are no assets other than cars. The Dubai court will not be in a position to determine the financial outcome of the divorce. In any event, neither party speaks Arabic and W has not been able to participate in the Dubai proceedings to-date. She points out it would be a waste of money for her to have to restart Part III proceedings as the financial remedy proceedings here are underway. She says there would be no delay, because her application to have the conditional order made final could be dealt with today.</p>

Otherwise, he says he is not interested in the financial remedy proceedings, either now or if there was a Part III application. The Dubai court has given him custody of their child C, aged 15, and his only concerns are to be divorced and to have custody. He thinks there will be delay if W succeeds today. For the avoidance of doubt, I am not dealing with custody issues.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">On balance, it seems to me that the English court is the appropriate court for these divorce proceedings. The parties are UK nationals and their property is in England. The English court is already dealing with the financial remedy application by W and the Dubai court would not be in a position to deal with the financial remedy proceedings, which have to take place, if there is no agreement, to sort out the financial outcome of this long marriage.</p>

I recognise that H may not have realised that English court proceedings were taking place when he issued his Dubai proceedings, but it does not appear that H has told the Dubai court of the English proceedings, even in the February hearing.
