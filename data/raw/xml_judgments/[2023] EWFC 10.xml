	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an adoption application on unusual facts. The relevant child, T, was born in 2004 and is now an adult, aged 18 and a half. The application for adoption was issued ten days before she turned 18. At the time of the application, she was living in a property managed by the applicants who run a business providing supported residential accommodation and education services for children. On turning 18, T moved to live with the applicants in their own home, and has therefore lived with them for about 5 months. The applicants are married, but have no children of their own. It was their idea to seek adoption for T, who has enthusiastically embraced the application and actively seeks to be adopted. T lived with her mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) until February 2019, and maintained contact with her, and her older sister (&#8220;S&#8221;) until June 2022. </p>

She conducted herself with dignity throughout the hearing, and told me that she was worried about escalation of difficulties between herself and T as a result of these proceedings. It was notable in her submissions to me that she repeatedly returned to discussing her former partner, T&#8217;s father (&#8220;F&#8221;) and his family who she described to me as a &#8220;curse&#8221; hanging over her head. </p>

It has, however, provided an Annexe A report dated 19 November 2022 in accordance with FPR 14.11, and, as directed by the court, an updated social worker report. Although it does not have formal locus, and has not been joined to the proceedings, the LA was requested at earlier case management hearing to remain involved, and it has attended this hearing. The view of the social worker, as set out in some detail in the Annexe A report and her update, is that an adoption order should not be made. </p>

But counsel were in agreement at the hearing before the judge as to the proper approach to any such application; and the judge accepted and endorsed the approach which they commended to him. Equally, before this court, counsel remain in agreement as to it; and, in turn, I consider that we should accept and endorse it. For, notwithstanding the absence of a decision referable to the grant of leave under s.42(6), there is a recent reported decision of this court referable to the grant of leave to apply for revocation of a placement order under s.24(2) of the Act. It is&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re M and L, Warwickshire v. M</span><span style="font-size:10pt">, [2007] EWCA Civ 1084. I would accept and hold that the legal principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion whether to grant leave pursuant to each of the subsections is identical. Thus the welfare of the child is a relevant consideration but, by virtue of s.1(7) of the Act, is not the paramount consideration: see [22] and [24] of my judgment in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re M and L</span><span style="font-size:10pt">.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">"My view is that the requisite analysis of the prospect of success will almost always include the requisite analysis of the welfare of the child. For, were there to be a real prospect that an applicant would persuade the court that a child's welfare would best be served by [the substantive order sought], it would surely almost always serve the child's welfare for the applicant to be given leave to seek to do so. Conversely, were there not to be any such real prospect, it is hard to conceive that it would serve the welfare of the child for the application for leave to be granted. But I hesitate to suggest that analysis of welfare will always be satisfactorily subsumed within an analysis of prospect."</span></p>

The legal provisions under s1 and s52 apply equally to all adoption applications, but the necessity and proportionality of an adoptive placement will depend upon a careful analysis of the context and the degree of interference with Article 8 rights which will vary depending upon the nature of the proposed placement.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T was born in 2004. M and F separated when she was 4 or 5 years old, after which F played very little role in her upbringing. F has a 2013 conviction for sexual assault on a minor and is a registered sex offender. I am quite sure that the knowledge of this has had a traumatising impact on the family, including T. T describes an unhappy childhood, characterised by an abusive relationship between her parents, and verbally and physically abusive behaviour by her parents towards her. M denies many of the historic allegations, which I do not consider I need to make findings on in respect of the early years.  M, for her part, felt that she was undermined by F and F&#8217;s parents, for whom she has no good words to say; her relationship with them was described by the social worker in earlier proceedings as &#8220;toxic&#8221;. T describes a dysfunctional relationship with S, who she portrays as domineering and intimidating. As time went by, S started to &#8220;get in with a bad crowd&#8221;, particularly from 2015 onwards when she is described as becoming aggressive and bullying, absconding from home and using drugs. S was beyond parental control. My sense is that although there may have been issues in early childhood, much of the intra-family relationships between T, S and M deteriorated sharply from about 2015, as S&#8217;s behaviour deteriorated, and S approached teenage years. A substantial accentuating factor must have been F&#8217;s conviction in 2013, and his release from prison a year afterwards. M, in my judgment, has not recovered emotionally and psychologically from these events, and it seems clear that she had difficultly coping with S, and protecting the children from F. </p>

A full care order was made in respect of S, who was placed away from the family home, and a 12 months supervision order in respect of T. Although the threshold document from that time has not been located, the court would not have made a supervision order without being satisfied that the s31 threshold were met. Piecing together the various documents, the main areas of concern were S&#8217;s behaviour, a dysfunctional relationship between M and S, and M&#8217;s inability to protect the children from F. A July 2016 parenting assessment by the LA was positive in respect of M&#8217;s care of T, and there was no adverse mental health finding in respect of M. That said, she was found to be limited in her capacity to control the children and protect them from possible sexual exploitation by F.</p>

She returned to M in March 2020 for two months. In May 2020 she briefly lived with S. To the consternation of M, T stayed with F for a few days, and with F&#8217;s mother for some time. In the midst of all this, a Child Protection Conference was convened on 18 July 2019 which recorded that T&#8217;s emotional needs were not being met consistently by her parents and grandparents, there was a history of relationship issues between T and M, and there were concerns about M&#8217;s ability to manage T. It also recorded that F (with whom T had spent some time shortly before the CPC) had directed seriously inappropriate comments towards T, and any relationship of trust between them had broken down. </p>

Although, being under 18, she was not permitted to live with them, she went away with them for weekends (with LA permission), and it is obvious that they formed a close, loving and affectionate bond. After a while she started working for them during the day under, as I understand it, an apprenticeship scheme, being picked up from the placement, taken to the office and then returned by the applicants at the end of the day. </p>

On the other hand, I have seen text messages, and heard voice recordings, in which T and M communicated with each other in intemperate, abusive and angry manner. The picture is mixed, suggestive of a volatile relationship between T and M, frequently unpleasant and hostile, but punctuated by occasional calm and good natured times together. In June 2022, all communication between T and M and S came to an end. It seems to me that this coincided with the strengthening of bonds between T and the applicants, such that she had no real need or desire to speak to M and S. </p>

The delicacy of the evaluation exercise is shown by the differing views of the professionals; the social worker who, whilst describing it as finely balanced, does not support an adoption order, and the Guardian who does, regarding it as a reasonably clear cut decision to take. Both professionals, in my view, have behaved impeccably in the way they have approached this case, the care taken, the sensitivity displayed and the thoroughness of their approach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A highly influential factor is T&#8217;s own wishes. She is now 18. She is articulate, mature and intelligent. She has spoken to professionals and to her own lawyers. I am satisfied that she fully understands the nature, meaning and consequences of an adoption order. She appreciates that it constitutes the severing of legal ties with her birth family, essentially foregoing one family for another. She understands what she would be leaving behind. She says in her written evidence that even thinking about her birth family causes her unhappiness. She attaches considerable significance to an adoption order which, for her, is about her family status.  She says living with the applicants makes her feel more secure, and they meet her physical and emotional needs. She now sees herself as a member of a different family, and yearns for the stability, security and permanence which would be afforded by an adoption order. In my judgment, this would enhance her own sense of identity, not just now but for ever, drawing a line under an unhappy past, and reflecting the reality on the ground that she treats the applicants as her parents, and they treat her as their daughter. She has drawn on her lived experiences with her family, in particular, I suspect, the events of the past few years. It seems to me that she has no wish to be associated with her sex offender father, and an ongoing legal relationship with F and M would maintain that association. She contrasts the dysfunctional relationships with her birth family, the chaotic lifestyle, and the exposure to her sex offender father with her happy, stable and secure relationship with the applicants with whom she has lived for 5 months but known well for much longer. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When M made her submissions to me, I sensed that she respected T&#8217;s views, but, as she told me, her real concern is if the relationship with the applicants breaks down. That is a relevant factor; if that were to happen, she would have lost two families. However, she has known the applicants well since 2020 and there is no reason to anticipate a complete breakdown of relations; the reverse seems likely. And, again, this is something which T has considered, and her views are clear and consistent. It seems to me that the essence of what T desires, and needs, is emotional and psychological permanence. Physically, she may move away from the applicants as she acquires a greater degree of independence in adulthood. But what she requires is a sense of belonging, which can only be fully achieved emotionally and psychologically under an adoption order, for I am quite sure that her relationship with her birth family has come to an end. An adoption order would stabilise, and enhance, her own sense of identity. I consider that for her to be able to present herself to the outside world as the child of the applicants would be a powerful benefit to her. I acknowledge that T was in contact with M until June 2022, but the overall picture of their relationship has not been a happy one in recent years and T has decided to sever all communication. It is notable how she has blossomed since living with the applicants, in terms of eating better, becoming more confident and happier. She is aware of the contrast between living with the applicants, and her lived experience with her birth parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have great sympathy for M. She has been profoundly hurt and affected by the behaviour of F which, so it seems to me, has deeply fractured the family. To sever T&#8217;s ties with her and S, in particular, is not a step to be taken lightly. I hope that if T&#8217;s status, and sense of family permanence, is settled by an adoption order, she, M and S may be able to resume a level of cordial contact. The applicants, to their credit, would have no objection to T, as an adult, doing so. I suspect that for all concerned that would be desirable, particularly if and when T, or S, in time have children who may want to explore their own identities. I am of the view that T will find that process much easier if an adoption order is made, separating her formally from her birth family. I do not discount the possibility that over time T may come to regret an adoption order being made, but on balance this seems to me to be an improbable scenario, and comfortably outweighed by the social, emotional and psychological benefits for the rest of her life. </p>

I have come down in clear favour of an adoption order which in my judgment is appropriate, necessary and proportionate. I will therefore make the adoption order, and, for the avoidance of doubt, dispense with parental consent as required by the Act.</p>
