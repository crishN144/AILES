A full care order was made earlier this year at the conclusion of a lengthy fact-finding hearing.  At the same time, Z&#8217;s father has made an application whereby he seeks a review of the current contact arrangements for his son.  This is my supplemental judgment in relation to these three extant applications. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">On 5 May this year (2020) I handed down my judgment in long running care proceedings which involved Z, the only child of X (&#8216;the mother&#8217;) and Y (&#8216;the father&#8217;).  Z was then six and a half years old and had been involved in litigation concerning his future for more than half of his young life.  The case was complex and had a number of unusual, if not unique, features.  One such was the profound disability of Z&#8217;s mother&#8217;s in terms of her very limited ability to communicate with the outside world.  She had been born in Cambodia to impoverished parents.  Since birth, she has been profoundly deaf and for many years had no formal or recognisable speech.  She and Z&#8217;s father married abroad in 2013 having met in Cambodia at a time when she was a very vulnerable young woman who had received more or less no formal therapeutic intervention to address her disabilities.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I made a number of findings at the conclusion of that hearing which included findings in relation to physical and sexual assaults perpetrated by Z&#8217;s father which had caused injuries to his wife.  Alcohol was almost certainly a trigger for some of these incidents which had on occasions been witnessed by Z.  The parties had by then separated.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Removal of Z from his family through adoption was not part of the local authority&#8217;s care plan.  It was an agreed basis of the final care plan that Z should remain in the primary care of his mother from the security of an assisted shared lives placement.  There was to be regular contact between Z and his father on an unsupervised basis albeit that the local authority would share parental responsibility because of the mother&#8217;s particular vulnerabilities in caring for their child.  It is right to record at the outset that, since the proceedings commenced in 2017, Z&#8217;s mother had made significant strides forwards in terms of the improvement in her communication skills.  The local authority had put in place a package of therapeutic and other support with which she had fully engaged.  As a result the young woman who emerged at the final hearing through many hundreds of pages of evidence was a very different individual from the one with whom the local authority was engaged at the outset of these proceedings.  I am told that her progress has continued in the months since the last hearing and that is one of the most heartening aspects of what has been, in many respects, a difficult piece of litigation. </p>

The father sought to appeal that order.  On 20 July 2020, Baker LJ dismissed his application for permission to appeal on the basis it was totally without merit.  Notwithstanding the detailed and careful manner in which his Lordship explained in his written ruling the reasons for the court&#8217;s decision, the father subsequently attempted to appeal that dismissal.  These steps in the litigation have obviously delayed the resolution of the issues which remained outstanding and which flowed from the foot of my mainframe judgment which was made available to the parties in early April and formally handed down at the beginning of May 2020. </p>

Y, the father, is entitled as of right to legal representation at public expense.  He is now 76 years old and is unemployed.  He claims that he has been reduced to a position of personal insolvency as a result of these proceedings in that he has lost the opportunity to open a restaurant business in which he proposed his wife would prepare and provide the food.  He has consistently refused to take up the opportunity of legal representation despite being encouraged to do so by the court on numerous occasions.  There is no doubt that Y is an intelligent individual.  He has a number of professional qualifications (primarily in engineering) which he deployed to good effect in his earlier working life.  For most of the marriage, this couple led a fairly peripatetic existence sailing around the Far East and earning a living which appears to have been a fairly &#8216;hand to mouth&#8217; existence.  Until the separation they were living in privately rented accommodation.  I understand that the father is now dependent upon state benefits. </p>

He does not accept that his wife no longer wishes to live with him.  Any such views which she may be expressing are, he alleges, the product of her &#8220;captivity&#8221; by the local authority which has been deliberately engineered to isolate her from him and friends. He maintains that he and/or those friends should be given the opportunity to persuade her that she does not understand the consequences of the views which I am satisfied she has been communicating clearly to her social worker and her shared lives carer.  He seeks to engineer an outcome for his family whereby they leave this jurisdiction to live with other members of X&#8217;s extended family in Cambodia with Z, free from any further interference in their family life on the part of the local authority.  </p>

From the foot of that financial settlement, the family will then move to Cambodia to begin a new life together.

When I indicated that the hearing was going ahead, he and his McKenzie friend left the court building and refused to return despite my encouragement and subsequent invitation that he should do so given that important decisions for Z were being taken.  So, too, did this hearing begin with a formal application by the father that I should recuse myself from any further involvement in these proceedings.  I allowed him to read a prepared statement for the first 25 minutes of the hearing.  He has since circulated copies of that statement to me and the legal representatives for the local authority, the Official Solicitor and the Guardian.  It follows the same themes and patterns reflected in previous iterations of similar documents sent to this court and the Court of Appeal. </p>

It sought to elicit whether he needed to enter that area for purposes other than the regular handovers at Z&#8217;s school at the beginning and end of each period of contact.

However, in terms of the pattern of alternate weekends during term-time, its view is that Z needs to spend time at weekends with each of his mother and his father.  I am told that he has a number of commitments during the week after school.  He attends martial art sessions twice a week and is keen to join a local football club.  With these commitments and homework during the school week, he does not have the opportunity to enjoy very much leisure time with his mother during the week and his weekends with her are important.  </p>

I heard about trips to the local parks and the shopping centre.  Z enjoys these occasions and I have no doubt that they are beneficial for Z just as they are for his mother.  Her social development over the course of recent months is one of the few bright lights in this litigation.  As her confidence has grown, she has started meeting other mothers at Z&#8217;s school.  She shops for her own clothes and has begun to integrate in her local community.  She has become a part of Z&#8217;s school community and it is important that she continues to develop these connections.  Spending time with Z at weekends is part of that development and I recognise that it would be detrimental to Z were he deprived of these opportunities. </p>

In the eyes of this seven year old child, that must be a confusing and worrying message to hear.  It demonstrates to me the extent to which his father lacks insight into his son&#8217;s need for emotional and physical stability in his life.  It is further evidence of his inability to accept the decisions made by this court and the Court of Appeal.  Z is emerging from a period of chaos and instability.  Over the course of the last few months he has become much happier and more settled.  He has had to deal with a number of moves in the last two or three years following his parents&#8217; separation. Y will of course say that it is the court which has brought about that state of affairs because of its unwarranted (and, on his case, illegal) interference in his family&#8217;s life.

In terms of his education, his school reports are excellent.  He is making good progress and is happy and settled in a safe learning environment where all his educational needs are being met in an age appropriate way.  His father has much to contribute in this context.  I accept that there are things which he and Z can do together which Z&#8217;s mother cannot do.  I have recognised the many benefits which contact with his father brings to this child.  It formed the basis of the local authority&#8217;s final care plan and it is the reason why the social workers who support contact have persevered in their determination to make contact work despite their difficult professional relationship with Y. </p>

I appreciate that he has been denied the opportunity to spend time in her company since the separation but the absence of contact between these parents reflects not only safeguarding concerns but Z&#8217;s mother&#8217;s own wishes.  At no point has Y accepted that his marriage has broken down nor does he recognise his own contribution towards that breakdown.

The document he produced on 10 November 2020 shortly before this hearing refers to Z&#8217;s need to have &#8216;quality time with his father each week until these proceedings are at an end&#8217;.  This latter reference appears to relate to the &#8216;conclusion of the family meeting&#8217; which Y is anticipating as the platform for a court-endorsed move to Cambodia.

Y has refused to assist the court and I know not what he might have said were he to have answered questions about the discussion(s) he appears to have had with Z about a future move to Cambodia as a reunited family.  That he is fixated upon, and driven by, this course is clear from the written material he has submitted to the court.  He needs to understand that these discussions do nothing to reassure Z; they merely confuse this child who currently looks to the security of his home with his mother and the roots he is putting down within his school and local community. </p>

To an extent, the maintenance of that contact on an ongoing basis lies within this father&#8217;s gift.  I would wish to see contact developing over the course of school holidays and half-terms and I am told that forward planning on the part of the local authority already embraces this extension.  Whilst Z finds it difficult to maintain concentration for extended periods of indirect contact on Skype, this form of contact should be supported and developed at the child&#8217;s pace.  I recognise it to be a useful support for the periods of direct contact which Z will continue to have with his father on alternate weekends.  Because of Z&#8217;s need to spend time at the weekend with his mother, I am not persuaded that this is a case where he should be deprived of that opportunity.  It would not meet his needs nor would it be in his longer term interest to spend every weekend with his father.  I accept the evidence which is before the court that he missed his mother when, recently, he spent three consecutive weekends with his father.  His attachment to his mother is secure but he is not yet at the stage where he can cope with leaving her every weekend.  It is clear from the way in which Y has framed his application for contact that he regards the arrangements as a holding position for whatever time remains before his anticipated move as a family to Cambodia.  That will not be happening given the orders which I have made in this case.  </p>

I have to balance that information against the evidence I heard from SF who told me about the delightful little boy who greets her very happily when she makes her regular visits to see him at home with his mother.  She described how he loves to play hide and seek and his evident delight when she &#8216;finds&#8217; him.  I cannot know how Z behaves in his father&#8217;s home and he has not been prepared to engage with this hearing so as to give me that insight.  To the extent that Y is adding to his son&#8217;s confusion and sense of uncertainty by referring to a move to Cambodia (and I am satisfied that he has had these discussions with his son), he may be contributing to Z&#8217;s anxiety. </p>

I understand that X does not wish to facilitate that contact but I am satisfied that the shared lives carer is willing and able to assist in this respect just as she manages the bi-weekly handovers on Sundays at the school.

In that case Butler-Sloss LJ stressed that, although the power to restrict applications was discretionary, the court must weigh in the balance all the relevant circumstances giving paramount consideration to the welfare of the child.  Because it is a power which interferes with the right of a party to make an application and to be heard in matters affecting his/her child, it is a power which must be used sparingly and with care.  It is often described as a &#8216;weapon of last resort&#8217; although it is a power which is available in appropriate circumstances where there has been no history of repeated and unreasonable applications.  In these circumstances, the court will need to be satisfied in relation to two matters.  First, the facts of the particular case before the court must go beyond the commonly encountered need for time to allow the child to settle into a new regime approved by the court and/or as a means of reducing animosity between a local authority and a parent.  Secondly, the court must be satisfied that there is a serious risk that, without the imposition of the restriction, the child or his primary carer will be subject to unacceptable strain. </p>

Furthermore, Z will be re-engaged in litigation as a Guardian will need to step back into the litigation arena to represent his interests outside those of his two parents.  Any fresh litigation will undoubtedly involve the shared lives carer who is already closely involved in all the practical aspects of supporting X and Z through what is hoped to be the final stages of this long-running litigation.

It is a very valuable and scarce resource and one which was identified by the local authority only after five previous moves and two temporary placements for Z and his mother.  They are both happy and settled in that placement.  Each benefits enormously from the support which the shared lives carer is providing.  She has made a significant personal and professional investment in supporting this mother.  She has learnt to sign and has completed a BSL course for these purposes.  She is liked and trusted by X and I have no doubt that this has been a significant factor in the remarkable progress which she has made to date.  X is sufficiently secure in that placement to have established the beginnings of an independent social life.  She is immersed in many of the aspects of Z&#8217;s school life and is becoming integrated into a local group of mothers who also have children at the school.  She and Z attend a local group which has been set up to assist other deaf and hearing-impaired individuals.  She is comfortable with that group of people and I am told that Z has found these sessions helpful in understanding his mother&#8217;s difficulties and how best he can communicate effectively with her. </p>

It is difficult to know where, or how swiftly, another shared lived placement could be found.  It is extremely unlikely that an alternative placement would be available in the vicinity which X and Z have now made their home. Any move now or in the foreseeable future would be likely to undermine much of the progress which X has made to date in terms of her integration into the community of the hearing world.  Friendships and her social support systems would be lost.  Z would in all probability have to leave his school.  He and his mother would effectively be left to start again without the support of a trusted carer who has consistently demonstrated the lengths to which she has been prepared to go to support this vulnerable mother. </p>

If she is found to be unable to conduct proceedings on her own behalf, as seems probable, the Official Solicitor would need to become involved on her behalf once again.  Taking instructions from this mother and eliciting her wishes and feelings about issues flowing from litigation is (or, at least, was) a complex process involving the intervention of a specialist expert.  Inevitably, this introduces delay and further intrusion in day to day family life.  Z would once again be the focus of difficult and contentious litigation and I have no confidence in his father to protect him from the impact of the unsettling effects it would have for this young child.

He has shown no insight into the effect on Z of his proposed move to a different country of which this child has no present knowledge and where his future remains completely obscure. He states that he has no desire to separate Z from his mother&#8217;s care.  However this is precisely the solution he was proposing at the final hearing in January when his case was that he should have primary care of Z if X had indeed set her face against returning to the marriage.

I am persuaded that there is a serious risk that, without the imposition of the restriction, both X and Z will be subject to unacceptable strain and worry.  It has to be remembered that this father is having ongoing and regular contact with his child.  The order I am proposing to make will not affect his ability to continue to enjoy that contact and to re-establish a solid and steady relationship with his son.  It is entirely compatible with the court&#8217;s objective to restore and support that relationship in an environment which is free from the pressures of litigation.  Y needs to change his focus.  He needs to accept that X has no wish to continue a relationship with him and that she is settled and, as far as the court can ascertain, content in her life outside the marriage.  To the extent that he seeks to engage with her in the future in terms of raising their son as separated parents, he is much more likely to achieve his objective if he is able to demonstrate that he understands the damage which his current approach to this litigation is causing to both Z and his mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The local authority seeks an order which will endure for five years.  I regard that as a disproportionate interference in Y&#8217;s parental and other rights.  I bear in mind his age.  I bear in mind the fact that an order under this section is not an absolute bar but merely a preliminary hurdle to overcome as a result of the imposition of the need for leave to proceed with an application.  In my judgment, an initial restriction of two years is an appropriate response to Y&#8217;s conduct of this litigation.  During that period, he will not be entitled to make any application in relation to the arrangements for Z&#8217;s care or his contact with Z without first securing the leave of the court.  At that point the position can be reviewed.  Hopefully matters will by then have moved on and a fresh order will not be necessary. </p>

At my request the local authority has supplied a second map which provides some wider context for that area on a larger scale.  The town in which X and Z live is a relatively small town with a single shopping centre and three specific areas of public green space.  The town is accessed via a one-way road system.  The entire circumference of the perimeter to the proposed exclusion zone is 3.7 miles.  I am told that it takes approximately 15 minutes to drive around the boundary although no one has yet calculated the internal square area. </p>

The contact arrangements will be unaffected by the operation of the proposed injunction.  Y&#8217;s home is approximately one hour&#8217;s drive away in a completely different part of the county some 50 miles away.  He has always collected Z and driven straight home for his periods of weekend contact.  There is no evidence that he has ever used the facilities in the town where the mother lives save for one occasion about which I know when he used the cashpoint at one of the supermarkets which falls within the proposed exclusion zone.  Because I have been careful in this anonymised judgment not to reveal any information which might reveal the identity of the parties or the location in which each lives, I am constrained in providing too much detail about the potential impact on Y of the proposed order.  Suffice it to say that it does not affect his use of any of the major road links between Z&#8217;s school and Y&#8217;s own home.  There is no impact whatsoever on his ability to access the many areas of outstanding natural beauty in the countryside around his home or the amenities which he might wish to use when Z is staying with him in that home.  In terms of the availability of petrol service stations, cash point and shopping facilities, I am satisfied that there are ample facilities within a reasonably short distance of the proposed exclusion zone to enable Y to purchase petrol or food without any unnecessary inconvenience.  Within striking distance of his own home, he has access to several major towns and at least one city.  There are some beautiful stretches of coastline and many leisure activities within easy travelling distance of Y&#8217;s home, access to which will remain completely unaffected by the exclusion zone which is being proposed. </p>

He is set upon taking steps, although I know not what these may be, to ensure that his family is provided with the means to leave this jurisdiction and set up a future life in Cambodia.  That future life is to be independent of any future involvement of this court or this local authority.

It is not simply a placement: it is a home, and one where they have felt sufficiently secure to put down roots and establish a life within their local community.  Y has repeatedly stressed his clear intentions to destabilise this home.  His plan to move the family to Cambodia and the ongoing discussions which he claims to be having with third parties (including international lawyers) in order to achieve this end have continued unabated.  His efforts towards this end have been unaffected by the clear findings I have made in relation to his conduct towards X.  He has no regard for this court or the judgments of the Court of Appeal.  He is quite unable to moderate his language and he continues to make threats to all those involved in these proceedings whom he regards to be part of the conspiracy against him and his family.  He has become increasingly irrational to the point of losing any sense of reality or proportion.  For these reasons I place no confidence in the absence of any approach to date as being a sufficiently protective factor. </p>

Any disturbance of the current arrangements for X would in all probability set back much of the progress which has been achieved to date.  It would inevitably impact upon her ability to look after Z effectively and safely.  That would have highly adverse implications for his welfare.  He is securely attached to his mother and continues to look to her to meet most of his day to day needs in terms of emotional warmth and support.  I am in no doubt that the injunction sought is both necessary and proportionate.  Y has been given the opportunity to explain to the court why its imposition might interfere disproportionately with his Art 13 right to freedom of movement and to come and go as he pleases.  He has chosen to withdraw and has said nothing to assist the court in this context.  I suspect that there is nothing which he could say or at least nothing which would tip the balance in favour of elevating those Art 13 rights over and above the security of X and Z&#8217;s home. </p>

Whilst it was a point which I raised with counsel during the hearing, I am satisfied that the restricted area needs to include the three areas of green space which are marked on the map.  These are areas which are familiar to X and Z.  I am satisfied that X would be quite unable to deal with a chance encounter with Y.  She continues to convey to those who know her well high levels of anxiety about any form of contact.  The order I intend to make does indeed represent a restriction of Y&#8217;s Art 13 rights.  He will see it as a further infringement of his Art 8 rights.  However I am persuaded in this case that it is an interference which is both necessary and proportionate.  I propose to make an order which will, in the first instance, last for a period of two years.
