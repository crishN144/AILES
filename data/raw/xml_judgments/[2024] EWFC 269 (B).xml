The assessments took place in England (in December 2023) and by the Polish authorities (in March 2024). Both assessments are thorough and conclude positively. Mrs H and Mr H have been married since 2011. They live in Poland where Mrs H is a nurse, with a specialism in intensive care and palliative care. Mr H fabricates and installs bells in churches. They live in a large apartment in a lovely neighbourhood in Poland with beautiful scenery. They both have secure jobs and are in good health. Natalia is their only grandchild.

In the course of these proceedings Natalia&#8217;s guardian has spoken to the maternal grandmother and was greatly impressed by her understanding of the issues, her insight, and commitment to putting Natalia&#8217;s needs first. This is also evidence in a thoughtful and detailed statement Mrs H and Mr H have submitted to the Court. </span></p>

The local authority brought the proceedings because it considered orders were required to be made to safeguard Natalia&#8217;s welfare. At the time the local authority took protective measures in respect of Natalia, she was suffering significant harm and at risk of suffering significant harm as a result of the care she was receiving from her mother. Her father was not present in her life and had contributed to the harmful environment in which Natalia had been raised. </span></p>

I am in no doubt that Natalia&#8217;s welfare needs will best be met by her moving to Poland to live with her maternal grandmother and Mr H. It will be a big change for her to move to another country. However, she will be moving to the home of family members who love her and who she loves in return. They are experienced parents and generous and kind individuals who have welcomed the opportunity to have Natalia in their care. They have travelled over to England to spend time with Natalia. It is proposed that following the hearing and orders being made, they will travel to Poland with Natalia in the next day or two.</span></p>

There is no equivalent to a special guardianship order in Poland. The local authority will not be in a position to provide the support that would be provided under a special guardianship support plan; discussions have already taken place with local Polish children&#8217;s services who will be available to support Natalia and her grandparents as and when needed. In all the circumstances, there are no benefits to making a special guardianship order rather than a child arrangements order. </span></p>
