	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother and the children arrived in England on 5 July 2019.  The mother alleged that she was fleeing domestic abuse from the children's father. Prior to this point the mother, who is a Slovakian national, and the children, who are Belgian nationals, had been residing in Spain with the father for a short period.  The father is also a Belgian national.  The mother is visually impaired.  The father has muscular dystrophy, is confined to a wheelchair and has lost the use of one arm.  There is evidence to suggest that the reason for the father and the mother visiting Spain with the children was an attempt by them to break away from the drug culture which had become part of their lives in Belgium.  There is also a suggestion that the move was to evade the involvement of Belgian social care authorities, who were concerned regarding the care afforded to the children by the parents.  Upon the mother&#8217;s arrival in this jurisdiction the UK Border Force alerted children&#8217;s services at the local authority in circumstances where the mother had been reported as &#8220;missing/vulnerable/at-risk&#8221; by the Belgian authorities following the families departure to Spain.  </p>

These checks revealed that Mr Y has twentysix criminal convictions, a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder and had given a history of heroin use and alcohol use.  Mr Y openly discussed this with both the local authority and the mother. Despite this information, the mother is said to have gone against professional advice and continued to reside with Mr Y and allowed him to have unsupervised contact with her children. It is said that Mr Y was observed to be highly controlling of the mother and made attempts to obstruct the local authority&#8217;s intervention when challenged on this. The mother did at one point agree to be moved into a women and children&#8217;s refuge but returned to Mr Y after three days. </p>

The family were being monitored by the Family Justice Centre in Belgium. It was reported that the mother had refused to engage or accept support in Belgium and, as I have alluded to above, had fled to Spain to evade any safeguarding intervention by the Belgian authorities. In Spain the mother was said to be offered support by the authorities but had denied there was any risk to the children. The information from Interpol suggests that there were significant concerns about the children's welfare in both Belgium and Spain and the mother&#8217;s ability to protect her children. </p>

The children were placed together in local authority foster care and the local authority sought and obtained an emergency protection order on 23 August 2019. The children were made subject to interim care orders at a hearing on 29 August 2019. At this hearing it was identified that there was an issue as to the substantive jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the children and that consideration needed to be given to this issue and to the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (hereafter BIIA) to these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, the court was asked to consider the issue of the habitual residence of the children.  On 3 October HHJ Butler concluded that the children remained habitually resident in Belgium and directed the local authority to liaise, through the Central Authority, with children's protective services in Belgium, to communicate the decision of the court to the Belgian authorities and to discuss the practical or legal steps that may be required to give effect to the intention of the Belgian authorities.  Within this context HHJ Butler made a declaration pursuant to Art 17 of BIIA that the English court did not have jurisdiction in this case and, in so far as the court was making any further orders, those orders were being made under the provisions of Art 20 of BIIA. Within this context, the local authority has repeatedly communicated with the Belgian authorities with the assistance of ICACU.   </p>

He met her in her native country at the time, both were adherents of the Church of Christ. They had premarital sexual relations, which was in violation of their strict religious beliefs, and he informed her father thereof. As a result, she was disowned by her family and handed over to him. She then repeatedly fell victim to physical violence and it can be posited that he also brought her into contact with drugs. She was entirely dependent on him and he brought her to Belgium, where she led an isolated life. In the meantime, they had two children, but the domestic violence and drug abuse have apparently never stopped, which is why the father was imposed a temporary restraining order in April of 2019, with which he however did not comply. To escape this long spiral of domestic violence, the mother did indeed flee. Our investigation, of which a report was sent to you, has revealed that the father ([G]) is doing drugs and that he is at large. No member of the family is currently registered in Belgium and they have been deleted from the National Register <span style="font-style:italic">ex officio</span>.  </p>

The principle of comity is accepted by Ms Birtles, and the adequacy of the system of Children&#8217;s Services in Belgium is not put in issue by the local authority.  However, Ms Birtles points out that the Belgian authorities have again responded to the questions posed by simply repeating their previous position, which is that they do not support a return, considering it to be contrary to the children's interests on the basis of their present situation. Ms Birtles further submits that, in these circumstances, the court does not have satisfactory evidence as to how the Belgian authorities would institute protective measures for the children were they to be returned, notwithstanding repeated requests for clarification of the same. </p>

In these circumstances, Ms Birtles submits that a return to Belgium would simply be incomprehensible to the children and would, in that context, be plainly psychologically harmful and would place the children in an intolerable situation. </p>

Within the context of this tension between the need to evaluate the evidence against the civil standard of proof and the summary nature of the proceedings, the Supreme Court further made clear that the approach to be adopted in respect of the harm defence is not one that demands the court engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the matters alleged as grounding the defence under Art 13(b).  Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified.   </p>

She was said wrongly to have rejected it without adequate explanation and to have failed to follow the test set out in &#167;36 of Re E in her treatment of the mother's allegations. In summary, the argument was that she should have adopted the "sensible and pragmatic solution" referred to in &#167;36 of Re E and asked herself whether, if the allegations were true, there would be a grave risk within Article 13b and then, whether appropriate protective measures could be put in place to obviate this risk. That would have required evidence as to what protective steps would be possible in Lithuania, the submission went. </p>

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see Re E supra &#167;32) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother's evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in &#167;37 about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania </p>

The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at &#167;35 of Re S, supra).  Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E.&#8217; </p>

As referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, at [52], the English courts have sought to address the alleged risk by "extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there.

The expression "protective measures" is a broad concept and is not confined to specific measures such as the father proposed in this case.  It can include, as I have said, any "measure" which might address the risk being advanced by the respondent, including "relying on the courts of the requesting state". Accordingly, the general right to seek the assistance of the court or other state authorities might in some cases be sufficient to persuade a court that there was not a grave risk within Article 13(b).&#8221; </p>

I am further satisfied that I should not exercise my resulting discretion to make a return order in this case and should dismiss the application of the father.  My reasons for so deciding are as follows. </p>

It is important however, in evaluating in this case whether the exception under Art 13(b) is made out, to begin by paying careful regard to the children&#8217;s current situation in this jurisdiction, the requested State.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The children have now been in this jurisdiction for nearly 12 months.  They have been taken into State care and are the subject of care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, which proceedings the English court has determined it has jurisdiction to hear pursuant to the relevant provisions of BIIA.  Those proceedings are ready for final hearing.  Pending the determination of those child protection proceedings, the children have been and remain the subject of effective protective measures comprising a placement in foster care, which placement continues to provide them with secure, safe and consistent care.  Both children are said to be thriving in the protective provision constituted by their foster care placement.  Subject to the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the children have continued to have contact with their mother. The English court has determined that the children have now lost their habitual residence in Belgium and permission to appeal that decision has been refused by the Court of Appeal. </p>

There are no relatives in Belgium who can care for the children were they to be returned to that jurisdiction.  Indeed, administrative proceedings have been taken in Belgium to </p>

Within this context, beyond a bare statement that, were the English court to make such an order, unspecified <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> protective measures would have to be taken, those authorities have declined to indicate what protective measures would be put in place were the English court to order the return of the children pursuant to the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention.  In the circumstances, after repeated enquiries made over a period of seven months via the Belgian Central Authority, to enquiries which the Belgian authorities have diligently responded, this court has no indication of the nature and extent of the protective measures that would be put in place were the children to be returned to Belgium without either parent, as they inevitably would have to be given each parents&#8217; concession that neither are able to care for the children and there are no other family members who could do so.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the circumstances, there is no evidence before the court to confirm who would take custody of the children upon their arrival in Belgium, whether any proceedings would be issued and, if so, by whom, what arrangements would be made for their care and how contact with their mother would be facilitated beyond an indication from the Belgian authorities that unspecified arrangements would be made when necessary or needed and only if a return order were made.   As Ms Holloran rightly points out, within this context the &#8216;standard&#8217; undertakings offered by the father do not address the complexity of the situation faced by the court because, in the circumstances of this case, it is simply not within the father&#8217;s gift to do what would be required. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I have made clear, this lack of clarity as to protective measures in the requesting state does not stem from a failure by the Belgian authorities to co-operate with the English authorities in answering questions as to protective measures, or from an absence of such protective measures in the jurisdiction in question (the existence of which the principle of comity in any event demands this court assume), but rather from a decision by those authorities not to provide details of protective measures in circumstances where they consider a return of the children to the jurisdiction of Belgium is plainly antithetic to their best interests.  As Mr Semple points out, the documents before the court indicate that that decision appears to have been a reasoned one and that the reluctance of the Belgian authorities to indicate protective measures that may be put in place should the English court order the return of the children has its genesis in that reasoned decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is possible to have some sympathy with this argument.  In taking a decision in an Art 13(b) case to decline to provide information on protective measures based on its assessment of whether it is in a child&#8217;s best interests to be returned, it might be said that a requesting State, by taking such a decision, in effect acts to determine the application on the basis of a welfare assessment rather than the application being determined by the requested State by reference to the principles in the 1980 Hague Convention.  However, it is not for this court to regulate the actions of agencies in a requesting State.  In so far as the father seeks to establish that the actions of the <span style="font-style:italic">Belgian</span> authorities have, by reason of the impact of their decision making on these proceedings, breached his Art 6 and Art 8 rights those arguments are not for this court to determine. Within this context, in determining an application under the 1980 Hague Convention this court must proceed on the basis of the information that is, and that is not, available to it.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In these circumstances, and having regard to the totality of the information that is, and that is not available to the court in this case, I am satisfied that to order the return of the children to the jurisdiction of Belgium would place them in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13(b).  That situation of intolerability is grounded in the stark contrast between the children&#8217;s current situation in this jurisdiction and the situation that would pertain for the children in the future were they to be returned to Belgium in the circumstances I have outlined above.  The making of a return order in this case would remove clearly vulnerable children who have suffered significant harm in the care of their parents from a safe, stable, secure and certain situation governed by a framework of protective measures in this jurisdiction to an entirely uncertain situation in Belgium in which it is not clear where the children will live, who they will be cared for by and what steps will be taken to determine the extant welfare issues in respect of them in a jurisdiction which has declined to indicate that it is willing to put in place protective arrangements for the children, where they are no longer habitually resident and which has expressly invited this court to conclude that a return would be entirely antithetical to their best interests.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, to order the return of the children to Belgium in these circumstances would result in the children moving from a position of certainty, stability and security to a position of manifest uncertainty, instability and insecurity.  They would be moved from a situation in which, in the context of neither of their parents having the capacity to care for them, their needs are being met by planned protective measures implemented in the framework of closely timetabled child protection proceedings to a situation in which, by reason of the considered position taken by the authorities in the requesting state, it is unclear whether and which protective measures might be taken.  In my judgment that would amount to a situation of intolerability for the children for the purposes of Art 13(b) of the 1980 Hague Convention.  Once again this is not a settlement case. However, the court also cannot ignore, as an aspect of intolerability, the manifest emotional and physical disruption to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have of course borne carefully in mind that courts should accept, unless the contrary is proved, that the administrative, judicial and social service authorities of the requesting State are equally as adept in protecting children as they are in the requested State.   However, as noted by Lowe and others in <span style="font-style:italic">International Movement of Children: Law, Practice and Procedure</span> 2nd Edt. at paragraph 24.55, if it is demonstrated on evidence that the requesting State cannot, or is incapable of or is unwilling to implement protective measures then the criteria set out in Art 13(b) may well be satisfied.  In this case, I am satisfied that the evidence clearly establishes, for the reasons I have given, that the absence of information as to protective measures in the requesting State does not stem from a failure by the Belgian authorities to cooperate with the English authorities in answering questions as to protective measures, or from an absence of such protective measures in the jurisdiction in question (the existence of which, once again, the principle of comity in any event demands this court assume), but rather from a decision by those authorities not to provide details of protective measures in circumstances where they consider a return of the children to the jurisdiction of Belgium should not take place.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The children have been in England now for nearly 12 months.  That the passage of time, the children&#8217;s experiences and their present secure situation in foster care are highly relevant factors in the assessment of their best interests when considering the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion.  As I have set out above, each of the children is thriving in their current placement, speaks English and benefits from receiving safe and stable care.  It would not be in either of the children&#8217;s best interests to disrupt their placements.  Both children are now the subject of child protection proceedings which are ready for final determination.  To make a return order would disrupt or delay those proceedings and thus delay the determination of the children&#8217;s long term welfare.  This would plainly not be in their best interests.  Beyond this, for the reasons I have given, to make a return order would move the children from a settled position of security, safety and uncertainty to a position of manifest uncertainty.  This would plainly not be in either child&#8217;s best interests. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a more disruptive step for the children at this point in their young lives.  As I have already stated, both children have now lost their habitual residence in Belgium.  </p>
