	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 2 June 2017 a four month old child, D, suffered a catastrophic collapse at the home which he shared with his parents, X and Y. At the time he was in the sole care of his father Y, his mother having gone out with her family to celebrate the birthday of her younger sister. Shortly after 7.30pm D was shaken by his father, Y, causing him significant brain and other injuries. Y called 999 at 19.36 and attempted to resuscitate D following instructions given to him on the phone by the 999 controller. When the paramedics arrived some 4 minutes after the 999 call was made, D was pale, floppy, breathing abnormally and had white fluid coming from his nostrils and mouth. </p>

He was immediately intubated and ventilated and an initial CT scan showed subdural bleeding on the right side of D&#8217;s brain. He was transferred that night to a much larger hospital where further CT scans were undertaken showing bilateral subdural bleeds and a diffuse hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. The extent of the bleeding was confirmed by an MRI scan which also showed spinal subdural haemorrhages. An opthalmological examination revealed extensive bilaternal retinal and pre-retinal haemorrhages. Despite every effort by the medical and nursing staff to treat D&#8217;s extensive injuries, D died at 15.31 on 4 June 2017.  </p>

She strongly denied the same and also denied that she had failed to protect the children from the risk of physical harm as submitted by the local authority. I observe that the mother was not cross-examined by Miss Isaacs QC on the basis that she had caused the older head injury to D and the older rib fractures to C. I note that the mother accepted that the threshold criteria were crossed in this case and accepted that she had failed to protect the children from emotional harm by dint of them being in a household where she was the subject of domestic abuse. The Children&#8217;s Guardian has remained neutral with respect to the findings sought by the local authority. Z did not oppose any of the findings sought by the local authority. </p>

There is nothing remarkable about the relationship between the mother and Z insofar as the fact-finding exercise is concerned, specifically it was not a relationship characterised by domestic abuse. Following the breakdown of her relationship with Z, the mother permitted him to have extensive visiting and staying contact with A. Those arrangements were flexible and appear to have worked to the benefit of A until the mother began her relationship with Y.  </p>

There was little information about this relationship before the court save for a police log on 20 January 2015 recording that the mother sought help when JT came to her house after their separation to remove his bed. On 6 February 2015 the mother sought help from her GP with anxiety following the breakup of this relationship. She told the GP that JT had been going into the back garden at night to scare her; that he had broken into the property; that the police were involved; and that JT was on bail with a condition that he did not contact her. She said that she never thought he would behave like this and was very scared and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">paranoid</span>&#8221; to be in the house alone with her daughter as the slightest noise caused her to panic and hyperventilate. In her oral evidence, which on this point I accept, the mother told me that her relationship with JT was not characterised by domestic abuse, whatever may have been her fears once it ended. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Y was born in November 1987 and is now 30 years of age.  Y has worked as a bricklayer, builder and window fitter. He has an extensive criminal record, chiefly for battery and criminal damage. His previous relationships appear to have been characterised by domestic abuse, although these incidents were not litigated within these proceedings save where convictions resulted. Incidents of battery on 5 December 2008, 6 December 2008, 9 September 2012 and 8 November 2014 all arose within a domestic context, the last of these involving his previous partner with whom he has a three-year-old daughter. Y does not have contact with his daughter from this relationship. A conviction for wounding pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100" uk:canonical="1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict.) c. 100" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Offences Against the Person Act 1861</ref> arose when he head-butted someone in a pub, receiving a suspended sentence of imprisonment in October 2008. Probation records indicated that many of these offences occurred when Y was under the influence of alcohol. In July 2013 he was convicted of drink driving for which he was fined and banned from driving for 12 months. The mother and Y were in agreement that problematic alcohol use was not a major contributory factor in their relationship difficulties.  </p>

She had been hosting a party at her home to celebrate his brother&#8217;s wedding when Y and X rowed outside the house. Y&#8217;s mother intervened in an attempt to calm the situation whereupon Y put his hands on her throat. She slapped him in self-defence and he took his hands off her throat. She called the police and, at some point during the police attendance at the house, Y assaulted the officer arresting him. He pleaded guilty to this offence and was sentenced to 8 weeks&#8217; imprisonment suspended for 18 months together with a rehabilitation activity requirement. Y told me in his oral evidence that he had no memory of assaulting his mother as he was extremely drunk but did not deny that he had behaved as she had said in her evidence. </p>

One of the mother&#8217;s friends, LR, described him as being explosive, escalating from 0-100 in an instant.  In 2008 he was required to undertake anger management work as part of a suspended sentence. That work, like many of the rehabilitative courses prescribed by those sentencing him for various offences, was never completed because he repeatedly failed to attend thereby breaching his sentence.  Y also used cocaine from time to time and in May and July 2011 he accepted two police cautions for possessing cocaine. The texts exchanged between X and Y showed that she suspected him of using cocaine during their relationship. Y told me that he had used cocaine about 10 times during his relationship with the mother and explained this infrequent use by saying that cocaine did not agree with him. He also told me that he had told the mother when he used cocaine. In addition, Y stated that he used cannabis often during the relationship, cannabis use being something of a substitute for alcohol.  </p>

It appears that Z, one or two of her friends and Y&#8217;s mother told her about Y&#8217;s convictions for domestic abuse prior to B&#8217;s birth but the mother denied that this had happened at that time and asserted that Y had told her after B was born.

However, a pattern of domestic abuse, separations, excuses and reconciliations quickly developed.  Furthermore, until the birth of the twins in January 2017, the mother told me that Y provided little support to her with either child care or household tasks. </p>

He threatened to kill himself if she left him and taunted her that no other man would have her because they would be scared of what he might do to them. She described him walking out on her; breaking and smashing things in the house; controlling what she wore; keeping her away from friends and family; snatching her phone from her and smashing it through jealousy (on one occasion when the mother was holding B); taking her car so she could not easily leave her home with the children; and not allowing her to communicate with Z over the contact arrangements for A. Z&#8217;s evidence confirmed that the mother asked him to stop calling her and coming to her home as it was causing difficulties in her relationship with Y. Z became aware of Y sitting in his van watching the mother walk A to school and that Y made her walk the long way round to A&#8217;s school so that the mother did not pass Z&#8217;s house. On one occasion the mother walked past Z&#8217;s house and he went out to ask if he could have A for contact on a different day. Y came running down the road shouting &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">why are you talking to her &#8211; it&#8217;s fucking Monday morning</span>&#8221;. Z tried to explain but Y was pushing Z and shouting at him. Y had picked B up out of her pushchair whilst he was doing this and the mother tried to stop Y. In his evidence Y accepted squaring up to Z during this incident and that Z had done nothing to warrant such behaviour. He also accepted that B had witnessed this incident.   </p>

He told me that the mother was controlling and verbally abusive on a daily basis, making him feel that he was a failure and that he could never do anything right.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In April 2017 the family support worker spoke to the mother about her decision to reconcile with Y despite previously insisting that they would remain apart. The mother said she had been scared of managing on her own and that she loved him. She was pleased that they had reconciled as things were much better this time round because Y was much nicer and more considerate. The mother was at pains to stress in her evidence that Y was much more helpful and supportive with the twins than he had previously been in their relationship. Though their rows continued and he walked out on a regular basis, the mother sought to assert to her family and in her evidence in chief that Y was not physically violent to her after the twins&#8217; birth. The text messages suggested otherwise: on 1 March 2017 the mother texted Y saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;never you is it always someone else all them things make you push me in the head did they. You offer to do night feeds then kick of get in a stress so you don&#8217;t have to&#8230;</span>&#8221; and again on 11 April 2017 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;and once again put your hands on me your never going to change once a woman beater always a woman beater&#8230;</span>&#8221;.

Y was present and the atmosphere between the parents was reported to be relaxed and positive. The health visitor decided that no further targeted visits were necessary and an appointment was made for the twins to have a developmental check when they were nine months old. Following a Team Around the Child meeting on 17 May 27 (convened as a forum in which Y&#8217;s probation officer, A&#8217;s headteacher and the health visitor could meet), the case was closed to the Family Resource Service. </p>

NS reported that the mother had said Y told her during the call that D was red in the face and seemed flustered. The mother had no recollection of receiving such a phone call but accepted that this might have happened. On his account Y had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">prop-feeding</span>&#8221; the twins, and then left them for a few seconds to go to his van, returning to find D blue and floppy. Y had laid D on the floor and compressed his chest. After a few minutes D&#8217;s colour returned but his eyes were discoloured and a bit red and he was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">out of it</span>&#8221;. When the mother returned home, she told me that the way Y had spoken to her about what had happened worried her. At that stage, Y told her that D had choked on his bottle. D appeared to the mother to be pale but otherwise showed no other symptoms. </p>

Both the mother&#8217;s sister and NS reported the mother as telling them that D had experienced more persistent symptoms that day arising from this incident - his eyes had been disoriented for a while that day and he was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">out of it</span>&#8221; and sleeping a lot according to the mother&#8217;s sister.

As the coughing did not stop but then went quiet, he went into the room where the twins were and discovered D had gone blue. D was still however breathing.

Y told the mother when she returned home one day that he had slipped on the bathroom floor whilst holding C. The mother had thought that, when Y held C up to protect him from hitting the floor, C&#8217;s head had hit the washing basket in the bathroom causing a small mark/bruise under the eye. This was described as a red mark which the mother&#8217;s cousin, VW, saw a couple of days after the incident &#8211; she said it was dark red and went from the outer edge of the eye to underneath the left or right eye. She observed that the mark was slightly darker in the middle and lighter towards the edges and was about 2 inches long and half an inch wide. The mother&#8217;s cousin remarked how close it was to C&#8217;s eye and the mother said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">something like how bad it was</span>&#8221;. VW told me in her oral evidence that the mother had not thought the mark was serious and that it had clearly been caused accidentally. The mother denied that the mark had persisted as recounted by VW and said it had faded some 15 minutes after her return home. That the red mark was short-lived was supported by the oral evidence of Y. </p>

Additionally, he suggested that, as the mother was the primary carer for the children and was thus caring for them most of the time, it was possible that she might have squeezed C on another occasion so tightly as to cause his older rib fractures. He recalled an incident in April/May 2017 when he was sleeping in A&#8217;s bed as she was staying with her father and he awoke at about 2am to find the mother shouting at the boys. He ran into their bedroom and saw her standing up with one of the boys at arm&#8217;s length shouting at him very loudly. He could not remember if this was C or D but remembered telling the mother to leave the room immediately. Before the mother left the room, she threw the baby on the bed but came back later to their bedroom to apologise for what she had done.

D was a normally developed and normally grown baby boy. He had no traumatic birth history and there had been no neo-natal problems. No bruising was detected either on external examination or on deep dissection of the skin and no bruising suggestive of an impact to D&#8217;s head was identified. However, head injury with an impact component was not excluded as, in a domestic setting, this could occur with soft furnishings where bruising would not necessarily be anticipated. Death was due to head injury of the shaking/impact type.  </p>

The haemorrhage was predominantly in the nerve fibre layer and in the retina but there was extensive haemorrhage extending through all layers of the retina and involving the receptor cell layer. The bleeding appeared reasonably fresh and some Perls iron reaction was consistent with a survival period of 48-72 hours. There was no extensive iron deposition to indicate a previous episode of haemorrhage in the eyes. In addition, there was haemorrhage of the optic disc in each eye. Both eyes were anatomically normal with neither developmental abnormalities nor pre-existing pathological disease processes being present. The distribution and extent of the haemorrhage seen in D&#8217;s eyes and optic nerves was that associated with head impact trauma or head movement trauma or a combination of both events. Dr McCarthy&#8217;s opinion was that the bleeding in this particular case was quite extensive and he regarded it as being the more extreme end of the spectrum given the significant orbital bleeding, significant optic nerve bleeding, and significant confluent retinal bleeding. The damage to D&#8217;s eyes was fresh and would be consistent with having occurred at and around the time that D collapsed. The amount of force required to cause this pattern and extent of haemorrhage was above that which is normally encountered in the day-to-day handling of an infant or indeed in episodes of so-called &#8220;rough handling&#8221;. Dr McCarthy&#8217;s overall conclusion, in the absence of firm evidence of head impact trauma, was that the damage to D&#8217;s eyes was consistent with head movement trauma. </p>

Dr Stoodley&#8217;s opinion was that there was likely to have been a major change in D&#8217;s behaviour at the time of the event causing these injuries. The symptoms and signs seen after abusive head trauma were however variable and non-specific: they ranged from the child going quiet for a while, to going off their feeds, vomiting, reduced levels of consciousness, abnormal movements and seizures to frank coma. </p>

He concluded that the intracranial bleeding, hypoxic ischaemic brain injury, retinal haemorrhages and spinal bleeding were caused non-accidentally and most probably by shaking. He could not exclude D&#8217;s head having impacted with a semi-yielding object. The clinical signs of acute subdural bleeding were typically a sudden alteration in consciousness with floppiness, pallor, impaired breathing and possibly vomiting immediately after the causal event. The severity of the symptoms was linked to the degree of the brain injury. D had extensive hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury so his symptoms were very likely to have been at the severe end of the spectrum. The causal event was very likely to have occurred moments before the emergency services were contacted. The force needed to cause the head injuries would be obviously excessive to a normally competent and responsible person. </p>

Thus, a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">little shake</span>&#8221; would not have induced the whiplash type of movement which would have been necessary to cause the profound injuries seen in D.

With respect to the first limb of Miss Isaacs QC&#8217;s challenge, Dr Jacques was clear that the gold standard for the identification of subdural bleeding was by tissue examination of the brain itself. Furthermore, there was often a discrepancy between what radiologists and pathologists saw with pathologists having the advantage of an examination in incredible detail under the microscope.

The various descriptions of D&#8217;s presentation were put and Dr Cartlidge agreed that these might be symptoms of a head injury at the milder end of the spectrum of head injuries. He was however very clear that an episode of choking might cause a child to become blue or floppy but would not cause subdural bleeding.  Mr Richards agreed that the symptoms presented by D would be consistent with encephalopathy or a subdural bleed at the lower end of the spectrum of head injuries. It would be rare though not incompatible to have such symptoms caused by a choking episode. Choking events were very rare in children, even those who were very vulnerable. Mr Richards was clear that there was no association between choking and subdural bleeding in mainstream medical thinking and that such a link (found in the work of Dr Geddes and others) had been refuted by the Court of Appeal in recent years. </p>

There was callus formation of the posterior aspect of the left seventh and eighth ribs consistent with healing rib fractures which were approximately three weeks old at the time of the skeletal survey [i.e. caused on approximately 15 May 2017].

Dr Jeanes was of the opinion that both these sets of rib fractures were highly likely to be inflicted injuries resulting from trauma to the chest on at least two separate occasions. Such fractures would usually be caused by either antero-posterior chest compression, by the direct impact of the chest onto a hard surface or following a direct blow to the chest wall.

All the fractures were due to two separate episodes of trauma. C would have been distressed at the point of fracture and experienced pain and fear which would have been obvious to anyone present when the fracture was inflicted. However, once C&#8217;s distress wore off, it may not have been obvious that C had a fractured rib. A carer who was unaware of the traumatic incident which caused the fractures would not have reason to suspect that C required medical attention. Dr Ehrhardt thought it more likely that C had been shaken, the shaking causing his rib fractures by him having been twice grasped excessively firmly around the chest. However, at a later point in his report, he contradicted his assertion that C was shaken by writing that it was unknown whether this had happened to C. </p>

Deep breaths, crying and handling around the chest would have exacerbated any ongoing discomfort, causing C to be more fractious than usual for at least a few days. As young babies cry so frequently without a specific reason being identifiable, the cause of C&#8217;s distress was unlikely to have been recognised especially by a carer unaware of any traumatic event.

Rather, it must take account of a wide range of matters which include the expert evidence but also include, for example, its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and inferences that can be properly drawn from the evidence. Thus, the opinions of medical experts need to be considered in the context of all of the other evidence.

I had the real sense that no one could blame her more than she blamed herself for what had happened to her family. At times she was so distressed and so racked with guilt that I wondered whether it was safe for me to rely on what she said at those points in her evidence.

It was not, as confirmed by her own admissions in cross-examination. I am also satisfied that the mother&#8217;s account of the choking incident involving D in about mid-May 2017 was untruthful since three other witnesses who I found to be straightforward and reliable told me that she had given them an account of what had happened at variance in important respects with what she told me had occurred. </p>

He was keen to portray himself as much a victim of domestic abuse as the mother. Though he accepted that his behaviour towards the mother had been abusive, he sought to minimise this or excuse it as being but a reaction to the mother&#8217;s own nasty and belittling behaviour towards him. At times his evidence was coloured by patent self-pity. He was by turns almost flippant, then defensive but then acknowledged his responsibility for D&#8217;s death and the need to make amends. There were some occasions when he appeared to be genuinely moved and, when I reminded him of C&#8217;s need for answers about what had happened to his twin, Y&#8217;s evidence was notably more frank and his demeanour sorrowful. </p>

Y&#8217;s own mother described her as a perfect parent to the extent that she would neglect herself for the sake of her children. I have no doubt whatsoever that she undertook most of the physical and emotional care for the children, including caring for the twins during the night. That was not an easy task given that, when the twins were born, she was caring for three children under the age of two years. Leaving aside the evident problems in her relationship with Y, she would have been physically exhausted throughout most of the period from January 2017 onwards. Y was, by contrast, an inexperienced parent who gave little assistance to the mother when B was a baby. Though he seems to have helped a little more when the twins were born, even on his own account Y absented himself from the home on many occasions to go fishing with his friends. I formed the very clear impression that he was a selfish man who did as little round the house as he could get away with. His parenting inexperience coupled with his short temper sheds light on the circumstances in which D and C came to be so seriously injured. </p>

She was out of the house when D was fatally assaulted by Y and was also not present on the earlier occasion when Y shook D. She bears no responsibility for the rib injuries to C. Y&#8217;s case, as set out in his statements, was that the mother might have been responsible for D&#8217;s earlier brain injury, Y asserting that he had seen the mother throw D into his bouncy chair which left D unsettled for several hours afterwards. Y also suggested that, as the mother was the primary carer for the twins, it was possible that she might have been responsible for the older rib fractures to C. In response to questions put by me, Y admitted that the mother was not responsible for C&#8217;s older rib fractures and that he had lied out of spite in suggesting that she was. He also accepted in cross-examination by Mr Goodwin QC that he had inflicted C&#8217;s earlier rib injuries. I regard Y&#8217;s attempt to implicate the mother as a possible perpetrator of some of the injuries to the twins as utterly reprehensible given that he knew that he was wholly responsible for injuring his sons. </p>

A&#8217;s behaviour was also congruent with her involvement in an extremely unpleasant incident which had convinced her that Y had tried to strangle her mother. That incident had a devastating impact on A as both her mother and Z attested.

Yet this is not the complete picture. The evidence also demonstrated that both adults were guilty of initiating and prolonging verbal altercations, with the mother on at least several occasions physically assaulting the father (for example, hitting him with a metal broom handle in October 2016 and pushing if not punching him on 29 December 2016). These matters in no way negate or excuse the effect of Y&#8217;s appalling behaviour towards the mother but illustrate a more complex and nuanced dynamic in their relationship. </p>

Her evidence was that she had heard rumours about Y&#8217;s behaviour in past relationships but that no-one had told her about it at that time. Z&#8217;s evidence on this point was, I find, clear and I accept it. He told me that he had tried to tell her about Y&#8217;s violence to former partners before B was born and that he was positive that several of her friends would also have told her about Y&#8217;s reputation. Having heard rumours about Y, I find it highly unlikely that the mother would have closed her ears to information about his past from close friends. In any event, it was clear from her evidence that she knew of Y&#8217;s domestic abuse convictions by summer 2016. By that stage she was also well aware of the effect of domestic abuse on her children as she confirmed to the health visitor in June 2016. </p>

At times the relationship struck me as like a revolving door with Y returning almost as soon as the mother asked him to leave. Despite multiple opportunities to separate from Y and the support of her family and friends, the mother nevertheless reconciled with him time and time again. Though she told me that she could not see a way out of their relationship especially after the twins were conceived when she felt she could not manage alone and wanted them all to be a family, I suspected that it was not just fear of or control by Y which drew her back to him time after time. Her behaviour in autumn 2016 when she tracked his movements with the assistance of her friend, CC, and her contact with him within days of the terrible assault on her in late October 2016 also stemmed from jealousy and need rather than fear. At that time Y had begun another relationship which was known to the mother &#8211; it would have been the perfect opportunity for her to end this profoundly dysfunctional relationship. Yet she sought out contact with Y both by phone, by text and in person and spent the night with him on 27 November 2016. Y, on the evidence available to me, was exerting no pressure on her to return to him &#8211; in fact he was flaunting his relationship with another woman.  Yet, by 30 December 2016 they had reconciled despite her assaulting him the previous day.  </p>

In her written statement the mother&#8217;s friend, LR, described her with considerable insight as being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">incredibly strong and would sometimes give as good as she got. There was something about [Y] that just seemed to get past her defences. As I said they loved each other but couldn&#8217;t be together</span>&#8221;. That insight was also apparent in her oral evidence when LR told me that the mother was a strong person who would never have anyone tell her what to do in any way whatsoever. Their relationship was a nightmare, LR said, full of broken promises made by Y.  That evidence illuminated the addictive and damaging nature of the relationship between these adults. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On post-mortem examination of D&#8217;s brain, the presence of organised haemosiderin deposits surrounded by a cellular membrane was, on the balance of probabilities, clear evidence of an earlier subdural bleed entirely separate from the incident on 2 June 2017. Though the imaging did not show this older bleeding, all the experts agreed there was no conflict between the microscopic pathology and the macroscopic neuroradiology. Dr Jacques&#8217; evidence to me about the length of time it took for the haemosiderin/membrane to appear was that it would be several days before the event occurred which led to the acute changes in D&#8217;s brain [i.e. June 2017]. He was unable to be more precise than this. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Though Dr Jacques could not exclude causation at birth, his experience told him that this would not explain the particular pathology he identified microscopically. I accept his evidence to me that, whilst it was not at all uncommon to see a very small amount of Perls material [material indicative of haemosiderin] without significant membrane formation in the dura of a child who dies later in life [bleeding arising from birth trauma], it was not usual to see the kind of membrane formation described here in that context. All the other experts deferred to Dr Jacques as to the significance of the combined haemosiderin and cellular membrane. Dr Cary said that, unless there was a very traumatic birth, one would expect most of the cellular membrane to have subsided by the time of D&#8217;s post-mortem. Dr Cartlidge indicated that the key issue was how unusual the finding was in the context of Dr Jacques&#8217; experience of infant autopsies. I am satisfied that, given the evidence of the other experts, I can rely on Dr Jacques&#8217; evidence as to an earlier subdural haemorrhage in D&#8217;s brain. The challenge to Dr Jacques&#8217; evidence mounted by Miss Isaacs QC did not get off the ground given (a) that the scientific paper she relied on was methodologically flawed as identified by Dr Jacques and (b) there was no inconsistency between the microscopic findings in the brain and the macroscopic imaging examined by some of the other experts. </p>

The lay evidence about this incident is not easily reconciled. Y said in his oral evidence that D was fine despite having vomited and that his pallor was normal with nothing to worry about. This account contradicted both (a) his own written evidence dated 29 January 2018 which was that D was pale and blue in colour when Y returned from his van and (b) what he told his aunt the very next day, namely that D was blue on his return and thus Y had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ripped</span>&#8221; him out of his chair to hit him on the back and had run outside with him to get him some air. Furthermore, Y denied telling the mother in some distress that evening that D had been blue and floppy and that he had had to perform chest compressions. His account in that respect was confirmed in part by the mother who said he was upset but that she had stopped him giving further details about D&#8217;s presentation in an effort to reassure him. </p>

Both recounted the mother reporting to them that, in the evening, Y had said D had gone blue and floppy and that he had performed chest compressions on D. Miss Meachin QC submitted in summary that their evidence should not be preferred to that of the mother as (a) their statements had been made in the context that the family had been told that D&#8217;s acute haemorrhage must have happened prior to the date of his hospital admission and they were trying to remember anything however small which was of relevance; (b) there were some discrepancies as to when their conversation with the mother had taken place so their recollection might be flawed; (c) they both accepted that the mother would have taken D to hospital had she thought him to be poorly and had he not apparently recovered; and (d) the mother&#8217;s sister had not told her own mother about this incident at the time.  I reject those submissions for the following reasons. Both witnesses were palpably honest and straightforward whereas the mother had good reason to minimise what had happened later that evening. Whatever minor discrepancies there were in their accounts, both were in agreement that Y had told the mother in some distress that evening that D was blue and either floppy or requiring chest compressions. Their accounts chimed with what Y&#8217;s aunt told me he had said to her. There is nothing in the point that the family were trying to explain D&#8217;s acute collapse &#8211; everyone was at the time these statements were taken by the police. I also accept the mother&#8217;s sister&#8217;s evidence that she had told her own mother about this incident the same evening as her discussion with the mother. The maternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence on this point was not evidence I can rely on given the unexplained contradictions between her oral evidence and her written evidence as to whether D turned blue during this incident. </p>

The circumstances in which Y found himself that day were strikingly similar to those which triggered his assault on D on 2 June 2017 &#8211; D was in his sole care, the twins were being prop-fed but had been left unattended by Y, D vomiting and Y picking him up immediately after the vomit. Thus, though the medical evidence cannot assist with the precise timing or mechanism or force causative of this subdural haemorrhage, I am satisfied from my survey of all the other evidence that I can find on the balance of probabilities that the earlier subdural haemorrhage was inflicted during the choking incident by Y who shook D with excessive force in anger. Y knew that he had hurt D as was evident both by D&#8217;s symptoms and Y&#8217;s response to those symptoms when the mother returned home and later that evening. This incident happened a few days before 26 May as described by Y in his statement. </p>

He accepted that he was capable of causing the rib fractures even if he had no memory of doing so and then admitted to me that he had broken C&#8217;s ribs, causing both the acute and the older fractures. The expert evidence was that C would have been distressed and in pain at the point of fracture and for about 10 minutes thereafter. This would have been obvious to an onlooker (and I include the perpetrator of those injuries in that category).  Both instances of fracture were thus likely to have been memorable events for Y and, that, in consequence he must have known that he had hurt C.

He initially said he did not want to say more without obtaining legal advice until I asked him to explain what he had done. He then said that he may have squeezed C&#8217;s ribs &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in frustration</span>&#8221; but claimed not to remember any details. When pressed, Y told me about an occasion when he had been sleeping in A&#8217;s bed (during her absence on a contact visit to Z) and awoke at about 2 am to hear the mother screaming at the twins, both of whom were crying. He went into their bedroom and picked up C (or possibly D) who had been thrown on the bed by the mother. The mother stormed out of the room as Y tried to comfort the child he was holding. Y told me that this child was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">crying and crying and crying &#8211; I must have got frustrated and squeezed him</span>&#8221;. He thought it was quite likely that he had fractured C&#8217;s ribs on this occasion. This incident seems to be very similar to an event described at paragraph 17 of Y&#8217;s statement dated 5 March 2018. In that paragraph Y sought to blame the mother for causing C&#8217;s earlier rib fractures and gave a similar description to that he gave me in his oral evidence but omitting therein any account of him squeezing C in frustration. Because of the generally unsatisfactory nature of Y&#8217;s evidence on this issue, I simply do not know whether his account in oral evidence was truthful or whether he was adapting an earlier account in his statement when pressed to explain how he had hurt C. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">With those observations in mind, I consider the specific findings sought in relation to knowledge of risk of physical harm to the children. My approach is to test each fact relied on before looking at matters in the round. The mother was reported to have told the family support worker in November 2016 of her unease about leaving B in his sole care because Y had a &#8220;short fuse&#8221;. This was said during a discussion about B&#8217;s contact with Y when the family support worker noted that: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[Mother] went on to say that she had tried to arrange contact between [Y] and [B] however [Y] had been inconsistent in this. [Mother] stated that she felt uneasy letting [Y] see [B] on his own due to his short fuse and him playing mind games. She stated that she had tried it for a few hours recently however [D] did not arrive with [B] at the correct time to bring her back. [Mother] stated that she telephoned [Y] who informed her that he was in </span></p>

In her evidence, the mother was adamant that she was worried about the father not bringing B back after contact and was not suggesting he was a risk to B. The family support worker was not called to give evidence and so I do not know whether the reference to Y&#8217;s short fuse referred to his loss of temper with the mother rather than with the children. </p>

VW was at pains during her oral evidence to stress that this was said during a jokey exchange with the mother, the aim being to amuse her grandmother. The mother responded by saying that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the way things were going [Y] would end up killing one of them [i.e. the twins]</span>&#8221;. VW, who I found to be a straightforward confident witness, told me that neither she nor the mother meant anything sinister by this exchange. In those circumstances, it would be most unwise for me to ascribe significance to this exchange and to infer that the mother had knowledge of Y&#8217;s physical risk to her children. </p>

I have already commented on the huge volume of such material attesting to rows, separations and reconciliations and, without more by way of corroboration, I am reluctant to ascribe significance to statements made in this volatile context.

Does it then follow that the mother ought to have known that Y&#8217;s violence to her and admitted short fuse placed the children at risk of physical harm or that he could not be left with the care of the children unsupervised?  He had never been seen by the mother or anyone else to rough handle the children and nothing untoward about his behaviour when with the children had been observed by professionals. I accept the evidence (a) that Y shouted and swore in the middle of the night when woken by the twins crying (b) that trivial things triggered Y&#8217;s temper and (c) that the mother was well-aware of his violence to her. In my judgment, it is a conceptual leap too far to assert that, in all the circumstances, such behaviour ought to have put the mother on notice that Y was a physical risk to her children or should not be with them unsupervised. She well understood though did not act on his risk to her but, on the evidence before me, the link between violence to a partner and violence to a child was not explicit for this mother. </p>

I am satisfied on the evidence that C sustained a red mark under one of his eyes but there is a dispute as to how long that mark persisted. Y said in his written evidence that it had remained for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">two days max</span>&#8221; though in his oral evidence he said it went quickly on the day itself as did the mother. I was asked to consider a bundle of photographs of the twins as the mother told me that she had taken a picture of C and D the following day when the mark had disappeared. As I had no exact date for this incident, those photographs did not assist me a great deal. </p>

Despite the absence of challenge in that respect by the mother&#8217;s legal team, VW was asked by Miss Meachin QC whether the mother had been open with her about the mark under C&#8217;s eye and whether she had seen the mark. To both questions, VW replied &#8220;yes&#8221;.  Looking at all the evidence, I do not accept that the red mark faded quickly and I accept the description of the mark given by VW.   </p>

There was no evidence that C was in any discomfort or distress either at the time or when seen by VW a couple of days later. He appeared to be perfectly well. With the benefit of hindsight, the mother recognised in her oral evidence that she should have taken C to hospital. I am however not persuaded that when, viewed objectively, her decision not to do so warranted the finding sought by the local authority.  Mr Goodwin QC suggested that common sense should have prompted a visit to the GP or hospital but common sense might equally well have prompted a caring parent like the mother not to do so in circumstances where her child appeared well and where what had happened appeared to be consistent with an accident. In that context, I also observe that I had no evidence from Dr Cartlidge on what might have been reasonable for a parent to have done in the circumstances. </p>
