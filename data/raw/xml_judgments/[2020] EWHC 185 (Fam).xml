The mother was unaware of the pregnancy and therefore had received no antenatal care. The mother took the decision to relinquish care of X at birth.  The mother was unprepared for motherhood, not knowing that she was expecting X.  She felt it would be in X&#8217;s best interests to grow up in an adoptive family.  She agreed to X being accommodated by the local authority and gave consent pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for X to be placed with foster carers on discharge from hospital with a view to subsequently giving her consent for him to be adopted.   </span></p>

She was also adamant that she did not want her parents, with whom she lives, to know about X&#8217;s birth.

He has the brain stem and some of the deep parts of his brain but nothing else is formed.

She referred to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes (NIDS), which recorded that most babies with hydranencephaly die before their first birthday. Reference was made to an Italian Journal of Paediatrics article in 2014 which recorded patients surviving into their 20s.

Case law has established that:  </span></p>

As is set out above, the legal question I have to address is what is in X&#8217;s best interests. X self evidently lacks capacity and it is not possible in the circumstances to assess his wishes and feelings. Ms Ford, on behalf of the Mother, does not resist the declaration being made.  </span></p>

Very sadly in this case starting with the strong presumption of the preservation of life, all the factors tend in favour of granting the declarations. I fully accept Dr de Lacey&#8217;s evidence. She was an excellent witness, giving measured and careful evidence, and plainly having an enormous expertise in her field.   </span></p>

He cannot see or hear, and it seems probable that the only sensation that he does have is one of pain. He is not even in the arguably better condition of some desperately ill babies in that he can feel nothing. X does appear to be able to feel pain and discomfort. It seems likely that X can experience no pleasure. </span></p>

As is set out in the cases above, life itself is precious and there is a very strong presumption in favour of preserving life. But X&#8217;s life is a truly tragic one and certainly reaches a threshold of intolerability.  </span></p>

When he gets an infection it can be treated, but his underlying condition of hydranencephaly is untreatable and irreversible. It will lead to his early death, and his condition will not improve. There is no possible doubt about his diagnosis. </span></p>
