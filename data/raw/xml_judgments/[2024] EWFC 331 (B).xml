I asked whether it was anticipated it would be for mother to be reassured and for it to be in her control as to contact moving on. The social worker told the court she could have re-framed it for evidence being presented to the court, but when I made the point that this is a final hearing, she confirmed that it would be for the mother.</span></p>

He has told a previous GP practice that he is illiterate and cannot read or write but there is no supporting evidence of such a diagnosis. He has told this court that someone else read the s7 report to him; and that he had help for dyslexia at school so assumed that there was such a diagnosis. However he has contacted the mother&#8217;s solicitors by email, he has messaged the mother and he has emailed the court during this hearing. He made notes in this hearing during submissions. He has been able to find others to help him read documents where necessary.
