It is therefore not as perfect as a reserved judgment and is the equivalent of an extemporaneous judgment. I am only dealing with the issue of whether contempt has been established against Mrs Byrne and Halesowen Estates Ltd at this stage. I very much regret having to deal with yet further issues of contempt in these very long-running and now notorious proceedings.</span></p>

However, the balance of the appeal, including that relating to the sentence imposed on Mr Hart, was dismissed. A subsequent attempt by Mr Hart to appeal to the Supreme Court was also unsuccessful.</span></p>

Prior to that order Mrs Byrne was the sole director of the company and the shares in it had been held by Mrs Byrne and a Mr Grayson &#8216;for the equal and joint benefit of Mr and Mrs Hart&#8217; (see para 14 of the judgment of February 2018). The 2015 order provided for the transfer of the shares to Mrs Hart. In the judgment of 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">rd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> February 2018 I explained the difficulties that she has faced in relation to that transfer and will not repeat the details here.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As to Halesowen Estates Limited (which I will call &#8216;Halesowen&#8217; from now on), it used to manage Drakestown Properties Ltd. The shares in Halesowen are held, nominally, by Mrs Byrne and, at the time of the hearing in 2015 at least, Mrs Byrne was also the only listed director. However, as I said in paragraph 21 of the February 2018 judgment: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">when Mrs Byrne gave evidence at that hearing she was unable to explain any aspect of the accounts and knew very little about the company. I had and have no difficulty in accepting Mrs Hart's evidence that it was Mr Hart who controls that company also and the records that it kept. That view is reinforced by the explanation that Mr Hart gave at the hearing in March 2017 about how Drakestown's income was applied &#8211; Halesowen Ltd collected the rents, paid them to the trust company, Dudley Estates Ltd (which he controls) which then re-applied some of the income to Drakestown (see response xv in Mr Hart's statement of 22</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"> March 2017).&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">On 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 2015, in an email written by Mrs Byrne to Mrs Hart&#8217;s commercial solicitors on behalf of Halesowen, Mrs Byrne asserted that Halesowen &#8216;hold a lien over all documents and funds of Drakestown Properties Ltd&#8217;. </span></p>

In paragraph ten of the judgment that I gave on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">rd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> February 2018, I voiced my criticism of the fact that the issue of conflict had not been considered within that legal team, or its previous members. When I raised the issue, I was told that there was a possibility of conflict and that Mrs Byrne and Halesowen needed to be advised by others. It is for that reason that this exceptionally delayed committal application had to be adjourned in order that separate legal representation might be found.</span></p>

Of course, Mrs Byrne and Halesowen were not parties to the undertaking given at the time of the substantive financial order but had been joined to the proceedings by consent on 24th February 2016 when the first of the above enforcement orders was made.  That enforcement order was made as a compromise of an earlier committal application that Mrs Hart had made against Mr Hart on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> October 2015.
