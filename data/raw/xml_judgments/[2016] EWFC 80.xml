Whatever my decision, one thing that has shone out during this difficult case is the love each of the adults have for H.  There will inevitably be a period of adjustment following this decision, but I sincerely hope each adult will recognise the role they have and the contribution they will make to H&#8217;s future.   </p>

Unfortunately, that was not possible.  An issue arose regarding the disclosure of a psychotherapist&#8217;s report relating to B that had been prepared in his immigration proceedings.  That issue was resolved by agreement to disclose the recommendations in that report and a psychiatric report was sought regarding B&#8217;s mental health from Dr S., whose report is now before the court.    </p>

Even though C was an experienced surrogate, this case demonstrates the risks involved when parties reach agreement to conceive a child which if it goes wrong can cause huge distress to all concerned.  For all the adults involved who all clearly love H, the one thing I know they will agree is that their dispute and this contested litigation has been a harrowing experience for them all.  This case highlights once again the consequences of not having a properly supported and regulated framework to underpin arrangements of this kind.   </p>

There are four parents with parental responsibility.  What I have to decide is who are best placed to give her a stable and permanent home.  In reaching that decision, H&#8217;s welfare is paramount, and the court needs to consider the matters set out in the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

As Lord MacDermott explained, this means that it &#8216;rules upon or determines the course to be followed&#8217;. There is no question of a parental right. As the Law Commission explained, &#8216;the welfare test itself is well able to encompass any special contribution which natural parents can make to the emotional needs of their child&#8217; or, as Lord MacDermott put it, the claims and wishes of parents &#8216;can be capable of ministering to the total welfare of the child in a special way&#8217;.&#8221; </p>

For the parent, perhaps particularly for a father, the knowledge that this is &#8216;his&#8217; child can bring a very special sense of love for and commitment to that child which will be of great benefit to the child...For the child, he reaps the benefit not only of that love and commitment, but also of knowing his own origins and lineage, which is an important component in finding an individual sense of self as one grows up.  The knowledge of that genetic link may also be an important (although certainly not an essential) component in the love and commitment felt by the wider family, perhaps especially grandparents, from which the child has so much to gain.&#8221; </p>

On two occasions, she has returned with greasy hair and a rash on her face and smelling of cigarette smoke.  Over a four week period, she had bites on her face and body.  We questioned the immediate concerns which were the bites and were told by B that they were mosquito bites and then spots.  We took H to the doctor for the rash.  The doctor said it was a fungal infection likely to have been bought on by H not having been cleaned properly.  She prescribed an antiseptic cream.  By the time H went back to B and A the following weekend, the rash had cleared up.  C passed the cream to B and A and asked them to continue using it for another two or three days to make sure the rash was not coming back.  The following Sunday when H came back to us, the rash was even worse.  A said that they had used the cream and handed me the tube back.  We used the cream again and the rash cleared up completely within about four to five days.

This lack of knowledge of each other was exposed with the difficulties they encountered in their relationship earlier this year.  It readily exposed their limited knowledge of each other and resulted in C and D making the decision they did to keep H, taking knowing and deliberate steps to secure her place with them legally and physically before informing B and A that H had been born.  In my judgment, this was a deliberate and calculated course of conduct decided on by C and D prior to and at the time of H&#8217;s birth.   </p>

This modus operandi of taking a position and sticking to it is a recurring theme of the way they operate.  They have limited or no capacity to resolve disputes, to negotiate their way through difficulties.  Their rigidity in deciding to keep H effectively justified the position they have taken, irrespective of the way the events have developed, seriously risks them not being able to give an accurate and balanced view to H about her circumstances and background.   </p>

As outlined earlier, she will soon form selective attachments.  During the ages of nine to twenty-four months, children demonstrate anxiety when separated from primary attachment figures.  Although they need to explore and meet other people, they are able to do this with their attachment figures nearby to act as a secure base for them to return to. </p>

I would suggest family days out together, or a meeting where she could spend a few hours in the care of C and D.  The frequency of this would have to take into account practical considerations, but should not be less than once every three weeks.&#8221; </p>

I based my thoughts upon H&#8217;s attachment needs.  It is significant that H has now passed the age of six months with frequent changes in carer.  She needs to go forward with stability to allow her to develop trusting relationships with consistent caregivers.&#8221; </p>

As she said and when reflecting on matters before writing her first report, it would have been very easy to recommend that H stayed with C and D.  She was obviously well settled there, they are experienced parents and that would have been the easy route.  But in her professional judgement such a course did not accord with her assessment of  H&#8217;s welfare needs for the reasons that she gave, in particular, the benefit of H of living in a home which reflects H&#8217;s genetic heritage, the pattern of undermining undertaken by C and D and the risks that poses to H and the ability of each set of parents to promote a positive image of the other to H.   </p>

She remained focused on that, really, if she did not see it as a problem, it would not be an issue for H.  Ms. Adams considered on balance H would gain more from living in a home reflective of her genetic heritage.  She recognised the steps C had taken to address this issue, but she did not think it compares to what she describes as &#8220;a lived experience&#8221;.   </p>

There is ample evidence to support this conclusion, which I agree with.  The reality is that, despite the assessment of Ms. Adams and the report of Dr. S ,  C and D still consider B&#8217;s mental health to be a risk to H&#8217;s future care, even though that is not supported by the independent evidence.  If this message were conveyed to H, it would be damaging.   </p>

But the evidence to date has shown that simply has not been possible, particularly if it is something that C does not agree with.  In D&#8217;s evidence, he was still clear that he feels that they should see the psychotherapist&#8217;s report.   C&#8217;s oral evidence was that &#8220;You can never be sure about mental health issues&#8221;, which leaves the issue lingering in an unhelpful way.  </p>

Bearing in mind the history any higher frequency at this stage risks further undermining of B and A&#8217;s ability to care for H which in turn puts H at risk of future emotional harm.
