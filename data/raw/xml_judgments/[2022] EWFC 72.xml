	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This is my judgment on an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s14</ref>D for leave to discharge a special guardianship order. The child who is the subject of the proceedings is T, a boy aged 5. The applicant is his mother (&#8216;M&#8217;). The respondents are the special guardian, who is T&#8217;s maternal grandmother (&#8216;MGM&#8217;), and the local authority, the special guardianship order having been made at the conclusion of care proceedings in 2017. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">M also makes an application for contact with T. Supervised contact was taking place regularly until December 2021 when it broke down. M does not need leave to apply for contact (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s10</ref>(7A)), and so these proceedings will continue in some form regardless of my decision on the leave application. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">T himself is not currently a party to these proceedings. It is not clear to me whether FPR 2010, r.12.3 requires the child to be a respondent to an application for leave to discharge (as distinct from an application to discharge once leave is granted). In the present case I am satisfied that it is not necessary for T to be made a party, and a guardian appointed for him, prior to the issue of leave being determined: I have sufficient information from the local authority and the other parties to be able to determine the leave application, and an independent overview of T&#8217;s welfare is not necessary at this stage. The position will, of course, be different if leave is granted. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">T&#8217;s father (&#8216;F&#8217;) has not played any significant role in his life and did not engage with the care proceedings, although he was notified of them. He has a significant criminal history and was in custody at the time of the final hearing. In M&#8217;s application it was stated that he does not have parental responsibility for T. During the course of preparing this judgment I received an email from M&#8217;s solicitors to say that was an error and F is in fact named on T&#8217;s birth certificate, although M has no contact details for him. In the circumstances I am satisfied that it is appropriate to deal with this application without making further efforts to locate F at this stage, but his position will clearly need to be re-considered when the matter returns for directions. </p>

In 2007 an initial child protection conference was convened and M was placed on a child in need plan.

In September 2020, after difficulties arose between M and MGM, the local authority agreed to offer a contact centre place for a time-limited period to allow the parties to reach an agreement about contact arrangements. The local authority offered to facilitate discussions between M and MGM but M refused to engage. In December 2021 the local authority ceased funding the contact centre place. </p>

The local authority is concerned that this discovery, in combination with the escalating tensions around T&#8217;s placement with MGM, led to M&#8217;s allegations. On other hand, it is not unusual in cases of sexual abuse for allegations to be made many years after the abuse took place.  M has given what could be a plausible explanation for her failure to raise the allegations in 2017, namely that MGM told her that if she said anything about her experiences as a child the likely outcome for T would be adoption. </p>

The alleged events took place long before the care proceedings; the allegations were of course known to M in 2017 when the special guardianship order was made; and the evidence on which M now relies in support of her allegations, namely the school records from 2006, were available to the local authority during those proceedings. </p>

For completeness however, it is appropriate to record my doubts, even if M had achieved much greater change, that her application would stand a real prospect of success. T is a five-year-old child who has lived with MGM (and his aunt) since he was a young baby. His relationship with M is important to him but he has not spent significant time with her and his primary attachment must be with MGM. It is difficult to see how, if the special guardianship order were discharged, M could meet his obvious need for an ongoing and meaningful relationship with his grandmother and aunt in circumstances where she currently has no communication with either of them at all. </p>

This point was not fully argued before me, there being no application before me to set aside the order, but I would tend to agree with the local authority that the fact that the allegations are based not on evidence that has come to light after the trial but on matters known to M at the time when the special guardianship order was made, together with the length of time that has elapsed since the order, mean that the balance would be likely to fall down in favour of finality. </p>

While I understand that M&#8217;s feelings towards MGM are complex, and that she has made allegations against MGM which will not now be determined by a court, the reality of this case is that the only way in which T&#8217;s important relationship with his mother can be maintained is if M engages with MGM to the limited extent which will be necessary to set up stable contact arrangements. The local authority&#8217;s offer to facilitate discussions around contact is almost certainly the best way of ensuring that contact resumes as soon as possible. M must bear in mind that if she declines to take up that offer it may be more difficult for the court to put in place appropriate contact arrangements, and it will certainly take much longer. </p>
