While CC has provided additional documents, for example additional bank statements, he has not provided all invoices, statements and receipts that are necessary to verify the accuracy of the account. In particular, he has not provided all receipts for the renovation work carried out at the property in Bristol. CC previously stated that he does not have all of the invoices and receipts, as the original builders left without completing the work and he could not locate them. In addition, in his letter dated 24 September 2014, he stated that he had delegated the task of paying the building workers &#8216;cash-in-hand&#8217; to his brother, who did not obtain written receipts from the tradesmen.

A specialist treatment company (Peter Cox Ltd) was asked to provide advice on how best to deal with the issue. Emergency remedial work was carried out in order to prevent any further spreading. Peter Cox provided a quotation of &#163;8,028 for them to carry out specialist treatment. Additional expenditure to reinstate the damaged timber areas will also be required. A rough estimate to complete the work (including the specialist treatment) in the region of &#163;17,000 was provided. As a result of the additional costs required to complete the remedial works, the family has decided to make up any shortfall of funds in order to ensure completion.</p>

Accordingly, as long as such an allowance is affordable, the court will take the commercial cost of care as the ceiling and reduce it by 20%.</p>

How should the court assess &#8216;the proper and reasonable cost&#8217;? There are two extreme solutions: (i) assess the full commercial rate for supplying the needs by employing someone to do what the relative does; (ii) assess the cost at nil, just as it is assessed at nil where the plaintiff is cared for under the national health scheme. &#8230;. It follows that in assessing &#8216;the proper and reasonable cost of supplying the needs&#8217; each case must be considered on its own facts.</p>

The ceiling would be the commercial rate.&#8221;</p>

Traditionally, in personal injury litigation, a carer&#8217;s allowance was linked to the Retail Prices Index (&#8216;RPI&#8217;). However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Thompstone v Tameside and Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/5" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 5" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 5</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 All ER 553" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 All ER 553</ref>, [2008] WLR 2207, the Court of Appeal held that the periodical payments payable to the claimant in respect of his care costs should be calculated by reference to the actual cost of care, as set out in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (&#8216;ASHE&#8217;), rather than the RPI.</p>

She had sold her car to pay the deposit and thereafter walked to and from work at Stoke Park Hospital. The retention of the property has no monetary motive and, if anything, it has turned out to be a millstone around her neck. The deputy and his siblings are retaining it simply out of respect for her wishes. The property is her pride and joy.</p>
