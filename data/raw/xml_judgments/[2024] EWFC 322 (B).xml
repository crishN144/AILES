The final hearing subsequently listed in January this year was used as a directions hearing, due to the Father changing his position to wanting shared care of the children and seeking to adduce further evidence into the proceedings. The Final Hearing therefore came to be listed before me, with a time estimate of 3 days.</span></p>

Her revised view, having considered Father&#8217;s latest statement was that not only did Father not fully accept the findings, but now he was asserting he wanted these findings reconsidered. In view of Father&#8217;s attitude, she did not consider she could continue to recommend the children&#8217;s time with Father should progress from the contact centre, even after 5 months.</span></p>

Firstly, there is a practical issue in that the Father has never been sole primary carer for these children. His ability to care for them safely for any longer than an hour by himself is untested. He is not familiar with their routines and performing their basic care tasks. These are children who are vulnerable by virtue of their young ages, and made more vulnerable by their inability to communicate with Father about their needs. The children do not speak Arabic, and Father does not speak Spanish or English (fluently). There is therefore a limit to what communication the children and Father can have at this time. These limitations as to practical care experience and communication could place the children at risk of inadvertently coming to harm in the Father&#8217;s care.</span></p>

I appreciate there were practical/financial difficulties with Father engaging with the same, but it is notable that he has not sought out any support whatsoever to address the concerns raised by the findings made by the Court. Those concerns therefore remain live, and in fact were heightened for the CAFCASS Family Court Adviser when she read Father&#8217;s most recent statement, which sought for the Court to re-open and re-examine those findings.</span></p>

I am troubled by his lack of insight, when I asked him direct questions, about what the challenges might be if the children&#8217;s residence and X&#8217;s schooling suddenly changed, and how he might respond to those challenges. His responses were na&#239;ve at best, saying simply he would deal with challenges and move on. He said he and the Mother would need to just be flexible, but when I queried how this would work given they had not been able to agree on much during proceedings, again he glibly replied that they would need to &#8216;be flexible and move on&#8217;.</span></p>

I have sympathy that sometimes in cases such as these, the non-resident parent may be presented with a criticism at the final hearing that they have not cared for the children enough and so lack the experience to do so now, when they have been restricted from further caring due to lack of agreement to increasing contact time or orders preventing further time spent with the children.  However, that is demonstrably not the case presently. This Father has had the opportunity to take up more than 1 hour per month of spending time with his children. Spending time arrangements were recited, as agreed, in the order of 09.09.21 as being fortnightly for two hours, and CAFCASS in fact recommended in their initial s7 report that there should be a progression to contact in the community after a period of such fortnightly contact. That hasn&#8217;t happened because Father has not committed to that level of contact. </span></p>

He has confirmed in evidence that he is on Universal Credit. He told me contact at the current location costs &#163;67 per hour (supported) or &#163;110 (supervised). I have sympathy for the Father&#8217;s difficult financial position. However, I am mindful that the Mother provides for the children alone, using her Universal Credit and Child Benefit. She receives, according to her evidence and not disputed by Father, no financial support from Father. So, at present, the Father&#8217;s only financial commitment to his children is paying for contact arrangements. He committed to seeing them for one hour per month, which was what he said he could afford, and even that has been missed on occasion, meaning the children have on occasion gone longer than a month without seeing their Father.</span></p>

She cannot afford, she says, to pay for three passports for herself and the children and take them on holiday. She described wishing to be able to do so, and the children also wanting this, but explaining to the children they cannot afford it and that they should be grateful for what they do have, whilst she studies and works to improve their situation.</span></p>

However, it was open to him to engage with the Triple P programme online, at a cost, but did not do so as he says he could not afford it.

He did call, and said he had not made changes, but that his son was not living with him, so if it was the Mother who made changes, he was fine with that.
