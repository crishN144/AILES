	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">This case involves allegations of domestic abuse, controlling behaviour and transnational abandonment. The applicant is the mother and the respondent the father of three children: J, a girl aged 8 years 7 months, K, a boy aged 4 years 11 months, and L a boy aged 3 years 11 months. The mother and father both originate from Pakistan but the father is British, as are the children. Having lived as a family in England since May 2015, the parents and children travelled to Pakistan in March 2019. The father returned to England a month later and the mother claims that he took the family&#8217;s passports with him, leaving them stranded in Pakistan. The mother alleges that the father&#8217;s abandonment of the family was part of his controlling behaviour over the course of the marriage, which involved the use by him of physical violence against both the mother and their daughter, J, which had come to the attention of J&#8217;s school, social services, and the police. The mother managed to obtain documentation to allow her to return to England, without the children, on 10 March 2020. She says that the father promptly went to Pakistan promising her he would bring back the children but he did not do so. She applied to the High Court for the children to be made wards of court. Following hearings before Mr Harrison QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, an order was made for the children&#8217;s return and they were returned to England on 30 September 2020. Since their return, the children have lived with the mother in a series of refuges. The father has indirect contact with the children only. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">In September 2020 Mr Harrison QC received written evidence and began to hear oral evidence from the mother in relation to the parties&#8217; respective allegations, but due to a combination of a family tragedy in Pakistan involving the fatality of a cousin of the children, and the father&#8217;s then barrister becoming ill, the hearing of oral evidence was abandoned. Mr Harrison QC gave directions for a finding of fact hearing prior to determination of child arrangements. The father disputes the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic violence and abandonment in Pakistan. He contends that the mother has been controlling and violent towards him and the children during the relationship, that she agreed to relocate permanently to Pakistan in 2019, only to change her mind, and that her allegations against him are vengeful fabrications. A Composite Schedule of Allegations with responses is appended to this judgment. There are eighteen allegations comprising both specific incidents and more generalised conduct. I understand the reservations about the effectiveness and suitability of Scott Schedules in particular in cases where the allegation is of a pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour, recently expressed by Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2021/4" uk:canonical="[2021] EWFC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWFC 4</ref>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">Shortly prior to the finding of fact hearing before me, the father chose not to dispute the children&#8217;s habitual residence in England and Wales, or the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make child arrangement orders. He also accepts that the children should live with the mother. The question of what, if any, time the children should spend with the father remains in issue. Mr Harrison QC did make interim determinations on the basis of the written evidence he had received, on the basis of which he ordered the children&#8217;s return. In doing so, he recorded certain findings in relation to the question of abandonment, but at the outset of the hearing before me, I indicated that I would not regard myself as bound by those findings. Mr Harrison QC expressly stated that they were interim findings, he disregarded the oral evidence he had heard, which did not include any oral evidence from the father, and he gave directions for the parties to serve amended Scott Schedules of allegations and responses, ordering a five day hearing to determine those allegations. The hearing before me was a fresh hearing before a different judge, not a resumed, part heard finding of fact hearing. It would not be incompatible with Mr Harrison QC&#8217;s judgment for me to come to different findings. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">This hearing was held remotely on the MS Teams platform. One working day prior to this hearing the father applied for permission to rely on a further witness statement from himself, and evidence from five witnesses, none of whom had previously provided statements. Mr Vollenweider sought to explain the lateness of the application by reference to difficulties cause by the pandemic, reliance on counsel to advise, and other practical difficulties, but those explanations did not fully excuse the delay. Nevertheless, I allowed the father to rely on his own further statement, and those of three of the witnesses. I said that I would explain my reasons in this judgment.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s further, short statement included corrections to his previous evidence, exhibited documentation which the mother&#8217;s representatives had previously seen, and commented on what another adult had told him that J had said on leaving Pakistan in September 2020, namely that she did not want to return to England. That evidence about J&#8217;s wishes and feelings was given in response to a report written by Ms Ashton, the children&#8217;s court-appointed guardian, dated 6 January 2021. Ms Ashton interviewed the children and J told her of her unhappiness about her time in Pakistan, making specific allegations of mistreatment of her and her brothers by the father and his family. I indicated to Mr Vollenweider that if I allowed the father to give evidence as to J&#8217;s views about life in Pakistan with her father, I would have to have regard to Ms Ashton&#8217;s evidence about the same matter.  He did not object to that and, applying the overriding objective, I allowed the father to rely on this further statement notwithstanding its lateness. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">I observed to Mr Vollenweider that two of the other witness statements were of very limited evidential value and he did not press for their admission. The three remaining statements were from RB, a friend of the mother, MI, the father&#8217;s brother, and RA, a cousin of both parties. All three statements were unsigned, undated, and in English even though none of the witnesses speak or write English. On the morning of the second day of the hearing I was provided with a witness statement from the father&#8217;s solicitor, who speaks Urdu and English, explaining that they had spoken to these three witnesses in Urdu but had prepared their statements in English. An interpreter was then engaged to interpret the statements to the witnesses who had confirmed and signed the English language statements. I was then provided with statements from the three witnesses in Urdu, apparently signed by them, statements of truth in English signed by the witnesses but not signed by the interpreter, and separate declarations signed by the interpreter but not the witnesses. The interpreter&#8217;s declarations confirm that &#8220;this document has been interpreted to the &#8220;above-named&#8221;. Accordingly, there were no English translations of the statements certified as being accurate translations of the witnesses&#8217; Urdu statements. In fact, the statements in English came first. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">At the end of day two of the hearing I received a statement from Mr Nadeem, who acted as an interpreter for the father during the hearing, confirming that the statements in Urdu were accurate translations of the statements in English. Although the requirement is that the translation should be into English, not from English, I allowed the father to rely on these three witnesses and to call the witnesses to give evidence. I did so well aware of the difficulties caused to the mother by late admission of these statements. She herself has little to no understanding of the English language, she currently lives in a refuge, her solicitor had Covid-19 at the time of the hearing, and all instructions had to be taken from her remotely. In fact, the mother&#8217;s Counsel, Ms Chokowry very pragmatically accepted that she had sufficient time to take instructions on the further evidence and that she was in a position to question the witnesses accordingly. I note in passing that the mother&#8217;s own witness statements appear to have been taken in a similar fashion to that described above. I was mindful that the court should be wary about excluding relevant evidence, even if served late, if the prejudice caused to the other party can be overcome and no delay will be caused. The failure to follow the practice direction and the guidance of Peter Jackson J is not fatal to the admission of the evidence. I was satisfied, applying the overriding objective, that I should allow the father to rely on these three additional witness statements. However, it is important that parties adopt the procedure set out in <span style="font-style:italic">NN v ZZ and ors</span> whenever a statement is taken from a non English speaking witness.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">Another evidential issue arose which I shall address at the outset of this judgment. In or about July 2018 the father installed what he calls &#8220;a spy camera&#8221; in the living room of the family home. The camera recorded continuously. The father says that he would intermittently save some of recorded film on his mobile phone. He has produced a number of transcripts of these films, written out in Urdu and translated into English. These are within the supplemental bundle which also includes translations of text exchanges and audio recordings. On 18 September 2020 Mr Harrison QC gave specific directions about this bundle, including that it should include the original messages, videos and audio files that relate to the written material the father had produced. That had not been done by the start of this hearing and was done only by the end of the fourth day. When cross-examined about the transcripts, the mother said that she could not understand either the English translation or the Urdu transcription, because she does not read either language. The language in which she had spoken when recorded was not Urdu. Counsel informed me that this difficulty had been raised before Mr Harrison QC in September 2020. I also note that some of the translations appear a little strained or unnatural. Further, there are frequent mis-spellings in the translations and whole passages which are very difficult to make sense of, for example page 91 of the supplemental bundle that purports to be a translation of a voice note left by the mother, including &#8220;&#8230; you are going to marry </p>

Later he owned and operated a grocery store. They had an arranged marriage, becoming married in Pakistan on 9 September 2011. This was the father&#8217;s second marriage and the mother&#8217;s first. How the arrangement came about is disputed but not relevant to the issues I have to determine. In the early years of the marriage the mother remained in Pakistan and the father lived mostly in England. J was born in Pakistan in June 2012. Immigration applications on behalf of the mother were initially unsuccessful. For about three years after J&#8217;s birth she lived with her mother in Pakistan, and the father lived and worked in England visiting Pakistan once a year for at least a month each time.  </p>

The mother gave her evidence in a matter of fact manner. I did not find her to be evasive and she did not embroider her evidence. She had a good recall of dates and of the incidents, which are addressed in the Scott Schedule. Her demeanour was consistent with evidence in the case that she is not easily cowed and is able to speak up for herself. However, it was also noticeable that the mother readily made certain concessions during cross-examination. She did not stubbornly adhere to a fixed, simplistic characterisation of her relationship with the father. For example, she conceded immediately that she had threatened to post material about the father on social media when he had wanted to leave for Pakistan in January 2019. She told the court that the father had run up debt from his shop business and had said he would leave for Pakistan. The mother feared being left alone with the children and having to answer for the debt, and admitted that she told the father that if he left she would tell everyone what he had done via social media. She also conceded that she would swear and become angry with the father. These concessions gave me the impression that she was being frank and honest in her answers.  </p>

His view is that everything that has gone wrong within the family is the mother&#8217;s fault, and the mother is a habitual liar, motivated only by greed and vengefulness. When challenged in cross-examination he used various devices to avoid giving a direct answer to a direct question. He would answer a different question from the one put, reframe the question, divert the focus of enquiry by introducing new assertions, or seek to change the subject. Some of his evidence was frankly incredible. For example, he relies on a translation of a transcript of a mobile phone conversation he says he had with J on 26 July 2017, when she was aged 5, shortly after J had reported to her school that the father had assaulted the mother.

After only a few questions about how he had managed to record the whole of an unexpected call, including the very first words, from a five year old girl who had no mobile device, he said that he was unsure if he was in the car at the time, and that he may have made the call, rather than received it. He said that he had pressed the record button immediately but also told the court that he did not routinely record calls. His account of how this recording was made lacked any credibility.  </p>

For example, at page 55 of the supplemental bundle &#8211; the bundle of the father&#8217;s evidence - there is a translation of a message from him to the mother from 2020 when he was in Pakistan and she was in England. It reads, &#8220;I made you live here&#8230;&#8221; When it was suggested that this supported the mother&#8217;s case that he had forced the mother to live in Pakistan he said that the word &#8220;made&#8221; was a mis-translation. On another occasion, he was taken to translations of court records from Pakistan, which show that he had produced copies of the children&#8217;s British passports to the court. He was asked how he had done so when his case was that the mother had kept possession of the passports and he had no access to them.

None of them supported the father&#8217;s characterisation of the mother as a greedy, dishonest and vindictive woman. It became clear that RB and RA were not sufficiently close to the parties that they were told about the family leaving for Pakistan in March 2019. Neither had had any contact with the parties at the time of the family&#8217;s departure. RB said that she had never spoken with the mother about personal matters and it was clear that RA, as a man, had not engaged in direct, private conversations with the mother other than to exchange pleasantries. Their evidence about the circumstances of the parties travelling to Pakistan and the father&#8217;s return soon afterwards was therefore peripheral.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">It was soon after the police attendance on 28 June 2018, and, so far as I can determine, prior to the visits of the social workers after referral by the police, that the father installed what he calls a &#8220;spy camera&#8221; in the living room of the family home. He has produced a number of recorded films taken by that camera, and what purport to be transcripts of what is recorded as being said by those recorded speaking. After the father first disclosed the installation of this camera, and the recordings, the mother served a statement in which she said at para. 14, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am very shocked to learn that there was a spy camera installed in our living room and the fact that [the father] was recording me and our children without my knowledge.</span>&#8221;  This assertion that the mother had not known of the camera was not contradicted by the father in his two subsequent witness statements. It was not put to the mother in cross-examination that her assertion was untrue. It was therefore a surprise when in cross-examination the father asserted that the mother knew by September 2018 that she was being recorded by the camera. He told me that this was evident from something that she had been recorded saying to her father at that time. It was an even greater surprise when a few minutes later he said that in fact the mother had known of the existence of the spy camera from the date when it had been installed because he had set her up with an app, and a device, to be able to monitor it. Whereas in his first statement he told the court that he had installed the camera because he had &#8220;lost faith&#8221; with the mother she had made the 999 call in June 2018, he said in oral evidence that it was installed to protect the family and that there were closed circuit television cameras installed outside the house too. He said that he would watch the &#8220;live&#8221; footage from the camera when he was at work, and sometimes call the mother to tell her that a child was crying or needed her attention. Hence, even though he had gone to great trouble to disclose footage, and to provide translated transcripts from the &#8220;spy camera&#8221; in the family living room, and even though the mother&#8217;s assertion that she was unaware of the camera was not challenged, the father&#8217;s evidence to the court was that both he and the mother knew it was there all along. </p>

Firstly, he describes it as a &#8220;spy camera&#8221; and told the court in his written evidence that he installed it because he had &#8220;lost faith in the applicant mother&#8221;, not to protect the family or to assist with childcare. Secondly, the mother&#8217;s assertion that she did not know about it was not challenged in the father&#8217;s subsequent statements or in cross-examination. Thirdly, the footage and transcripts have no evidential value at all if both parties knew they were being filmed. The whole point of the father disclosing the recordings was to show how the mother actually behaved as opposed to how she presented herself to others such as the police and the court. He would not have sought to rely on the recordings had the mother been fully aware that they were being made. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Out of all the hours of footage available to the father, he has elected to disclose a relatively small number of short recordings, only one of which caused me some concern that it might show a physical assault. The recording in question is labelled P79 and shows, at 3 mins, 35 seconds, the father stand up beside the mother, who is sitting on a sofa, and make a motion that looks to me like a slap with his left hand close to her face. The mother&#8217;s head moves to the side. I cannot tell whether her head moves because the father&#8217;s hand has made contact, or whether it is an evasive reaction to the approaching hand and no contact is made. The mother said that she was not hit but I was not satisfied that she had viewed the recording properly. When I asked the father about this footage he said variously that he might have been stumbling and put his hand out to steady himself, that he might have been brushing something off the mother&#8217;s cheek, and that it might have been a gesture of affection. The translated transcript for this footage indicates that the parties were having an argument. Given that the mother has not sought a finding that the father slapped her on this occasion, and the difficulty with being sure exactly what occurred, I make no finding that the father slapped the mother on this date, and I proceed on the basis that no slap occurred on that occasion. However, it is ironic that out of hundreds of hours available to the father, the only recording that he has put before the court that shows anything resembling a violent incident, is this one.  </p>

The mother relies on what J reported to the school but her own evidence does not confirm any details of these alleged incidents. The father says at para. 27 of his first statement, in an account that I understand to refer to J&#8217;s reports to the school in 2016, that he had encountered difficulties getting J out of the car because she wanted a particular toy. He says, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The applicant mother&#8217;s response was tell the school tomorrow and say to them that dad hit you. These comments must have played on J&#8217;s mind because when she went to School the following day she told someone that I had hit or hurt her</span>.&#8221; There is no mention of this account in the disclosure from social services. Furthermore, in his oral evidence the father said that he had been taken by surprise when he heard that J had made these allegations to the school, which would not have been the case if, as he has alleged, only the day before he had witnessed the mother having urged J to make the allegations. I do take into account that it appears that the father went into the school with J and it was observed that J was comfortable with him. There is a paucity of evidence from the mother and the father about allegation 3. The mother&#8217;s case is that the father hit her frequently. If so, J may have witnessed this and reported it to the school.  The father denies that that was the </p>

I have set out details of the relevant disclosed material. The incident at allegation 4 was reported by J and largely confirmed to social workers by the mother. She has also confirmed it in her written and oral evidence to this court. The father denied the alleged assault but also said that the mother was prone to developing black marks, including on her neck. This was something he said for the first time in cross-examination &#8211; it does not appear in his written evidence. The court was not presented with photographic or other evidence of bruising to the mother&#8217;s neck, but the father&#8217;s oral evidence might suggest that she did have bruising to the neck at the time, his case appearing to be that the mother used that fact to initiate false allegations that he had caused it. As for allegation 5, this is a separate incident, reported by the mother to J&#8217;s school when they asked her about J&#8217;s report of the father hitting the mother and putting his fingers to her throat. Again, the mother confirmed this in her evidence to the court, and the father denied it as a fabrication. </p>

Do those events reflect the stranding or abandonment of the mother and children in Pakistan or an agreed family relocation to Pakistan about which the mother later changed her mind? As well as the parties&#8217; evidence I received evidence from the witnesses RB and RA. Their evidence that the mother had talked about plans to relocate to Pakistan to live was at odds with other evidence in the case, and in any event I found it to be peripheral. RA had not spoken directly to the mother and what he heard her say was always in the presence of the father. Neither he nor RB had spoken to the mother for at least three months prior to the family travelling to Pakistan in March 2019. Their evidence about why the family travelled to Pakistan was therefore of limited assistance to the court. The key evidence comes from the parties themselves. </p>

Even upon his late production of a receipt from a shipping firm which showed, he accepted, payment for 86kg of cargo, he maintained that they had sent 300kg. He relies on an email from the shipping firm which says that he sent 220kg in January 2019 and 200kg in October 2018, which of course totals far more than 300kg. The father told me that the firm had said that they do not keep paperwork for more than three months. It is not credible that a shipping firm would not keep copy invoices or proof of payment for more than three months. The evidence about the weight of cargo sent in January is inconsistent, and it does not assist the father&#8217;s case.  </p>

The father was not present at the time when the mother allegedly slapped J, he was in England and she was in Pakistan. The allegation is that this occurred in the &#8220;latter part of 2014&#8221;. At that time, J would have been aged 2 years 6 months. It is that the mother slapped J&#8217;s face and arms. In oral evidence the father said that the incident happened in the summer, clarifying that he meant that it was summer here in England. He said that his brother told him that the mother had slapped J on the face arms and body. His additional allegation that slaps were directed to J&#8217;s body came for the first time during cross-examination, but his brother&#8217;s late statement says that the mother &#8220;slapped her a few times to the face and to her body&#8221;. The clear impression given was that the father had adjusted his evidence in the light of the brother&#8217;s statement. MI says in his statement that he does not recall the date of the incident but says that it followed an argument between the mother and father after the mother&#8217;s visa application had been refused but J&#8217;s had been accepted. According to the father&#8217;s first statement at paras. 14 and 15, this was when J was about 3 months old, not when she was two and a half years old. In oral evidence MI told the court that J was three years old at the time of the incident and that it happened in June, July or August. At that time J was in fact in England with both parents. His oral account was that he was disturbed by the noise of the mother argument with J, and on his arrival at the scene she was beating her. This conflicts with his very recent written statement that the beating started after he had spoken to the mother. The father said that MI called him to tell him about the incident but MI denied calling the father. The mother denied the allegation in its entirety. </p>

It comprises two allegations, the first being that the mother was physically violent to L. I have watched it carefully and read the translated transcript, albeit that the mother is unable to accept that the transcript is accurate. The mother appears to be very tired. She is trying to ensure that K and L take milk from their bottles. They were aged 2 years 9 months and 1 year 9 months at the time. L is crying constantly and does not want to take his bottle. The mother has a remote control in her hand and is lying next to the boys. She sings to them and tries to cuddle L and pat him to soothe him. He is very unhappy and will not drink or stop crying. She picks him up and places him on the floor slightly away from her. He gets up and hits the mother on the head. She looks exasperated and upset but stays calm and she does not strike out at him. She points in what I take to be the direction of the father and the boy moves away out of shot. Shortly afterwards the father comes into view carrying L and soothing him. The transcript records that the mother was cross with L. She denies calling him a &#8220;bastard&#8221; as the translated transcript records. The transcript shows the father to have criticised the mother. I am quite satisfied that at no point does the mother strike the child with the remote control or otherwise or throw him to the floor. Allegation 4 includes another allegation from the same date, that the mother tells K to hit L harder. I have been unable to locate any recording showing this, but the purported transcript and translation is at the supplemental bundle page 102. The mother says that the children were fighting and she was shouting to them from another room for the father to stop the children fighting. Even so, the translation reads, &#8220;Slap him! Hit him two four times, beat him more!&#8221;  </p>

The allegation refers to J having told him that the mother would hurt them on occasion but I have already found his evidence about one recorded conversation with J about the mother beating her to be wholly unreliable, and indeed set up by the father. The allegation is a very serious one and yet the anticipated &#8220;further statement from F to come&#8221; has not materialised. None of the children have disclosed any complaint that the mother has struck them, whereas J has made such disclosures to her school and social workers against the father. The father has had the benefit of continuous recorded film from the spy camera for a number of months from July 2018 to March 2019 but has not produced any recorded film of the mother striking hitting the children.

The allegation of domestic abuse by the mother against the father &#8220;through coercive and controlling behaviour perpetrated by the mother, motivated by financial gain&#8221; is, as I understand it, a reference to the father&#8217;s case that the allegations by the mother, including her allegation of abandonment, are designed to control and coerce the father into giving money to the mother. Her threats to hit the children were made in order to cause him to buy gold bangles, her persuasion of J to complain to the school about the father&#8217;s violence was designed to cast the father in a bad light and for revenge when the father did not act as the mother wished.

The level of inconsistency and incoherence in his evidence was such that I find myself unable to place any trust in it unless it is agreed by the mother, or is otherwise strongly corroborated. With apparent conviction he gave oral evidence about important matters such as the installation of the spy camera and the location of the family&#8217;s passports that was wholly at odds with his own written evidence. Other parts of his evidence could not be reconciled with documentary evidence such as the translated court records from Pakistan, cargo receipts, and translated transcripts of messages that he himself had sought to rely upon. Moreover, standing back and considering his case about the mother&#8217;s conduct, I find his assertions lack any credibility. On his case the mother had wanted to relocate to Pakistan in March </p>

He took charge of paying all the bills and outgoings including for food, except for a weekly payment to the mother, for the benefit of her and the children combined, of &#163;20. Upon the intervention of social services in 2018, after negotiation, he agreed to increase that to &#163;50. The mother did not have a bank account and had no other source of income. The father did not take any effectively steps to assist her to learn English. He installed a camera in the family home to spy on the mother. He would watch it whilst at work. He was monitoring her behaviour so that he could control it. He used violence on occasions to control the mother. He used her isolation in England and her lack of knowledge about this country to threaten her that if she did not do as he wanted, the children could be removed from her.  </p>

When she did become angry and argumentative, it was because she was responding to her mistreatment, but the father saw her conduct as disrespectful &#8211; she was not the wife he wanted her to be &#8211; and he considered this to be justification to exercise even more control. The father complains now that the mother was obsessed with money and driven by greed. That is a difficult claim to make when he controlled the family money and was content to pay the mother only &#163;20 per week. Indeed, the father continues to say that the mother&#8217;s actions are motivated by greed even now as she lives with her children in a refuge, with no assets, no income beyond benefits, and a very uncertain future. </p>

Covert recordings, selectively disclosed by one party who was aware the recordings were being made whilst the other party was unaware, have to be treated with considerable caution by the court. I cannot know what happened before or after the extract of film shown to the court. I cannot know what provocation from the father preceded an argument that was recorded and disclosed.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">I am satisfied that the disclosures made by J to her school are true. She was aged 4 and then 5 when she made those disclosures. At the age of 5 she repeated them consistently when spoken to by social workers. Neither parent has suggested that she is a child prone to lying or to making fantastical allegations. Neither has suggested that she had a grievance against the father. Indeed, when she was seen with the father she was comfortable. Aged 5 she described him as funny and kind. In general, she had a good relationship with him. It is possible for that to be the case even though he had struck her, and even though she had seen him strike her mother. I note that more recently, having told Ms Ashton soon after her return from Pakistan of some very concerning matters relating to her father&#8217;s conduct there, she later told Ms Ashton that the father had apologised and she appears to regard his apologies as an assurance that all will be well in the future. Similarly, I am sure that she revealed true accounts of violence by the father within the family in 2016 and 2017 when she spoke at her school and to social workers, but that she was even so generally happy to live with her parents at home. The father&#8217;s suggestion that J made the disclosures in 2016 because the mother told her to do so to punish her father for not letting her have a toy is not credible. There is no suggestion in the evidence in relation to these disclosures that J was put up to making them. The father did not aver that at the time and he has not suggested to this court that J confessed to him that she had made up the allegation or that the mother persuaded her to report him to the school. In any event she was only 4 at the time and the father&#8217;s account would involve her having an ability to maintain a fabrication at her mother&#8217;s instigation, and when she was fond of her father, that is difficult to believe.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">The mother&#8217;s evidence about the events alleged at 6, has been inconsistent, but there is compelling evidence that she suffered a bump to the side of her head, as reported in the police disclosure, and as the father accepts. The mother has been consistent in her evidence about that injury and that it was caused by the father hitting her. The Child and Family Assessment report from 2018 records the father saying that the injury may have been caused by him throwing a toy at the mother. He says that that is an inaccurate record of what he said, but he had not challenged it before this hearing. The father&#8217;s alternative account to the social workers in 2018 that the mother may have caused the injury herself is unrealistic. In his written evidence to this court, he says that the mother reached for toys to throw at him and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">must have caught herself and bruised her right eye lash. I did not touch her</span>.&#8221; This statement was not translated &#8211; the father has reasonable English although he had an interpreter for the court hearing. Even allowing for some language difficulties, his account of how the mother may have injured herself is not credible, and the reference to a bruised eye lash is difficult to understand. Further, I do not accept that the mother would have contacted the police had she accidentally hurt herself during the course of the argument. She did not have any record of making complaints to the police or social services. Indeed, this is the only occasion on which she did so even though, as I have found, she had been struck on previous occasions by the father. I am sure that she called 999 because the father had injured her. I am satisfied that he did so by striking her with his hand to the side of her head, causing a small lump. I am not satisfied on the evidence that she had bruises all over her body. The mother&#8217;s evidence as to whether the children were present has been inconsistent but listening to her oral evidence that she called the police because she was concerned the father would hit the children, and that they were present during the argument in which the father hit the mother, I found her account to be credible in the detail she gave and the frank manner in which she answered questions. On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that the children were present when the father hit the mother on this occasion. </p>

I have found that he was violent to her on the four occasions alleged at 3, 4, 5 and 6. In addition, I am satisfied on all the evidence that the father struck the mother on other occasions. I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father was violent towards her during the marriage is reliable. I found her to be a largely straightforward witness whereas I found the father&#8217;s evidence, including his denials that he was violent to the mother, to be unreliable. I have made findings of violence by the father on specific occasions as alleged. I am quite sure that the mother has truthfully told the court that he was violent on numerous occasions throughout the marriage, and that she did not complain at the time because she was in a weak position to do so &#8211; she was in an unfamiliar country, did not speak the language, and had no access to financial support. J&#8217;s account to Ms Ashton of the children&#8217;s treatment by the father when they were together, without the mother, in Pakistan, tends to support the fact that the father is a man who is prepared to use physical force against members of his family. Although J has softened in her attitude to the father since her first interview with Ms Ashton, she did not retract her allegation but, under influence from the mother, accepted that the father was sorry for what he had done.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>The father admits that he installed a spy camera in the family home. It seems to me plain that he did so to monitor the mother and to gather evidence for his use as and when necessary. The mother&#8217;s allegation 7 is that his use of a spy camera was to control the mother. The installation only came to light when the father filed his first statement in these proceedings in July 2020. The camera was installed about two years earlier and will have been in situ for about eight months recording the family before they left for Pakistan in March 2019. At para. 42 of that first statement the father says that after the incident when the mother called 999 on 28 June 2018, &#8220;I lost faith in the applicant mother.&#8221; I have found that he had struck the mother on that occasion and that what she told the police was fundamentally true. Hence, his motivation for installing the camera was not, in my judgment, to a response to unsubstantiated allegations against him. Rather, he sought to use the camera and recordings to keep an eye on the mother and to build up evidence he could use against the mother as and when he might need it. Installing what he himself calls a &#8220;spy camera&#8221; covertly to record, hour by hour, the daily life of the household, family discussions, and private, shared moments between the mother and her children, all the while intending to use what was recorded for his own ends, is, I am satisfied, controlling behaviour. As has been observed by others in previous cases, reliance on covert recordings of this kind tell the court more about the recorder than the recorded. I have given careful thought to the definition of controlling behaviour within FPR PD 12J. The fact that prior to these proceedings, the father did not show the mother the recordings in order to subordinate or isolate her, or to control her behaviour, does not mean that the installation of the camera was not done for that purpose. I am satisfied that the father installed the camera and kept recordings for the purpose of exercising control over the mother. He kept a library of recordings to deploy against her in the event that she made complaints against him to the authorities or to her family. Furthermore, since he alone knew that the camera was there, he was able to stage or control behaviour within the family for his own ends. He was exercising control over family life, and over the mother, in order to obtain recordings to suit his purpose. As he admitted during his oral evidence, he would watch the film from the spy camera &#8220;live&#8221; when he was at work in his car, so that he could check on what the mother and children were doing. The father&#8217;s installation and use of the spy camera was directed to exercising control over the mother. I am therefore satisfied that allegation 7 is established. </p>

Yet, the children had barely started education in England, and he himself said that in his view the young women in his village in Pakistan all dream of a &#8220;prince&#8221; arriving to take them away to England.

That timely complaint is not consistent with the mother having agreed to relocate permanently to Pakistan only a few weeks earlier. The father told the court that the mother made this complaint, even though she was content to be in Pakistan at the time, just to make him look bad in the eyes of others and to show him that she had power over him even though she was in Pakistan. That is not a credible explanation. The much simpler explanation, and the one I find to be true, is that the mother was seeing to bring attention to the fact that the father had left her and the children stranded in Pakistan. </p>

Further, on his case, she left her children in Pakistan in March 2020 for no better reason than to be vengeful towards him. His evidence about the mother&#8217;s intentions and actions is wholly unreliable and I have no doubt at all that he tricked the mother into taking the family to Pakistan in March 2019 with the intention that he would leave them there whilst he returned to England. He told the mother that his father was ill and that they needed to travel to Pakistan as a family to see him. That was not true. Once there, he secreted their travel documentation so that they could not leave. He controlled the situation so that he could keep the mother and children in Pakistan until, without his knowledge, the mother managed to obtain a replacement visa and return to the UK. He then promised her that he would bring back the children but instead ensured that they remained in Pakistan for as long as possible until he was forced, by court order, to assist in their return. Whatever their treatment in Pakistan, their forced removal and &#8220;stranding&#8221; there was clearly to their detriment, in particular after their mother returned to England in an attempt to secure their return. The father&#8217;s actions resulted in the children being separated from their mother for several months in 2020. He has lied to the court about his actions in order to try to cover up his reprehensible behaviour. </p>

Neither has the father ever complained to the police, socials services or anyone else about the mother&#8217;s violence prior to these proceedings. He has produced no evidence of any injuries. The father has had the advantage of reliance on covert film over several months of the mother with the children in the family home. He has been able to put before the court only one incident of alleged violence by the mother against a child. For the reasons given below I do not agree that the recording in question, which forms the basis of his allegation 4, shows the mother hitting or manhandling the child at all. Thus, the father has produced not a scrap of evidence in support of his allegations that the mother was routinely violent to him and the children. </p>

Having viewed the recorded film which the father claims shows the mother smacking L with a remote control and throwing L to the floor, I am quite sure that it shows neither of those actions. The mother is holding a remote control. She is clearly upset that the child is crying and will not take his bottle. Her arm comes to the child&#8217;s side but not as a smack. She places the child on the floor away from her but does not throw him to the floor. The transcript of the mother saying, &#8220;beat him more&#8221; is the evidence the father relies on to show that the mother told K to hit L &#8220;even harder&#8221;. The mother says that she was speaking to the father at the time, not to K, and the recording does not establish to whom she was talking. Removed from any particular context it is difficult to make findings about who the mother was talking to or what was intended by her words. The father has the burden of proof in relation to this allegation and I am not satisfied that he has proved it on the balance of probabilities. Neither allegation within allegation 4 is proved. </p>

Insofar as he relies on the other seven allegations, for the reasons given I do not find them proved and so they do not support a finding that this allegation is established. Insofar as he refers to distinct conduct, not covered by the other seven allegations, he has not produced any further evidence in support as he indicated he would. The evidence of Ms Ashton is telling. J initially made serious allegations to her about the father&#8217;s conduct whilst the children were in Pakistan. At the interview in January 2021, she said that she accepted that her father was sorry for his actions and her attitude towards him had softened significantly. She told Ms Ashton that her mother had persuaded her to be forgiving of the father. The implications of this for the family, and the welfare of the children in the future, need to be carefully considered on another occasion, but, in relation to findings of fact, the evidence is in complete contrast to the father&#8217;s portrayal of the father. Far from scheming to control him, she had, privately, encouraged her daughter to forgive the father. Far from being vindictive towards the father, and turning the children against him, she was doing the reverse. The father&#8217;s allegation 8 is not proved. </p>
