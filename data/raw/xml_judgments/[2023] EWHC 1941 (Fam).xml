	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with the mother&#8217;s application under the Hague Convention for X, aged 2 years 10 months, to be returned to Country B. That application is opposed by the father on the grounds that at the relevant time in April 2023 the child&#8217;s habitual residence was here and, if he is wrong about that, the mother consented or acquiesced to X remaining here. Finally, the father submits, in the event the court gets to that stage, the court should exercise its discretion and refuse the order for the child to go to Country B.</p>

X remained there until December 2022 when she returned back here with the mother. The father accepts that prior to December 2022 X&#8217;s habitual residence was in Country B. It is accepted the relevant date for determining habitual residence is about 12 April 2023, when the father removed X&#8217;s passport without the mother&#8217;s knowledge. X and the mother remain living here, as does the father. The parents separated in April, X lives with the mother and the father has contact with X.</p>

More recently, the mother and X did not return due to health related reasons. The father suggests that these were further delaying tactics by the mother thereby acknowledging her reluctance to return here. The father returned here in June 2021 for work related reasons and then family commitments here. He went to Country B in October 2021 and returned here in February 2022. The mother and X were due to travel with him but X had an ear infection. This happened again at Easter and June 2022. The father visited Country B on four occasions in 2022.</p>

A housekeeper and nanny were employed, X was registered with a nursery that she attended for two days in January. That nursery recommended delaying her attendance, and she started attending in late March/mid-April. There was some evidence it may have been at the end of March; the letter from the nursery refers to the April date whereas the child and family assessment refers to her starting in late March. Prior to December 2022 the mother had renewed her practising certificate in this jurisdiction and took on a 6 month contract with a legal firm here that ended in mid-July 2023. The mother and X came here on a return ticket, with the return date 10 June 2023. According to the mother many items of hers and X&#8217;s were left in Country B.</p>

The mother states she and X had a return ticket booked on 27 April 2023. Although there was no evidence as to why this date had been chosen Mr Gupta, on instructions, informed the court that it had been discussed between the parents and it coincided with a date when the father was travelling to the US for two weeks. This US trip is confirmed in the letter from the father&#8217;s solicitors dated 2 May 2023.</p>

The letter continues &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">In fact, your client specifically said to our client that it was her insistence on obtaining the comfort of the Affidavit and his irrevocable consent for [X] and our client to return to Country B which led him to serve the divorce papers on her on 19 December 2022&#8217;.</span> The letter continues setting out the options for the mother who wishes to return to Country B with X, including issuing an application for leave to remove X from the jurisdiction.

Any reference in them to the Hague Convention was in the context of the allegations made by the father in the divorce petition that the mother had wrongfully retained X in Country B in 2021. There is no doubt, on the evidence, that the mother has not wavered in her wish to return to Country B with X. The only thing that prevented her from doing so was the father&#8217;s actions in removing the passport, withdrawing his consent and securing a port alert.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the evidence this was not a wholly consensual re-location back to this jurisdiction as the father seeks to suggest in his statement. It was in the context of a very fragile relationship between X&#8217;s parents, where they were tentatively exploring reconciliation. They had effectively lived separately since mid-2021, the father had issued divorce proceedings, within days prior to the mother and X coming to this jurisdiction she had sought for the father to sign various documents that would give her the security of knowing she and X would be able to return to Country B and two days before they came back here the father served the divorce proceedings on the mother, making it clear he accepted the jurisdiction of the court in Country B in relation to all aspects, namely divorce, children and financial issues. Bearing in mind the timing and context when that was done it can only have been done to give the mother the reassurance she sought in the documents she sent to the father on 19 December, the father confirms that in the message that states that the summons gives a very clear statement regarding X&#8217;s residential status, namely in Country B. To describe what happened on 21 December 2022 as being a joint consensual decision to effectively re-establish their lives in London simply does not fully reflect the reality. It was, in my judgment, a fragile temporary arrangement in the context of the parents seeing if they could reconcile, where the mother had made clear her position to be able to return back to Country B with X &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">on the next flight if necessary&#8217; ,</span> the father had given that by adding &#8216;irrevocable&#8217; to document 1, and he had taken the deliberate step of serving the divorce petition on her re-assuring her about X&#8217;s residential status in Country B. The father also knew about the long stop return date of 10 June 2023 specified in Document 1.

On a practical level those arrangements needed to be in place. However, that evidence cannot be looked at in isolation of the context of how those arrangements came into being, the position of the parents, particularly the mother who had been X&#8217;s main carer over such an extended period and what the circumstances were, namely a short term temporary visit to see if her parents could effect a reconciliation.</p>

There is no issue that the mother was X&#8217;s main carer, certainly prior to December 2022. X was well integrated into a family and social environment there, the evidential window about that is provided in the statement from the mother and the nanny.  After that clearly both parents cared for her as they lived under the same roof but they both worked and a nanny was employed. Within a relatively short period of time X returned with her mother to Country B and, according to the mother, she sought the re-assurance of seeing Document 1 again before she returned to England. Document 1 had an end date. The text messages prior to the mother and X returning to the UK on 21 March 2023 make clear the situation remained very fragile, and it being uncertain whether, in fact, the mother and X would fly back from Country B later that day. The mother states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Well I can&#8217;t fly if we&#8217;re not in agreement over the main thing which is where [X] and I live if we get divorced&#8217;.</span> These messages continue right up until the flight later that day and Document 1 is sent over to the mother again and she responds <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;I take a lot of comfort from this because what it means is that if it all gets too much for me in London, I can get back here'</span> and she and X get on the plane to the UK later that day taking one a few hours later than the one the father is on.</p>

I have carefully weighed in the balance all the points relied upon by Ms McKenna about the way X integrated into a family and social environment here (i.e. nanny, nursery, living in previous home with her parents and undertaking various activities) but also have to weigh in the balance the clear evidence, in my judgment, that in reality this was only a temporary arrangement in the context of the parents seeing whether they could repair their marriage. This is made clear by the messages running up to the departure in December 2022, the active step the father took in serving the divorce petition two days before departure with the express intention of giving the mother the re-assurance she was seeking, Document 1 was time limited and the consent was given on an irrevocable basis. Whilst it is right the words &#8216;domicile&#8217; and &#8216;temporary&#8217; were deleted,  the divorce petition, the addition of &#8216;irrevocable&#8217; and the end date of 10 June 2023 gave the reassurance the mother sought. This conclusion is supported by the text exchanges around the time of the return on 21 March 2023. In addition, I have factored in the extent to which X was integrated into the social and family environment in Country B. The mother and X were based at her parents&#8217; home, spending time in short term rented accommodation when the father was present in Country B for the reasons given. That did not detract from the roots X had clearly put down in Country B, as described by the mother.</p>

The correspondence from the mother&#8217;s first solicitors make clear the mother&#8217;s wholesale opposition to the retention and X remaining here. The letters consistently refer to her wanting to take X back to Country B, which is inconsistent with her having acquiesced to X&#8217;s retention. Ms McKenna invites the court to infer that due to the mother being a solicitor and having taken legal advice in the way that she has she is fully conversant with her rights under the Hague Convention to seek a summary return. What is clear from the correspondence is that she is seeking an immediate return, the only thing that is stopping her are the actions by the father (removal of passport, withdrawal of consent and instigation of port alert). There is no express reference to the Hague Convention in the letters other than in the context of the father&#8217;s allegations regarding the mother&#8217;s retention of X in Country B. There are references to making applications to the court here but the mother would have to do that in any event due to the father&#8217;s unilateral actions and the child being present in this jurisdiction. Having looked at the correspondence as a whole, in the particular circumstances of this case it cannot be said that it led the father to believe that the mother was not asserting or not going to assert her right to the summary return. Therefore, in my judgment, this defence is not established either.</p>
