In this regard it might be felt this case is restricted to the matters contained in the schedule only. I intend to take a different approach. This is because in the statement one can pick up elements of alleged controlling behaviour and further in a preceding injunction statement the mother raised concerns as to controlling behaviour, whilst not raising the substantive matters set out in &#167;4 above. So, in the supporting statement the mother consistently states she was unable to report the behaviours of which she now complains because: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">every aspect of my life was monitored&#8221;; &#8220;he monitored my phone and I was never alone long enough to call someone and seek help; &#8220;the applicant&#8217;s mother would also listen into my calls&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">In the injunction statement her focus was on alleged controlling behaviour but set this out in relatively limited detail commenting: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">&#8230;he became very controlling. He stopped me from using Facebook and tried to isolate me from my friends and family. He would tell me what to wear and how to put on (sic) my make up on. He would constantly criticise me for not cleaning  or doing things properly&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt"> I intend to consider these allegations within this judgment.</span></p>

Over-reliance on inherent probability in such circumstances would lead to an incorrect outcome. The touchstone for all cases is for the Court to focus on the evidence before it and what it suggests as being accurate. Inherent probability is but one aspect of this assessment and should not be the determining factor. In any event the standard of proof is not changed by reference to the inherent probability of an event.</span></p>

The Court will find assistance in the internal consistency of evidence and how its fits with other parts of the evidence. The Court will often be faced by evidence of a party lying to the Court.

Domestic abuse as with all abuse is the imposition of one parties wishes onto a weaker party. Domestic abuse typically occurs in the private sphere and with this comes real challenges as to assessment and obtaining of evidence. It will often be the case that the Court is left to evaluate the diametrically opposed evidence of the key participants without any help from extraneous sources. The Court can find guidance in Practice Direction 12J as to the concepts of domestic abuse including coercive and controlling behaviour. The Court is reminded through the guidance found in Re H-N &amp; Others [2021] EWCA Civ 448 as to insidious nature of domestic abuse and the need for sophisticated analysis. This includes awareness as to the potential for abuse to be maintained notwithstanding parental separation and even so where there are protective orders in place.</span></p>

Not every act of unkindness, rudeness or misconduct will be such as to justify fact finding. The Court needs to clearly delineate between those findings which will have a material impact on child arrangements (if proven) and those which will not. It is not for the Court to resolve all disputes between adults and it is positively unhelpful for the court to allow the proceedings to become &#8216;another battleground for adult conflict&#8217;.</span></p>

She contends the father was verbally, physically and sexually abusive and exhibited controlling behaviours towards her. Her communications were monitored and the car was tracked. She could neither communicate with nor visit her family. She was treated poorly and expected to meet the needs of the father in the home. She had little if any personal autonomy and claimed to have developed Stockholm Syndrome type patterns of behaviour. I understand this to be a situation in which classically a captive through coercion aligns their own interests with those of their kidnapper. Ultimately, she &#8216;fled&#8217; the property by claiming to wish to spend time with her family although her intention was to leave the father. When he discovered this was the case the father was abusive in his communication leading to the police being called.

He suggests the relationship began to fracture when the mother placed pressure on him to move out of his family home and find alternative accommodation or indeed move to London. He claims this was a persistent request made by the mother and aggravated by her mother&#8217;s views. When he was resistant to doing this issues arose. The maternal grandmother interfered in their relationship and the mother and the maternal grandmother were disrespectful to his parents. He reached the point where he did not consider they could remain together and asked the mother to leave dropping her in London with her family. Thereafter he had mixed emotions as to whether they should separate but this became inevitable when the maternal family questioned his right to see his daughter. He claims there is evidence of the mother taking active steps to seek advice as to how to restrict or obstruct his relationship with his daughter and he contends the allegations made have been fabricated for this purpose. He does accept he was verbally abusive in his communications in the period after physical separation but explains this needs to be understood in circumstances in which he was wrongly being told he would not see his daughter.</span></p>

The messages were warm and appeared to place the parents on an equal level. At times they were intimate with each other.

He also relies upon correspondence in which he claims the mother was seeking for &#8216;spells&#8217; to be cast upon him. The mother does not dispute the former but says she was simply seeking help. In relation to the latter, she claims the father has orchestrated this correspondence as he continued to have access to her account. She points to exhibits relied upon by the father which prove his continuing access to her accounts. The father responded by saying the mother had used his laptop when working within the business and her email account was open on the laptop allowing him to see what she had done. The father comments the parents shared religion is one which respects the equality of men and women and that he had no expectations on the mother to stay at home. Whilst he agreed he was the breadwinner the business was a joint collaboration between him and the mother. It was wrong to say the mother could not stand up to him. She would continuously do so and there were issues relating to her wishes for their future life. He agreed the relationship did suffer and they would argue. His parents would intervene to tell them stop arguing over silly things. The main argument related to buying their own home and moving to London. The father contends the mother&#8217;s case of control is difficult to fit with her willingness to spend time with him having &#8216;escaped&#8217; into the care of her family. I understood the mother to explain this by reference to a combination of (a) recognising the importance of the father seeing the child, and/or (b) continuing to feel under a degree of control even after separation.</span></p>

She gives an account of a forceful act in which there could be no question of consent. Her clothes were pulled off and the father restrained her to keep her quiet. She clearly told him she did not want sex. She was clear in evidence that this took place on the day in question and that this event was the act of intercourse in which the child was conceived. She was questioned as to how she could be so clear as this being the intercourse that led to conception and pointed to its particularly traumatic character. A simple reading of her statement suggests this was an isolated incident and there is no mention of further events with the mother giving the impression this was a particularly traumatic event (as it would be if true). </span></p>

The mother made clear that she informed the police as to this taking place at the earliest opportunity. It was her case the police officer had wrongly failed to include the report within his/her contemporaneous records. In October 2021 the mother did speak to the police about this allegation. On this occasion she detailed being subject to repeated rape on a daily basis after August / September 2020 and additionally subject to oral rape on at least a monthly basis when on her period causing her to vomit on occasions. She referenced an occasion which stood out and which logically appears to be the incident at &#167;17 above but the detail is somewhat different in that it does not include the aspect of oral sexual assault.</span></p>

He was questioned as to further assault post-birth and made clear this could not have taken place as the mother had received stitches following child birth and she would likely have been seriously injured if he had forced her in this period. He accepted the parents engaged in oral sex as part of their relationship but denied any impropriety. He told the police he saw this as an attempt to obstruct a relationship with his child. The father relies upon messaging between the parents on the date of 4 September 2020 as not fitting comfortably with the allegation. The mother disputes this assists the Court.

She accepted there was messaging from her to the father on 4 September 2020 in which she commented on them having sex that evening. She was not able to report these events to her family until after the relationship ended due to her phone being monitored.

In his live evidence the father pointed to contradictions in the mother&#8217;s evidence and made the point about the relevance of her receiving stitches during child birth. He argued he would not have acted in this way. His parents sit in the room directly below their bedroom and the house is not large with the inference that they would hear if something inappropriate was happening.

However, before reducing this judgment to writing I have stood back and reflected on the evidence holistically considering the wide canvas of evidence placed before me. Each allegation is independent of the others and there must be room for the Court to make mixed findings. The rejection of one allegation does not justify the Court in moving on to reject all allegations. However, at the same time the Court is bound to draw upon its assessment on one allegation to an extent when considering others. In a case in which coercive and controlling behaviour is alleged it is important that I take care to look for and, if identified, interpret patterns of behaviour present on the facts.</span></p>

This was a relationship based on mutual affection and there were no overbearing cultural issues which balanced power relations differentially between the parents. The mother and father are plainly reasonably intelligent individuals without any disability, learning challenge or other identified vulnerability which leaves them open to exploitation. I accept this does not rule out a controlling relationship but it is a relevant matter to place into the balance.

The mother gave an account of social isolation, however whilst I accept she may have felt isolated to some extent having left her family and moved in with the father, this was not a consequence, in my assessment, of misconduct on the part of the father but rather the reality of married life. The evidence I heard from the grandmother was that there were at least a series of visits post marriage between the mother and her family. I consider nothing turns on the fact that the father accompanied her when she travelled to see her family. That is entirely unexceptional. It is clear the maternal family also visited the paternal home. I consider it is likely that a combination of leaving home and moving some distance has impacted on the mother&#8217;s emotions in this regard. I can see she describes herself as having suffered post-natal depression following the birth of the child and it is likely this has further impacted on her feelings and sense of dislocation. The fact she became part of the father&#8217;s family would have only exacerbated her likely sense of missing her own family. All of this is added to by the reality that this all took place during the period of covid and during sustained periods of lock down when wider community was legally restricted. This is likely to have contributed to the mother&#8217;s feelings and is likely to have been exacerbated further when cracks in the relationship began to grow. But in my assessment, this is not evidence of isolation engineered or exploited by the father.</span></p>

The evidence was that she had her phone and the sister confirmed they would message rather than call each other. Having heard all the evidence, I favour the father&#8217;s account in this regard. I accept he would often, but not always, be away working and that the mother plainly had the opportunity to call her family. It is plain on the evidence that she did so. Her access to a phone is also confirmed by the evidence of messaging between the parents over a sustained period. The mother was not contained or restricted within the family home. She worked and had access to a car which she was free to use. I did not find the evidence of 24/7 tracking at all persuasive. The evidence of the father in this regard was clear and credible. This was plainly an insurance feature and had no bearing on control of the mother. I was equally unimpressed by the suggestion the mother&#8217;s communication were monitored at all times. I accept there would have been a real likelihood of family being present when the mother made calls but I sense this was a function of family life rather than control. The maternal grandmother gave equivalent evidence of calling the father&#8217;s home and speaking to the mother and the father. The presence of family members is not probative of control but is as likely to be an innocent aspect of family life.</span></p>

I fully accept this may only be a partial insight into the relationship and I certainly would not determine this point on the messaging alone.

That language was wholly inappropriate and he should be ashamed of himself. I am not imposing a moral judgment for using profanities per se, but rather being critical of the father for causing these to be directed at the mother. It was a sustained tirade against the mother of his child and is inexcusable. Elsewhere he is described by the maternal grandmother as swearing a lot in general conversation; a point which the father came close to accepting was part of his character. I do not find it difficult to imagine him using this level of profanity against the mother at other times when they fell out and I accept this would have been deeply upsetting for the mother to hear. But it is only right I place this into the wider context of the relationship. As an example, I reflect on the mother&#8217;s allegation about the sex of the child and the threatening behaviour of the father. She claims this was an instance when he threw abuse into the conversation. The next day she called the hospital about the child&#8217;s sexual identity being revealed. At 12.22pm on this day (which must have been proximate to the call to the hospital) the mother messages the father:</span></p>

This is one of a number of messages which convey a sense of ordinary and appropriate home life. I consider it is likely this was a relationship which had arguments and that on balance when these arose, they could be heated and the father could express himself harshly and inappropriately. I have absolutely no reason to believe he slipped into error on only one occasion. But I also consider that between arguments the relationship returned to balance and the parents maintained a level of warmth between themselves. I judge an element of this can be seen in the post-separation visits. I do not accept the mother was pretending happiness to survive. It is likely to an extent they fulfilled traditional gender roles. However, I am not persuaded this was a case with patterns of coercive or controlling behaviour underpinning it.</span></p>

This is the only allegation of violence directed at the child and it is surprising that the single item raised is effectively at the extremes of behaviour being an attempt to suffocate. There is no surrounding context that might begin to explain why the father acted in such a manner on this day. The most that is suggested is that he was jealous of the relationship the mother had with the baby. However, other evidence in the case suggests the opposite and the desire of the father to maintain a relationship with his child. In any event this would not come close to explaining such conduct. I bear in mind the mother&#8217;s case is that but for intervention there was a risk/likelihood of death. There is an essential implausibility to this allegation which is otherwise wholly unsupported by the evidence in the case. Added to this is the inherent improbability that were the father to act in this manner that he would do so in a room which the mother could access at any time (as she did), and with the door to the room open and with his own mother sitting and watching (as is clearly alleged). The evidence in no way suggests the paternal grandmother had any malice towards the child and the notion of her watching her son suffocating the child and laughing whilst he did it is very difficult to readily accept.</span></p>

On her case she could clearly see what was happening from the stairs yet at the same time she described having a rear view of the father as he leaned into the cot placing the toy over the mouth of the child. Having heard the accounts given in this regard and having considered the very short space of time in which this was viewed I am not persuaded the mother could have gained a confident understanding of what was happening. At best she might have been able to sense the father engaging with the child and she might have maintained concern from earlier in the day (as detailed above). However, the earlier concerns were of a very different type of event. In my assessment the combination of positioning and time available to reflect on what was  happening make the mother&#8217;s case one which has to be treated with real caution. I find it difficult to understand how from the rear she could have had a clear view of the father&#8217;s actions in front of him let alone an impression of exactly what he was doing with the toy. On the evidence given by the mother I was surprised she was not open to at least a level of uncertainty.</span></p>

Her account was not of having to remove the toy from the child&#8217;s face or moving the father&#8217;s arm to push him away. Rather she spoke of the toy in some way being moved as she interfered with whatever was happening. This in my assessment casts doubt on whether the toy was in fact on the child&#8217;s mouth or simply in the vicinity of the child. I consider it far more likely this was an innocuous event in which the father was trying to distract a crying child with a toy. This is common place and unexceptional parental behaviour.</span></p>

Yet taken with the other points raised above it is right to record the messaging seems entirely ordinary and contrary to what one might expect to see in the period surrounding such action on the part of the father. After the event in the surrounding days the mother sends the father photos of the child with warm messages stating words to the effect &#8216;love you daddy&#8217;.

The evidence given is not persuasive. It is further inherently implausible and is not supported by the way in which the mother subsequently acted when speaking to the father, the police, children&#8217;s services or in her first statement. Although it is not for me to ascertain exactly what happened my sense of the evidence is generally of a mother who may at times have lost sense of the reality of what was happening and allowed her emotions and worries to cloud her judgment. It is entirely possible that she was concerned as to the toy being left close to the child and jumped to a wrong conclusion when she later saw the father with the toy proximate to the child. It may be with time this has crystallised into a sense of the father attempting to harm the child. I find for whatever reason the mother has reached a conclusion that is unwarranted and pursued this notwithstanding the circumstances of the account which should have caused her to pause and reflect. Before reaching my conclusion, I have paused to consider whether there is anything in the wider picture which might help me better understand this allegation or might cast my understanding in a different light. Having done so it is quite clear to me that the allegation is unsupportable on the available evidence.</span></p>

There is no room for ambiguity. The real question is whether these events took place. If they did then the father has acted in an abusive and sexually controlling fashion. If they did not then he hasn&#8217;t. Allegations of this sort are peculiarly difficult to resolve and ultimately turn on a balancing of the parties&#8217; evidence and reflection on the surrounding evidence to consider whether that evidence supports or undermines the allegations. My decision in this regard is more balanced than in the case of the suffocation. I have though reached the conclusion that on balance I do not find the allegation proven or indeed the pattern of abuse proven.</span></p>

Further, for reasons set out above I do not accept the account of this being referenced to the police but missed out by them. On balance, I find the mother did not raise this with the police. The resulting question for me is as to why she did not do this and why she positively denied sexual assault when taken through the DASH questions. I bear in mind this may have been through embarrassment or shame but I also bear in mind this is not the mother&#8217;s case and she positively asserts she told both her mother and sister on returning home and the police on first meeting.</span></p>

It is equally difficult to understand why her family permitted this to happen if they had just received an account (as is claimed) of the father being both a rapist and child abuser. I simply do not find the mother&#8217;s account of suffering from Stockholm Syndrome to be an adequate explanation for her behaviour. First, there is nothing approaching medical support or diagnosis of such condition. Second, if this were the case then she would not have been calling the police against the father on unrelated matters in the surrounding days. Third, it is quite clear from her own statement evidence that it was on leaving the father that she was able to make the reports. Her case is not that she internalised a warped sense of appropriate behaviour whilst with the father and which took time to dispel after leaving. Her case is she was aware things were wrong throughout but couldn&#8217;t report this as she was being monitored but could make a report immediately on separation. Her case is of being conscious things were wrong and being relieved to escape. As she put it in evidence, she had fled the home. This is the very opposite of Stockholm Syndrome. This simply does not fit with booking a hotel room for her and the father. There are photos of the parents together during this period. They give an impression of a couple very relaxed in each other&#8217;s private company.</span></p>

The mother describes this as memorable having regard to the nature of the event. However, when describing it to the police she failed to include a significant component of the assault (the oral assault). On its own this would not be a determining feature in my assessment but it is part of the weight of evidence causing me to have concern about the allegations. I am also concerned as to the apparent confidence with which she associated this event with the conception of the child. Plainly if this was an isolated event of intercourse then it may be possible to identify it as the cause of pregnancy. But here the mother informed the police that during this period she was being raped on a daily basis. How could she possibly associate pregnancy with this event? This is more apparent when one considers this event was 42 weeks prior to the child being born which would appear at the extremes of possibility. I find in a case  - in which the mother raised a single allegation of rape in her statement and but for the police disclosure (which was not initially forthcoming) there would be no suggestion of broader sexual abuse - it is troubling the mother wanted this to be associated with the conception of the child subject to the proceedings. It is also puzzling that on 24 September 2020 the mother is messaging the father telling him she has just come on her period. It is not clear to me how this can be the case if by this point, she was already pregnant. An hour later she messages the father saying, &#8220;Really missing you need a hug&#8221;. In reality these are snapshots from the messaging and it would be disproportionate to import the full messaging into this judgment. However, the point I make is that the messaging is not obviously consistent with endemic abuse within the relationship. There is much comparable messaging to similar effect.</span></p>

I appreciate that this does not rule out a later abusive act but taken with the other information it better fits the father&#8217;s case. When the case is viewed in the broader context with regular (&#8216;daily&#8217;) sexual abuse the messaging becomes very difficult to reconcile to the claimed state of affairs in the relationship.</span></p>

I accept the mother made reports to her family but these are fundamentally self-serving and were in any event not contemporaneous. I would not place great weight on evidence from the paternal grandmother claiming her son had denied such allegations. I take a similar approach to the evidence the mother seeks to draw support from from both MARAC and her therapist. They reflect the judgment of others who have heard the mother&#8217;s complaint. I am equally dismissive of any reliance the father places on the police taking no further action against him. This is not in my assessment probative of the truth of the allegation.</span></p>

He argues this demonstrates her underlying motivation to obstruct contact. As with the points above I do not consider this actually speaks as to the truth or not of the allegations. It is equally plausible a wronged party might seek support as might someone who has suffered no wrong. The mother certainly does not express herself at any point as to having fabricated any allegations &#8211; indeed the messaging is largely silent as to the key issues before me. The father also points to other internet communications in which he claims the mother was seeking for spells to be cast against him. He argues this suggests an animus on her part towards him. I appreciate the mother denies she has done any such thing but in reality, this aspect of the evidence does not help answer the question of the allegations placed before me. It is equally plausible (if she did act in this manner) the mother has acted in this way because of the father having wronged her as acting in this way out of malice towards him. It doesn&#8217;t help me answer the questions I am required to answer. It can be seen there is little if any evidence besides the parents own evidence.

My overarching sense of the father is of an individual who will express himself in coarse language and has on occasion unjustifiably blamed the mother when things have appeared to go wrong. An example is found in the basket incident. This is a further occasion. I consider a mistake has been made and rather than reason it through he has blamed the mother and abused her in the course of doing so.</span></p>

It is not in the form of behaviour that justifies fact finding. I do though accept the evidence of a positive cannabis hair strand result in the case of the father. I reject the notion that this reflects the use of cannabis oil as a topical hair treatment. I do not accept this could lead to the results obtained. The father would need to have supporting expert evidence to make out such a case. He has none. I do therefore accept the father has used cannabis and it seems likely he would have used it during the relationship. I find the account given by the mother credible. It fits with the bigger picture but I do not consider it amounts to a matter which justifies a freestanding finding with impact on contact per se. To the extent this is relevant I consider it a welfare rather than a fact-finding issue. It seems likely the father will be asked to provide an updating test to demonstrate a change in usage if this continues to be a relevant issue in the case.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">There is a level of acceptance of inappropriate communication post separation. However, to some extent I accept there is a context to this behaviour. The mother was plainly seeking to restrict contact and there is supporting evidence to suggest she was seeking advice informally in this regard. At the same time her conduct was inconsistent with her at times making reports to the police and then having the father stay over. One can easily see the frustration this would cause but it did not justify the language used by the father. I find he was abusive and intimidating in his actions.</span></p>

I generally do not accept this was limited to the occasion post-separation. My finding is that he has too readily been critical and abusive of the mother. I accept this language would have an intimidatory impact on the mother. It has an element of coercion to it when one understands coercion incoroporates behaviour which is belittling and humiliating. I consider this language has the tendency to cause the mother to be belittled and humiliated.</span></p>
