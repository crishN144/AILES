	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.21in">It is unnecessary to set out the full detail of the history of this family and the proceedings.  That detail has already been set out in earlier judgment by Her Honour Judge Atkinson in the care proceedings which preceded the making of the care and placement orders.  The relevant background can be summarised as follows:  The father is now aged 46, the mother 39.  The father's childhood appears to have been relatively settled.  He told Mr. McKenzie, the psychologist instructed as an expert witness in these proceedings, that his father had been very generous and caring, although his mother had been a more tough and controlling figure.  The mother, on the other hand, had a much more troubled childhood.  She told Mr. McKenzie she had memories of her father being violent towards her mother.  On one occasion, after her mother </p>

The mother's mother had a drink problem which clearly affected her capacity to care for the children, so that the mother herself took on a protective role towards her younger siblings.  For a period during her teens the mother was in foster care.   </p>

In 2011, A alleged that she had been raped by the father, but at that stage no further action was taken by the police.  Thereafter, there was some kind of reconciliation, but the relationship between them finally broke down in May 2014.  At that point the five H children, including one child suffering from significant disabilities, were left in the care of the father.  At a later point, A alleged that the father had raped her on two further occasions in 2014.  I shall return to this allegation below.   </p>

They had in fact met some years earlier and had a brief relationship, after which they had separated for a number of years.  At the time when they resumed their relationship in 2014, the mother and her three children were living in one room in a hotel.  In February 2015 the mother and the three children moved into the father's home, where he was living with his five children.  It is the local authority's case that the relationship was volatile from the outset, with incidents of domestic violence.  In May 2015 the mother and her children were provided with alternative accommodation for a period, but subsequently returned to live with the father.  In July 2015 the mother accepted a caution for an offence of common assault on the father.  In August 2015, there was an altercation in which it was said that the father broke down a door and grabbed the mother by the neck.  Later that year the mother was again provided with alternative accommodation, but once again she returned to live with the father.</p>

The father was joined as a party to those proceedings.  On 6th November the children were made the subject of emergency protection orders, and removed into foster care.  Five days later, the children, that is to say B and L, were made the subject of interim care orders.  On 23rd December 2015, care proceedings were started in respect of the father's five older children.  At a hearing on 20th January 2016, the five H children were made subject to interim supervision orders.  The mother was joined as a party to those proceedings.  After a number of case management hearings, in the course of which it was directed that the two cases be heard together, they were listed for final hearing before Her Honour Judge Atkinson for six days starting 7th June 2016.   </p>

Four days later, on 17th July, the mother gave birth to P.  On 19th July, the local authority started proceedings in respect of P and two days later, at a further hearing before Judge Atkinson, she was made the subject of an interim care order until the end of the proceedings and removed from the care of the mother in hospital and placed in foster care.  P has not been in the care of her parents since that date.   </p>

I shall consider her findings in further detail below.  Suffice it at this stage to say that she made a number of substantial findings concerning the behaviour of the parents and the impact of that behaviour on the children.  In short, they were: (i) against a background of controlling behaviour, on two separate occasions, the father raped A; (ii), in the nine months between March 2015 and December 2015, there were nine specific instances of volatile and unpredictable behaviour between the father and mother, often including violence and often played out in front of one or more of the children; (iii), the mother had exposed B and L to a lack of stability and chaotic lifestyle through her frequent moves and her prioritising of her relationships; (iv), the father and mother had persistently prioritised their relationship with each other over their respective children and demonstrated a unified inability to work openly and honestly with professionals; (v), the mother continued to abuse alcohol; (vi), the father had neglected the five H children whilst in his care on occasions.  </p>

She made final care orders in respect of B and L on the basis of a care plan that both children be placed in the care of B's father.  The final decisions concerning the H children and P were adjourned for a further hearing.  At the hearing on 31st August, when judgment was handed down, an application was made by the local authority for a contra mundum injunction restraining publication of information relating to the proceedings, prompted by social media activity by the parents.  The judge made an interim order on that application.   </p>

The final hearing on the welfare issue and the proceedings concerning the five H children, and the care proceedings in respect of P, concluded with a further judgment delivered by Judge Atkinson on 10th November 2016.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge made a care order and a placement order in respect of P.  She approved the care plan for adoption and a staged reduction in contact, culminating in a final farewell visit.  The judge also made care orders in respect of the five H children, coupled with orders under section 91(14), restricting the father's right to make further applications in respect of those five children.   </p>

On the local authority's case, the reason for bringing the meeting to an end was that the father threatened one of the social workers and as a result  the police were called.  Following that incident the LAC review, scheduled for 20th December, did not go ahead and no such review occurred until after P's placement.  At a meeting of the adoption panel on 22nd December, P was matched with prospective adopters.  On 7th February 2017, the prospective adopters were approved by the adoption and fostering panel and a few days later, on 13th February, they were introduced to P.  Shortly afterwards, on 15th February, the final farewell contact visit between the parents and P took place and on 20th February she was placed with the prospective adopters.   </p>

It is the local authority's case that a letter, apparently undated, had been sent informing them that the panel had recommended placement and that the manager had approved the recommendation, but the letter was subsequently returned.  Plainly, however, this letter did not satisfy the local authority's full obligations as summarised above.   </p>

That is not so when the judge has to consider the prospect of what might happen in the future; there he is in the realm of assessing risks, possibilities, probabilities and maybe a sense of confidence and assurance.

		<p style="margin-left:1.4in;margin-right:0.71in;text-indent:0in">"Since the phrase 'nothing else will do' was first coined in the context of public law orders for the protection of children by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, judges in both the High Court and Court of Appeal have cautioned professionals and courts to ensure that the phrase is applied so that it is tied to the welfare of the child as described by Baroness Hale in paragraph 215 of her judgment: "We all agree that an order compulsorily severing the ties between a child and her parents can only be made if 'justified by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests'.  In other words, the test is one of necessity. Nothing else will do."  The phrase is meaningless, and potentially dangerous, if it is applied as some freestanding, shortcut test divorced from, or even in place of, an overall evaluation of the child's welfare. Used properly, as Baroness Hale explained, the phrase 'nothing else will do' is no more, nor no less, than a useful distillation of the proportionality and necessity test as embodied in the ECHR and reflected in the need to afford paramount consideration to the welfare of the child throughout her lifetime (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>). The phrase 'nothing else will do' is not some sort of hyperlink providing a direct route to the outcome of a case so as to bypass the need to undertake a full, comprehensive welfare evaluation of all of the relevant pros and cons (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Re R</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/715" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 715" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 715</ref> and other cases).   </p>

The father, as is plain from his evidence, still genuinely believes that the local authority is motivated principally by financial considerations.  He told me that he would love to believe that local authorities acted in the best interests of a child's welfare, but his experience was that this was not so; everything in his view is money-driven.  This intransigent attitude and the way it has been expressed in the past has undoubtedly had an impact on the local authority's analysis of the issues as I shall describe below.   </p>

There was nothing to indicate she that suffered from any social developmental disorder or any severe psychological disorder.  There were however signs of less severe psychological disorders.  Mr. McKenzie concluded that her history let to the unequivocal conclusion that she has suffered a substance misuse disorder, namely alcohol, for a significant period of her adult life, and in his view the weight of the evidence suggests that her level of alcohol abuse has impaired her primary care for the children on occasions and led to severe emotional outbursts and aggressive behaviour.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.21in">Mr. McKenzie reported that the mother's account of her drinking was that she had not consumed alcohol on a daily basis but had rather tended to drink when under stress.  It was his view that it appeared to suggest there remained a significant danger of her misusing alcohol in the future at a level which would impair her social and parental functioning, although he reported that the mother herself did not accept she would easily return to this pattern.  Mr. McKenzie recounted that the mother had reported having traumatic memories of domestic violence during childhood.  At one stage during their conversation, the mother had become tearful in recalling this history.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.21in">Mr. McKenzie concluded, although this was challenged on behalf of the mother in oral evidence, that these memories frequently preoccupy her, leading to underlying feelings of apprehension and security and a reduced ability to cope.  These memories have been exacerbated by her own experience of domestic violence, in particular during her relationship with B's father.  In addition, Mr. McKenzie noted that the mother had poor self-esteem, which had manifested itself in an incapacity to assert herself and in a sense of being a victim during relationships.   </p>

He concluded that her underlying psychological difficulties were at a level which required treatment.   </p>

He warned  however that the underlying problems, as he identified, would take a significant period counting in years for her to recover.  He thought that, free of alcohol, and in a supportive relationship, her psychological problems may not be of a severity that would immediately preclude the care of the child.  On the </p>

Although he had looked for support on the internet for his conspiracy theories, Mr. McKenzie concluded this was not evidence of a paranoid outlook, although he thought that the father has a tendency to over-value ideas which he might hold on to in the face of contrary evidence.  As with the mother, there was no evidence of a severe personality disorder, although Mr. McKenzie noted in evidence that the father had become aggressive within intimate relations, on the basis of Judge Atkinson's findings, including as she had found, sexual aggression.   </p>

For the purpose of her report, she met the parents on three occasions at their home.  Like Mr. McKenzie, she found the home well presented and welcoming and the parents helpful and cooperative.  She described the couple as appearing happy and calm during her visits and noted that they were able to disagree without difficulty and to listen to each other's point of view.  The mother and father told Ms Beat that they had made significant changes during the past seven months.  They described how the mother had addressed her alcohol issues and how they had attended various parenting courses.  The father had attempted to enrol on domestic violence perpetrator problems, but had been unsuccessful due to his refusal to accept the findings made by Judge Atkinson.   </p>

They had acquired an improved ability to reflect on what they needed to do to improve their parental capacity and develop insight into their methods of parenting.

Ms. Beat also noted the history of difficulties the parents had had working with professionals, including a number of outbursts during meetings and comments made on social media.  On the other hand, she was critical of the errors made by the local authority in failing to comply with the procedural requirements prior to the placement of P with prospective adopters, and also of a history of poor communication by the local authority.   </p>

She spelt out in detail the structure programme of recovery and treatment she has undergone, through Reset, a drug and alcohol unit in Tower Hamlets.  She described in detail the treatment programme, the recovery centre, the treatment centre, the groups she had attended, in which she had learned, for example, strategies about how to cope under pressure, and how to avoid drinking under pressure; the tests, physical tests, urine, blood and breathalyser tests she had undergone, and her balancing mood programme, which she said had become a major part of her life and introduced her to an effective way of coping with life, to mindfulness and cognitive therapy workshops and ongoing attendance at AA meetings.   </p>

It is true that Mr. McKenzie's tests did not reveal evidence of aggressive behaviour to a wider community i.e., to those outside a relationship with the father.  It is in the context of a relationship that these attacks occurred, against the background of what Judge Atkinson found to be controlling behaviour.   </p>

Any child placed in his care would be at risk of emotional harm.  The father's response is, first, that he denies that the assaults ever happened as the judge found.  He continues to assert that the judge did not have the full evidence before her when she made the findings, an assertion not accepted by the local authority, and points to the fact that he was subsequently acquitted by the jury of rape.   </p>

The father understands this.  On his behalf, Mr. Andrew Norton QC submits, rightly, that it is not an essential prerequisite of a return of a child that a party accepts every finding made against him.  I agree.  But the fact that this father refuses to accept this very serious finding is inevitably a significant matter which has to be taken account in the balancing exercise I have to conduct.   </p>

There is no evidence of any recent altercations of the sort found by Judge Atkinson.  Having interviewed them, Mr. McKenzie thought it more likely than not that their relationship would continue for some time.  In court, they have presented as a caring and supportive couple.   </p>

They accept there were arguments and that the children would have been affected by those arguments, but they portray those arguments as attributable entirely to the mother's drinking and their joint difficulties struggling to blend the two families together, and with managing teenage children.  They do not accept that the relationship was violent in any way, or at least in the way found by the judge.   </p>

One example of their minimising their conduct concerns an incident which was one of the findings made by Judge Atkinson, in which they were seen fighting in the street on CCTV.  They asserted before me they had simply been play fighting.  This illustrated the extent of their ongoing denial and their willingness to deceive the court on this matter.   </p>

Whatever the findings were, in particular it is their case that the principal underlying cause of the difficulties in the relationship was mother's drinking, and that now she is dry, those difficulties will not arise in future.  In addition, both parents have been on other courses, including, in the father's case, a course run by Reset for partners of recovering alcoholics and addicts, and also a course called strengthening families, through which he has learned techniques about managing difficulties within families and relationships and, he says, gained insights which will reduce the risk of any further difficult behaviour on his part.   </p>

But the fact remains that they have not faced up to the fact that their relationship in the past was toxic and seriously affected by their tendency to be violent to each other in stressful situations, as found by the judge, and as a result of which the children suffered harm.   </p>

She is thriving and meeting her developmental milestones.  She has developed an attachment with her carers and seeks care and protection from them appropriately.  For example, when the door is answered and a stranger walks in, she stands behind her carer's leg and peeps out inquisitively.  When the guardian visited, she was appropriately wary of him and looked to the carers for reassurance.  She is comfortable with groups of people but tends to sit closest to her carer and to check back with her if playing with others.  She enjoys age appropriate activities, is sleeping through the night and is beginning to speak.  Her carers have a life story book with photos of her birth family.  She is a healthy child and as yet there are no signs that she has suffered any developmental delay or other problems as a result of her mother's drinking during the pregnancy.  Although, it is the mother's case that she was in fact sober for a period of months during that pregnancy.  </p>

In closing submissions, Mr. Newton QC on behalf of the mother suggested that if it were the case that the local authority and the guardian said that this was the factor which had a significant decisive impact on the balancing exercise, expert evidence was required.

The court will almost invariably require some expert evidence of the strength of the attachment that exists between the particular child and the particular carers and the likely emotional and psychological consequences of ending it. In that regard, the generalised evidence of the ISW and the Guardian, which did not involve any assessment of A and Mr and Mrs X, in my view fell short of what is required."   </p>

Each case turns on its facts.  There is no dispute that there will be some emotional harm to P were she to be removed from her carers.

No party suggests that those circumstances exist here.   </p>

Whilst it acknowledges that the court is bound to take the findings into account and the risk of repeated behaviour that exists as a result of those findings, Mr. Norton QC submits that the court can safely conclude that there is unlikely to be any such repetition, having regard to the strength of the couple's relationship, the insight they have acquired as to the effect of their past volatile relationship on the children, their positive engagement and treatment on courses focusing on aspects of their domestic relationship. It is submitted that in assessing the evidence of the independent social worker and the local authority, the court should bear in mind that both the independent social worker and the social worker seem to have misread Mr. McKenzie's report as suggesting that the psychological issues precluded the safe return of P to the parents' care.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.21in">Drawing these threads together, I reach the following conclusion.  I start with the judgment of Judge Atkinson dated August 2016.  That provides the factual basis of all decisions about the future of P.  The attempt at an appeal against those findings was dismissed and all courts must therefore follow the findings in that judgment.  The father and mother recognise that this is how all courts and professionals involved with their family must proceed, but they do not accept the truth of many of those findings.  They think the judge was wrong, but this court and everyone else has to proceed on the basis she was right.  </p>

Although he was subsequently acquitted of rape by a jury in criminal proceedings in respect of the incidents which Judge Atkinson made findings, her findings, which were, of course, made on the lower civil standard of proof applying in family proceedings, still stand and are binding on this court.  They were not in any way expunged or watered down by the acquittal.  As the father fairly recognised in evidence such findings are plainly relevant to the decisions about P's future.  They demonstrate that he has the capacity to commit acts of sexual violence.  Such a tendency gives rise to a risk of harm to any child in his care, not through any direct threat of physical or sexual harm to the child emotional harm but rather through the risk of emotional harm caused as a result of witnessing or being otherwise affected by violence within the domestic relationships in the household.   </p>

In addition in the case of the father, there is the propensity to sexual violence.  So far as those problems are concerned, and in stark contrast to the issue of the mother's drinking, there have been no significant developments at all.  The father has made some attempts to get on a domestic violence programme, but has been turned away because he denies he has been violent.  It follows, therefore, that the propensity to violence, including in the father's case, sexual violence, remains.   </p>

But in addition, their assertion that there is no risk of violence in the future is based on their continuing denial that there was any violence in the past.  The reality is they have simply not faced up to the facts as Judge Atkinson found them to be.  The facts are that, in stressful situations, they have both in the past become violent to each other, and in the father's case to his former partner.

In addition, P has half siblings, eight half siblings, although none of them are at present living with the father and mother and some of them are estranged from the parents, returning P to the care of her parents would enable her to form relationships with some of her siblings, immediately and in the long-term perhaps with all of them.

In particular, the father has failed to accept the findings that he subjected his former partner to an extreme form of sexual violence on two occasions.  Both parties deny that their relationship was characterised by domestic violence as Judge Atkinson found had occurred.  As Mr. Norton QC accepted, this means there remains a risk of recurrence of violence.  However, he contended that the court could have a degree of confidence that this will not recur because the mother has now stopped drinking, the parents have acquired insight and understanding through the various courses they are undertaking and there are grounds for concluding their relationship is less volatile than it was. </p>

Without any acknowledgment by the father of the findings of sexual violence, the extent of the risk of a repetition is unquantifiable but remains significant.  The impact of any recurrence of such behaviour will be very serious on any child in the household.  The failure of the parents to acknowledge the truth about their violent relationship means that the risk of a recurrence of that violence is unquantifiable, but in my judgment significant.   </p>

Consequently, a major disadvantage of returning P to their care will be that she would be returned to the care of people with an unacknowledged and untreated propensity to resort to violence within relationships.  It is inevitable she would suffer were there to be a recurrence of this violence.   </p>

Although the parents have demonstrated they can work with some professionals on the various courses they have undertaken, in particular the mother's close relationship with those professionals working with her on her alcohol treatment programme and have also formed a much better relationship with the current social worker, Mr. King, the history of the last three years demonstrates that these parents have an extremely challenging and confrontational attitude to social workers, judges and other professionals borne out of a view held by the father that social workers support forced adoption for financial benefit and his views as to the endemic corruption of local authorities.  The court cannot be confident they would co-operate to the extent required to ensure P's needs were met.

This is not the most important factor in this case and if all the other factors pointed in favour of a return home, it would not be a factor of decisive importance.

I respectfully reject Mr. Newton QC's suggestion that the significance of this factor is reduced because any difficulties would be likely to emerge quickly so that, in those circumstances, P could be removed again.
