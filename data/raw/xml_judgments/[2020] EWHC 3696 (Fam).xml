	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">My order resulted from longstanding financial remedy proceedings which commenced on 27 June 2017.  The final hearing took place over three weeks in January &#8211; February 2020.  My draft judgment was circulated on 28 February 2020.  It was formally handed down on 30 March after making a couple of small amendments arising from the hearing on 27 March. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the course of the judgment I made a series of condemnatory findings in relation to H&#8217;s disclosure and honesty. I also made findings against W but these are not relevant for current purposes.  The effect of the order was that H should pay W &#163;64 million, comprising the matrimonial home mortgage free (&#163;15 million) and a lump sum by instalments totalling a further &#163;49 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">When the matter came before me on 27 March 2020, Mr Todd QC, acting on behalf of H with Mr Yates QC, applied informally, i.e. without any application having been issued, for me to defer handing down judgment on the basis that the economic effects of Covid-19 were such that the basis of the order was likely to be fundamentally undermined and that the court should not make any final order but adjourn the case until September 2020. I refused Mr Todd&#8217;s application and the draft order was then the subject of debate between counsel during the hearing. </p>

Mr Caldwell, SJE accountant, had not been asked to report on it and it received passing reference only in his report.  I raised in my judgment the possibility of there being a transfer of assets between the parties so that H had the option of converting some of the award he had to pay from cash into shares.  At the hearing on 27 March he chose not to take up that invitation. </p>

In addition, he subsequently applied for an order that the decree nisi be made absolute, but that application was not proceeded with and he seeks to have that adjourned generally and W asks that it be dismissed.  I consider that it should be dismissed rather than left dormant, although that would not inhibit a reapplication if appropriate. </p>

In it he asserts that &#8220;A large proportion of the assets ascribed to me at the final hearing are, unfortunately, held in countries, or are underpinned by businesses, which have been amongst the hardest hit globally during the course of this crisis. The same is true of assets held by my wider family. I set out in this statement my understanding of the current position, broken down by country and industry.&#8221; </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">He goes on to say at paragraph 10 &#8220;In summary, however, I am not in a position to make payment of the lump sum provision provided for within the final order, due to the enormous reduction in my financial worth, and that of my family, but which I am currently unable to fully quantify. Furthermore, I believe that this entirely unforeseen and unforeseeable course of events fundamentally undermines the fairness of the award.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">A striking feature of his statement is how very little of it relates specifically to the assets which I found to either belong to H or in which he has an interest.  Paragraphs 30 &#8211; 35 deal with his interest in three publicly quoted companies, Company A (BVI), Company C (BVI) and Company R (BVI); no more than about 10 paragraphs thereafter touch upon what I found to be H&#8217;s assets and part of the marital acquest.   </p>

	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The whole of the rest of the statement concentrates on the macro-economic situation arising from Covid-19.  He ends the statement by saying, &#8220;I ask this court to now make directions for the revaluation of the relevant assets by the single joint experts so that it can consider my variation application in the light of these new values and the now much reduced liquidity.&#8221; </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The only assets for which H provides any figures are the three quoted companies.  One of them, Company C (BVI), in which H holds a significant shareholding, did drop nearly 50% by value but it is now down by just 5%.  Company A (BVI) has, he says, dropped by 77% but this is a small company in the great scheme of H&#8217;s wealth.  Company R (BVI) has, according to H, had its market capitalisation value significantly decreased as many investors withdrew their funds, but that does not in itself mean that H&#8217;s interest has been significantly reduced in value.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The remaining references that H has made to his assets are general in the extreme.  He points out that some tenants of properties that he owns or in which he has an interest have given notice and/or have struggled with their rent.  Hotel occupancy has fallen, and I accept that it follows that as earnings have decreased, so would the value of H&#8217;s hotel owning companies have been reduced.  But H does not seek to put any figures before the court.  Likewise, the changed occupancy and expenses of running his care homes are likely to have had an effect on value, albeit not one that H seeks to particularise. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is against that background that H says that there should be a complete revaluation of all the assets in the case.   In his application he seeks that 10 properties not previously valued should be valued.  They comprise land and improvements in the UAE, Philippines, New Delhi and London, as well as plant, machinery, office equipment and vehicles.  Two care home business in England, a London property and no less than 25 businesses, many of them with related entities, are to be revalued. H cannot shirk from saying that what he seeks is effectively a complete rerun of the whole of the valuation exercise, albeit set against the background of the findings that I have made as to ownership. </p>

H now wants all the properties to be valued/revalued to provide greater accuracy.  It follows that this would be a massive exercise, costing some &#163;300400,000 plus taxes and expenses and would take six months to complete on the timescale put forward by H. </p>

This is an inherently unsatisfactory prospect in the light of the findings that I made about H&#8217;s credibility.   </p>

On the other hand, if W had received her award, she would have had the opportunity to invest it and in a rising market might make significantly more by way of return.  I am not prepared to increase the rate of interest to the judgment rate because in the current economic climate I would regard such an order as excessive.  It is appropriate that H should pay 4% pa on the sum of &#163;30m.  I confine the award to the second tranche. I do not attach interest to the first tranche because H will be continuing to pay the mortgage on the matrimonial home and W is not in reality being kept out of that element of her financial award.  Nor am I willing to award interest on the third tranche.  That liability arises solely by reason of his non-payment of the second tranche when in other circumstances it would only be payable from 30 September 2021.  Again, in the current financial circumstances I would regard the immediate award of interest on the sum of &#163;19m as oppressive. </p>

It is correct that they apparently provided her with about &#163;1m in the first round of the litigation for her to obtain the services of a financial advisor/investigator.  I accept also that they would be in a position to help her financially if they so wish, but they are under no liability to do so and I have no reason not to accept W&#8217;s statement that they are not willing to do so.   </p>

That argument needs to be seen in the context of what H actually offered.  H has offered to transfer the home to her but leaving it subject to a mortgage in these terms: H would borrow &#8364;6m against a property in France held in the joint names of H and W and use &#8364;4.9m of that sum to discharge what would be about &#8531; of the mortgage on the matrimonial home and provide &#8364;1.1m to put towards W&#8217;s costs.  In exchange he expected W to transfer to him her interest in the French property. </p>

Equally, she must be put in a position where she can participate in the litigation.
