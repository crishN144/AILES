Since then, meetings have taken place with the family on 30 November 2020 and 4 December 2020. Without surgery, the narrowing will progress, which can lead to thickening of the heart muscle and ventricular hypertrophy. There is an increasing likelihood of damage to the heart outlet valve, coronary arteries, and heart muscle. There is, accordingly, an enhanced risk of collapse and sudden death, which statistically stands at 25 to 100 times higher compared to the matched population. </p>

The means of treatment would be open heart surgery with a heart lung bypass machine to enlarge the narrow area with patches.  The 30-day survival rate is 97.3%. Long term survival is reported at 70-97% with good quality of life and freedom from re-operation at 65% after 20 years. There is a small risk of damage to other organs in the body, although this is often only temporary in nature without long lasting consequences. </p>

I state this as a general and not as an invariable premise because of the possibility of cases in which a court would not authorise treatment of a distressing nature which offered only a small hope of preserving life. In general terms however, the present state of law is that an individual who has reached the age of 18 is free to do with his life what he wishes, but it is the duty of the court to ensure so far as it can that children survive to attain that age?To take it a stage further, if the child's welfare is threatened by a serious and imminent risk that the child will suffer grave and irreversible mental or physical harm, then once again the court when called upon has a duty to intervene." </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Having considered the evidence and the legal principles, I have reached the clear conclusion that the proposed treatment is consistent with CK&#8217;s best interests. There is a strong likelihood that it will reduce, by a significant degree, an otherwise lifethreatening condition.  Although the proposed surgery is not entirely free of risk, such potential for risk is far outweighed by the potential for benefits. To refuse the application would, by contrast, seriously compromise her health to the point where there is a substantial enhanced risk of death.  The view of GOSH and the treating clinicians is unanimously supportive of the application. It is consented to by all interested parties.  I therefore grant the application. </p>

As things stand, and prior to the anticipated grant of Special Guardianship status to GK in March 2021, an application to the court will be required on each such occasion for authorisation of such treatment. This is costly, and onerous, on the parties, particularly in circumstances where the history suggests GK&#8217;s views will likely be aligned with those of GOSH.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">In order to avoid this, the parties invite me to make a child arrangements order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that CK shall live with GK, which in turn would confer on GK parental responsibility by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

A child arrangements order would plainly reflect the reality of the situation, which is likely in any event to be confirmed in March 2021 by the Special Guardianship Order. Further, it is apparent that the lack of a person with parental responsibility who is able to provide lawful consent has hampered provision of medical care for CK, in particular, generating delay at GOSH which the clinicians there are anxious to avoid.  That is wholly unsatisfactory, and inimical to CK&#8217;s welfare. Taking into account the paramountcy principle and the welfare checklist, I am entirely satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order that CK lives with GK. </p>

This may be a useful course of action in other cases where the minor lives with a close relative who does not have parental responsibility. Of course, the court must always be satisfied before making a child arrangements order that it is in accordance with the statutory principles; although plainly satisfied in this case, it may not always be so.  </p>

I wish everyone, and especially CK, the very best outcome from the surgery on 23 December.   </p>
