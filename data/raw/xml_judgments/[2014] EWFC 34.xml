Her parents &#8211; her mother is Zimbabwean and her father American &#8211; are separated and estranged.  Her unsettled life history falls into three chapters: until the age of three, she lived with both parents and her older siblings in Zimbabwe; she was then taken by her father to the United States and kept in his exclusive care until the age of five; then, in November 2012, as part of a habit of continuous travel, he brought her to England where she was soon removed by the local authority and placed in foster care.  Now each parent seeks her return to their care.  </span></p>

Since her arrival here, her mother has been unable to visit England, and only now has she received a visa allowing her to travel from South Africa, where she now lives.  As a result, Amanda and her mother met last week for the first time in four years: it was a joyful occasion.  Meantime, the father, who remains in England, has not had contact since February 2013: as a result of his approach to contact, supervision was directed, but he has been unwilling to see Amanda with supervision.</span></p>

Their protracted course is described in my judgment of 30 July 2014, which can be found on Bailii as </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re F (Habitual Residence)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/26" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 26</ref>.  At that point I found that this court has jurisdiction to make decisions about Amanda.  That arid issue (arid because no one wanted the case tried anywhere else) had been pursued by the father on appeal after some nine months during which he took no part in the proceedings.  The consequence has been that the better part of a year has now been lost.  This delay has been damaging for Amanda.  She has known since August 2013 that the plan is for her to be placed with her mother and is too young to understand the legal labyrinth that her case has since been through.  As her social worker puts it: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;I feel she is probably questioning how it can possibly take this long.&#8221; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">In the meantime she has had one parent who refuses to see her and another who has been unable to do so.  With the removal of her father's powerful influence, she has been in limbo, becoming more attached to her devoted foster carers all the while.  </span></p>

I find that once the father arrived in America, he reneged on what was expected of him and set about taking total control of Amanda's life.  The mother did not even receive a photograph of her daughter from America, nor did she know that the father and Amanda were in South Africa for two months in the autumn of 2012, nor did she hear of the grandmother's death until three months later from one of the father&#8217;s sisters.</span></p>

A resumption of life with him would be disastrous for Amanda&#8217;s future development.  Confirmation of this appears from the independent social work report of Christina Pugh dated 20 August 2014.   In her detailed assessment, Ms Pugh concurs with other professionals in considering that the father has failed to consider Amanda's emotional needs, but has his own agenda which he has kept to regardless.  His parenting meets his needs by training Amanda on his terms rather than allowing her to develop as an individual.  He shows no potential to change or to work with others, but is rigid and immutable.  Amanda has a highly ambivalent attachment to him and shows no separation anxiety at his disappearance or enthusiasm for his return.  Ms Pugh cannot recommend that Amanda is placed in his care.</span></p>

Their involvement stretches back to the beginning of the proceedings.  Both have been subjected to unsparing criticism by the father, which I find to be groundless.  Because he lacks the capacity to weigh other points of view, the father&#8217;s reaction to disagreement is to attack the other person&#8217;s good faith and competence.  I instead commend Mrs Hunter and Mr Jones for their patient commitment to Amanda&#8217;s best interests.  They have approached their responsibilities objectively and professionally and I accept their advice.  </span></p>

In his first report (June 2014) he gave the opinion that the father is not suffering from major mental disorder that would impact upon his ability to care for or have contact with Amanda.  However, in July 2014 he provided an updating report on the basis of further information.  In this he provisionally diagnoses the father to be suffering from delusional disorder.  Dr Pool&#8217;s report contains a detailed account of his interview with the father, which I have read.  However, I have not taken his diagnostic conclusions, original or revised, into account in reaching my conclusions.  In the light of all the wealth of other information, it is not necessary to do so.</span></p>

Looking to the future, there is a risk that Amanda will suffer further harm as a result of her father's actions and attitudes.  In the great majority of cases it is in the interests of the child to have the active involvement of both parents, sharing parental responsibility.  Unfortunately, this is not such a case.  The father has not only said, but demonstrated, that he is not able to share parental responsibility.  Any future unregulated involvement by the father in Amanda's life is likely to be seriously and damagingly disruptive.  It is essential for Amanda's future development that she and her mother are protected from this.  It is not possible to know what steps the father might take, but he is likely to want to impose his plans upon Amanda if he gets the chance and I find that there is a real threat of a further abduction.  I would urge that these risks are treated seriously by any agency having the power to offer protection to the mother and Amanda and support the plan for legal orders to be obtained in other jurisdictions as necessary.</span></p>
