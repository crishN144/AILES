	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by a father under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;) in relation to his daughter X born in New Zealand in July 2003 and now 20 months old.  The mother is English; the father is a New Zealander.  They are not married.  Their relationship began when the father came to England in 2001.  After a short time, the father returned to New Zealand and the mother joined him there on what was intended to be a settled and permanent basis, having taken with her Y, her 10 year-old son, now aged 13.  When X was born in July 2003, they all lived together as a family in Lyttelton, a suburb of Christchurch, in a pleasant house of which the mother and father were joint legal owners.  By that time the mother&#8217;s parents had also moved to New Zealand.  They lived nearby, are of comfortable means and generously helped the mother and father with the purchase of their home.</p>

The mother contends that the father could not commit himself to family life and the relationship was in trouble by the time of X&#8217;s birth.  Separation had already been discussed between them and the father left the family home in October 2003.</p>

The father&#8217;s contact with X was the subject of agreement between them following two sessions of counselling through the Family Court in New Zealand.  However, contact proved somewhat erratic because of difficulties arising from the father&#8217;s occupation as a tour driver.</p>

She agreed with the father that she would have a holiday in England taking X and Y with her during his summer school holiday, where she would attend her Graduation Ceremony scheduled for December 2004 returning to New Zealand on 22 December 2004.  Return tickets were purchased for that purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once in England, the mother&#8217;s depression lifted and she experienced great relief at being home.  At the same time, Y, who is an intelligent child of sensitivity and some maturity, revealed to her how deeply unhappy and isolated he had felt in New Zealand.  He is a child of mixed race.  He had been bullied at his New Zealand school, but had not revealed his own unhappiness to his mother because he did not wish to add to her distressed state.  The mother felt that she had failed him and was herself full of dread at the thought of returning to New Zealand.  She registered Y to attend a school in England and informed the father by telephone of her decision to stay in England with the two children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In those affirmations, Miss Hansen, who is a solicitor highly experienced in proceedings concerning children and is a member of the Law Society&#8217;s Children Panel, sets out Y&#8217;s history, state of mind and strong feelings as recounted by him in some detail.  They confirm his unhappiness in New Zealand, the difficult and unsympathetic relationship which he had with the father, his happy feelings and excellent progress at school here in England and his unwillingness to return to New Zealand if his mother does so.  He has stated that, much as he would regret it, if his mother left with X for New Zealand he would not go as well.  He says that he has friends with whose families he could stay while at school here, and that such is his intention if his mother goes back.  He says that he loves X and would miss her a lot.  He describes how she loves his company and rushes to be with him on his return from school.  He describes his mother&#8217;s depressed state while in New Zealand and how he feels &#8220;very worried&#8221; that this would happen again if she returned.  He states that seeing her as he had seen her in New Zealand really scared him because previously he had always been able to rely on her.  He is worried that if he went to New Zealand with her, this situation would re-occur.  He also states that, though he realises that X could not control the circumstances of her birth, he has felt and would feel anger with her for rendering his mother in a position of trying to force him to return. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no effective dispute between the parties that the evidence establishes a case of wrongful retention under the Convention.  So far as Article 3 and Article 5 are concerned, the affidavit of Miss Harrison as to New Zealand law makes clear, and it is not in dispute, that the mother&#8217;s indication to the father that she would not be returning to New Zealand from her holiday as planned and her subsequent retention of X here, was in breach of the rights of the father under New Zealand law which amounted to rights of custody within the meaning attributed to the concept by English law.  Thus, by Article 12 of the Convention, the court is obliged to order the return of X to New Zealand forthwith unless the mother is able to establish one of the exceptions allowed in Article 12 or Article 13.  There is no applicable exception under Article 12.  The exception relied upon by the mother is that set out in Article 13(b) of the Convention which provides that</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case for the mother, shortly put, is this.  It is acknowledged on her behalf that, for the purposes of Article 13(b), the focus is upon the child and not upon herself and that the burden rests upon her to satisfy the court that, if the order is made for X&#8217;s return, there is a grave risk that X will be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation.  It is not suggested that there is any grave risk of physical or psychological harm to X by reason of the conduct of the father or, indeed, in any direct sense.  What is suggested is that, by reason of Y&#8217;s unwillingness to return to New Zealand, coupled with a grave risk that the mother will suffer a recurrence and deepening of her depression upon her return, X will be exposed to a situation where her primary carer will be rendered incapable or incompetent of giving  her the care she needs and has always provided, in a situation where no satisfactory substitute is available and in which X will be deprived of the beneficial association with Y her half-sibling to whom she is devoted.</p>

However, the mother&#8217;s dilemma resulting from the need to choose between, on the one hand the strongly expressed wishes (and indeed the welfare) of Y and on the other hand returning with X to the land where Y was unhappy and the mother became clinically depressed, is relied upon to demonstrate the likelihood that her depression will reassert itself with inevitable detriment to the happiness and care of X, thus placing X in an intolerable situation for the purpose of Article 13(b).</p>

So far as &#8220;lay&#8221; evidence is concerned, the mother asserts, and in this respect is supported by the evidence of Y, that following X&#8217;s birth, she was distressed and suffered low moods that became worse as time went on.  They did not improve following separation and in April 2004 she was treated and prescribed medication for clinical depression.  Her low mood had an effect upon the children.  She noticed that X was not a very smiley baby and that Y lost his motivation and was unhappy and of low mood.  Unlike his normal character, he appeared to become apathetic and disinterested in life. He was worried and preoccupied and would &#8220;slouch&#8221; along rather that walk and run as a carefree small boy.</p>

Upon arrival in England both became immediately more happy and relieved to be &#8220;home&#8221;.  Y soon made clear to her how profoundly unhappy he had been in New Zealand.  He expressed a strong desire to return to school in London and remain amongst his friends and in an English environment where he is less aware of his &#8220;difference&#8221; than in New Zealand.  The events which followed have already been described by me in paragraphs 5 to 7 above.  The mother confirms her agonising dilemma as set out in paragraph 14 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as medical evidence is concerned, there are before the court two short reports from medical practitioners, one as to the state of health of the mother in New Zealand and one as to her situation here.  The first, dated 31 March 2005 is from Dr Chambers of the Lyttelton Heath Centre where the mother and her family were her patients while they lived in Lyttelton.  She states that on 9 February 2003, when X was eight months old and the father had left some four months previously, the mother was feeling stressed with poor sleep.  However the mother had stated that she felt she had good support and did not think she was depressed at that stage.  Unhappily, when the doctor saw her on 8 April 2004 with her father, her symptoms had worsened.  She appeared depressed with disturbed sleep, early morning wakening, low mood, negative thinking, poor concentration, indecisiveness and feeling that everyday tasks required a Herculean effort to achieve.  She was prescribed antidepressants and in-house counselling.  The report then states:</p>

He relies upon authority to the effect that a depressive condition on the part of a mother upon whom relevant children are physically and emotionally dependant may give rise to an intolerable situation of the kind envisaged by Article 13(b); see <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Abduction: Psychological Harm) </span>[1995] 1FLR 64, a case in which it was established that three very young children who were clearly both physically and emotionally dependent upon their mother would be at grave risk of exposure to psychological harm in a situation where the judge found that the mother was suffering from a moderately severe reactive depression and in considerable danger of becoming psychotic and that, if she were forced to return to Texas with the children there was not only a risk, but the likelihood, that she would become psychotic.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second factor on which Mr Turner relies is that there will be lack of a proper home in New Zealand for the mother and X (and Y on the assumption that he too returns) because the mother has sold the home in which she and the children were living in New Zealand.  This will create practical problems in respect of the arrangements upon return, the absence of a secure home and the problem of arranging accommodation being likely to aggravate the mother&#8217;s state of anxiety and depression.  In this respect, he relies on the fact that the mother sold the home with the knowledge of the husband after he had become aware that she did not intend to return and that he did not notify her of any Convention proceedings to compel her return until after the sale had become binding.  Thus the mother did not sell with the intention of seeking to frustrate any proceedings for a return.</p>

He poses the rhetorical question, should she go with X, leaving Y behind; should she stay with Y, sending X back to New Zealand without her primary carer or her brother; or should she seek to force Y to return?  Whichever choice she were forced to make would be likely to lead to a depressive reaction on her part and create an intolerable situation for X.</p>

In that case the mother wrongfully removed three children of the family from Germany, the two elder children aged nine and seven objecting to their return.  Since they were of an age and maturity at which it was appropriate for the court to take account of their views the court (Johnson J.) exercised its discretion under Article 13 not to order the return of the two elder children because of their objection.  However, the youngest child was too young for the court to take account of his views and there could be no sustainable objection to his return on that ground.  Since the court was satisfied that he would be devastated if separated from the two elder children it was held that he would suffer psychological harm and that he would be placed in an intolerable situation if returned to Germany without them. The court therefore exercised its discretion to refuse an order for return.</p>

It will also have an impact on the welfare of X, his half-sibling with whom he has always lived to date.  He seeks to avoid the argument that the dilemma in which the mother has placed herself if a return is ordered is, so far as she is concerned, self-induced by pointing out that Y is blameless in that regard and faces a bleak position in which he will be obliged either to return to New Zealand contrary to his strong objections and his happy situation in England, or be separated from his life-long primary carer mother and a half sister whom he loves and with whom he has lived since she was born.  </p>

He points out that, had Y been a subject-party of the proceedings, he could have argued that to make an order which would either result in his unwilling return to New Zealand or sever his relationship with his family would place him in an intolerable situation.   It is a matter of indifference to Y that he is only a half-sibling rather than a full brother to X.  Thus, says Mr Setright, &#8220;the technicality of parentage&#8221; does not alter or reduce the practical adverse effect of the decision of the court on Y, which the Court should strive to avoid.</p>

That case bore a considerable similarity to this case, so far as the facts were concerned.  An English mother removed B, a young child of the marriage aged 6 from Cyprus where he was habitually resident without informing the Cypriot father.  She took with her A, a child by a previous relationship who had moved to Cyprus with her when she married the father, living as part of the family.  The father sought the return from England of B under the Convention.  There was evidence from A that, whereas she had been very unhappy in Cyprus, she was now happy and settled in England and would refuse to return to Cyprus.  The mother&#8217;s case was that returning the child to Cyprus would involve splitting the family, thus placing her in the intolerable position of having to choose whether to stay in England with A or go back to Cyprus with B.  The judge concluded that, although the Convention conditions had been made out, the mother had established that, if B were returned he would face grave risk of psychological harm or otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation under Article 13(b) because of the potential splitting of the family and, in her discretion, the judge refused to return the child.  </p>

The consequences of the return on A should not have deflected the court from concentrating on the right of B to have his future decided in the state of his habitual residence.  The mother had to make what arrangements she could for A and, in the situation created by her, make the choice whether she returned to Cyprus with B or not.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The grave risk of harm arises not from the return of the child, but from the refusal of the mother to accompany him.  The Convention does not require the court in this country to consider the welfare of the child as paramount, but only to be satisfied as to the grave risk of harm.  I am not satisfied that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, if the mother refused to go back.  In weighing up the various factors, I must place in the balance and as of the greatest importance the effect of the court refusing the application under the Convention because of the refusal of the mother to return for her own reasons, not for the sake of the child.  Is a parent to create the psychological situation, and then rely upon it?  If the grave risk of psychological harm to a child is to be inflicted by the conduct of the parent who abducted him, then it would be relied upon by every mother of a young child who removed him out of the jurisdiction and refused to return.  It would drive a coach and four through the Convention, at least in respect of  applications relating to young children.  I, for my part, cannot believe that this is in the interests of international relations.  Nor should the mother, by her own actions, succeed in preventing the return of a child who should be living in his own country and deny him contact with his other parent.&#8221;</p>

In testing the validity of an Art. 13(b) defence, trial judges should usefully ask themselves what were the intolerable features of the child&#8217;s family life immediately prior to the wrongful abduction?  If the answer be scant or non-existent, then the circumstances in which an Art. 13(b) defence would be upheld are difficult to hypothesise.  In my opinion Art. 13 (b) is given its proper construction if ordinarily confined to meet the case where the mother&#8217;s motivation for flight is to remove the child from a family situation that is damaging to the child&#8217;s development. &#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the mother&#8217;s emotional/medical state, he submits that the Court should be cautious in its approach to the evidence of the mother as to her state of mind in New Zealand and its likely effect upon the welfare of X.  Depressed as the mother no doubt became in New Zealand, the evidence of her then general practitioner falls far short of demonstrating that she left New Zealand in a state of depression.  On the contrary, it demonstrates that by April 2004 she was emerging from her depression, sleeping and eating better and feeling clearer mentally.  She continued to improve and, when last seen on 18 October 2004 had returned to being positive, clear-headed and enjoying life.  The evidence confirms that she was homesick and missing friends and their support and suggested that this might re-occur if she had to come back against her will.  However, the observation that &#8216;this could well put her at risk of a further episode of depression&#8217; does not amount to cogent evidence of grave risk of psychological harm or other intolerable situation so far as X is concerned.  The position spoken to would certainly fail to satisfy the working test suggested by Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span>[1999] 2FLR at 487H-488B; there is nothing to show that X&#8217;s life in New Zealand was intolerable or damaging to her development at the time when the mother left New Zealand when she first made up her mind not to return.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nor is this deficiency made good by the report of Dr Braunold obtained in England.  A fair reading of that report suggests that the stress under which the mother was labouring on 29 December 2004 was the result of her decision to stay in England and the worry and stress she was receiving from telephone calls from the father, in respect of which she was developing panic attacks at the thought of simply answering the telephone.  The report speaks to the mother having settled well in England and her coping well with looking after X and Y here in the UK.  Its conclusion, based on the account of the mother (&#8216;I feel that she would actually become quite vulnerable were X returned to New Zealand and would have grave concerns for her welfare&#8217;) is again not of a level of confidence or objectivity necessary to establish the grave risk to be established so far as X is concerned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the lack of a proper home should the mother return to New Zealand, that is a problem well able to be overcome without grave risk of an intolerable situation arising.  When the mother sold the home which she owned in New Zealand in early 2005 it is clear that she received a sum by way of profit on the resale after repayment to her parents of the money lent for its purchase.  Further, it is clear that money has been accumulating to her credit in New Zealand as a result of maintenance payments made by the father to the New Zealand equivalent of the Child Support Agency. Thus, she has the means available at least to rent a property on her return.  Furthermore, the mother&#8217;s parents would be able to provide emergency accommodation while the mother sought a more satisfactory place to rent with the children while awaiting the outcome of any application made by her to the New Zealand court for permission to relocate.  The grandparents have in the past been generous and supportive, and there is no reason to doubt they would be so again.</p>

Furthermore, in so far as Y was enrolled in a new school in November and has since become settled and happy there, that was again something which could have been avoided if the mother had returned with him to New Zealand during what was the Summer break, and allowed Y to begin at his secondary school in New Zealand at the start of a new term.  In so far as she encouraged in Y the expectation of remaining in England with her, she has only herself to blame.  </p>

He submits that the overwhelming probability is that if X is ordered to be returned, the mother will rightly decide to return with her and Y will go too when faced with the reality of an order.  There is no evidence, save for an expression of belief and intention on Y&#8217;s part, that he has anyone capable of  providing care for him in the everyday way a 13 year-old needs, despite his maturity.  His devotion to his mother and to X (despite feelings of anger which he may well feel at the position in which he has been placed) will take him back to New Zealand.  That is the reality of the situation, so that X will continue to have the company of a brother she loves.  In the highly unlikely alternative that Y were to remain in England, the age of X and the family support available to her in New Zealand pending any welfare-based decision as to her future by the New Zealand court, is apt to avoid grave risk of harm or an intolerable situation arising for the purpose of Article 13(b).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Howard accepts that, as a result of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>, human rights considerations arise and that, in determining an application under the Convention, the Court must not act in a manner which is incompatible with the  ECHR.  However, he submits that a driving policy of the Hague Convention is itself respect for family life in the sense that its underlying purpose is to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention from the care of the parent who has custody rights in respect of them and from the protection of the courts best placed to consider their welfare interests.  It is on that basis that the threshold test for an Article 13(b) defence in respect of a child too young to express its own wishes is set so high.  Thus, while in dealing with a case of this kind it is relevant in relation to the child the subject of the application to take into account the position of the half-sibling not the subject of such application, the imperative of the Convention is to safeguard the right to family life as between the child the subject of the application and the aggrieved parent, and to treat the rights and interests of other sub-sets of family life as subordinate.  Thus, absent a defence provided for in the Convention, it is difficult to envisage any situation where the making of an order by a court after careful and child-focussed consideration of whether such defence has been made out, would or could be regarded as incompatible with the ECHR.</p>

In this respect, Mr Howard placed heavy reliance on the observations of Butler-Sloss LJ quoted at paragraph 31 above.  In that passage, Butler-Sloss LJ was drawing attention in forcible terms to the undesirability of permitting a situation where the mother, as Thorpe LJ put it:</p>

However, it is not a principle articulated in the Convention or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and should not be applied to the effective exclusion of the very defence itself, which is in terms directed to the question of risk of harm to the child and not the wrongful conduct of the abducting parent.  By reason of the provisions of Articles 3 and 12, such wrongful conduct is a &#8216;given&#8217; in the context of which the defence is nonetheless made available if its constituents can be established.</p>

Thus, while the primary purpose of the Convention  as stated in Article 1 is to provide for the prompt return of a child wrongfully removed or retained and to ensure that rights of custody and access under the law of each contracting State are respected, it was no doubt thought necessary in the interests of child protection generally to provide a &#8216;longstop&#8217; defence under Article 13(b) in any case where it appears that the risk of harm which the Convention assumes as a result of the wrongful removal would be intolerably compounded by an order for return.</p>

However tempted the Court may be to temper the effect of the Convention on the basis of the broad welfare interests of the abducting parent and child as they appear in the summary snapshot before the court, it must restrain that inclination, ceding any decision in that regard to the court of the country of habitual residence:  See the observations of Wall LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Abduction: Child&#8217;s Objections to Return) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/428" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 428" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 428</ref> [2004] 2FLR 64 at para [93].

Thus an order of the court which interferes with Y&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s enjoyment of family life together would entail a violation of Article 8 vis-&#224;-vis Y unless shown to be (i) &#8216;in accordance with the law&#8217;, (ii) to have an aim or aims which is or are legitimate under Article 8(2) and (iii) to be necessary in a democratic society for those aims: see <span style="font-style:italic">Haase v Germany</span> [2004] 2FLR 55 at paras [82] &#8211; [83].

Insofar as an order made for return in this case may interfere with Y&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s mutual enjoyment of each other&#8217;s company, it will be made for &#8216;the protection of the rights and freedom of others&#8217;, namely X and the father&#8217;s corresponding rights, to which the Convention, by its structure and terms, accords paramount weight.  Under the terms of the Hague Convention itself, the focus is on X.  Y is not the subject of the application, nor a person whose objections to the order being made is relevant to the establishment of a defence under Article 13(b).  While his position is relevant to the extent that it affects X&#8217;s welfare in the sense of the risk of harm to X, that is as far as it goes for the purpose of considering whether a Section 13(b) defence has been established in respect of X.  If it does so assist, it will also become relevant in its own right in relation to the exercise of the Court&#8217;s discretion whether to make an order nonetheless.  If it does not so assist, then it is not relevant for the purposes of the Hague Convention.</p>

That is because this is a New Zealand, and not a European, case and I have not heard detailed submissions in the latter regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case Singer J.&#8217;s decision was a proper solution on the basis of the submissions then presented to him.  As a result, Y&#8217;s separate point of view has been ably presented by Mr Setright.  As it has emerged, the order was unnecessary because there has been no substantial divergence of interest apparent between Y and the mother.  Both Mr Setright and Mr Turner have urged that the Court should make no order for return, based on the dilemma of the mother in the face of Y&#8217;s unwillingness to return to New Zealand.  Both have advanced and supported Y&#8217;s wishes in that respect.  Both counsel submit that it is intolerable that the mother should be obliged to choose between the interests of her two children and that her return will adversely affect her health and her capacity to care for the children.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the concerns of Singer J. have proved unfounded.  This perhaps emphasises the importance upon an application for separate representation of investigating whether or not (a) there are exceptional circumstances to justify such a course and (b) there is, on the information available, an arguable case for exercise of the court&#8217;s Article 13 discretion.  As a general observation it seems to me that, at least in relation to non-European cases, the need to order separate representation in relation to a child who is not the subject of the application will be rare indeed.  The summary nature of the procedure, the hegemony to be accorded to the interests of the child who is the subject of the application, and the availability of the services of a CAFCASS officer in an appropriate case, all make it difficult to envisage a situation where the position of a sibling who is not the subject of the application would merit such a course.</p>
