This consideration was subject to focused case management directions made on the handing down of the substantive judgment. The parties agreed I should resolve this dispute on the papers without a hearing. The child&#8217;s guardian played no part in the costs process.</span></p>

The starting point is that the process is quasi-inquisitorial and focused on achieving the best outcome for the child.

There are a series of features (caught in paragraph 7 above which open the door to an order and make the same justified). SP&#8217;s litigation conduct raised disputed issues which should not have been raised and which have both extended to proceedings and increased the cost of the same. He engaged in a drip feed approach to disclosure (including the video and other recordings) which also exacerbated the costs of the process. I consider his interviewing of the child to be litigation misconduct (although it had a separate welfare impact) as I consider his willingness to attempt to deploy the police and others to evidentially advance his case. This was all thoroughly inappropriate and is reprehensible conduct. I am well placed to reach this conclusion having conducted the final hearing and with a good sense of this conduct. My judgment encapsulates the issues which lead to this conclusion.</span></p>

I have in mind the request to travel overseas as a prime example. I am not so critical of the SP with respect to his broad position in this regard, although I found against him. I also bear in mind there would have been a need to consider the application to vary the existing child arrangements order. It is difficult to be precise in this regard but I consider SP&#8217;s conduct had a significant impact on the process and led to both an extension of the time required to resolve the issues and the expense required to engage with the issues. In my assessment I consider this should be assessed as amounting to 50% of the costs of the final hearing.</span></p>

On my reading he appears to have mortgages totalling some &#163;1.68m with arrears of &#163;15,275.
