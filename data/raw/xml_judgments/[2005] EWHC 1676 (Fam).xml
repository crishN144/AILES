	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is before me an application of 6 April 2005 by a London Borough in respect of a 2 year old girl, P.  In October 2003 the Local Authority obtained an interim care order in respect of P because her mother&#8217;s chaotic lifestyle threatened her welfare.  They placed her with foster parents, Mr and Mrs N, shortly afterwards.  P has not seen her mother since January 2004.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue before me is whether a Local Authority is under a duty to parents and to a child to disclose that a foster carer with whom the child lives is HIV positive.  If so the question is whether that duty is outweighed by a foster parent&#8217;s right to confidentiality about their medical condition.</p>

At that stage the medical information was sparse.  It consisted of  a paragraph in an affidavit filed by a social worker, Miss K of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2005:</p>

By coincidence his solicitor, Mr M, was appearing before me in another matter listed on 20 May.

I explained only that there was an application involving the Local Authority and the foster parents of P but not the nature of it.  I said that until I had given my judgment I considered that he should not inform his client that there had been the hearing.  I indicated that I might well give a direction to that effect should he feel, as I expected, under an obligation otherwise to inform his client.</p>

Blood, semen or vaginal secretions, and human milk from a person with HIV are considered infectious.

For example a needlestick injury from someone known to have HIV, where infected blood is injected into a healthcare worker, carries a risk of infection of 0.3%.  However blood from a person with HIV in contact with intact skin carries no risk as HIV cannot penetrate intact skin.</p>

This is because of the potentially serious affect on the ability of a convicted person to live a normal life, a risk of violence and that disclosure might drive them underground.
