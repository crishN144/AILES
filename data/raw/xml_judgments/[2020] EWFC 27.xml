It was listed again on 25 March 2019 and one of the issues for that hearing was whether any expert evidence was required. At that hearing the mother&#8217;s counsel raised a number of technical points in relation to the husband&#8217;s failure to comply with the Family Procedure Rules in relation to his answer and cross petition. Although the order of 21 January 2019 does not expressly rule upon the technical points taken the content of the order indicates that the court accepted that the matter should proceed on the basis of a petition for divorce and a cross petition for nullity. All subsequent orders proceeded on the basis that the two live issues before the court were divorce and nullity. </p>

The husband attended in person at the Family Court in Leeds but the wife in error attended at the Huddersfield Family Court. The order made on 6 June 2019 also records the husband&#8217;s case. One of the recitals notes that the husband took issue with part of the recital on the order of 25 March insofar as it appeared to state that the husband accepted that Casa Milan was an authorised marriage venue. The judge gave directions for the Home Office to disclose relevant information relating to applications made to the Home Office in relation to the wife and Ralph. HHJ Hayes QC directed that the proceedings be transferred to the High Court; I believe in fact this was intended to be an allocation to be heard by a judge of High Court level. He listed for directions before Mr Justice Cobb on 8 July 2019 and for final hearing before Mr Justice Cobb on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of October 2019. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Regrettably I did not have expert evidence on Philippine Family Law which might have confirmed both the substantive law but perhaps more importantly the practice and application of that law to marriages in the Philippines. However, part of the court bundle comprised extracts from the Family Code of the Philippines (executive order number 209, July 6, 1987) and the Civil Code of the Philippines (Republic Act number 386, June 18, 1949). As both extracts derived from the same source I had assumed that they were provided by the respondent although in the course of the hearing he relied only on the Civil Code and said that the Family Code had been provided by somebody else and he appeared to be unaware of it. The respondent&#8217;s submissions on the law were all based on the Civil Code and he said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I am an expert in the Philippines family law</span>&#8217; [application for cross petition of nullity]. However, it appears that the Family Code of the Philippines came into effect on 3 August 1988 in accordance with article 257 of the Code which stated that it would take effect one year after its publication in a newspaper of general circulation. Circulation in accordance with article 257 occurred on 4 August 1987.  Article 254 of the Family Code repealed (amongst others) titles III &amp; IV of the Civil Code which dealt with marriage replacing them with Titles I and II of the Family Code. Ultimately the fact that the respondent had relied upon repealed provisions of Philippine family law in support of his legal submissions did not affect the outcome as the relevant provisions were not that different, although it did illustrate an aspect of the respondent&#8217;s character, namely his absolute conviction in the rightness of his own view and his derisive and abusive dismissal of those who disagree despite the foundations of sand on which his views might rest.  Issues of foreign law are to be determined in this court as issues of fact not law. </p>

She maintains that they obtained a licence to marry as required under Filipino law and that the marriage was solemnised by the solemnising officer who is required to register the marriage with the Philippine Statistics Authority. The identity appears to have changed at some point from the Philippine Statistics Office to the Philippine Statistics Authority.  She says that the marriage certificate shows that it was provided by the office of the civil registrar general, part of the PSO and that the place of marriage was the office of the solemnising officer at PM Apartments, room 101, 24 Matalino Street, Diliman, Quezon City. The certificate confirms a marriage licence was granted (199624), that it was witnessed, being signed by those witnesses and the husband and wife and that it was sealed through registration with the Philippines Statistics authority. She says that Casa Milan is a venue where legal marriages could be conducted in 2005 and remains so today.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In relation to the allegation that at the time of the marriage she remained married to Ralph&#8217;s father she originally said that although she undertook a ceremony with Raphael Gragasin, that it was not legally recognised or registered nor did it comply with the requirements of a legally binding marriage. She said this was not uncommon where couples celebrate their relationship but they do not amount to legal marriages. Over the course of the evidence though she accepted that a marriage ceremony had taken place and that it had been registered. However, she said that when she had come to apply for a passport the Philippine statistics authority had been unable to locate a marriage certificate and she had been issued a passport as a single person. She also understood that Mr Gragasin had emigrated to the USA and his status had been accepted within that process to be that of a single man. She said she had therefore believed that she was not married and that this was confirmed by her obtaining from the national statistics authority a &#8216;singleness&#8217; certificate or Certificate of No Marriage prior to the marriage ceremony in March 2005. She therefore continued to maintain that she did not remain validly married to Mr Gragasin in March 2005. In relation to the alleged defects in the process of marriage in 2005 she maintained that they were insufficient to render the marriage void or voidable and that it was an effective marriage in Philippine law and thus she was entitled to a decree of divorce in England.  </p>

The burden of proof lies on the husband to prove on the balance of probabilities that the wife was already lawfully married and/or that the marriage was invalid for procedural irregularity.

It became clear that following the marriage in March 2005 that the husband and wife encountered very considerable difficulties in securing immigration status both for the wife and for her son Ralph. Having heard from both the husband and the wife I am satisfied that the wife&#8217;s initial application for a Visa was refused by the Home Office. Although the husband&#8217;s evidence was not always reliable his account of how the wife came to be granted a Visa seem to me to have the ring of truth about it. The husband&#8217;s evidence was selective and he disclosed facts tactically in order to advance his case rather than providing a full and complete picture. However, his account of his conversation with the immigration officer when the wife was several months pregnant with their first child in autumn 1995 had a ring of truth about it. Although the Home Office file in relation to the wife&#8217;s immigration applications has, for reasons which I am unclear, </p>

However, she also said that when the National Statistics Office were unable to locate her marriage certificate that she came to believe that Rafael&#8217;s family had manipulated the register to allow him to present as a single person for the purposes of emigrating to the USA. </p>

It may have been provided by the husband and wife.  There are two &#8217;versions&#8217; of Ralph&#8217;s birth certificate. They are identical save that one contains in a section entitled &#8216;DATE AND PLACE OF MARRIAGE OF PARENTS&#8217; the entry &#8216;January 15, 1994 Kaloocan City&#8217;. The other version has this section blank. In her statement the mother said that she had to annex to the birth certificate an admission of paternity by Rafael.  This was plainly untrue. When questioned about the birth certificates the wife accepted that the original birth certificate was that which showed the date and place of their marriage. She said that she applied for a replacement birth certificate at the time of Ralph&#8217;s entry to school because she was unable to send him to school without his father&#8217;s consent if they were married. Thus, she obtained, she says, a different version which omitted reference to the marriage.  </p>

However, some support for her position came from an unlikely source, namely the husband. His position was that one of Rafael&#8217;s close relatives worked in the Philippine Statistics Office and would have been in a position to alter or suppress the records in relation to Raphael&#8217;s marriage in order to allow him to present to the US immigration authorities as a single person. The combined effect of their evidence, including the identity of the individual tended to suggest this was so. He also said that over the years he had come to the view that corruption was rife within the Philippines and that official (but inaccurate) documents could be obtained by paying excessive fees for them. He gave </p>

He said he had paid what he believed to be an &#8216;expedited&#8217; fee in order to speed the process but on reflection had concluded that the very large (by comparison to the cost of living generally in the Philippines) fee was paid in order to obtain a certificate which did not refer to the wife&#8217;s earlier marriage to Rafael.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is of course possible, as suggested by the husband in cross examination that the wife&#8217;s obtaining of a passport which showed her to be single was a result of her own fraudulent actions but on fine balance I accept that as a result of actions probably taken to support Rafael&#8217;s emigration to the USA the wife had come to believe that the fact of her marriage to Rafael might have been erased from the National Statistics Office records. However, I do not accept that she did not believe that she had been lawfully married on 15 January 1994. The totality of her evidence in relation to that event together with the marriage certificate produced at the request of the Home Office and Ralph&#8217;s full birth certificate point plainly at the existence of a lawful marriage having been undertaken. Her evidence in its totality leads me to conclude that at that time of the marriage she believed she was lawfully married. She was pregnant at the time.  The Philippine Family Code appears to require only five essential or formal requisites of marriage. These are the legal capacity of the contracting parties who must be a male and a female, consent freely given in the presence of the solemnising officer, the authority of the solemnising officer, a valid marriage licence, a marriage ceremony taking place with the appearance of the contracting parties before the solemnising officer and their personal declaration that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of not less than two witnesses of legal age. All of those essential and formal requisites are present in relation to the January 1994 marriage. Thus, I conclude that according to Philippine law she was lawfully married and she believed herself to be lawfully married.  </p>

However, if she did believe that it was not because she doubted the lawfulness or the validity of her marriage but only because the records had somehow been interfered with. The wife gave no evidence which would support the existence of any reason for or court process which could have led to the annulment of her marriage under the Philippine Family Code. None of the reasons for annulment under article 35, article 45 or 46 are alleged to have existed so as to render the marriage void or voidable. No court process was undertaken. The only provision of the Philippine Family Code which might have potentially been open to the wife was article 41 which applies where a spouse has been absent for four consecutive years and the left behind spouse has a well-founded belief that the absent spouse is dead. Even in those circumstances a summary process must be undertaken to obtain a declaration of presumptive death. None of this applies in the subject case. </p>

That the wife may have believed that the records of that marriage no longer existed does not affect the fact that she was lawfully married. Even if she believed that the absence of records meant she was not lawfully married that is of no relevance to the fact that under Philippine law she remained lawfully married. The husband&#8217;s state of knowledge at the time was of course derived from the information that the wife gave him. I did not hear sufficient evidence to enable me to reach a conclusion as to whether his state of mind was one of genuine belief that the wife&#8217;s earlier &#8216;marriage&#8217; was no more than an informal celebration or whether he turned a blind eye to a suspicion that the wife may have remained lawfully married.  </p>

The evidence of the parties was clear that the marriage ceremony took place at Casa Milan probably on the Friday, 18 March 2005. The solemnising officer attended at Casa Milan and the witnesses signed the documents at Casa Milan as did the wife and the husband. The parties then went on a honeymoon to a hotel some distance away. Neither of them seemed to think they were in Diliman, Quezon City on 21 March 2005 which is when the marriage certificate records the marriage as having taken place. The husband recalled attending the law offices of the solemnising officer in order to collect a copy of the marriage certificate. The wife attended an interview with immigration officials on 23 March 2005 in Manila. Thus, the marriage certificate contains a number of details which are wrong. However, none of those errors would appear to amount to an absence of one of the essential or formal requisites for marriage as required by article 2 or article 3 of the Family Code of the Philippines. But for the fact that the wife remained legally married to Rafael Gragasin on 18 and 21 March 2005 I conclude that the steps the parties undertook would have resulted in the creation of a lawful and valid marriage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It was the wife&#8217;s application for financial relief that prompted the husband&#8217;s challenge to the validity of the marriage. He said in evidence that he regretted having challenged it because he now realised that he could have brought a claim for financial relief against the wife and she would have been entitled to nothing. I believe he was referring to a claim for spousal maintenance; she working full-time in the NHS as a nurse and he being retired. This was perhaps another example of the husband&#8217;s unreliability both in the positions he takes and his understanding of the law. The husband adopts a manipulative stance on his willingness to accept a divorce provided there were no financial consequences for him.  It is indeed as Mr Murray submits an unattractive stance to adopt &#8211; perhaps far more than unattractive. Parliament has provided for financial remedies to be available to divorcing spouses and for the husband to say that he was prepared to be divorced but only on the basis that the law relating to financial remedies was not to apply to him is indeed unattractive, particularly coming from a member of the legal profession. However, having raised the issue of the validity of the marriage it was never going to be possible for the husband to go into reverse. The duty of the court on matters of status such as this would be to enquire into the facts and to reach a conclusion as to the parties&#8217; true status. Had the evidence established that the husband had knowingly participated in a bigamous marriage in the Philippines, this combined with his manipulative stance in relation to the granting of a divorce might have constituted sufficient reason on public policy grounds to decline to grant a decree of nullity. However, his unattractive position on the divorce does not on its own require me to consider further the public policy issue. </p>

Ultimately the marriage they entered into is void because the wife remained lawfully married to Mr Gragasin. I will therefore grant a decree of nullity.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not consider that a costs order should be made in favour of the wife in relation to the costs she incurred in the suit. Applying a &#8216;clean sheet&#8217; approach she failed to secure a decree of divorce. The husband&#8217;s conduct of the proceedings both in the stance he adopted and his failure to file documents as required and his at times abusive attitude to the court would amount to conduct which would potentially weigh in favour of a costs order being made against him. However, he ultimately won on the issue. I therefore consider that no order for costs on the petition and cross petition is the right order to make.

The Queen&#8217;s Proctor made submissions at my direction rather than at any invitation of the parties.
