I am satisfied that C was suffering and was likely to suffer significant emotional harm as at the date of issue of this application attributable to the unreasonable parenting of her Mother. I find that the Mother provided psychological and practical encouragement for the development of a wholly false narrative by which C came to believe that she has suffered forms of physical abuse whilst in the care of her Father. It is evident that the Mother failed to take reasonable steps to address any concerns which C may have had on 10 August 2020. I find that the Mother engaged in a process by which C&#8217;s fears were consolidated, magnified beyond reality and the Mother through her action or inaction permitted, allowed or encouraged that distorted narrative to be recycled amongst professionals. The Mother&#8217;s willingness to do so contributed to a growing range of professional concern and intervention.  In my judgment, the Mother&#8217;s perspective had become so distorted that she misrepresented the facts to professionals, she did not provide full accounts to professionals thereby encouraging further referrals to be made and her actions resulted in C coming to believe that which is palpably false.  </span></p>

She said that she has come to accept that C had been lying about the range of abuse she had alleged save for something which had originally troubled her on her return to her Mother&#8217;s home on 10 August 2020. She accepted treating things said by C as if they were facts and failing, at times, to exercise any appropriate parental responsibility to manage them or control them. The finding I make establishes that her role went beyond simply failing to act but embodied active misrepresentation and promotion of an abuse narrative.  I do not find that she has been plotting to demonise the Father but she did not merely receive the information but became a proponent of it.  She has a complex psychological presentation and will need time and therapy to develop insight into her role in these tragic events.</span></p>

It was common ground that either placement proposal would need to be underpinned by the sharing of parental responsibility with the local authority. The key objective of the care plan is to address the false belief that C has about the abuse which she believes, in an age-appropriate sense, to have occurred.  It is pivotal for C&#8217;s future that this issue is addressed successfully.  Whether she is removed to foster care to enable the process to begin (allied to appropriate therapeutic intervention), which is the local authority plan, or whether they are invited to revise their care plan on the basis of the court&#8217;s evaluation of risk and placement suggesting that she should remain in the care of her Mother and N, in my judgment, it is vital to her future that there is intense oversight as the plans are developed within the Local Authority.  In my judgment, there is one opportunity to begin and to succeed in this delicate task which will challenge C&#8217;s understanding of her life and her trust in those around her.  Such an important and delicate task requires the local authority to be in a position to manage and where necessary dictate the process working, hopefully, in partnership with the parents.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s case is that she has made mistakes and following the completion of an introductory six sessions of CBT in January 2023, she understands that she has struggled in treating opinions given to her, including by C, as anything other than facts, which she has accepted unquestioningly.

I believe the negatives can be mitigated in so much as I can identify triggers in my own anxiety and accept them, the risk is that the anxiety remains. I have the support of a partner who is aware this exists and is happy to say step back. I will be continuing to work on myself alongside this, so I am not static in this, and I accept that that work will be at times challenging but I am not the only person at home who will be reinforcing this message &#8211; to hear this off the other people who she trusts and who support her will only serve to reinforce the message needed and therefore the times I may need to step away will be covered.

She underestimates her lack of insight and her ability to withstand the challenge of unpicking the false narrative which she has conspired to inculcate in her daughter. The advantages of a neutral placement to enable the necessary reparative work to be done with intensive social work oversight outweigh the short-term distress of separation likely, according to Dr Ravenscroft, to last 1-2 weeks. However, the local authority should be in no doubt that the Head of Service will need to resource this placement appropriately. It will require intensive social work visits (likely daily) during the first few weeks to ensure that the arrangements for C including the time she will spend with her Mother are properly calibrated to minimise the distress of separation.  The advice of Dr Ravenscroft will be necessary to support the therapeutic journey of C and must be closely coordinated by the allocated social worker, Ms Baker. Thirdly, the allocated social worker will need to be closely involved in developing arrangements and working relationships with the parents to build on the work with C in the hope and expectation that she can be rehabilitated to the care of a parent as soon as it can be assured that the relationship with both of her parents will be maintained and promoted.  The local authority should consider supporting therapeutic work, as appropriate, with both parents to address the issues which have been highlighted within these proceedings.</span></p>

In doing so, I have kept firmly in mind the contents of the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>.  In this case, the factors of status quo, effect of change and risk of harm have been central to my analysis.  The harm of C&#8217;s false belief is so grave and the uncertainty regarding the Mother&#8217;s ability to promote effective change given her own deficits and therapeutic journey so uncertain that the effect of uprooting a known status quo which has held for the entirety of her life is justified in order to allow her to develop a balanced relationship with both of her parents and undo the risk of enduring damage through a developing false belief that she was sexually abused by her Father.</span></p>

There is no hierarchy of possibilities to be taken in sequence as part of a process of elimination. If there are three possibilities, possibility C is not proved merely because possibilities A and B are unlikely, nor because C is less unlikely than A and/or B. Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings. So, in a case of this kind, the court will not conclude that an injury has been inflicted merely because known or unknown medical conditions are improbable: that conclusion will only be reached if the entire evidence shows that inflicted injury is more likely than not to be the explanation for the medical findings.</span></p>

It should give due consideration to the possibility that the cause is unknown or that the doctors have missed something or that the medical finding is the result of a condition that has not yet been discovered. These possibilities must be held in mind to whatever extent is appropriate in the individual case.&#8221;</span></p>

The weight to be given to records, which may be disputed by the parents, will depend, along with other factors, on the Court&#8217;s assessment of their credibility generally.  Here, the reliability of the hearsay material may be tested in many ways e.g. do similar issues arise in the records of a variety of unconnected individuals?  If so, that will plainly enhance their reliability.  Is it likely that a particular professional e.g. nurse or doctor would not merely have inaccurately recorded what a parent said but noted the exact opposite of what it is contended was said?  The reaction of witnesses (not just the parents), during the course of oral evidence, to recorded material which conflicts with their own account will also form a crucial aspect of this multifaceted evaluative exercise.  At the conclusion of this forensic process, evidence can emerge and frequently does, which readily complies with the qualitative criterion emphasised in </span><span class="None" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re A</span><span class="None" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [(A Child) (Fact finding hearing: speculation) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/12" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 12</ref>].&#8221;</span></p>

In doing so, I have considered the written and oral submissions made by all parties. Whilst I do not descend to the level of detail set out in each and every aspect of the submissions that does not imply that I have not read or considered their import in the context of the issues as a whole. It is however in the nature of a judgment that I should highlight those matters which have driven me to the conclusions I adopt and address the arguments and criticisms which have been made.

She took a photograph, rather than act to instantly remove the tissue. S reported that C was distressed and she had to reassure her before going downstairs to make a cup of tea. If C was in an agitated state, which would have been held in her body, it would have taken a while for her nervous system to have relaxed to allow her to fall asleep, especially if she was worried about her Mother going downstairs and about her Father turning up at the house. C looked to be fast asleep in the photograph. With respect to S&#8217;s action of taking the photograph, at best this suggests an inability to prioritise her daughter&#8217;s needs above her own or, at worst, suggests that she deliberately sought to deceive professionals, with the intention of portraying that her daughter was incredibly distressed. I have grave concerns about this incident as children can choke on tissues in circumstances where they breathe deeper, for example.&#8221;</span></p>

When I asked her whether she thought she had engineered any aspect of this, she strenuous[ly] denied the suggestion. Nevertheless, her own experiences of an absent Father and being brought up by Mother and maternal grandmother, unhindered by male interference, are strikingly similar to C&#8217;s early childhood environment. It is for the court to decide whether this has been brought about by S&#8217;s active exclusion of Father. It is here that more, and corroborated, information about S&#8217;s Father would be helpful &#8211; how long had he and her Mother been in a relationship, was she planned, why was he unable to attend a birth (which had been 9 months in anticipation), why is his name not on the birth certificate, why does she not have a relationship with paternal grandparents and other members of [t]he Father&#8217;s family&#8230;?</span></p>

The Mother and maternal grandmother were living together until the maternal grandmother moved out on or around 7 September 2020.  N moved into the property in about October 2020.  Nonetheless, the maternal grandmother remained intensively involved with C during the period of therapy running from 4 December 2020 to 28 October 2021. During the pendency of the final hearing, the Mother gave evidence to the effect that she had questioned her Mother about paternity and she had revealed further information which had caused the Mother shock and upset. It was in the context of these discussions that the Mother said that the maternal grandmother had made comments to her, which suggested to the Mother that C may have been questioned about them by the maternal grandmother.  It is a further possible feature of the dynamic at play.</span></p>

She is clear that her approach is formulation driven. Central, in her view, to the psychological explanation, is that caregiving and eliciting behaviours are known to be influenced by attachment in the child/parent relationship so that ultimately the explanation reverts to the dynamic between parent and child.  It would be psychologically safe for C to align herself with her Mother in these circumstances in contrast to the Father.</span></p>

She noted that C was able to refer to the Father as &#8216;Daddy&#8217; when boundaries were set within interview by Dr Ravenscroft.  Dr Ravenscroft described a circular relationship between parental alienation and enmeshment, with secondary gains for the Mother in terms of achieving distance between C and the Father and intrinsic satisfaction at increasing her own control and having that closeness of bond with C allied to a sense of importance as someone who sits as a conduit between health professionals and her daughter; a person with the role of keeping her daughter safe.</span></p>

She noted the Mother&#8217;s evidence of change in working with the family support worker, Louise Abbott with whom she completed the Solihull programme (C214, paragraphs 17, 19 and 21) but the priority, in her view, was to establish the facts as to where C&#8217;s statements had been derived from and if appropriate for her to resume a relationship with her Father from a neutral setting.  In her view, barriers have been put in place and C has developed a tainted view of her Father.  When pressed on whether removal was justified given the way that Mother has worked with professionals, completed CBT and achieved a return to school (in which C is as settled as she has ever been), she reiterated that depending on the findings of the Court, ultimately C needs a neutral setting where she has an emotional and psychological permission to establish a relationship with her Father.  She accepted that the position was complicated and not clear-cut but she was struck at the sudden by the sudden amelioration of symptoms upon C&#8217;s return to school.</span></p>

For her presentation to ameliorate so quickly without therapy suggests it was not a clinical presentation. Dr Ravenscroft accepted that if the work the Mother did in completing the Solihull programme with the family support worker resulted in a tangible improvement for C than that was positive but she said that she would still not have expected something of that nature to improve in the way that it did.</span></p>

In my judgment, this evidence supports the notion that it is the dynamic in the relationship with her Mother rather than the trauma of any alleged abuse, which has been the driver for her failure to attend school regularly until June 2022.  I accept that the work of Louise Abbott may well have shifted the Mother&#8217;s thinking but ultimately, the issues at school derive from the Mother&#8217;s parenting failures from and after the genesis of the allegation in August 2020.</span></p>

She was strongly of the view that for rapid progress to be made C should be in a neutral setting. The key difference is that the Mother is in an enmeshed relationship with C, consequently her ability to respond in a manner which is contained and secure is quite different to a neutral setting.  If the court found that the narrative has been actively encouraged by the Mother and C was then told, whilst remaining in placement, that it was not true then that would be very confusing and unsettling; it could make everything worse in terms of her trust and a sense of reality and internal distress. If the Mother and N were required to present an alternative narrative, C would be primed to pick up on cues and behaviour and may well detect incongruence making it difficult to trust others and her own judgment so her sense of self becomes more fragile. Her narrative has already been clouded by the additional layer of her belief that she has been sexually abused.</span></p>

At times, she appears analytical and combative in challenging professional accounts. At other times, she appears subdued, reflective and willing to accept failures in her parenting, which have caused damage. It was in her oral evidence that she accepted that C has lied about the abuse.  At times, when describing how she sought to support contact and made C aware of that, she appeared na&#239;ve as to what C might have deduced from her behaviour.  I accept that she loves C. I accept that at a superficial level she is keen to see the relationship between C and the Father re-develop.  However, I have a profound unease at her lack of insight and understanding of the true measure of the impact of her behaviour (principally since August 2020) upon C and the Father. I agree with her comment that she is still trying to work through the history to gain insight, including her relationship with the maternal grandmother and her confused paternity.</span></p>

I found him to be committed and desperately sad at the impact of events upon his daughter.  The photographs and videos he produced provide a consistent snapshot of a warm and loving relationship with C.  Overall, I accepted his evidence.</span></p>

It is within the household where she has lived with her Mother, for a time with the maternal grandmother and after that N, where she has developed that belief. In assessing the chronology, it is not the case that the Mother denies acting inappropriately. She has, within her final evidence and within her oral evidence, made important concessions about her functioning and how that has played a part in the significant deleterious impact upon C. Her case is that it is anxiety and inability to recognise the need to assert control which has imperilled C. She says that she has learned through her work with Louise Abbott, family support worker and in completing the Solihull programme, the changes necessary and such changes are evident in her attitude towards professionals and in the promotion of the return to education which took place over a period of time in summer 2022. In terms which I have already quoted, she says that the change which is already evident places her in the best position to seek to help C by undoing the damage of the false narrative before it causes further lasting damage.  In order to seek to explain why, at times, she has failed to intervene appropriately as the cycle of allegations spiralled she points to her recognition, following 6 sessions of CBT, that in her mind she has treated matters of opinion, including those of C, as if they were facts.  Where there is evidence of C referring to matters of a sexual nature, which it is difficult to conceive of her inventing or even elaborating upon, she has referred to a conversation with her own Mother during the course of the final hearing which gave her pause to think that her Mother may well have questioned C and formed a view as to the Father&#8217;s role in the alleged abuse.</span></p>

I have taken account of the fact that she has formed part of the history of the development of the allegations.  What is also clear, in my judgment, is the pivotal role played by the Mother.

The seeds of that dysfunction may well be relevant but it is, in my judgment, dangerous to exaggerate the significance of that initial period. Clearly from late 2015 until August 2020, contact did occur regularly. When contact was missed, generally arrangements were made for it to be compensated for. The position, however, was not straightforward. The complaints which the Mother reports C to have made may well be attributable to the psychological functioning which played an ever more important role in the development of the allegations after August 2020.</span></p>

I remain unconvinced that the Mother has a rounded insight into her functioning and how it has impacted upon what C has said to her as compared to her presentation to others. I suspect that the &#8220;Fact/ Fiction&#8221; notion that she described in her oral evidence is the attempt to try to make sense of her behaviour, which actively played a part in the development of the allegations.  It is the lacunae around her understanding of her contribution and the impact upon C, which may have its roots in her own relationship with her Mother and the continuing pain around the question of paternity, which troubles me in terms of her ability to undertake a task for which she is particularly unsuited. She will have to navigate the task of challenging C&#8217;s reality, a reality which she has been instrumental in forming. She will require accurately and faithfully to provide information as a key conduit to the work that would be necessary to unpick the false narrative. What a survey of multiple sources of information have revealed is that there are significant doubts about the accuracy or completeness of information which she has provided at key times.  Thus, in my judgment, the Mother has barely begun to develop a genuine and full understanding of the impact of her parenting and the reasons for it allied to my grave reservations as to her ability to manage the process of change.</span></p>

The picture which develops of her functioning is that of a Mother in the role of protector who has psychologically and unreasonably sought to prosecute the allegations.

She appeared to ignore some evidence and to suggest that allegations would emerge eventually arriving at a questionnaire which suggested that C was suffering with the signs of PTSD. She began initial stages of EMDR, a talking therapy, which seems particularly inapt for a child of this age given they would be required to relive elements of that so-called trauma.  The entire dynamic of C preparing the notes with the active support of the Mother and N, attending the sessions and observing the close relationship developing between K and her Mother would only have served to compound the pressure to make, elaborate or repeat allegations.</span></p>

The Mother has seemingly failed to achieve that task. I find it extraordinary that C, a child who had been wildly resistant to attending school, demonstrating a fear of men and of a particular male teacher, having allegedly suffered sexual abuse would so readily have returned to school and to have settled so well. I accept the evidence of Dr Ravenscroft that such a turnaround is much more explicable by a child psychologically aligned whose expectations had shifted to those of her psychological carer.  I find it probable that the Mother developed a keen sense, alongside the development of understanding following completion the Solihull programme, following receipt of Dr Ravenscroft&#8217;s report in April 2022 that she was under pressure to demonstrate the ability to deal with the issue of education. She was aware that interim removal had already been floated by application before the court and it is in that context that we see the picture of a child capable of making an enormous and successful adjustment.</span></p>

For much of his oral evidence he struck me as a parent struggling to demonstrate any emotional insight into the perspective of his daughter living in the midst of parents who struggled to communicate well. It was only in answer to some of my own questions did he begin to countenance the notion that his daughter may feel more comfortable saying different things to different parents.  He appeared to show some insight into the fact that he paid little regard to what the Mother had to say where he interpreted it as an attempt to undermine the parental role he had sought to secure.  Nonetheless, the underlying difficulties, which did not stop contact from continuing over a number of years, appears to have laid the foundations for the development of the problem in August 2020.</span></p>

C is likely to have reacted to her Mother&#8217;s discomfort, which prompted the Mother to query the source of the discomfort given the absence of evidence of rash.  She magnified the concern.  That is evident by her seeking advice from the GP in circumstances where there was no good reason to do so. In my judgment, this was playing into an established psychological dynamic. By the point of handover at contact, C had been put in the position of expecting an explanation from her Father for something which was now perceived to have been &#8220;wrong&#8221;.  Rather than mitigate the issue, in my judgment, it is probable that the Mother held the view that what he had done was wrong and it is this conduct, which then became distorted, magnified and eventually divorced from reality. C sought, in due course, the elusive &#8220;bit of paper&#8221; (therapy session, 19 March 2021 [F151]), which would justify not seeing her Father are not getting her Mother into trouble.  The cessation of contact, in these circumstances, would only have served to confirm that the Father had done something wrong, which meant that C was not safe to see him. The repetition, expansion and questioning of C involving the Mother, N and possibly the maternal grandmother (although the evidence as to that is extremely limited), together with K provided fertile ground for C&#8217;s own imagination to provide the stories to feed the investigation and justify Mother&#8217;s feelings towards the Father.</span></p>

GP advised not to apply cream any longer. Feels it could be a heat rash or sweat glands getting blocked, not concerned - no cream.  C went on a camper holiday with dad for 10 days. He said he developed the rash on holiday, which she accepted as very hot and been on the beach and camping. S saw no rash, but is there now.  S does not believe there has been any inappropriate touch, she was concerned as daughter very upset and distressed.  Whilst on holiday, was not allowed to speak to daughter, had two conversations, she feels this also caused distress.  C said that dad is shouting at her and not using her name keeps calling her Elly and does not like it.  I checked in regards to application of the cream &#8211; exterior of the body, in the buttocks, but she did not like it.&#8221;</span></p>

The Mother was plainly under threat of enforcement proceedings, as she had already faced enforcement proceedings, and her concerns about C&#8217;s relationship with her Father were sublimated to the issue of the application of cream.  I find that she failed reasonably to manage and reassure C but otherwise sought to encourage and expand the scope of the enquiry in the hope of justifying her breach of court order on account of the alleged presentation of C to her, which presentation was likely to have been a function of the Mother&#8217;s approach to the Father&#8217;s relationship with C.</span></p>

If there had been such a meeting then she suggested it would have been noted on their system, CPOMS.  It was not.  It was put to her that the Mother requested to speak to LM and brought C into school at which point C had threatened to gouge at her mouth on a piece of wire whilst waiting to go in.  It was asserted that LM took C and having spoken to her brought her back to reception.  It was further asserted that the Mother told her about the threat regarding the wire and LM had said words to the effect that C must not hurt herself.  In her oral evidence, LM said that she did not recall any such exchange with the Mother and C.  I find it inherently improbable that such a situation, if true, would not have been recorded and would not have been recalled by LM, who otherwise had some recollection of events. I find it improbable that the Mother&#8217;s account is accurate. What is evident, in my judgment, is the Mother&#8217;s willingness to present C&#8217;s behaviour as unmanageable.

From the Mother&#8217;s perspective, it has been used as a precursor to launch a wide ranging complaint about the relationship between C and the Father. In my judgment, it is likely that much of this is adult led and the Mother is a willing and encouraging proponent of this narrative.</span></p>

This intervention is illustrative of the Mother&#8217;s tendency to mislead and to exaggerate.  There is no reasonable explanation for her failure to tell the nurse that the context of the application for cream was a period of recurrent rash and the issue had been investigated and resolved by the local authority.  It is hardly surprising in that context that the nurse makes a safeguarding referral.  It also demonstrates the somewhat fluid changing description from the cream being put &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;in&#8221; the bottom.  I find that this is a further unjustified ratcheting up of the allegations.  This further illustrates the active engagement in the Mother in promoting the abuse narrative.</span></p>

However, the impact of the therapy was explained by her compellingly: telling a child they have been sexually abused by an important person comes with evident harm and risk. It is entirely possible for a child to believe that abuse happened.  There is no doubt that through therapy people can come to believe they experienced abuse that never happened and this can provide an explanation for the nature of the problems they experience [E86 at 5.26].

In terms of S, this has occurred on both a conscious and unconscious level. This view has been reinforced by S commissioning a private therapist who has simply accepted the allegations as truth and has sought to treat C in a trauma informed way, giving C the message that she requires help to manage difficult feelings and emotions. This therapeutic work will have further strengthened C&#8217;s beliefs that she has been abused. Thus, C is a victim of her Mother&#8217;s difficulties in permitting C to have a positive relationship with her Father. S is allowing this to happen, even if it is to C&#8217;s detriment in terms of the loss an important relationship and not attending school, to meet her own psychological needs.&#8221;</span></p>

I have seen that video.  The video is clearly addressed by C to  K.  She mixes water and PVA glue into a bowl. She feels it with her fingers. The Mother and N both make comments to her (&#8220;is it glue you want?&#8221;; &#8220;did you start with too much water?&#8221;).  C starts a second bowl with glue before adding the mixture from the first bowl slowly.  She is reassured not to worry about the time after C has checked for the second time.  Nobody is asking </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">what</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> she is trying to make or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">where it was that she saw, felt or touched it</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.  After 7 minutes, she is &#8220;nearly&#8221; happy with it and then the Mother puts a container of flour on the table, open, with a metal spoon which C proceeds to add to the mixture (7 min 37s). She touches it with her finger and thumb, rubbing them together and says &#8220;nearly&#8221;.  She appears to whisper to the Mother and there is a quiet comment by the Mother. C says it is &#8220;getting there&#8221; and passes the bowl to the Mother to test with her finger, who says, &#8220;is it the right sticky?  Have you checked it because you said you knew.&#8221;  C mixed it again in the bowl and there is more mixing but after more whispering, she says, &#8220;it needs to be less drippy&#8221; (10 min 12s).  C adds more flour but is still troubled as to whether it is &#8220;too drippy&#8221;.   She agrees that she is trying to make it &#8220;sticky but drier&#8221; when the Mother clarifies it with her (N says, &#8220;thicker?&#8221;).  Mother offers to get the flour out but C adds a large tablespoon of flour and says she is &#8220;getting there&#8221;.  She adds a small amount of water and says, &#8220;that&#8217;s it&#8221; (12 min 31s).  She adds more glue and tests it between her finger and thumb, rubbing them together.  She holds up a plastic mixing toy to the camera and says, &#8220;this is how sticky it was, it&#8217;s like glue but I think I need to add a little bit more water&#8221; (14 min 30s). She adds more water and mixes again.  Mother asks, if she is &#8220;nearly done&#8221;.  C again feels it on her finger and rubs it between her finger and thumb.  C says the skin looked like that, &#8220;sticky and slippery so like a mixture with water, glue and the right amount of stickiness [she giggles] except for when it dries up&#8221; (17 min 15s).   Mother then asks, &#8220;and what, what was this?  What have you made?&#8221;.  C responds, &#8220;I&#8217;ve made something I&#8217;m going to call &#8216;it&#8217;s messy stick&#8217; because it&#8217;s hard to make and it&#8217;s sticky and it is how it sticks that &#8216;It&#8217; had.  It feels just the right amount of stickiness that &#8216;It&#8217; felt&#8221; (17 min 56s). She confirms it is not too &#8220;sloshy&#8221;.  It ends with her using her arms like a clapper board and saying, with a smile on her face, &#8220;cut&#8221;.</span></p>

They spent 19 minutes recording the mixing bowl at the centre of the screen or the mixture on a plastic toy utensil or on C&#8217;s finger and thumb. Mother&#8217;s case [C204, paragraph 6] is that C had run out of time to do the third experiment with K (the texture of a substance that &#8216;came out of Daddy&#8217;) and K had suggested letting C complete the experiment in about 5 minutes at home. The Mother says that she &#8220;did not understand why she was doing it and didn&#8217;t understand what she wanted to show, so I said very little and left her to it. I concluded it was lotion of some kind, nothing more, quite possibly suncream as her Father often recorded in the contact book that he had put on lots of sun cream and he often asked about eczema cream, he also had eczema himself. She didn&#8217;t like the cream being applied. I have never said it was sperm and it was the professionals who came to this conclusion.&#8221; </span></p>

Research suggests that false memories lack sensory and other details. A study by Marche (2010) demonstrated that that when a person remembers something that actually happened, they have a richer memory experience. They recall the details more easily, more vividly and with greater confidence than when they remember something that did not occur. In considering the experiments that C wanted to do in terms of demonstrating the roughness of her Father&#8217;s lips and recreating a substance that she asserts &#8216;came out of dad&#8217;, these are things that are very easy to describe verbally. Given C&#8217;s cognitive profile I would not expect her to have any difficulty in explaining this, if it actually happened. When I watched this video, it felt very dramatic and theatrical and lacked authenticity. There was certainly no sense of this being traumatising for C. If a substance did really &#8216;come out of dad&#8217; I would expect other details to emerge, such as how C felt, details about smell and sound, what he did afterwards.&#8221;</span></p>

The audience was the Mother. C clearly wanted to please her by completing the experiment that she did not have time to complete withK. Allowing the video to continue to 19 minutes illustrates vividly that the Mother wished to encourage C to produce the right consistency of substance and it is, in my judgment, disingenuous of the Mother and N to suggest that they had no idea what substance she was seeking to make.  They showed a remarkable lack of curiosity.  In simple terms, I do not believe the Mother when she says that the parallel with semen did not cross her mind.  I find that she wanted C to evidence such a substance and the prolonged experiment and video recording was the means to promote that.</span></p>

The Father has provided a photograph of C on the beach purported to be taken on 24 July 2020 [C312] and 30 July 2020 [D326 &#8211; D327].  It is a busy beach populated with families and children.  In my judgment, it is an inherently improbable location to engage in such abuse particularly with the frequency and intensity alleged.  Within the snapshots, C appears happy.  She prepared a postcard to the Mother [D333], stating, &#8220;I am having the best time, love from C.&#8217;  I find it improbable that such a pattern of abuse would have occurred in such circumstances.  </span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s relationship with the maternal grandmother had become strained since April 2022 and the nature of their relationship has already been documented within the expert evidence. The Mother sought to suggest during her oral evidence that the maternal grandmother had given her cause to think that the maternal grandmother might have asked questions of C.  She recalled the phrase given by the maternal grandmother (6 February 2023), &#8220;add it up&#8221; in the context of the implication that the facts suggested that there was substance to the complaint against the Father.  I did not hear oral evidence from the maternal grandmother and am in no position to explore this issue beyond commenting upon what the Mother said as a possible source for the allegations made by C.  I have taken that into account.  However, there is sufficient evidence already before me about the process by which the Mother&#8217;s parenting has impacted the development of the allegations irrespective of any additional contribution which may have been made by the maternal grandmother, about which, it is impossible to do more than speculate.</span></p>

It is consistent with the overall picture of misdirection, misrepresentation and encouragement of the allegations allied to the ability of C to weave accounts together.

She was at pains to make clear that the interplay of issues were subtle and complex and provided a formulation driven account rather than simply attaching a label.  I do not regard the criticisms as to her psychometric testing or evaluation to be borne out. Overall, she focused on important elements of the history, clinical interview and her own testing to formulate a psychological model to explain the underlying functioning of the Mother, C and the Father. Her analysis, when set alongside the factual and expert evidence I have considered, is, in fact, properly grounded and helpful.  I accept the broad thrust of her conclusions and weigh them accordingly.</span></p>

The undoubted influence resides there.  Her key relationship is with her Mother.  From my review of the evidence, it is the Mother who occupies centre stage.  My assessment of her was of a witness, at one level, capable of recognising limited responsibility through the impact of her anxiety, lack of control and the &#8220;fact/ fiction&#8221; excuse but also combative and detailed in rejecting other accounts.  I am satisfied that she has been instrumental in the encouragement of the allegations in a myriad of ways centred around the psychological functioning of her relationship with C.  Her misgivings about the Father took sway and C fell into line over time, acting and reacting to the need to justify not seeing her Father and making sure that her Mother would not get into trouble for doing so.

The expert professionals have recommended childhood therapy for C which would need to be in a neutral setting and not in the care of her Mother (answered by Dr Ravenscroft within the additional questions). Even it is found that C has been sexually abused and her Mother has not alienated her then the Local Authority would still have concerns surrounding the enmeshed relationship which appears to be a key concern. The Local Authority have had concerns regarding S&#8217;s handling of the situation therefore the separation would be in C&#8217;s best interest so she can have a safe space to heal from her experiences.</span></p>

She is a child who will continually be exposed to harmful parenting as outlined within expert reports filed to Court. Whilst we cannot determine what &#8220;normal&#8221; is to each individual, we can refer to the welfare checklist and in considering this, and C&#8217;s experiences, there is evidence she is at risk of suffering and likely to continue to suffer ongoing emotional harm in the care of her Mother.</span></p>

I echo my previous comments about the need for the local authority properly to resource and ensure that there is, particularly in the early weeks, an high level of social work intervention and an higher level than is currently proposed.  It is vital that the IRO keeps a careful eye on the development of the plan so that progress can be made for both the Mother, the Father and C.  The Mother occupies a central role in C&#8217;s life and, over time, it is vital that she builds her insight into the impact of her patterns of behaviour upon the events which have unfolded and demonstrates responsibility for them.  The Father must also understand that he will need to become and remain acutely aware of the sensitivities from C&#8217;s perspective of what she regards as her lived experience.  </span></p>

C needs her family, supported by the local authority, to help her recover from the trauma of the last 2 &#189; years. I am clear that it is necessary and proportionate for a care order to be made so that the local authority are able to share parental responsibility and take decisions required to promote her welfare. In doing so, I acknowledge that the plan is removal from the care of the Mother and placement with foster carers. I approve that plan.</span></p>

She is a bright and delightful girl and I remain convinced that both parents have much to offer her.</span></p>
