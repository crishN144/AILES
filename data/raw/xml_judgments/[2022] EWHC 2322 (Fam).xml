On any analysis the relationship was highly acrimonious from what appears to be an early stage with numerous abusive messages passing between them, some of which I will refer to below. The F lived throughout in California. The M owns a property in Oklahoma, was born in H and has moved on a number of occasions. According to the chronology, she moved to Oklahoma in May 2019.</p>

It seems to me that when a Court has before it the issue of who shall be accorded custody of a child, and awards interim custody to one of the parents in the course of dealing with that issue, it has rights relating to the care and control of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child&#8217;s place of residence. It has long been established that a Court may be a body or institution capable of caring for the person of a child. As I explained in E. (Mrs) v. Eve [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388, the Court of Chancery has long exercised wardship over children in need of protection in the exercise of its parens patriae jurisdiction. But I see no need to rely on jurisdiction emanating from this doctrine, which has understandably &#8216;puzzled and concerned&#8217; other contracting parties . . .&#8221;</span></p>

First of all the application to the Court must raise matters of custody within the meaning of the Convention and that will require in every case a consideration of the terms of the D application. Secondly, a question arises as to the time at which the Court acquires such right. It is clear that the interpretation which has been accepted of the Convention which allows the possibility of a Court having rights of custody does not contemplate that happening unless there is an application to the Court in a particular case raising the issue of the custody of one or more children. The date at which such application confers these rights is a matter which has not been the subject of detailed consideration ^ in relation to the Convention.

The fact that there is a condition precedent to the making of the order does not mean the Court is not seised. He draws an analogy with the need under the CA for section 10 CA to be crossed before a section 8 order can be made; or that Court cannot make a care order until threshold is crossed. These requirements do not mean that the Court is not seised of the matter.</p>

The mischief that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H</span> and subsequent cases were seeking to deal with was where the left behind parent did not have legal rights of custody but was in the process of obtaining them through the home Court. If such an interpretation was not adopted, then the abducting parent would be incentivised to flee the jurisdiction before the Court made orders. However, in my view, it must be the case that the court is materially engaged in the issue of rights of custody. For that reason, I agree with Ms Langdale that the Court needs to have before it an application (in whatever form) that would allow it to make an order concerning rights of custody.

The F&#8217;s application for a paternity order does not itself relate to or establish rights of custody, so that application alone would not have allowed the Court to give the F rights of custody. This was Ms Henson&#8217;s clear view, and she is the single joint expert on Oklahoma law.  I do not accept Mr Sampson&#8217;s argument that I should not consider paternity to be a condition precedent, and that an analogy with the need to establish threshold before a care order can be made.

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be real. It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as grave. Although grave characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as grave while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.

Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent.&#8221;</span></p>

However, in my view, it is not necessary for me to consider that part of the evidence in any detail. The more obvious, immediate and in some ways less contentious issue, is that if I order the return of the child to California then there is a very significant possibility that he will be separated from his mother for a prolonged period and quite possibly irrevocably. That in my view would be a grave risk of psychological harm and place him in an intolerable situation. </p>

Doubtless he takes this stance because he believes it to be in the child&#8217;s best interests. It is not impossible that he will change that position in the future, and he may accept professional advice. However, there can be no doubt that if I ordered XX to return to the USA to the care of his F, then as matters stand at the moment, the F would take steps to ensure a complete cessation of any contact, even letterbox contact, with the M.</p>

This means that it is very unlikely as matters stand that the M will go to California, and her ability to fight for custody or even access to XX will be very limited. I note that the F, most unusually in these cases, does not put forward any protective measures for the M to accompany XX and does not suggest that he will seek to withdraw any allegations against the M or to persuade the police or the Courts to lift the arrest warrant. </p>

In any event, to separate a child from his primary carer, being the only parent he has known in any caring sense and then to send him to a parent who he has only had limited contact with is a very significant step, certainly in a summary process. I would be severing his links to his M for a very long time, if not irrevocably. This is particularly the case given the arrest warrant and the intense difficulties the M is likely to have fighting the F for contact/custody in California. </p>

(ii) The test is essentially a factual one which should not be overlaid with legal sub-rules or glosses. It must be emphasised that the factual inquiry must be centred throughout on the circumstances of the child's life that is most likely to illuminate his habitual residence (A v A, In re L). (iii) In common with the other rules of jurisdiction in Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;) its meaning is &#8220;shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity&#8221;. Proximity in this context means &#8220;the practical connection between the child and the country concerned&#8221;: A v A, para 80(ii); In re B, para 42, applying Mercredi v Chaffe (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-497/10PPU" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-497/10PPU</ref>) EU:C:2010:829; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] Fam 22" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] Fam 22</ref>, para 46. (iv) It is possible for a parent unilaterally to cause a child to change habitual residence by removing the child to another jurisdiction without the consent of the other parent (In re R). (v) A child will usually but not necessarily have the same habitual residence as the parent(s) who care for him or her (In re LC). The younger the child the more likely the proposition, however, this is not to eclipse the fact that the investigation is child focused. It is the child's habitual residence which is in question and, it follows the child's integration which is under consideration. (vi) Parental intention is relevant to the assessment, but not determinative (In re L, In re R and In re B). (vii) It will be highly unusual for a child to have no habitual residence. Usually a child lose a pre-existing habitual residence at the same time as gaining a new one (In re B). (viii) In assessing whether a child has lost a pre-existing habitual residence and gained a new one, the Court must weigh up the degree of connection which the child had with the state in which he resided before the move (In re B &#8212;see in particular the guidance at para 46). (ix) It is the stability of a child's residence as opposed to its permanence which is relevant, though this is qualitative and not quantitative, in the sense that it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than a mere measurement of the time a child spends there (In re R and earlier in In re L and Mercredi). (x) The relevant question is whether a child has achieved some degree of integration in social and family environment; it is not necessary for a child to be fully integrated before becoming habitually resident (In re R) (emphasis added). (xi) The requisite degree of integration can, in certain circumstances, develop quite quickly (article 9 of Brussels IIA envisages within three months). It is possible to acquire a new habitual residence in a single day (A v A; In re B). In the latter case Lord Wilson JSC referred (para 45) to those &#8220;first roots&#8221; which represent the requisite degree of integration and which a child will &#8220;probably&#8221; put down &#8220;quite quickly&#8221; following a move. (xii) Habitual residence was a question of fact focused upon the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or indefinitely (In re R). (xiii) The structure of Brussels IIA, and particularly recital (12) to the Regulation, demonstrates that it is in a child's best interests to have an habitual residence and accordingly that it would be highly unlikely, albeit possible (or, to use the term adopted in certain parts of the judgment, exceptional), for a child to have no habitual residence; As such, &#8220;if interpretation of the concept of habitual residence can reasonably yield both a conclusion that a child has an habitual residence and, alternatively, a conclusion that he lacks any habitual residence, the Court should adopt the former&#8221; (In re B supra).&#8221;</span></p>

Thus, the party seeking a stay must show not only that England is not the natural and appropriate forum but that there is another available forum that is clearly and distinctly more appropriate;</p>

Connecting factors will include not only matters of convenience and expense but also factors such as the relevant law governing the proceedings and the places where the parties reside;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.59in">If the Court concludes, having regard to the foregoing matters, that another forum is more suitable than England, it should normally grant a stay unless the other party can show that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. In determining this, the Court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including those which go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Again, I consider the answer to this issue to be straightforward. Firstly, Mr Sampson accepts that if one narrows the issue to the determination of the care proceedings, then England must be the most convenient forum. They are English proceedings, with an English local authority as the applicant. However, even if one considers the issue to be simply that of where XX should live and with whom, in my view it is plain that the answer remains England. XX is living and settled with carers in England. Therefore, any assessment of him and his welfare will turn on evidence of what is happening in England. Any English social worker or equivalent is in a far better position to assist the Court than anyone in California. His mother is in England and effectively cannot travel to California because of the arrest warrant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The only participant in these proceedings who is in California is the Father. The decision as to where XX is to live is between the two jurisdictions but, on the basis that decision is yet to be made, I can see no argument that the Californian Court is in a better position to decide than the English Court. Therefore, I reject Mr Sampson&#8217;s application for a stay and a transfer of proceedings to California. </p>
