The neurology report, dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022, does not suggest that XFR&#8217;s recent symptoms are representative of a new neurological problem.

She will certainly lose the Child Benefit of &#163;94.46 pcm.  On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2022, XFR was assessed as having limited capacity to work.  The Welfare Rights Unit advised the wife to make a claim for Universal Credit for XFR in XFR&#8217;s name. The reasoning for this step was to avoid any gap in the wife&#8217;s Universal Credit reducing and XFR&#8217;s Universal Credits starting.  On this basis it is likely that XFR would receive Universal Credit of &#163;619.59 pcm and W, &#163;201.69 pcm.  It is also likely, on my reading of the report, that the wife would continue to receive Carer&#8217;s Allowance of &#163;302.03 pcm, but this is subject to complicated rules such as the wife providing at least 35 hours care for XFR a week, with the week running from Sunday to the following Saturday at midnight.  I was not addressed about whether this would affect the direct payments from the local City Council for personal assistants or annual respite care.  The figure calculated by the City Council for the last year was &#163;45,610.79.  The monies must be used as directed and what remains unspent returned to the Council.  The wife will also continue to receive some part of the Personal Independence Payment.  It should be paid as normal for the first 9 weeks, giving her &#163;400.40 pcm.  Thereafter, the wife is able to claim back those days XFR is at home, but such payments are paid in arrears.</p>

The author of the report, Ms Kate Morrison, felt unable to attend court to give evidence, but I am grateful to her for her assistance.  I repeat there is a good deal of uncertainty as to how the detail of all this will unfold and what it will mean for XFR and the wife going forward.</p>

It includes Child Benefit; the mobility component payable directly for the car; ongoing Personal Independence Payment (non-mobility) which will reduce from January 2022; or that it has yet been established the wife is entitled to the Limited Capability for Work Related Activity Element. The differences in the interpretation of the report simply underscores the point I made in the previous paragraph.</p>

If the wife were to start working, her earnings would reduce her Council Tax Support.  An earnings taper would also affect the Universal Credit for earned income and/or periodical payments payable to her. I have previously found the purchase of the Skoda car, using the mobility element of the Personal Independent Payment, to be reasonable.</p>
