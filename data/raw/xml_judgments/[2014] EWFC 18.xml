Even now, the parents remain on bail and the Crown Prosecution Service has not reached a decision about whether either of them should face criminal charges, nor is there any sign of when it will do so.  </span></p>

In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of her two children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother&#8217;s two other children had experienced apparent life threatening events taking a similar form. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions. There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation. In the course of his judgment, Judge LJ (as he then was) observed: &#8220;What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then, any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

At paragraph 10, he observed: &#8220;A temptation there described is ever present in Family proceedings too and, in my judgment, should be as firmly resisted there as the courts are required to resist it in criminal law. In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities.</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of nonaccidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

His behaviour since being arrested shows him in an extremely poor light, but it does not mean that he was responsible for K&#8217;s injuries.  He has been described, including by the mother, as treating both children well in the past.  He was nonetheless an unimpressive witness.  His evidence was frequently scarcely audible.  He showed himself to be an immature and self-centred man with little sense of the wider responsibilities of parenting.  Where there was emotion, it was largely in the form of anger towards the mother for trying to keep control of his wage packet.  In contrast, there was very little emotional coherency or convincing detail to his account of the events surrounding K&#8217;s collapse.  I formed the impression that he was fundamentally incurious about why it had happened.  His recent allegations against the mother were not motivated by his stated concern for A, but were instead a response to what he sees as unfair treatment by the local authority and resentment towards the mother and her family, who he sees as having got the better of him.  This is not to say that there may not be some truth in his account of the mother having been violent towards him: he may not have the imagination to have invented some of the details.</span></p>

On the second occasion, which was minutes before 8.00 am on Monday 11 July, the father struck K&#8217;s head against a hard surface with enough violence to fracture his skull and cause fatal brain injuries.  At that point he realised that K had been hurt, but instead of seeking help, he put him into his Moses basket in the bedroom, hoping that all would be well and determined to conceal what he had done.</span></p>

On the crucial question of whether, at that moment, he thought there was something seriously wrong with K, his evidence was confused and inconsistent.

There was inconsistency of personnel and zero protection for A under a child protection plan.  Having sent her home, there was a repeated failure to review the position.  I am staggered by the police evidence that by their own agency they disagreed that there were child protection problems [when, following receipt of the report of Dr Ward Platt, they retained it for several months].  They did not give other agencies or the parents a chance to take a view.  A has been lost since K's death.  The agencies were pro-sympathetic to the parents.  Had anyone sought legal advice at the outset, A would have known what her permanent arrangements are by now.  She would have been established with no repeat breakdowns and with certainty for her and for the parents.  Instead, she is now nearly 5 and faces great uncertainty and possible further disruptions to her life.</span></p>

The President's Guidance is of assistance as providing the starting point, but it does not determine the outcome.  The rights of all individuals and of the public have to be examined.  In this case, a good deal of information about the family is already in the public domain as result of the criminal trial, and as a result the family described in these proceedings will inevitably be identifiable.  However, I am satisfied on the direct evidence of the social worker that publication is unlikely to be harmful to child A, who is well-supported by her mother and a group of professionals.  For her part, the mother would wish it to be on record that she has been exonerated of responsibility for K's death.  Publication will undoubtedly have an effect on the father, but not, in my judgement, to a degree that outweighs the public interest in knowing what this court has concluded.  In a case of this seriousness, there is a very strong public interest in being informed of the decisions that are made in its name, both in the particular case and generally.  There is also the consideration that the Coroner's inquest, a public process, is yet to be held.  The parties have also reported that a serious case review by the Local Safeguarding Children Board and a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission are shortly due to be published. </span></p>
