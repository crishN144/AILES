The local authority applies for public law orders in respect of Z who is A&#8217;s maternal half sibling born in June 2023; Z is the mother&#8217;s fourth child and D&#8217;s first child. The application is made against a background of concerns around neglect of A and his older siblings, B and C, who now live with their father (&#8220;F&#8221;).

The mother was due to start her shift at a local restaurant at 12.00 noon. D arrived back at the property at 11.51 am and at 11.54 the mother and D left A alone at home whilst the mother was driven to work. D returned to the address and after a short break attended a remote meeting with colleague. A played by himself in his bedroom until later, when D found him inside a bedside cabinet. He was unresponsive and D drove him to the hospital where attempts at resuscitating him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead. Police conveyed the mother to the hospital where she was reunited with A after being informed of the terrible events of that day.</span></p>

During the investigations, B and C were interviewed and raised allegations of abuse against D and further alleged that the mother was aware of D&#8217;s treatment of the children. On or about September 2022, the mother fell pregnant with Z and in October of the same year D and the mother moved to their current address. Before his birth, in November 2022, Z was made the subject of a multiagency CPP. On 23 June 2023, the local authority applied for public law orders in respect of Z, who was subsequently placed in the interim care of the local authority and removed to foster care, where he continues to reside. The matter has since progressed to this hearing before me where I am tasked with determining the local authority&#8217;s allegations against D and the mother.</span></p>

All members of this family, including the extended family members, have suffered a significant loss that has, and will continue to have a profound effect on them. It is inevitable that this will impact on their approach, their interactions, and memories of key events. There is no uniformity of expected behaviour in individuals who face the reality of such loss and different individuals may react differently in the face of such tragedy.

The professional observations and reports on the children spoke to the positive contributions that D was making in supporting the mother and the children. Such was the improvement, that in January 2021, the relevant local authority closed its case. The evidence in this regard is highly informative of the background to this family and must be weighed into the balance when considering the totality of the evidence that is before the court. </span></p>

Whilst both mother and D sought to suggest that this was in part in the furtherance of an agreement that the mother and F reached on their separation and the general culture expectation of older boys living with their father, the evidence is clear that the fundamental reasons for the two oldest children&#8217;s return to their father was mother&#8217;s and D&#8217;s inability to cope with all three children, that included financial pressures within the home where the mother was required to work and D was undertaking his self-financed studies. </span></p>

There was a significant passage of time before the children were interviewed. There was no &#8216;truth or lies&#8217; exercise undertaken with the children nor was there any attempt at establishing the children&#8217;s understanding of timing and duration. Finally, DC McKenna was given little background information about the family to provide her with important context to better assess and engage with the children. Whilst I do not accept that these failures are catastrophic, in the absence of corroborating evidence, extreme caution needs to be exercised before placing any reliance on the evidence of the two children. </span></p>

They each stated that the decision to leave A was made under some pressure as the mother was running late for work, A was playing on the iPad, which caused D to become angry, this having previously been an issue.

The mother&#8217;s explanation that D would call if &#8216;something happened&#8217; showed no concern for A whatsoever. More puzzling still, was her unsuccessful attempts at calling D later to ask for help with a delivery at the restaurant without having A in mind. After starting her shift, the next occasion that she spoke to D was in hospital after A was pronounced dead. Tragically, the last time she saw her son alive was when she left him, alone, at home. </span></p>

Before attending his prearranged video meeting that commenced at 12.43, D prepared a snack and rested. He clarified his evidence during his oral testimony that in material parts contradicted his earlier statements, he checked on A about twenty or thirty minutes after the meeting started. He was unable to give any meaningful detail about A on this first check, save that he was sitting in the cabinet playing with his Lego. D further stated that, on the second occasion he looked into the room on the way back from the bathroom, but he didn&#8217;t see A. D accepted that this was not an adequate check. The meeting then ended at 14.06. As D explained in his oral testimony, at this point he went to the kitchen to prepare lunch without first checking on A. D then entered the room to check on A to find the cabinet face down and, as he lifted and turned the cabinet, he discovered A inside. He pulled him out and attempted to resuscitate him. He demonstrated his actions using the same cabinet, as produced by West Midlands Police, during his oral testimony. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Furthermore, they point to the &#8216;exculpatory evidence&#8217; which includes D&#8217;s colleague&#8217;s account whilst in the meeting, D&#8217;s cooperation with the police investigations, CCTV showing D hurrying to hospital and D&#8217;s initial account to the police. These are well founded submissions that I agree with and must be actively taken into account when considering the evidential balance. Moreover, I must consider the inherent probability or improbability of D confining A in the bedside cabinet. In my judgment there is no evidence that would support a finding that D confined A in the cabinet and to make such a finding would stretch the permissible evidential boundaries beyond breaking point. However, for reasons that I have set out above, I find that D has not provided a complete or reliable account of the events of this day. I further find that the sad and tragic circumstances leading to A&#8217;s death was caused by D&#8217;s gross neglect of A.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In their submissions, Mr Bagchi KC and Mr Wilson raise a number of concerns about the attitude of the mother and D. These include the mother&#8217;s lack of engagement with D&#8217;s actions; the conduct and treatment of the three oldest children, including the events leading to A&#8217;s death; the mother&#8217;s inability or unwillingness to engage with the allegations that B and C have made; and D&#8217;s general conduct that includes the inconsistencies in his evidence. They also point to D&#8217;s inconsistent accounts, honesty, and lack of insight into the scale of his neglectful parenting. In my judgment, these are entirely well founded and justified observations of the conduct and attitude of these two adults. </span></p>

Whilst I accept that there may be cultural reasons for Z&#8217;s parents to wish to marry in China and to give birth to Z in China, this assertion was, in my judgment, an attempt to divert attention away from the primary wish and purpose of the arrangements, which was to avoid professional involvement in Z by relocating to China. </span></p>
