At all times during the deputyship AH&#8217;s liquid assets were less than &#163;16 000 but her total assets, including a property in which she lives, were substantially higher. The deputyship order includes authorisation to seek SCCO assessment but makes no explicit reference to the size or nature of AH&#8217;s estate. The Applicant contends that it is entitled to rely on the authorisation in its deputyship order to seek SCCO assessment of its costs. In the event that the Court does not agree, the Applicant seeks retrospective authority to obtain SCCO assessment. </p>

KB explained that currently [P&#8217;s grandson] was managing them, but that it had been made clear by P&#8217;s daughters that this situation was unacceptable to them. As far as they were concerned it needed to be formalised and they wanted it to be either themselves or, in the alternative a panel deputy. Confirmed that the Council&#8217;s view was that a Panel would be appropriate as it would be independent from the Council and due to the complaints this was preferable, equally it would be independent from each of the family members, and that due to disagreements between the family this would be appropriate. If necessary the Council were prepared to make the relevant application. </span></p>

When P is living in a property there are the ordinary day to day management issues which can indeed usually be arranged to operate smoothly (by direct debits etc) but there may also be one-off or sustained issues which require a lot of management decisions (eg urgent repairs, dispute as to title or interest, adaptations to meet increasing needs, sale for &#8216;downsizing&#8217;).  </p>

In my judgment, that argument is not persuasive. It still requires the order to be construed &#8211; until that change of circumstances &#8211; as meaning the opposite of its plain words. Moreover, it seems to me rather perverse to argue at once both that the plain words of the order when made do not have any practical meaning because the quantification of the deputy&#8217;s costs should be restricted to protect AH&#8217;s occupation of her home; but also that an authority to seek more generous quantification of costs would be effective when P&#8217;s house is sold.

Additionally, the deputy should check the terms of the costs authorisation carefully on first receipt of the order. If it includes the option of SCCO assessment but does not expressly confirm that such authorisation applies even where the net estate is worth less than &#163;16 000 for the purposes of paragraph 12 of Practice Direction 19B, the deputy should make a speedy COP9 application pursuant to Rule 13.4 of the Court of Protection Rules 2017 for reconsideration.

In order to avoid the need for proceedings of this type in the future, where a deputy is appointed in respect of such an estate but with authority to seek SCCO assessment of their costs, the authorisation should explicitly state that it applies in the context of such an estate.
