I refused permission to appeal on a number of other grounds, including the suspended change of residence and the change of surname.  I am asked, today, to reconsider my decision on the surname and I have declined to do so.  There is no notice given to other parties of this request; it would be unreasonable for me to consider it in those circumstances, and in any event, I would decline to do so on its merits.  That said, it does not cease as a point to be of some relevance, as I will explain in a moment.</p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.42in">The background to the matter is that the parents lived together, that is the father Mr A and the mother, Mrs K as she now is, from 2003 until 2011.  There was, I am told, an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile in 2012, but by early 2013 the mother was in a relationship with Mr K and they have subsequently married.  They have one child and they are expecting another soon.  Mr K has a couple of daughters by his previous marriage.</p>

It is a very sad fact that since 2013, almost without cease, the parties have been involved in litigation so that there has been five years of the most conflicted litigation with H at the centre of it.</p>

The father has been much criticised in this litigation for his failure to accept those findings, and it is plain that he still does not accept them, certainly the bulk of them.</p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.42in">In 2014, the mother and Mr K took the preparatory steps before they issued, in early 2015, an application to adopt H.  It is clear from the documents that I have seen, that they sought to extinguish the father&#8217;s parental responsibility for H and remove him from any role in her life.</p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.42in">In the normal way a Guardian was appointed, Ms C, as the reporting officer.  I am told that without meeting the father, Ms C reported that the adoption should be granted, consent dispensed with, and that there should be no contact to Mr A.  By the time that Ms C had reported, she had already seen the mother.  It is part of the father&#8217;s complaint that Ms C was appointed as Guardian in the subsequent Children Act proceedings.  It is no reflection on her, but I can easily understand how to the father there would be a perception that her mind was already made up.  If there are to be further proceedings, and I am absolutely not encouraging them, but if there are to be further proceedings I would respectfully suggest that consideration be given to the appointment of another Guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.42in">It took until mid-2016, and a number of hearings, before Mr and Mrs K withdrew their application.  By then, the father says, much damage had been done, and H had been encouraged to call Mr K &#8220;daddy,&#8221; and her father by his first name.  I have to say that from my judicial perspective the application for the adoption order was misconceived, and in the context of this case, unfortunate.  The father says that by 2016 any idea of contact between H and her father had been never actively encouraged by the mother.  That is evidenced by a number of things, including the use of his first name by this still young child as the appropriate way to refer to her father, and the use of K as a surname.  An assessment of the father&#8217;s personality was prepared by Dr B, who deemed him no risk, and certainly I have read nothing to suggest that H is at any physical risk from the father.</p>

She said that she would be unable to regulate her emotions sufficiently to even consider this to be possible.  Nevertheless, despite this deeply unpromising start, the therapists were able to facilitate three periods of contact between November 2016 and January 2017, which apparently all went well.  The therapeutic involvement extended into play therapy and what is described as Equine Facilitated Therapy. The contact reports were favourable, as the judge accepted, but they broke down when, first, in February 2017 and then in May 2017, H refused to get out of the car to see her father.  Thus, January 2017 has been the last occasion when there has been successful face-to-face contact between father and daughter.</p>

The father says this is unsurprising and is the result of four to five years&#8217; hostility towards him from Mr and Mrs K.</p>

At the hearing, the father sought a variety of orders, including a change of name so as to make it clear that H&#8217;s surname was his surname; a suspended change of residence; contact orders; and therapeutic intervention by the Family Separation Clinic.  Judge Dowding, in her very long and careful judgment, started off at para.11, setting out the fundamental legal principles, and she said this:</p>

Thirdly, the father may be permitted to send monthly letters, cards and occasional gifts, and that Mr and Mrs K were to encourage but are not required, to compel H to reciprocate.  The father&#8217;s application for a suspended change of residence and for psychological assessments was refused.</p>

I refused permission on other grounds, and since I have criticised Mr and Mrs K for their adoption application, it is right that I should also criticise the father in respect of his application for a suspended residence order, which was, in my view, unrealistic, and would have led only to heighten the anxiety of Mrs K and H.</p>

Skype contact is not taking place as frequently as the judge had hoped and anticipated, and Mrs A&#8217;s contact has not happened.  She is 79; she has breathing difficulties; travel is not easy for her; she lives in South London; Mr and Mrs K live-in the Birmingham area; they require Mrs A to travel up to their area, and they refuse to let her see H unsupervised.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of this; I have only the account given to me on behalf of the father.  But I would just say this: I urge Mr and Mrs K and Mrs A to break this deadlock which is so obviously contrary to H&#8217;s interests.  If Mrs A is not able to travel to H&#8217;s area, then Mr and Mrs K should take it upon themselves to meet her in her area.</p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.42in">The problem in this case is that there has been five years of litigation, huge ill will, multiple attempts at therapeutic interventions, the involvement of many professionals, and a complete lack of progress, and H has been caught in the middle of this conflict.  It is not easy to see the way forward.  H, inevitably, has sided with those with whom she is living.  I need only remind Mr and Mrs K, and I am sure they are very aware of this, that H is the daughter of Mr A, and they owe it to her to promote him in a positive light.  Sooner or later, if they do not do so, it is likely to come back and bite them.  H plainly knows that Mr A is her biological father.  </p>

I put this point to Ms Wiley and she did not flinch from saying that there would have to be a re-hearing of the factual basis of why it is that H is so resistant to contact.  The judge found that a deeply unattractive solution, and I agree with her.  The prospect of yet more highly conflictual litigation between these parents, with H in the middle, would in all probability be deeply damaging to H and cause further difficulty in her resuming a relationship with her father. </p>

There are a number of very solid reasons for that, including the fact that I have seen no-one, in this case, other than Mr A, sitting quietly in front of me, while counsel speaks on his behalf.  I can see no basis on which I could or should find that the judge was wrong.</p>

	      <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.42in">I need to add this: I have read and considered position statements on behalf of Mr and Mrs K and the Guardian.  Mrs K is now expecting another child, due in or around November 2018 no doubt to her great and understandable delight.  Of course, I hope all goes very well.  Inevitably, this is a time of nervousness as well as excitement in the K family.  I would do H no favours if I was to add to the tension by ordering a re-hearing of facts and another round of litigation.  That is another reason why I think such a course would be counter-productive.  But, with respect to Mr and Mrs K, they should not feel, and I have no idea whether they will or will not, that their family, with the arrival of the new baby, is complete, and there is no room in it for Mr A.  He is, and remains, H&#8217;s father, and has a role in her life as such.  It is incumbent upon them to encourage the Skype contact and to encourage H to reply to communications from the father, however briefly, even if it is just a card, saying, &#8220;thank you.&#8221;</p>
