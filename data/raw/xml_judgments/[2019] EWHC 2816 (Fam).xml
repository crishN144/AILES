It is unnecessary for me to set out any of those matters.  Mr Rushbrooke QC, who appears with Mr Munby on behalf of W, accepts that if the representations were found to be made and were known to be untrue by W then they could amount to a fraudulent representation, albeit not actionable for reasons to which I will come. For the purposes of this application I have to assume that H can prove the ingredients of fraudulent misrepresentation on which he relies although it is important that I record that W denies them. </p>

Since 1962 there have been many such actions, most commonly in my experience, arising from negligence, in particular when one spouse has been injured by the careless driving of the other.  Actions for the tort of deceit arise but rarely and in particular paternity fraud cases are few and far between.  Indeed, the first reported action was not until 2000 and arose between two former unmarried cohabitees.  The researches of counsel have revealed there has never been reported such a claim in the High Court between husband and wife. </p>

How I am to do that calculation is unclear.  I then make an actual calculation of the value of the various gifts (as yet unidentified) which H has given W excluding from that value any benefit that H may have received from them.   </p>

If it is impossible for the court to calculate the value to be attributed to the benefit of the child, so as to set off such value against the financial cost of the child&#8217;s upbringing as a matter of legal policy in tort, how is the task possible for a court if such loss results from a breach of contract?  Added to this is the sense, reflected in the judgments in Rees and MacFarlane, that it is morally unacceptable to regard a child as a financial liability.   </span></p>

I agree with Mr Gruder that the fact that damages may be difficult to assess is not a reason for saying the liability does not exist, but this long passage of my judgment illustrates why the route that the husband invites me to take is so plainly inappropriate.  Even if I was wrong about the difficulty of quantifying damage or the credit H must give for the benefits received, I would still come to the same conclusion about the inappropriateness of the remedy he seeks. </p>

I have not had updated cost estimates covering the many parts of their claims that are not before me on this application, but bearing in mind the litigation in all three divisions of the high court and what I can recall of previous cost statements, I would be surprised if there was much change between them from &#163;3 million.

She has been the successful party in the proceedings and, as such, she is entitled to her costs.  Mr Gruder&#8217;s suggestion that I should park the issue until the financial remedy proceedings are concluded and I have heard the evidence is an unattractive argument.  I have to deal with the matter now and I will be in a better position to deal with it now than I will be at a later stage, or at least in no worse a position.  In fact, if I did put the matter off and there had to be another hearing, there would be Mr Gruder and Mr Munby arguing the same points as they have argued in front of me today, with the consequent additional cost.   </p>

My view is that costs should be ordered on a standard basis.  This is not a classic fraud case.  This is a case where in fact I have not come to any conclusions about the underlying subject matter of the action, namely whether or not the wife has misled the husband in relation to the paternity of C.   </p>

The husband has not lost on all the points argued before me and nor has the wife covered herself in glory in some of the answers that she has given to questions that have been asked of her in the proceedings.  All these factors point to an order on the standard basis. </p>

In my judgment, it is right that there should be a deduction, principally for the reasons that have been articulated in front of me, namely that a considerable amount of time has been spent on an issue (whether the tort of deceit can exist between husband and wife in intimate matters) on which the wife has not succeeded.  There is no doubt that argument will have increased the costs to some extent.  Secondly, it is fair to say that the husband has succeeded in flushing out an element of the case in which the wife has been less than honest and, thirdly, that some, but a small element of the material that has come out in these proceedings will be of use in the financial remedy proceedings.   </p>

It seems to me that the only people who would benefit from it would be the costs draftsmen.  This is one of those cases where it is simply not possible to identify and cost an issue as a discrete issue.  It is very different from those cases where perhaps there is a major argument about the valuation of a particular asset where it is easy to hive off the relevant costs but that does not apply in this case.   </p>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">I come now to the question of payment on account.  The rules are clear: I shall order a party to pay a reasonable sum on account of costs unless there is good reason not to do so, and there is no good reason for me not to do so.  Mr Gruder perfectly properly raises the issue that a large amount of the wife&#8217;s costs will be challenged as being necessary or proportionate and I bear that in mind.   </p>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.08in">I calculate the sum that I will order as follows, starting with figures net of VAT:  of her bill of &#163;376,000 costs, I reduce the figure by 80 per cent, which produces a figure of &#163;300,800.  I then for the purposes of a payment on account order that the husband pays what I calculate as 55 per cent.  That is a relatively modest percentage if, as the parties agree, the wife can expect to recover 70 to 75 per cent, which produces a figure of &#163;165,400, to which I then add VAT, which brings a figure of just under &#163;199,000.  I am going to round it to &#163;200,000.  Therefore, I shall order that the husband pays &#163;200,000 inclusive of VAT on account of costs, and I gain such comfort as I can from the fact that if I have in any sense overshot the mark, which I think is very unlikely, then that is something that can be ironed out in due course.  Whatever the outcome of the financial remedies&#8217; litigation, the wife will be in a position to make any refund of funds that may be necessary.   </p>
