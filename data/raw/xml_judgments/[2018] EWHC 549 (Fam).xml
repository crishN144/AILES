It now falls to me to sentence him for that contempt. The proceedings before me also extend to allegations of contempt against Mr Hart&#8217;s sister, Susan Byrne and a company that Mr Hart controls through his sister, Halesowen Estates Limited. However, it has been necessary to adjourn the proceedings relating to Mrs Byrne and that company; there is no suggestion that I should adjourn this exercise until conclusion of the proceedings relating to those others and I accept that there is no reason to do so.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">The issues that led to this hearing arise in the aftermath of divorce proceedings in which I found that Mr and Mrs Hart had total wealth of &#163;9.375 million pounds. Thus, they are rich and privileged people. In a judgment and order dated 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> June 2015, I divided their wealth as to 38%, or about &#163;3.5 million, to Mrs Hart with the balance remaining with Mr Hart. As part of the provision that I ordered in favour of Mrs Hart within the proceedings, I directed that shares held for Mr Hart in a company called Drakestown Properties Limited should be transferred to her. The shares have been transferred to her and so she is now the owner of that company. The company, which owns two estates of industrial units in the West Midlands, amounted to a substantial part of the wealth that Mrs Hart was to have as a result of my order. The management of the company by Mrs Hart should have been simple but Mr Hart has done his utmost to frustrate her ability to run it efficiently and effectively.</span></p>

I found that Mr Hart had ceased making interim maintenance provision for Mrs Hart without any justification and was &#163;92,229 in arrears. I said that Mr Hart filed evidence that was &#8216;thoroughly unsatisfactory and often contradictory&#8217;. I found that he chose to provide as little information as possible about the family trust, which is worth about &#163;5.5 million, and treated that trust as if every penny were his own money. I said that Mr Hart&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">&#8216;approach to disclosure has been very poor indeed. His evidence about past events has been under-researched by him and, at times, his approach has been deliberatively obstructive&#8217;.</span></p>

It was necessary for proceedings to be taken in the Chancery Division of the High Court for Mrs Hart to gain possession of the company premises. Then, when Mr Hart and his staff finally vacated the premises they stripped out all of the management records of the company only leaving behind two bank statements and a collection of current licences and leases relating to the units that the company lets. Nobody could possibly manage the company efficiently or effectively on the basis of that information alone, as Mr Hart well knew.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">So it was that in September 2016, 18 months ago, Mrs Hart applied for Mr Hart&#8217;s committal. It has taken a great deal of time for these proceedings to be concluded. There was a hearing in March 2017 for which Mr Hart did not prepare properly. The case had to be adjourned and a list of documents was drawn up by Mrs Hart&#8217;s barrister on the basis that, if Mr Hart produced that information, the committal hearing would not proceed further. Mr Hart did not produce that information and so, eventually, the case came back before me in February of this year and I found Mr Hart to be in contempt.</span></p>

She has not been able to file full accounts for the company and those accounts that she has filed have had to bear a caveat that they have not been based on full information. She has been unable to deal with insurance claims relating to subsidence at the company premises. She has not been able to defend a claim to rates, leading to the company having to bear a significant liability. She has had great difficulty filing VAT returns. None of that should have occurred and, if Mr Hart had done what he was supposed to do, none of it would have occurred.</span></p>

Although, initially, there was disagreement about whether I should see the letter (and I heard arguments about &#8216;unambiguous impropriety&#8217; forming the basis upon which without prejudice material should be before the court) it was eventually agreed that I should see it. It was contended that its contents showed that Mrs Hart&#8217;s motivation in bringing these contempt proceedings has been to secure further financial advantage only rather than information. I have not heard that issue litigated on evidence but on the face of the document, without ruling on the contentions about unambiguous impropriety and on the basis of my now lengthy involvement in this case:</span></p>

I emphasised to Mr Hart in the clearest possible terms in March 2017 (a year ago) that he had an opportunity then to produce the information that he had been ordered to produce. I also warned him that, if he did not take that final chance of many to produce the information, I would be driven to sentence him for any contempt that I found against him. I had given him previous warnings to the like effect. Therefore, this is a man who has received repeated warnings already that he must comply with court orders and he has chosen, repeatedly, not to do so. </span></p>

That information was provided on the first morning of this sentencing hearing without any forewarning to me in the second lever arch file of documents. Mr Mitchell had no opportunity to check it properly before it was handed in but I could not delay the sentencing because of it.  I therefore take it that the information that has now been provided does fill this particular gap in the documentation provided by Mr Hart. However: a) that does not detract from the fact that the information should have been provided far earlier; b) the finding that I made was not there was &#163;150,000 elsewhere in an account &#8211; the finding was that the documentation did not explain what had become of this sum of money and c) this issue was raised in the hearing in March 2017 and it has taken a year since then for the current documentation to be provided. For the purposes of this exercise I accept that Mr Hart was not himself responsible for the original redaction of the information but it did remain his responsibility to comply with the court&#8217;s orders and his own undertaking. Further, on the overall scale of Mr Hart&#8217;s contempt, I regard this as a factor of limited significance where there have been multifaceted breaches in relation to so much other information and documentation.
