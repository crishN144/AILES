This finding was not disputed by either party and was accepted by the court and, by my order of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March2022, I accordingly appointed Ms Emma Gaudern of EMG Solicitors to be the husband&#8217;s litigation friend.

I am grateful to both Counsel for the helpful, skilful, courteous and clear way they have respectively conducted their cases &#8211; both parties have been represented before me at the highest level; but it has, of course, come at a high cost. The wife has incurred a total of &#163;280,482 in legal costs and the husband a total of &#163;418,236 &#8211; nearly &#163;700,000 of family money has gone to lawyers, never to be recovered. In fairness to the Solicitors, this has not been a straightforward case, procedurally or evidentially, and I do not criticise the way in which the case has been handled on either side &#8211; but it is still of course a large amount of money to incur in legal fees in the context of the available assets.</p>

My clear impression is that most of the money for these investments came from the husband&#8217;s substantial earnings; but that the wife was involved in the buying and managing process and her name appears on the legal title and mortgage of most of the properties. In this sense the purchase and management of real properties was very much a team effort.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">At least by 2013 (and probably significantly before that) the marriage had become unhappy and turbulent and the absence of sexual intimacy in their relationship was a source of distress to the husband. In late December 2013 matters took a dramatic turn. The husband decided to visit a sex worker. He quickly felt guilty and ashamed about what he had done and regretted his action. In early January 2014 he told the wife what had happened. Very understandably, she was not happy to hear what she was told and my perception is that she acted with a mixture of distress and anger. One (I think representative) example of her contemporaneous thinking about this event is contained in the text message sent by her to the husband&#8217;s mother on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 which includes the comment: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I cry for the death of my husband! My husband died the day he went to see that prostitute in December</span>&#8221;. She was not minded readily to forgive the husband for his transgression. In her witness statement, she says: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I felt emotionally devastated and was in a terrible place personally</span>&#8221;. Her initial reaction was, or certainly appeared to the husband to be, to be determined to end the marriage. The husband did not wish this to happen and begged her not to end it. She was persuaded to consider going on with the marriage, but decided to bolster her financial security in the process, as a <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo</span> of not pursuing a divorce.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.25in">As a consequence of these events the wife, in January 2014, consulted a Solicitor, Ms Diana Parker at Withers, a leading Solicitor in the financial remedies field. There has been no disclosure of Ms Parker&#8217;s file (so I am unaware what the wife told Ms Parker or what advice was given about these matters), but a document was quickly drafted by Ms Parker which bore the title &#8220;Post-Marital Agreement&#8221; and included the narrative: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In the event of the permanent Breakdown of the Marriage, both parties intend and agree that their respective financial rights and obligations will be solely as governed by this agreement&#8230;this agreement shall be treated as binding on each of them&#8230;.irrespective of their ages or medical conditions at the date of the Permanent breakdown of the Marriage</span>&#8221;. This document, as Mr Rainer has accepted, sought to impose a financial outcome if the marriage did ultimately break down, which was significantly more advantageous to the wife than would have been the case had the matter been referred to a court at that stage.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">It is clear from the evidence I have heard and read that the husband&#8217;s immediate view was then he would take no issue with the proposed agreement, whatever the appropriateness or fairness of its terms. He was in a hurry to sign whatever document was put in front of him; but (no doubt in order to impose more validity and enforceability on the agreement) he was required by Ms Parker to take (and to prove that he had taken) legal advice on the document. With this in mind the husband consulted Mr Simon Pigott, a partner in Levison Meltzer Pigott, and another leading Solicitor in the field of financial remedies. An email from the husband dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 shows his state of mind as he said: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;(The letter from Ms Parker) focuses only on my Parkinsons and makes no reference to my uneven behaviour and adultery. Please let me be clear. I do not wish to use my illness as a negotiating point&#8230;I am confident that any proposal on behalf of my wife will be based on the provision of the best possible outcome for SC and MC &#8230;my instructions are we will not challenge any proposal at all&#8221;</span>. </p>

It is inevitable that one day I will have to stop working and need long term care&#8230;if SC and I are no longer married, then the only provision of care will be from the state. The state is the carer of last resort. In that case the best outcome for SC and MC would be for SC to own all assets as the sole owner&#8230;In summary my position is that SC should have the maximum possible share of the assets upon a breakdown of our marriage. Please do share this with Mrs Parker so we are all on the same page.&#8221;</span></p>

Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.25in">Unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress) will be likely to eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement, and other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, would reduce or eliminate it. The court may take into account a party&#8217;s emotional state, and what pressures he or she was under to agree. But that again cannot be considered in isolation from what would have happened had he or she not been under those pressures. In cases of this latter nature the influence one person has over another provides scope for misuse without any specific overt acts of persuasion. The relationship between two individuals may be such that, without more, one of them is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other. The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in these 'relationship' cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of persuasive conduct. The types of relationship in which this principle falls to be applied cannot be listed exhaustively. Relationships are infinitely various. The principle is not confined to cases of abuse of trust and confidence. It also includes, for instance, cases where a vulnerable person has been exploited. Indeed, there is no single touchstone for determining whether the principle is applicable. Several expressions have been used in an endeavour to encapsulate the essence: trust and confidence, reliance, dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy, domination or control on the other. None of these descriptions is perfect. None is all embracing. Each has its proper place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It was (initially at least) part of the husband&#8217;s case that the agreement had been procured by the &#8216;blackmail&#8217; threats of the wife to inform his parents about his visit to a sex worker if he did not sign the agreement; but, as the case developed, the evidence did not suggest this was a powerful argument and it was (I think appropriately) not really pursued with vigour by the end of the case. It emerged in the evidence that the husband&#8217;s mother knew about the sex worker event at least by (and probably earlier than) the wife&#8217;s text message of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 and so a &#8216;blackmail&#8217; strategy was unlikely to be of much effect &#8211; and I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence on this that the husband was aware before he signed the agreement that his mother knew what had happened. Further, the evidence for the making of a threat was weak and, of course, the husband was not in a position to give oral evidence to maintain what he had said on this subject prior to his losing mental capacity. Further, the disclosure from the husband&#8217;s 2014 Solicitors file did not support the proposition that &#8216;blackmail&#8217; played any part in the husband&#8217;s decision-making in early 2014. In so far as the &#8216;blackmail&#8217; argument is still being pursued (and it has not been formally abandoned) I reject this as a reason for vitiating the agreement.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">For me, however, that is not the end of the matter. A number of questions have troubled me in thinking about this case. Why would somebody engaging in rational thought sign a document which was so manifestly to his disadvantage? Why would somebody who had a clear entitlement to assets worth perhaps &#163;2,500,000 or more sign a document restricting his claim to a sum in the region of &#163;1,000,000? In the search for fairness it is adequate to say <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;well, he knew the gamble he was taking</span>&#8221;? In the search for fairness is it adequate to say that he was appropriately rewarded by receiving the benefit of the possibility of a continuing marriage, albeit one which might end a few years later, which he otherwise was not going to have? In the search for fairness, how should the court deal with the husband&#8217;s apparent wish to have less money or even no money to meet his likely future care needs, so as to make himself dependent on local authority support?  How should a court deal with a clause in a Post-Marital Agreement which invites the disregard of needs arising from a medical condition, in particular where the existence of those likely future needs is known about at the time the agreement was drafted?  In the search for fairness, is a person giving away assets to which he has a secure entitlement to secure the resumption of a marriage to be treated any differently from a person (such as Mr Granatino) who gives away the possibility of sharing in pre-marital assets to secure the commencement of a marriage?</p>

Ms Mottahedan has skillfully drawn together some of the available evidence of the husband&#8217;s presentation in late 2013 and early 2014 (and in the periods before and after those dates) which, though falling short of any suggestion that the husband lacked formal mental capacity to sign the agreement at that time, create some significant question marks over what was really going on in his head. </p>

The wife told me that there was no truth in this and that this was a paranoid thought by the husband and I accept what she says about this. For me, these apparently paranoid assertions are perhaps corroborative of the thought that the husband&#8217;s mind and decision-making was not working properly at this stage. It is difficult to disaggregate the constituent parts, but my impression is that this was tied up with his feeling of guilt and remorse about visiting the sex worker in December 2013.</p>

How does this proposition fit with the search for fairness?</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">He has a housing need. Just because the husband has a serious medical condition, and has significant and worsening disabilities, his social needs should not in my view be disregarded. His lack of litigation capacity does not mean that he does not reasonably need the things which other people without disabilities reasonably need &#8211; in particular a reasonably comfortable house. In my view there is a strong case on the facts here for arguing that he reasonably needs to remain in the familiar surroundings of the house that has been his home for many years, that is Property X, and I find myself unattracted by the wife&#8217;s arguments that it would be fair to provide a much less valuable home for him (Mr Rainer&#8217;s closing submissions suggest a house at &#163;675,000 would be adequate to meet his need). She wishes to continue living in a house with a value of &#163;2,350,000. It seems to me not at all unreasonable for him to wish to continue living in a house with a value of &#163;1,850,000.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Further, the husband has real and identifiable needs for home care. The evidence suggests that there may well come a time when his care needs are such that he will objectively need to be in a nursing home or a care home &#8211; which will be cheaper in costs terms than living at home with a bespoke care package; but Ms Mottahedan invites me to note the evidence that the husband has a strong view that he wishes to remain living at home (as to opposed to living in a care home) for as long as this is possible. Indeed, one of the reasons for the separation in 2020 was the husband&#8217;s perception and fear that the wife would be likely to put the husband in a care home at the earliest opportunity &#8211; a fear which was rather confirmed by the evidence which the wife gave on this subject before me. My view is that the husband does have a real and identifiable need for home care, which may be over a long period, and any needs assessment needs to take this into account. I reject as unfair any suggestion that the agreement&#8217;s invitation to ignore medical condition should be treated as overriding the requirement for the court to make an assessment of need.</p>

Ms Mottahedan says this: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The reality is that the full extent of the husband&#8217;s needs cannot be met on a 50% share of the assets. But he will take his half share and balance his housing, income and care needs at different points in time by the people who care for him and love him</span>&#8221;.

W says yes. There may be less needs headroom/cushioning than the court would otherwise order absent the agreement, but H knew this in 2014 and welcomed it with clear eyes and open arms&#8221;.</span> Although Mr Rainer has put this view powerfully and cogently, I find myself not agreeing with this approach. Is it fair that if his home care budget should run out and the husband be left with no option other than local authority-funded care home provision? Is it fair that his choices should be removed from him in this way? In my view the suggestion of Mr Rainer falls foul of the <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher v Granatino</span> (supra) fairness test and would be quite likely (perhaps unless he died very much at the worst case scenario end of the scale) to leave the husband in a predicament of real need.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary on this area of the case, I have reached the conclusion that it would be wrong for me to place weight on the Pre-Marital Agreement. Not only was it very much to the husband&#8217;s disadvantage in financial terms, I have reached the overall conclusion that, at the time that it was signed, he was a vulnerable person (in the ways described above) and the wife rather took advantage of that vulnerable situation to gain a substantial financial advantage. I reject the suggestion that she engaged in blackmail or direct threats or that she imposed any direct pressure; but (not thinking in &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">formal legal terms</span>&#8221;, rather considering &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">all the circumstances as they affect each of two human beings&#8230;in the complex relationship of marriage&#8221;) </span>it is my view that the agreement was not a fair one. In my view this is a case where these words resonate: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The relationship between two individuals may be such that, without more, one of them is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other. The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in these 'relationship' cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of persuasive conduct.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I have reached the conclusion that to enforce the agreement runs the risk of leaving the husband in a predicament of real need, possibly leaving him in inadequate accommodation and/or running the risk that he would have no option other than to do the one thing he wants to avoid &#8211; going into a care home. For me, the fact that his own words contemplated this situation in 2014 does not, given the question marks over his decision-making ability in 2014, change my view that it would be unfair to hold him to the strict terms of the agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As far as the &#8216;historic tax&#8217; liability is concerned I propose to regard that as a joint debt to which each party should contribute equally (in so far as a debt arises) and the parties should cooperate to minimise. The possible liability arises from the fact that for tax purposes the rent from the investment properties were declared (I believe for quite a number of years) as having been divided 90:10 in the wife&#8217;s favour (so attracting a lower rate of tax because of her lower employment earnings). It has emerged that, in fact, to claim this differential it was necessary for some formal documentation to be executed and (possibly) served on HMRC evidencing the fact that this division was a common intention. Although it is agreed that this was the common intention, it appears that the necessary documentation was not executed and/or served. It may still be possible to argue with HMRC that all is in order, but it may not. At present this is uncertain. I am content to record in my order a recital / finding that it was the parties&#8217; common intention that this was the situation, and I am told this may help the argument with HMRC, but my order needs to be drafted in a way that this is an ongoing project in relation to which both parties should cooperate.</p>
