	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">These proceedings concern a young person. Katie is now aged 16. Her adoptive parents are MG and FG. On 10 June 2011 Coventry City Council (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;) issued care proceedings. The final hearing took place in July 2012. The local authority&#8217;s final care plan, opposed by the parents, was that Katie should be made the subject of a final care order. That is the order I made.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">At final hearing the parents&#8217; case was that it would be more appropriate for the court to make Katie a ward of court. On behalf of both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian it was contended not only that that was not the appropriate order but that as a result of s.100 Children Act 1989 the court had no jurisdiction to make Katie a ward of court. Though satisfied that Katie&#8217;s interests would be best served by making her a ward of court I was persuaded by the local authority and the guardian that I had no power to do so. I gave the parents permission to appeal. On 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">November their appeal was allowed. The care order was discharged. Katie was made a ward of court. The proceedings were remitted back to me.</span></p>

It is unnecessary to say more about those issues within this judgment. The one remaining issue relates to the parents&#8217; wish to be able to discuss the case with the media. It is that issue to which this judgment relates. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The background history is set out fully in my earlier judgment. It is unnecessary to repeat it. I was critical of several aspects of the way in which the local authority had dealt with this case. For the purpose of this present judgment it is appropriate simply to repeat what I said at the end of my judgment:</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Accepting a child for adoption, particularly a late adoption, inevitably involves taking a risk. The parents have said that had they known in 2003 what they know now they would not have proceeded with the adoption. But they did not know. And they did adopt Katie. There is no going back. Adoption is final, both for the child and for her adopters. It is to the immense credit of these parents that despite the challenges Katie has presented, and despite the difficulties they have had to contend with in engaging with the local authority, they still care about Katie, they still love her and they still want what is best for her.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In assessing the local authority&#8217;s care plan two particular issues give me cause for concern. Firstly, the local authority&#8217;s case for a care order is in large measure reliant upon the conviction of professionals that that is what Katie wants. Yet it is not clear that any professional involved in her care has stood back and assessed what Katie is saying against the backdrop of her acknowledged emotional immaturity and her propensity for using her behaviour as a means of controlling those around her.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Secondly, the state of the parents&#8217; working relationship with the local authority is very poor. The local authority has been accommodating Katie since December 2010. In that time Katie has been sexually assaulted, prompting the local authority to apply for a secrecy order; she has been arrested for a serious assault on a member of staff but the parents were not informed; she has had a contraceptive implant fitted but the parents (Roman Catholics) were not consulted and were only informed after the event; the local authority has signed up to a working agreement which made clear provision for regular updating information to be provided to the parents but its compliance has been erratic and unreliable; at a meeting on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> December 2011 the local authority appeared to agree to pay for </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Family Futures</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> to provide therapy for Katie and yet, to date, no therapy has taken place and no clear arrangements for therapy are in place; at that same meeting the local authority agreed to prepare an updated working agreement but that, too, has not happened. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The father asks, plaintively: if this is the way the local authority treat us when we alone have parental responsibility, how will they treat us if they share parental responsibility with us under a care order? That is a serious question. I regret to say that on the evidence before me I am in no doubt that there is a likelihood, a real possibility, that if I make a care order the parents will be marginalised and largely ignored.</span></p>

I had intended that order only to remain in force for a matter of days until full argument could be heard. In the event, that order has remained in force until today.

They list a number of factors which may have contributed to the recent deterioration in her behaviour including, for example, beginning a period of extended school holiday having completed her GSCE exams, waiting for GCSE results in August, moving into the sixth form in September, the commencement of therapy and the end-of-GCSE school prom.</span></p>

They also want to highlight the implications for the adoptive siblings of such a child. More generally, they would wish to be able to talk about the need for greater recognition of RAD, the treatment options and the kind of support needed by families caring for a child suffering from RAD. The parents&#8217; motive is to change systems for the better and to try to get RAD recognised as a life-affecting condition in the same way that autism is recognised as a lifelong developmental disability.

At the beginning of this year there was a meeting between the parents and senior management. Although the meeting appeared to be positive (the parents describe it as &#8220;good mood music&#8221;) from the parents&#8217; perspective it has not led to any change in the working relationship between themselves and the local authority. The parents say that correspondence has continued as if that meeting had never taken place. They consider it a waste of time talking to this local authority because it isn&#8217;t listening. The parents wish to be able to discuss these issues with the media.</span></p>

The local authority&#8217;s response to the application was to indicate an intention to apply for a Reporting Restrictions Order. In the belief that that application was about to be issued arrangements were put in hand for it to be heard by Hogg J in Birmingham at the beginning of February. In the event, on 29 January I was informed that neither the local authority nor the guardian intended to proceed with that application. On behalf of the parents, Mr Downs makes the point that by opposing the parents&#8217; present application the local authority is effectively seeking a Reporting Restrictions Order by the back door. Furthermore, Mr Downs notes that at the hearing before the Court of Appeal last November the court was made aware of the newspaper articles to which I referred earlier. The local authority could have sought to deal with the wider publicity issues at the time of the appeal hearing but did not do so.</span></p>

Thirdly, that the level of upset caused to Katie by her recent discovery of the publicity last August was extreme.

In the last four years there has only been one occasion when there has been a duly accredited representative in my court. I believe that that is the experience of most family judges. There are a number of reasons for this. These include, in particular, the lack of access to court documents to which I referred earlier, lack of advance notice of the cases coming before the court and lack of the resources needed to be able to send reporters into the family courts on a regular basis. However, the fact that the media rarely attends hearings in the family courts does not mean that the media has ceased to be interested in family justice. What it has meant is that there continues to be a tendency for journalists to publish reports about cases based only on the invariably tendentious accounts given to them by aggrieved parents. </span></p>

It should not be necessary to show that there is some particular reason to justify why leave should be given in the particular case, let alone any need to justify leave on the basis that the judgment deals with some supposedly interesting point of law, practice or principle. For my own part, I should have thought that the proper approach ought to be the other way round. It is not so much for those who seek leave to publish an anonymised judgment to justify their request; surely it is for those who resist such leave to demonstrate some good reason why the judgment should not be published even in a suitably anonymised form.&#8221; </span></p>

The maintenance of public confidence in the judicial system is central to the values which underlie both Art&#160;6 and Art&#160;10 and something which, in my judgment, has to be brought into account as a very weighty factor in any application of the balancing exercise. And where the lack of public confidence is caused even if only in part by misunderstanding or, on occasions, the peddling of falsehoods, then there is surely a resonance, even for the family justice system, in what Brandeis&#160;J said so many years ago.

But if such criticism exceeds what is lawful there are other remedies available to the local authority. The fear of such criticism, however justified that fear may be, and however unjustified the criticism, is not of itself a justification for affording a local authority anonymity. On the contrary, the powers exercisable by local authorities under Parts&#160;IV and&#160;V of the Children Act 1989 are potentially so drastic in their possible consequences that there is a powerful public interest in those who exercise such powers being publicly identified so that they can be held publicly accountable. The arguments in favour of publicity &#8211; in favour of openness, public scrutiny and public accountability &#8211; are particularly compelling in the context of public law care proceedings: see </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-family:Garamond">Re&#160;X; Barnet London Borough Council v Y and X </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#160; </span><a href="javascript:CVPortal.components.lcContent.loadDoc(null,%20%7b%20docid:%20'Family_FLRONLINE_FLR_20062FLR0998',%20filename:%20''%20%7d);" style="font-family:Garamond">[2006] 2 FLR 998</a><span style="font-family:Garamond">, at para&#160;[166]. </span></p>

How can such errors be exposed, how can public authorities be held accountable, if allowed to shelter behind a judicially sanctioned anonymity? This is particularly so where, as in the present case, a public authority has been exposed to criticism.

In that event, it was submitted, it was likely that the ward would suffer serious harm because of the reaction of those who made the identification. Furthermore, he would be likely to read the article himself and he would be seriously affected, both by the terms of the article and by his fear of the reaction of others to the article.

As the President&#8217;s recent draft Practice Guidance makes clear, there is a need for greater transparency in the family courts &#8220;in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system&#8221;. Improvement in the public&#8217;s understanding and confidence will largely be dependent upon media reporting. There is, therefore, a responsibility on the media to report cases accurately and fairly. There is also a responsibility on the media to have regard to the sensitivities of the children and young people who are the subjects of their reporting and to recognise that, as this case demonstrates, the children and young people concerned may themselves become aware of what is reported. </span></p>

The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.

Children do not live in isolation inside a bubble. For better or for worse, children live in the care of adults, often with siblings or other children who are also part of their family. They are likely to have a relationship with members of their wider maternal and paternal families. To a greater or lesser extent they are likely to be known by their neighbours. Depending upon their age they will be known by teachers and other children at school. They may be known by other professionals &#8211; doctors and health visitors, for example. They or their family may be known to the police. Their parents may have their own circle of friends and work colleagues in whom they may confide information relating to their family. So it is that every child is part of a loose network of people each of whom is likely to know something about that child&#8217;s story. These are people who are to a greater or lesser extent, in the words of Neill LJ &#8220;in the know&#8221;. Whatever the extent of the anonymisation of a judgment given in a family case in every such case there is a risk, and in some cases a significant risk, that those who are &#8220;in the know&#8221; may recognise the child who is the subject of that judgment either by reading the judgment or by reading a newspaper report of the judgment.</span></p>

Those reasons are plain from my earlier judgment and do not need to be rehearsed. Throughout the whole of these proceedings these parents have behaved in a very responsible way in the face of considerable adversity. Their decision to set up PATCHES is a laudable response to what has been an exceedingly difficult chapter in their lives. They are trying to achieve something positive, something that will be of help to others, out of the ashes which remain from the hopes and aspirations they had at the time they put themselves forward as prospective adopters. They are trying to make a virtue out of a crisis and for that they are to be applauded.</span></p>
