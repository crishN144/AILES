	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This case concerns Sophie who is now 5 &#189;. It now has a fairly long history. In terms of judgments in the High Court I gave a judgment on jurisdiction in the summer of 2005, a judgment on welfare in January 2006 and Hogg J gave a judgment in the summer of 2007 on some welfare issues.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">As appears from my 2006 judgment, in 2003 a joint residence order was made in respect of Sophie and her mother went to live in Dresden. That joint residence order (with some amendments) governed the time that Sophie spent with each of her parents. Her father remained living in England. Sophie was conceived before the marriage of her parents and there are now divorce proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In 2006 I continued a shared residence order and set a new regime for the time that Sophie was to spend with each parent. I also set a timetable for review which resulted in the hearing before Hogg J in 2007 and this hearing, which was set in large measure so that a decision could be made as to where Sophie should go to school on a full-time basis. It was clearly understood by all in 2006, and was inevitable, that the regime of time spent with each parent in the two countries would have to change when Sophie started full-time school. This was because she would have to go to school in one of the two countries and therefore she would be living with the parent in that country during the school terms. The position remains that the mother is living in Dresden and wishes to remain living there and the father is living in England and wishes to remain living here. The question therefore arises whether Sophie should go to school in England or in Germany. If in England she will continue at her present school. If in Germany she will remain at her present kindergarten until the beginning of the school year in September 2008 when she will move to full-time school. There is a dispute between the parents as to whether she should attend a local public school or an international school. </p>

More can be seen from my earlier judgments (and I am sure from the judgment of Hogg J - but no transcript of that is available) and from the three reports of the CAFCASS officer (who was appointed as Sophie's Guardian by Hogg J), the statements of the parties and a chronology that was prepared by counsel for the Guardian. At the earlier hearings before me the parents have appeared in person. At this hearing the mother was represented and through that representation put in a further statement during the course of the hearing. This statement did not contain anything that might have taken the father by surprise and he was able to deal with it. The father against represented himself.</p>

The welfare of Sophie is the paramount issue and in this context a starting point in each jurisdiction is that so far as is possible Sophie should maintain an attachment to, and a relationship with, both her parents.</p>

The solution will also often involve changes in the relationships between the child and its parents which can cause upset to the child. Both the parents and the child are put in difficult situations having regard to the available choices flowing from the inability of the parents to reach agreement and the wishes of the parents to live in different countries. The child has conflicting loyalties and feelings which can create considerable burdens on the child. </p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Testing results: Father</span>: The International Personality disorder Examination (IPDE) is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to help standardise diagnosis of personality disorders. There are two versions &#8211; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &#8211; IV and the International Classification of Diseases &#8211; 10. It is advised that practitioners consider both forms of diagnosis as they are not exactly equivalent. There is a screening test that is a self-report questionnaire allowing the practitioner to fairly quickly decide whether it is necessary to administer the full semi-structured interview. The time criteria used for this examination is over the past 5 years &#8211; which is considered a conservative measurement for personality disorder (e.g. symptoms have been noted in the past 5 years). The scoring is structured and there is a place for symptoms to be recorded that are reported by 'informant' (e.g. by another person and/or from the records) as well as those reported by the client. Given the controversy around personality disorder diagnoses, it seems prudent to add an additional structured clinical measure to aid in assessment. The father does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of personality disorder. He does show a number of maladaptive personality traits that are commonly associated with Anankastic Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder.</p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">Anankastic Personality Disorder is characterised by doubts, perfectionism, conscientiousness, checking and preoccupation with details, stubbornness, caution and rigidity. Individuals with these traits often engage in pedantry. They are likely to insist that others do things exactly the way they do them. They tend to be behaviourally rigid, distant, intellectualised, and detailed. They are often controlling of themselves, others, and situations indirect in their expression of anger although an apparent undercurrent of hostility is often present. They are likely to be inflexible and stubborn in relationships. The Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterised by shallow and labile affect, self-dramatization, exaggerated expression of emotions, suggestibility, egocentricity, self-indulgence, and lack of consideration for others. People with these traits are easily hurt and seek continual excitement, attention and appreciation. Individuals with histrionic personality traits view themselves as gregarious, sociable, friendly and agreeable. They consider themselves to be charming, stimulating, and well-liked. For individuals with Histrionic Personality Disorder, indications of internal distress, weakness, depression, or hostility are denied or suppressed and are not included in their sense of themselves. Individuals with histrionic personality traits tend to have stormy relationships that start out as ideal and end up as disasters. ---------------</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">The test is valid. However, the father worked very hard to present himself in a positive light. The father's profile is of someone who is affable and sociable on the surface but who likely has some chronic feelings of social discomfort and awkward social relationships. His profile is of someone who tends to appear charming to acquaintances but in longer term and more intimate relationships is likely to be perceived as demanding and somewhat emotionally shallow. It is of someone who does not tolerate boredom well and tends to become impulsive in situations in which he is bored. Of interest is that he reports few symptoms of anxiety though he is clearly anxious and has been so during the life of this Court case. ------</p>

The mother does not qualify for a diagnosis of personality disorder. She has some personality traits that have caused her long standing difficulties in managing stress and her relationships with others. Like The father, she has some of the traits associated with Histrionic Personality Disorder, including a tendency towards moodiness, shallow emotions, egocentricity and self-dramatisation. This is combined with some traits associated with paranoid personality disorder including a deep distrust of others, a rigid belief system and a pervasive fear that others mean to do her harm. It is likely that these traits have become more pronounced since the demise of her relationship with the father.</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">The Hare Psychotherapy Checklist is designed to measure psychopathy in a forensic population. The test is scored by the clinician based on a semi-structured interview data and collateral (file and written reports) information. A sore of over 30 on this measure is indicative of a diagnosis of psychopathy. The test is made up of two factors. Factor one measures the personality traits associated with a diagnosis of psychopathy. Factor two measures behavioural traits associated with the diagnosis and also closely associated with a diagnosis of Anti-Social Personality Disorder. Research has demonstrated that whilst the majority of a prison population will qualify for a diagnosis of Anti-Social Personality Disorder, only a minority will qualify for a diagnosis of Psychopathy. Research has also demonstrated that high levels of psychopathy are associated with (and in some populations predictive of) violent crimes and behaviour, poor response to treatment and high levels of recidivism in prison populations. The body of research has been conducted in Canada, the United States and in the United Kingdom. There was no evidence of psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder.</p>

The mother' profile is of someone who seeks excessive attention and praise in order to gain the nurturance and reassurance she needs from others. When this is not present, she feels inadequate and worried about her ability to cope. The testing reflects the profile of someone who has extreme paranoid symptoms at present &#8211; believing that others are actively plotting to cause her harm and/or make her life difficult. She is experiencing symptoms of anxiety though she does not wish to admit to these readily.</p>

In reaching that view I have placed considerable reliance of the view of the Guardian which is in part based on her knowledge of the approach and resources of the relevant local authority. The effect of the local authority becoming involved would in large measure depend on the individuals assigned to the case. I agree with the Guardian and Dr Bisbey that the likelihood of significant change in the attitudes of the parents being achieved through CBT, or for other reasons, are poor but not hopeless. If they were achieved this is likely to best promote the welfare of Sophie against a background in which the local authority has not become involved and in an attempt to achieve this result I agree that it would be premature to involve the local authority at this stage.</p>

Some aspects of that particular faith, indeed, may well be thought by many to create an environment which is not the best and happiest for a child's upbringing, particularly if it leads to his or her isolation from other children and from his or her wider family. Clearly, moreover, these may be matters of great importance when considering the welfare of any particular child and the orders to be made for custody and access. But there are many other matters which also have to be taken into account and it would be quite wrong for anyone to assume, in a dispute between two parents of whom one is and the other is not a Jehovah's Witness, that the custody and care and control of their child will necessarily, or even more often than not, be given to the latter. Each case must depend on its own particular circumstances; I endorse my Lord's hope that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re T, given on 10 Dec 1975, will be reported for its very valuable summary of how these competing factors should be considered and weighed.

What he was told reassured him that there would be no problem concerning this in Germany. It is to my mind of note that he found this out of his own initiative and it was not something volunteered by the mother. During the hearing before me the mother volunteered that Sophie could carry a card signed by the father giving his permission to her being given blood transfusions. The issue of blood transfusions was not one that the father raised in statements or in argument, as I understood it, because of what he had found out in Germany and his presence in England should Sophie require medical treatment here which necessitated a blood transfusion. </p>

Her failure to do this was not investigated in evidence and I acknowledge that it may be that the mother was aware of the position in Germany and had the same view as the father, namely that he would be in effective control of the position in England, and therefore she decided not to raise the issue and thus avoid argument and conflict relating to her faith.

He has also been criticised by me, and I think Hogg J, for his conduct at handovers both as to "evidence gathering" and inappropriate behaviour. Very late in the day the mother produced some emails exchanged on 27 December 2007 (and one on the 29 December 2007) including passages showing the father's anger and criticism of her in strong and angry terms. These emails are few among a great many. The clip started with a reasonable and sensible one from the father followed by a reply from the mother in reasonable terms but which effectively asserted the mother's case and prompted a very quick reply in strong, accusatory and angry terms.

This is an important point and I return to it later. As appears later I do not accept that it is true or that it has been matched by the mother's actions since the 2006 hearing.

The mother returned from Ireland with Sophie and the basis of her move to Germany was the shared residence order made in 2003.

It was thus said to Sophie after the mother had introduced them into the issues in this case and Sophie's life and at a time when she knew her paternal grandparents were alive and had had contact with them, her uncle and cousins. An explanation or assertion (even if the father had at one time said to the mother that his parents were dead) to explain the earlier absence of any part by her paternal grandparents in Sophie's life, or for any other reason, is therefore difficult to follow unless it was intended to paint a bad picture of the father in Sophie's mind. For example, the mother could have said that the father (and his brother) and his (their) parents did not get on and did not see each other.</p>

The criticism of him for failing to do this when he did not return Sophie in accordance with the times set by the first shared residence order, together with his knowledge and justified fear that a further failure could lead to a change in Sophie's school and where she lives during term times, are factors supporting the view that he will stick to handover times.</p>

In my view she has failed to do this and rather than take steps that dispel or reduce the risk expressed in my 2006 judgment that if there was to be a sole residence order in her favour (or by inference she was to have Sophie living with her for the majority of the year) she would marginalise the father; she has confirmed the existence of that risk.</p>

However since that hearing she has effectively blocked such contact and reverted to the unconvincing reasons she advanced before as to why it should not take place relating to it being intrusive. She also said that she did not understand that it was something she had to do under the order and therefore she did not promote it. The order provided that the parties were to "take all reasonably practical steps to enable that contact [i.e. telephone contact] to be by way of video link". The mother has not taken any such practical steps and it is difficult to see why she thought that this was not contrary to the order. But, and whether or not she did think this, it is a clear indication of her not promoting contact between the father and Sophie albeit that by taking this stance she also deprived herself of such contact with Sophie when she was with her father. It is also an example of her only doing what she says she thought she was bound by court order to do, rather than taking a sensible and practical approach whilst Sophie was in Germany to promoting Sophie's contact with her father and thus her welfare.</p>

The judge in Germany has said that the application in Germany asserted that the mother did not know that I was still dealing with the affairs of the child. I accept that this is what the judge in Germany was so told and it is clearly untrue. It is apparent that for some time the mother continued to seek sole custody in the divorce proceedings in Germany and it seems that she sought to challenge the decision of the judge there to leave such matters to the English court.

Although I accept that I should infer that Sophie is not unhappy at school or at home in Germany my impression is that both she and the mother are fairly isolated and lonely. This based for example on the following:</p>

On 23 November both the mother and the father were ordered to forward their medical records to Dr Bisbey. Neither did so on time and the mother has not done so. Dr Bisbey was of the view which I accept that this reflected the father's lack of understanding of her need and wish to check assertions from third party sources. As to the mother both Dr Bisbey and the Guardian were in my view correctly concerned that this was an example of the mother refusing to provide relevant information and of her suspicions and lack of trust of others. Indeed Dr Bisbey's expressed concern about the mother's mental health and that her suspicions of others is quite extreme. </p>

In my judgment this is not an approach that is likely to lead to the encouragement or promotion of Sophie's relationship and contact with the father if Sophie goes to school in Germany.</p>

Much of his motivation for doing so is related to him then being able to better care for Sophie if she goes to school in England. It also has the effect that it would be easier for him to have holiday contact with Sophie than it would have been if he had remained in his old job, and it would be for the mother given her holiday periods.</p>

She has the skills, qualifications and experience to do so and, for example, there are many jobs she could apply for in the UK. It would be much easier for her to move here than it would for the father to move to Germany albeit that he has skills, qualifications and experience that would mean that he could probably find work there, he does not speak the language and in my view he has a justified fear that if he moved there the mother would move to another country.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the Guardian and the submissions made on behalf of the mother that the most significant or magnetic factor in this case is which parent would be most likely to promote Sophie's continuing relationship with and her contact with the parent who is not living in the country where Sophie goes to school and who therefore will spend less time with her.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The reason for this is that in my view in difficult cases such as this it is appropriate to identify what is most likely, if successful, to promote the short, medium and long term welfare of the child and then to see if that is a realistic possibility and how it is best to be achieved. Sadly here I agree with the Guardian that the court has to look at what is likely to be the least bad solution and has to be very aware that the goal may not be achieved. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">As appears from my conclusions in respect of s. 37 Children Act at this stage it remains appropriate to seek to achieve a result in which Sophie is able to continue and build on her relationship with both her parents, and to try to achieve this by providing as secure and stable situation as is possible in which she will be going to school from the home of one parent and visiting the other during holidays (and being visited by the parent who lives in a different country during term time). So I agree that the stage has not been reached that security and emotional stability for Sophie should be sought by greatly reducing her contact with one of her parents or removing her from the day to day care of her parents. As I have indicated unless there is a significant change in the parenting of both the mother and the father such steps might have to be considered in the future.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I have reached the same conclusion by a wider margin. The main reason for this is my conclusion expressed above, for the reasons set out above, that the risks that the mother will not promote Sophie's relationship and contact with the father if Sophie goes to school in Germany is higher than the same risk the other way round.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This is necessarily a prediction and I acknowledge that it involves a change of background circumstances and there are arguments persuasively advanced on behalf of the mother that the balance of competing factors favours a different assessment of risk and a different prediction. But for the reasons I have given I am not persuaded by those arguments. In particular it seems to me that the actions of the mother since the 2006 Order found the view I have reached that if Sophie goes to school in Germany it is likely that the mother will be obstructive on many issues relating to contact and the promotion of Sophie's relationship with her father.</p>

I agree that weight should not be placed on Sophie's view expressed to the Guardian that she prefers being in England and any indication from the pictures she drew for Dr Bisbey that they indicate that preference. She is too young to process the relevant factors and as the Guardian points out will miss her mother when she starts to spend more time in England. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">As appears earlier I accept and agree with the conclusion of Dr Bisbey and the Guardian (which Dr Bisbey bases in part on the pictures) that Sophie is very well aware of the conflict between her parents who both treat her as a small adult, involve her in their conflict and have their own needs in respect of their relationship with Sophie. Those needs are different and Sophie is already able to manipulate both parents and is anxious to please both. This underlies my view that, absent significant change, she is likely to suffer significant harm and the unhappy background to this case.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It leads me to conclude that Sophie needs to have as much stability and security as is possible and that to promote this she needs to have as many outlets as possible to assist her to form other relationships to assist her to develop into a balanced adult notwithstanding the conflict between her parents.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The religious conflict between her parents is not relevant as such in this respect but, as the cases show, the knock on effects of the ways of life of the parents by reference to their religious beliefs and practices is relevant and in my view here it is relevant to the question of Sophie's stability and security to assist her development.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In my view such stability and security will be assisted by Sophie having a wide group of friends of her own age, and relationships with adults, both from divergent backgrounds rather than a social life centred on the Jehovah's Witnesses. In my view such a peer group, and relationships with adults, would assist her general happiness and thus her security, stability and development. Such adults would include parents of friends, teachers and people running activities.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In my view the beliefs and practices of the mother as a Jehovah's Witness to parties and Christmas is likely to limit the width of Sophie's friends of her own age and her contact with adults, who can help and influence her. Further it may well cause her problems at school simply because of the differences it will create between her and her class mates.</p>

Absent such emotional insecurity flowing from the parental conflict those effects would have far less weight. Further, as I have indicated they are not the most important or magnetic considerations in this case. Rather they constitute a factor that supports the conclusion based on those most important and magnetic considerations.</p>
