In the instant case the parties have agreed to split their net capital assets equally. Precisely how that is to be done is in dispute. So far as income provision for the wife and children are concerned, the husband earns per annum considerably more than is necessary to &#8220;maintain&#8221; (generously construed) the wife, their four children, himself and his new partner. The wife seeks an equitable share of that surplus over a four year period to enable her to go a long way to achieving a clean break. The husband accepts that in the light of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McFarlane; Parlour</span> he must not only maintain the wife and children but also pay over a proportion of the surplus. How much is in dispute. Both the level of maintenance for the wife and children and the sharing of the surplus are in dispute.</p>

The husband is restricted from selling it until 2008. At the time of purchase the husband executed a document confirming that it was to be held in trust for the wife and himself. Its current agreed value is &#163;1.31 million. A loan was obtained which now stands at &#163;300,000. The wife says its net equity before CGT is &#163;957,600. The husband contends for &#163;936,952 because conveyancing costs of &#163;22,500 ought also to be deducted. </p>

In its first year R LLP made a loss, of which the husband&#8217;s share is said to be &#163;5 million. This, it is hoped and expected, will give him an estimated tax refund of &#163;2 million. He will have to repay borrowings of &#163;1 million from the Royal Bank of Scotland (&#163;250,000), HSBC Private Bank (&#163;550,000), and from T Limited (&#163;204,000) plus interests and costs. Thus, if the scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue, it could provide him with a net amount of some &#163;900,000. The husband&#8217;s accountants expect the Inland Revenue to approve the scheme by the end of this year.</p>

Whether his earnings will remain at their present high level after he has left ZFC is doubtful. I have no figures as to what he might be able to earn from media work &#8211; assuming he can break into that field &#8211; but the impression I got was that his earnings are likely to fall, and fall substantially, after he ceases to play.</p>

The actual difference in money terms between the parties&#8217; assessment of the net capital assets is small, i.e. c. &#163;123,000. I say it is small because the difference represents c. 3.4% of &#163;3,677,855, the wife&#8217;s assessment of the net capital assets and c. 3.5% of &#163;3,554,638, the husband&#8217;s assessment. The husband&#8217;s costs are in total just under &#163;105,000. The wife&#8217;s costs are of a similar order. A substantial proportion of those costs must be referable to the dispute about capital. I would hazard that the amount spent in costs in determining what is the exact figure of the net capital assets is disproportionate to the difference between the two assessments. Further, the resources of the legal system are limited and should not be deployed on the exploration of disputes the resolution of which ought to be capable of agreement. However, as the parties have explored this dispute it would be churlish of me not to methodically resolve the differences, tempted though I am to take a rough and ready approach.</p>

I was told that the wife&#8217;s outstanding costs are now approximately &#163;75,000. Since the husband is effectively funding the wife&#8217;s litigation costs it would seem unreal now to expect any lesser sum than &#163;55,000 to be made available by the husband. Accordingly the wife&#8217;s assets increase to &#163;1,736,143 and the husband&#8217;s decrease to &#163;1,922,718. The difference is &#163;186,575 in favour of the husband and thus the balancing figure payable by the husband to the wife should be &#163;93,288. This balancing figure is, of course, only payable in the event of the wife receiving &#163;900,000 from the R LLP scheme i.e. it is successful. </p>

The wife has agreed that, upon receipt of &#163;900,000, she   will discharge the mortgage on property B. So far as the other two properties are concerned the wife does not know what rental income she may be able to obtain. Furthermore, the evidence she put before me of how she is going to re-mortgage the properties in order to release the husband from the current mortgage is vague and unsatisfactory. Miss Theis submitted the properties should be sold. Mr Cayford submitted that the wife should have a further three months. If there are then no concrete proposals to re-mortgage them, they should be sold. I am prepared to accede to Mr Cayford&#8217;s submission.</p>

Both accepted they had been extravagant. Much time and effort was spent during the hearing in each party blaming the other for overspending after they had separated. To be fair it was the husband who first accused the wife of overspending post the separation. The wife responded in kind but as an essentially defensive measure. Miss Theis drew my attention to the scale of the wife&#8217;s expenditure particularly in late 2003 and 2004 when the husband was anxious to restrain expenditure generally. In March 2004 the wife spent &#163;27,950. The wife pawned some of the husband&#8217;s jewellery, she said, to pay the builder but produced no documentary evidence of such a payment. Miss Theis suggested that in 2004 alone payments were made out of the joint account to or for the wife of &#163;166,835. The wife&#8217;s share of property E of &#163;33,000 was spent and there is no documentary evidence to show upon what.</p>

She was, indeed, as Miss Theis submitted, untruthful about the pawn tickets, see paragraph 42 above. But I do not accept that the extravagance of the wife after the separation, her failure to hand over some of the husband&#8217;s jewellery to the jeweller, and her pawning of jewellery make her out to be inherently unreliable in handling money.  </p>

Bearing in mind all the s. 25 (2) factors it does not adequately reflect what in my judgement ought to be the appropriate level of maintenance.

The Court of Appeal awarded Mrs Parlour &#163;444,000 per annum which represented 37.5% of Mr Parlour&#8217;s net income. As I read the judgements of the Court of Appeal that figure was arrived at on an entirely pragmatic basis. The court was unwilling to remit the matter for further determination with all the further costs that would have entailed [see, in particular paragraph 141 of the judgment of Wall L.J.]. Mrs Parlour did not seek more than 37.5%. Further the Court of Appeal were satisfied that within the figure of &#163;444,000 per annum was a large reserve (&#163;294,000 per annum) which could be laid up against the discharge of her periodical payments order in the future. I refer, generally, to paragraph 77 of the judgment of Thorpe L.J. and paragraphs 141 and 142 of the judgment of Wall L.J. where he described the percentage as &#8220;an arbitrary figure&#8221;. Thus the fact that the Court of Appeal sanctioned a split in favour of Mrs Parlour of 37.5% does not in itself provide much guidance in the instant case.</p>

For the wife to receive 50% of the   husband&#8217;s net income is fair, affordable and consistent with <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McFarlane; Parlour</span>. It would put the parties on an equal footing for the next four years during which the husband&#8217;s earning capacity is likely to be at its peak. There is nothing abhorrent in such a split which is designed to achieve a level of saving to enable a clean break to come about in due course, and sooner rather than later. It gives the parties the best chance of a clean break; both would have the opportunity to save equal amounts and be in similar capital positions in four years time. Thereafter the husband will be in a stronger position by reason of his much greater earning potential. Furthermore, it is submitted that there is still a &#8220;nexus&#8221; between the parties. The separation was only twenty months ago. To put the parties in a substantially different position during the next four years is discriminatory, particularly in the light of the wife&#8217;s past, present and future contribution in bringing up the children. Finally, Mr Cayford was at pains to make it clear that he did not advance the argument for an equal share of the income on the basis that the capital had been split equally, nor did he seek to advance the submission made in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McFarlane;</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Parlour</span> based on &#8220;entitlement&#8221; or &#8220;compensation&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In any case in which, despite a substantial capital base available for division, clean break is not presently practicable, the court has a statutory duty to consider the future possibility. That duty assumes particular prominence in cases where there is a certain and substantial surplus of future income over future needs. If, as in one of the present appeals, the surplus will be predictably short-lived, the first option for consideration should be the planned progress to clean break by means of a substantial term order open to a later application for extension. The obligation on the parties to achieve financial independence is mutual. The earner must give proper priority to making payments on account out of the surplus income. The payee must invest the surplus sensibly, or risk that her failure so to do might count against her on an application for discharge under s 31(7A) and (7B). Given the mutuality of the obligation, the opportunity and responsibility to invest should, in my judgment, be shared. It strikes me as discriminatory, and, therefore, wrong in principle, for the earner to have sole control of the surplus through the years of accumulation. The preferred mechanism by which the surplus is to be divided annually must be periodical payments. They are variable, which lump sum orders are not. They can, therefore, reflect fluctuations in the payer&#8217;s income. They are determined by the court in the event of dispute. They terminate on the remarriage of the recipient. The practicality of such an order will depend upon many factors. Essentially the completion of the process must be foreseen within a relatively short span. A term of 5 years which these cases illustrate may be towards the limit of the foreseeable.&#8221;</p>

There is no obvious solution proposed by the statutory considerations under section 25(2). There is no body of case law to inform the court as to how, in the instant case, it might go about its duty in deciding what share of surplus income the wife should have. I have, of course, read and reread <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McFarlane; Parlour</span>. But those cases were concerned with a principle which is not in dispute before me, namely that the court must strive, where appropriate, to bring about a clean break between husband and wife and that may involve transferring surplus income to the wife from the husband. Having made its deliberation on the principle, the Court of Appeal restored the District Judge&#8217;s award to Mrs McFarlane (but made it subject to an extendable term) and adopted the figure of 37.5% for Mrs Parlour in order to put that principle into practice. More particularly it did not enunciate specific guidelines or parameters within which a court should assess what actual percentage of the husband&#8217;s net income should be subjected to a periodical payments order in a case when the net income substantially exceeded the needs (generously construed) of the parties and their children. That is hardly surprising since no argument was addressed to the Court of Appeal upon the application of section 25A &#8211; see paragraph 119 of the judgment of Latham L.J.</p>

Having cited the familiar passage from Lord Nicholl&#8217;s speech, Thorpe L.J. asked at paragraph 105 why the principle defined should not be of equal application in the assessment of periodical payments.

The judges must remain focused on the statutory language, albeit recognising the need for evolutionary construction to reflect social and economic change. The statutory checklist and the overall circumstances of the case allow the judge to reflect factors which are said to be inherent in either the entitlement model or the compensation model. But to adopt one model or another or a combination of more than one is to don a straitjacket and to deflect concentration from the statutory language. Clearly in the assessment of periodical payments, as of capital provision, the overriding objective is fairness. Discrimination between the sexes must be avoided. The cross-check of equality is not appropriate for a number of reasons. First, in many cases the division of income is not just between the parties, since there will be children with a priority claim for the costs of education and upbringing. Secondly, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead suggested the use of the cross-check in dividing the accumulated fruits of past shared endeavours. In assessing periodical payments the court considers the division of the fruits of the breadwinner&#8217;s future work in a context where he may have left the child-carer in the former matrimonial home, where he may have to meet alternative housing costs and where he may have in fact or in contemplation a second wife and a further child.&#8221;</p>

I, therefore, agree that where the payer&#8217;s income is sufficiently large (as here) a cut-off point for periodical payments based on generously interpreted needs, thereby leaving a large surplus of income for the payer to do with as he pleases, has no foundation in the statute and is discriminatory. But the danger of this approach seems to me to be that it runs the risk to reintroducing the repealed tailpiece of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial causes Act 1973</ref> by the back door.

That is inevitable when the courts are working out the exercise of the wide powers given by a statute like the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. It is the essence of such a discretionary situation that the court should preserve, so far as it can, the utmost elasticity to deal with each case on its own facts. Therefore, it is a matter of trial and error and imagination on the part of those advising clients. It equally means that decisions of this court can never be better than guidelines. They are not precedents in the strict sense of the word. There is bound to be an element of uncertainty in the use of the wide discretionary powers given to the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>, and no doubt there always will be, because as social circumstances change so the court will have to adapt the ways in which it exercises discretion.

I do not want to belittle the importance of the &#8220;step&#8221;; indeed a better and more descriptive word might be &#8220;bridge&#8221;. Nevertheless the payments that I am being asked to sanction cannot be more than payments on account of an undefined and indefinable amount to be finally assessed, if it cannot be agreed, in four or five years time.

On the other hand if the subtext of Miss Theis&#8217; argument is that the court must proceed with caution given that its ability to second guess the future is restricted then I think she is on firmer ground.</p>

There is a priority claim of the children of &#163;80,000 per annum for periodical payments and school fees (which will inevitably increase over the next four years). The accumulated fruits of past shared endeavours have been determined in the division of capital I have made. The husband now has N to support and to an extent her two children, whose father, in the context of the husband&#8217;s lifestyle, is making a very modest contribution financially. That is not a criticism of their father but I have no doubt that the husband will subsidise their living costs, particularly after he buys a new home for them all to live in, and their holidays and sundry other expenditure. Further, periodical payments are capable of variation. As the husband&#8217;s income is bound to drop dramatically when he ceases to play football, it seems to me the wife cannot expect to be maintained thereafter at the rate of &#163;120,000 per annum.

It would provide savings for the wife over four years of &#163;860,800 (i.e. &#163;1,038 million x 40% = &#163;415,200 less &#163;200,000 per annum maintenance for the wife and children = &#163;215,200 x 4 = &#163;860,800). If, after receipt of &#163;900,000, the wife paid off the mortgage on property B (thereby releasing the husband), and remortgaged it in the sum of &#163;200,000 she would have remaining cash of approximately &#163;300,000. In addition she will have the net equities of properties D and C, less CGT, of &#163;240,718, the insurance policies of &#163;75,862 and approximately &#163;73,000 of the balancing payment after paying the balance of her costs. Thus she would have assets of &#163;1,550,380. In addition, the net equity (if remortgaged as above) of property B would be worth, on current values, &#163;1,150,000. Property B is not, of course, a free asset but if and when it is appropriate for the wife to move to less expensive and smaller accommodation, then capital can be released for investment to produce income. I consider such a result to be fair and just in all the circumstances of the case and meets the objective placed on the court by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>A(1) and (2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973, as amended.</p>
