I explained (paras 22-23) the reality that NHS England was in the hands of third parties, specifically the two clinicians and the relevant Secretary of State, whose various inputs were, as a matter of law, a pre-requisite to X&#8217;s transfer under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref>, but that the hope and expectation was that X would be transferred from ZX to ZZ on Thursday 10 August 2017. I said (para 24) that it was quite clear to me that X&#8217;s interests would best be served by her proposed transfer from ZX to ZZ on the Thursday. I concluded (para 25):</p>

My purpose in making an order in these terms is obvious. If need be, and I very much hope that the need will not arise, there will be a further hearing later this week.&#8221;</p>

In the event, the care plan, dated 9 August 2017, was filed on 11 August 2017. In her position statement dated 15 August 2017, the guardian endorsed the final care plan. So do I. The guardian drew attention to various matters which the local authority needs to bear in mind and keep under review. There is no need for me to go into the detail. I agree with the guardian.</p>

I made a care order, and approved a care plan for the baby prepared by the local authority which, in common with the care plan for the baby prepared by the Prison Service, provided for the baby to remain with the mother in prison until she was 18 months old. But I emphasised (see paras 17, 19) that nothing I was doing could bind the Secretary of State:</p>

What I am doing today &#8211; and all that I am doing today &#8211; is to make a care order pursuant to Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and, as part of that process, endorsing and approving the care plan promoted by the London Borough of Islington. I am not concerned today either to approve or to disapprove the care plan which has emerged as part of the Prison Service&#8217;s decision making, although if this assists the Prison Service and the Secretary of State I can say that the plan seems to me to accord entirely with the best interests of the child. More specifically, it must be understood that nothing I have said today and nothing in the order I make can in any way fetter the power of the Secretary of State, if circumstances arise which justify such a decision, to decide that mother and baby should be separated before the baby has reached the age of 18 months.&#8221;</p>
