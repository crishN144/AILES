This marriage was not &#8220;registered&#8221; with the Ukrainian State authorities. According to the wife, they were well aware that the marriage should have been registered. On three occasions she attempted to register the marriage but the husband refused to cooperate. It is clear to me that registration in this context means the parties formally marrying according to Ukrainian law in what we would describe as a Registry Office. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No decree nisi or conditional order of nullity has been made in this case. Whether the court should make such an order in this case is the central issue I have to determine. Para 2 of Schedule 7 applies to &#8220;a spouse&#8221; who has obtained a nullity of marriage order. This gives rise to the question whether a party to a void marriage can literally be described as a spouse. The term a &#8220;void marriage&#8221; is an oxymoron because the very essence of what is called a void marriage is that the parties were never married in any shape or form and certainly were never spouses. This directly bears on the issues I have to determine and which I address below.</p>

Paragraph 3 of Schedule 7 permits the court to make such an order where cohabitants cease to cohabit. This puts a cohabitant applicant in a rather better position than a spouse applicant. Unlike the latter, the former does not have to wait until the court has conditionally terminated their union before his or her application can be heard. Nor does s/he have to wait until the court has finally terminated their union before the transfer can take effect. For cohabitants the only requisite condition for the application to be heard and to take effect is that the cohabitation has ceased. </p>

The Recorder asked on the husband&#8217;s behalf the questions he considered relevant to the issues for the court to determine. The court granted a transfer of tenancy to the wife on 25 March 2022 and ordered that the husband could continue to occupy the property for 14 days from the date of service of the order but had to vacate by 4 April 2022 in any event.</p>

On 29 March 2022 he&#160;then&#160;stayed by consent the order of 25 March 2022 due to concerns regarding the parties&#8217; marital status having been raised after the conclusion of the hearing. Specifically, the husband had pointed out that even if not validly married he and the wife were spouses for the purposes of para 2 and so in making the order before a decree nisi (as it was still called on that day) the court acted without jurisdiction. The court gave directions for the parties to file statements in relation to the marriage ceremony. On 14 April 2022 Recorder Allen KC gave a supplemental judgment and lifted the stay of the order of 25 March 2022. He did not consider that there was a need to try the issue of the validity of the parties&#8217; marriage for the purposes of the application before him. He ordered the husband to vacate the property by 12 May 2022 and extended the time for seeking permission to appeal to the same date.</p>

The first ground of appeal is that the Recorder was wrong to have made a transfer of tenancy order without first determining whether the parties were legally married. Therefore the other seven grounds depend on whether the judge had jurisdiction to make the transfer of tenancy in the first place. Regarding the first ground of appeal, the husband made a preliminary application pursuant to FPR 30.9 to amend the ground so as to read:</p>

Following the rift with Rome, freed from curial domination, the common law judges created the concept of the voidable marriage. This was a marriage which was treated as valid until it was annulled by the court. The foremost example of a voidable marriage was the unconsummated marriage. In truth, this was a divorce by another name (and indeed in Canon law a marriage <span style="font-style:italic">ratum sed non consummatum </span>has always been, exceptionally, dissoluble by the Pontiff). </p>

Offences necessarily presuppose duties. There are no conjugal duties, but those which are expressed or implied in the contract of marriage. And if the compact of a polygamous union does not carry with it those duties which it is the office of the marriage law in this country to assert and enforce, such unions are not within the reach of the law.

Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Act did not seek to deal with entrenched legal concepts relating to capacity or consent. It was concerned only with due form. It did not apply to the marriages of Jews, Quakers or the Royal Family. All other marriage ceremonies had to be under the Anglican rite, which in turn required certain specified regulatory formalities. The requirement that the marriage ceremony had to be under the Anglican rite was removed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/6-7/85" uk:canonical="1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Marriage Act 1836</ref>, but the formal requirements remained.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The effect of the Court of Appeal judgment is therefore as follows. The age-old taxonomy of valid, void and voidable marriages, formally confirmed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/44" uk:canonical="1971 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1971 Act</ref>, is undisturbed. On an application relating to these concepts the court is empowered to award matrimonial relief. In the case of divorce, the relief is a divorce order dissolving the marriage; in the case of a void marriage it is a nullity order that operates as a declaration that there is not and never has been a marriage; and in the case of a voidable marriage it is a nullity order that operates as a declaration that there is not and never has been a valid marriage, but for all practical and legal purposes such a union is to be treated as  a valid marriage until the date of the order. However, if the application concerns a marriage in England and Wales which is said to be void because of non-compliance with certain formal requirements stipulated in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref> the court will entertain the application if, and only if, the ceremony otherwise broadly complied with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8216;As stated in paragraph 2 of the Report, the Bill codifies the English domestic law of nullity but does not attempt to deal with problems of conflict of laws. Accordingly, subsection (1) makes it clear that clause 1 or 2 does not preclude the English courts from determining the question of the validity of a marriage in accordance with the rules of a foreign country where our rules of private international law so require. This has a two-fold application. First, a marriage governed by foreign law may be valid notwithstanding that it would be void under clause 1 or voidable under clause 2 if it were governed by English law. For example, notwithstanding clause l (a)(ii) it will be valid although one party was under the age of sixteen years if valid in the country where it was celebrated and by the law of the parties&#8217; domicil. Secondly, the marriage may be void or voidable if defective according to the law of the place where it was celebrated or that of the parties&#8217; domicil, notwithstanding that it would not be void or voidable under clause 1 or 2. This might be so, for example, where the applicable law had wider prohibited degrees, a higher minimum age or additional grounds of voidability.&#8217; </p>

That seems to me to state the obvious. However, this principle does not tell us precisely what the remit of the foreign law determination is. In my judgment, the binding determination by the foreign law does not necessarily come to a halt at the question of the validity of the ceremony. If the foreign law not only determines the question of validity, but also determines the ramifications of invalidity (if found), then in my judgment that corollary should also be binding, provided that it is not obviously contrary to justice.</p>

As referred to above, I consider that the effect of the expert evidence is simply that, as a legal marriage was not effected, there is no marriage. It is clear that Syrian law has no separate concepts of a marriage being void or voidable or a non-marriage. It would appear, in the circumstances of this case, that a marriage will either be legal or not legal &#8211; the marriage in this case is clearly not valid and has been described as being either a &#8216;non-approved&#8217; marriage or a &#8216;non-marriage&#8217;. As described above, it would be simplistic merely to take the words &#8216;non-marriage&#8217; or even &#8216;non-existent&#8217; marriage and apply those words in an English law sense when Syrian law does not have the same terms. </p>

As referred to above, both parties knew they were participating in a marriage ceremony. It was a ceremony which was capable of being made formally valid because permission could have been obtained as part of the registration process following the marriage. It was a ceremony which was capable of conferring the status of husband and wife, if the parties had subsequently complied with the necessary formalities. To adopt Coleridge J&#8217;s words, it is not &#8216;so deficient&#8217; that it can be described in English law terms as a &#8216;non-marriage&#8217;.</p>

I do not consider that this is to give the marriage any greater effect than it has under Syrian law because as described above a void marriage could be described as no marriage or a non-existent marriage or, even, a non-marriage but for the way in which these latter terms are used under English law.&#8217;</p>

		</authorialNote>. In that case an elaborate Christian ceremony of marriage took place in South Africa although it was made deliberately defective (for example by leaving out key words at the exchange of vows) so that it did not produce a valid marriage under the local law. The reason for this was that the defendant, an atheist Jew, did not want to be married in a Christian ceremony. Therefore, the parties agreed that there would be a Christian ceremony which looked very much like a marriage, but that they would in fact be later properly legally married in a registry office on their return to this country. Needless to say, their relationship broke down before they could get to a registry office here. Bodey J heard expert evidence as to what South African law, the proper law, would say about the validity or otherwise of the so-called marriage. He rejected the opinion of the wife&#8217;s expert that the parties had in fact concluded a valid marriage; he accepted the opinion of the husband&#8217;s expert that a court in South Africa would find the ceremony to amount to a void marriage and that there would be a judgment or order issued to that end. In [40] Bodey J held that under South African law &#8220;Miss Hudson would be entitled to a decree of annulment, rather of divorce.&#8221; </p>

It provides for automatic invalidation of marriages where there was a prior subsisting marriage, or close consanguinity, or mental incapacity. It provides for mandatory invalidation in cases where a judge has found that there was a want of free consent, or where the marriage was a sham. It provides for discretionary invalidation where a judge has found remoter degrees of consanguinity, where in the case of a young person the necessary consent has not been given, and where ill-health has been concealed. Where a marriage is invalidated, either automatically, or in the exercise of judicial discretion, the parties lose all spousal rights and their property is divided between them as if they were cohabitants. However, some spousal relief may be awarded where a party was found to have been unaware of the impediment to forming a valid marriage.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I have been referred to a decision of the Ternopil City District Court dated 25 April 2016 where a Swedish man married in Sweden an Ukrainian woman he had met online. However, after the marriage the husband flatly refused to live with, or have anything to do with, the wife apart from demanding that she pay his debts of &#8364;500,000. The wife petitioned for an annulment of the marriage claiming that it was fictitious in that the husband never had an intention of creating a family or acquiring the rights and obligations of the spouse. The claim was upheld the court holding that the wife did not give free consent. The court went on to hold pursuant to article 45(1) of the 2002 family code of Ukraine that a marriage declared invalid by a court decision did not constitute a basis for the rights and obligations of spouses. This provides:</p>

The nearest provision in the 2002 code is article 48 which refers to a marriage which is &#8220;non-concluded&#8221;. Such a state of affairs would arise if a marriage is registered (i.e. formed) in the absence of one or both parties. The SJE&#8217;s evidence shows that this provision is used where a marriage has been fraudulently contracted for example where a signature of a spouse has been forged, or where an alleged marriage simply did not occur. In such a situation the record of the marriage is removed from the register at the behest of a judge. This would not be an apt process if there was a challenge for lack of due form.</p>

From 2002, under Article 74 of the 2002 Code they would be treated as if they were married de facto and from that point their property would be divided between them by reference to the same rules that would apply if they were married. These rights would derive from their cohabitation and not from their unregistered marriage in the Iranian embassy. Further, under Article 91, with effect from 2002, maintenance may be ordered to be paid to a long-standing cohabitant if that person has become unable to work or is living with their child. Again, this right to claim maintenance derives from cohabitation and has nothing to do with an unregistered marriage.</p>

This ceremony will not be afforded any recognition in any shape or form. Nor is it a ceremony which can be subsequently ratified by an administrative step (unlike the marriage in <span style="font-style:italic">Asaad v Kurter</span> which is best seen as a marriage which was at its formation conditionally void). The &#8216;registration&#8217; referred to above would not ratify the Iranian embassy ceremony. On the contrary, it would be an actual original marriage. </p>

It is true that the parties have relied on the marriage as being valid; and they secured the wife&#8217;s entry into this country on the basis that they were validly married. However, while Ukrainian law unsurprisingly does not have a concept of a non-marriage, the SJE is equally clear that the ceremony in the Iranian embassy gave no rights to either party to seek anything.</p>

There are many religious (usually Islamic) marriages solemnised in private dwellings in gross disregard of our laws (or the host country&#8217;s laws) concerning the due form for such ceremonies. According to the judges these ceremonies are so irregular that they amount to non-qualifying ceremonies, a feature of which is that no primary or ancillary matrimonial relief may be awarded. Yet, the ceremony is a valid marriage in the minds of the parties and probably would be recognised as valid by the entire Islamic world. In my opinion the situation is a disreputable mess and urgently needs to be definitively clarified both substantively and procedurally.</p>

Unfortunately, I cannot grant a leapfrog certificate under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1969</ref> as there is no Court of Appeal binding authority on the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.14</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and the rules of private international law on the treatment of defective overseas ceremonies of marriage. Further, this being an appeal I cannot grant permission for there to be a second appeal to the Court of Appeal. Under CPR 52.7 only the Court of Appeal can do that. It would therefore seem, by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/15/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 15(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1969 Act</ref>, even if there had been such binding authority no certificate could be granted by me under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12(1)</ref> as I do not have the power to grant leave to appeal.</p>
