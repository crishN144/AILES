	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in"><span style="color:#000000">There are four applications before me that concern two children in connected proceedings. Both children are Romanian nationals. The first set of proceedings concerns a sixteen year old child whom I will identify as LB. The second set of proceedings concerns LB&#8217;s young child who is six months old. I will identify her as S. In September 2021, when LB was fifteen years old, she presented unaccompanied to a hospital where S was born.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in"><span style="color:#000000">Concerns about both children&#8217;s circumstances caused the police to exercise their protective powers. Subsequently, the local authority applied to the court for public law orders in respect of both children. The local authority&#8217;s concerns included child trafficking and the possibility of LB being forced to marry. Both children were placed in a &#8216;mother and baby&#8217; foster placement pursuant to an interim care plan that was approved by the court on 1 October 2021 when the court made each of the subject children subject to an interim care order.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in"><span style="color:#000000">On 3 November 2021, LB left the placement, leaving S behind. The local authority asserts that LB was wrongfully removed from the jurisdiction and this was facilitated by her family. LB&#8217;s whereabouts have been uncertain, although more recently there is evidence to suggest that she is residing in Romania with her parents. She wishes to remain living in Romania and for S to join her. The local authority contends that in circumstances in which it is unable to exercise its shared parental responsibility for LB, she should be made a ward of the court and the court should continue to demand her return to England (&#8216;this jurisdiction&#8217;) until at least the conclusion of the provisional fact finding hearing that is listed to commence in September of this year. Finally, S&#8217;s father (&#8216;AB&#8217;), who has been seeing his daughter remotely, wishes to progress his contact to face to face meetings. He invites the court to order that contact should progress as soon as possible. </span></p>

S&#8217;s guardian opposes the applications for transfer in respect of S.

The Commission rejected by a strong majority a proposal by the Australian, Irish, British and United States delegations favourable to the perpetuatio fori.</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Certain delegations explained their negative vote by their hostility to the very principle of perpetuatio fori in this field and wanted jurisdiction to change automatically in case of a change of habitual residence, while other delegations thought that it would be more simple for the Convention not to say anything on this subject thereby abandoning to the procedural law the decision on perpetuatio fori. The first opinion appeared to be the more exact in the case of a change of habitual residence from one Contracting State to another Contracting State. Indeed it is not acceptable that in such a situation, which is located entirely within the interior of the scope of application of the Convention, the determination of jurisdiction be left to the law of each of the Contracting States. Moreover this solution is one which currently prevails for the interpretation of the Convention of 5 October 1961. On the other hand, in the case of a change of habitual residence from a Contracting State to a non-Contracting State, Article 5 ceases to be applicable from the time of the change of residence and nothing stands in the way of retention of jurisdiction, under the national law of procedure, by the authority of the Contracting State of the first habitual residence which has been seised of the matter, although the other Contracting States are not bound by the Convention to recognise the measures which may be taken by this authority.&#8221;</span></p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court's analysis when deciding the critical question which is&#160;where&#160;is the child habitually resident and not, simply, when was a previous habitual residence lost</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;.</span></p>

Within this context, I am inclined to share the obiter view expressed by Cobb J in&#160;</span><span style="color:#000000">In re NH (1996 Child Protection Convention: Habitual Residence)</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#160;that the question of habitual residence for the purposes of articles 5 and 6 of the 1996 Hague Convention falls to be decided as at the date on which that question comes before the court for determination, in this case at this hearing. The corollary of this conclusion is, of course, that it will be important that the question of habitual residence in cases engaging the 1996 Hague Convention is determined without delay, in order to avoid the question of habitual residence being determined simply by mere effluxion of time over the course of protracted proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

This is what the father describes in his skeleton argument as the habitual residence basis of jurisdiction. Indeed, in contrast to BIIA, which contains a lex perpetuato fori provision in the 1996 Hague Convention makes provision for jurisdiction to transfer where habitual residence changes to another contracting state, but as Nepal is not a contracting state, I need not consider how that operates in the abstract. I'm prepared to accept that the proper interpretation of article 5 requires the court to consider habitual residence at the time the court was seized of the application in these circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

This might be the case if a child habitually resides with his or her parents in a Contracting State other than that of the child&#8217;s nationality and both parents are killed in an accident. The child will be very likely to return to the State of nationality where the other members of his or her family reside, and the authorities of the habitual residence may think that the best interests of the child are for his or her protection to be organised by the authorities of the country of nationality&#8221;.</span></p>

Some of the same factors may be relevant to both. But it is clear that they are separate questions and must be addressed separately. The second one does not inexorably follow from the first. The question remains, what is encompassed in the &#8220;best interests&#8221; requirement? The distinction drawn in In re I <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 AC 319" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 AC 319</ref> remains valid. The court is deciding whether to request a transfer of the case. The question is whether the transfer is in the child&#8217;s best interests. This is a different question from what eventual outcome to the case will be in the child&#8217;s best interests. The focus of the inquiry is different, but it is wrong to call it &#8220;attenuated&#8221;. The factors relevant to deciding the question will vary according to the circumstances. It is impossible to be definitive. But there is no reason at all to exclude the impact upon the child&#8217;s welfare, in the short or the longer term, of the transfer itself. What will be its immediate consequences? What impact will it have on the choices available to the court deciding upon the eventual outcome? This is not the same as deciding what outcome will be in the child&#8217;s best interests. It is deciding whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the court currently seised of the case to retain it or whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the case to be transferred to the requested court.&#8221;</span></p>

I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention &#8211; risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment &#8211; is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention. </span></p>

The inherent jurisdiction with respect to children is exercised by reference to the child's best interests, which are the court's paramount concern. Whilst under its inherent jurisdiction, the court may make any order or determine any issue in respect of a child and whilst, therefore, the jurisdiction of the court under the inherent jurisdiction is theoretically unlimited, there are, in fact, far-reaching limitations on the exercise of the jurisdiction (see Re X (A Minor)(Wardship: Restriction on Publication) [1975] All ER 697 at 706G). The boundaries of the inherent jurisdiction, whilst malleable and moveable in response to changing societal values, are not unconstrained. </span></p>

However, wardship is only one manifestation of the inherent jurisdiction with respect to children. Subject to the distinguishing characteristics of wardship being that custody of the child is vested in the court and that, although day to day control is vested in the individual or local authority, no important step can be taken in the child's life without the court's consent, the jurisdiction in wardship and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court are the same (see Re Z (a minor)(freedom of publication) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 1</ref>). In the circumstances, the inherent jurisdiction in respect of children can be invoked without the use of wardship (see Re W (A Minor)(Medical Treatment: Court's Jurisdiction) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 64</ref>).

On one account she came to the UK when aged thirteen, fell in love and insisted that she stayed living in the UK. By another account, this was a visit that was prolonged by the expiration of her passport and the global pandemic. There is a profound professional concern about LB&#8217;s circumstances and welfare. Such are the concerns that the local authority now seeks very serious findings about the family. Broadly, the local authority alleges that the adults have conspired to arrange for LB to be married to AB despite her (their) young age, conspired to lie to the UK authorities about her circumstances, kept her invisible to the UK authorities by not registering her with any health and education services, failed to protect her from AB who has allegedly raped another child under the age of sixteen, S has been neglected through a lack of antenatal care and both children have been abandoned with LB initially in this jurisdiction and latterly her wrongful removal from this jurisdiction by the family, abandoning S. The local authority&#8217;s allegations are now provisionally listed to be determined in September of this year.</p>

She stayed with AB&#8217;s parents and the two commenced a relationship after falling in love. The relationship was kept a secret from the adults and she maintains that she was unaware of the police investigations concerning AB. Following S&#8217;s birth, she was scared and lonely in foster care. This was the first time she had lived outside of her culture and the language barrier contributed to her sense of loneliness. In November 2021, she was crying in a nearby park. She came across a Romanian woman who offered to take her to Spain. She denies any of her family members were involved in any arrangements to move her away from this jurisdiction. LB is very clear that she loves S and wants to care for her in Romania with the help of her parents.</p>

She states she and her children lived in Spain and this was where LB lived for most of her life. They travelled to Romania for holidays and during one such visit LB and AB met. Eventually, LB persuaded her parents to allow her to visit the UK. This was never intended to be for more than two months, although in her first statement she states that this was to be for no more than four or five months. However, LB kept prolonging her stay and eventually the global pandemic intervened by prolonging her stay even further. She and her husband (&#8216;MAB&#8217;) gave her cousins (AB&#8217;s parents) a power of attorney that allowed LB to travel with them to England for tourism between 13 September 2019 and 13 September 2021. LB arrived in England on 17 September 2019. MB expressed her concern about LB not being registered with the health authority and that she had missed her education in Spain. She was informed by AB&#8217;s mother (&#8216;LET&#8217;) that LB was pregnant. LB was about six to eight months pregnant at the time. She further states that when in hospital, AB&#8217;s parents lied about LB&#8217;s circumstances as they were ashamed of their son and the pregnancy. She further concedes that her husband lied to maintain a consistent account. Finally, the family had planned to arrange for LB to go back to Romania before the proceedings had commenced. Her account as set out in her first statement is corroborated by MAB.</p>

The evidence that is before the court raises two opposing scenarios, one in which the two children are at grave risk of harm and the other in which a child has determined that she wished to stay in England where she fell in love and later became pregnant. Subsequently she made a decision to leave the jurisdiction without involving her family. On any view this illustrates the necessity and the importance of determining the factual issues in this case. This can only happen in the English courts if I determine that this court has jurisdiction to do so.</p>

To do otherwise would be perverse and would render the provisions of Art. 7 superfluous or meaningless. The terms of Art. 7(2) are very clear in this regard.</p>

This is subject to review particularly where the principle of<span style="font-style:italic"> perpetuatio fori </span>is not in operation. Furthermore, the Romanian authorities have not sought to challenge this court&#8217;s jurisdiction. This is an important factor but it is not determinative. The evidence before me would suggest that before her arrival in England, LB was habitually resident in Spain. Whatever the intention of LB or her parents in September 2019, notwithstanding the lack of detail in the evidence that is before me, it is clear to me that over time LB became increasingly integrated within the family in England and within life in this jurisdiction. Her conduct and intentions must be assessed in light of her culture and family practices. She was not registered with health or education authorities, these being classic examples of integration that can support a finding of a change in habitual residence.  It is not necessary for me to determine at this stage whether there was an instantaneous change in her habitual residence or whether this was over a longer period of time. It is however clear to me that at some time before her arrival in this jurisdiction or soon thereafter, she was involved in a significant relationship which persisted for a significant period and a child has been born from this relationship. In my judgment this illustrates a degree of integration within the family and within life in England. On her parents&#8217; evidence LB has prolonged her stay in England which is to some degree illustrative of her intentions. Her parents&#8217; evidence also seems to suggest that her care was effectively delegated to her relatives in England. For example, the mother did not raise any concerns about the lack of registration with health authorities until these proceedings had commenced and her family in this jurisdiction appear to have assumed a degree of financial responsibility for her. I note that by November 2021, LB had lived in England for two years. </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">45 The modification to which I have referred concerns the drawing of adverse inferences in claims for ancillary financial relief in matrimonial proceedings, which have some important distinctive features. There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.&#8221;</span></p>

In my judgment, any argument that the local authority has acquiesced in LB&#8217;s wrongful retention outside of this jurisdiction is unsustainable.

LB is sixteen years old and her views must be given significant weight in assessing what is best for her. However those views are not determinative and must be considered in the context of all of the evidence before the court that includes her vulnerabilities and her life circumstances. As I have set out earlier in this judgment, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate what the final outcome in these proceedings may be. It may be that LB&#8217;s wishes do come to fruition. These do not form part of my assessment of what is best for her when considering this application. Given the concerns about her as detailed in the local authority&#8217;s schedule of findings and what I have observed further below I do not find that it would be in LB&#8217;s interest that these proceedings be transferred. Accordingly, I refuse the application to transfer the proceedings concerning LB to the Romanian courts.

Her guardian has filed a very helpful and detailed analysis in support of LB&#8217;s application for the transfer of these proceedings and opposition to making her a ward of court. The guardian most helpfully sets out the relevant cultural issues that have contributed to both children&#8217;s circumstances.

She observes that LB has been clear about not wishing to return to the UK and even if the practical difficulties in returning her could be overcome, she is likely to abscond from any placement and place herself in greater danger. Such an order would add to her fears and anxieties.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">LB&#8217;s guardian, whose expertise and opinion I hold in the highest regard, has a distinct advantage of familiarity with the culture and the language of the family. Her careful analysis has inevitably involved an element of risk assessment that has informed her conclusions on what best serves LB&#8217;s interest. I am slow to disagree with the opinion of a guardian whose experience and expertise are of the highest calibre. However, in this instance, her opinion seems to place little weight on the serious allegations against LB&#8217;s parents, AB and other members of the family. Whilst the cultural norms must be respected and tolerated even when they are in conflict with the customs and conventions in this jurisdiction, illegality and disregard for the law cannot be ignored. Furthermore, LB&#8217;s apparent vulnerabilities as cited above and the influence of the adults in her life cannot be disregarded or understated. LB is a child who now appears to be in the care of her parents. Her parents have thus far failed to facilitate her return to this jurisdiction despite being ordered to do so. Her needs include a need to bond and care for her own child. In my judgment, the unusual circumstances of this case demand that LB is protected and that she remains a ward of the court. I give no directions for any arrangements concerning where and with whom she is to live but repeat the previous orders that she must be returned to this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">Turning to the arrangements concerning S&#8217;s contact with her father, I note that he had his first and thus far last direct contact with S in December 2021. I also note that this was a largely positive contact. AB has since maintained a consistent desire to see his daughter. This desire has been not been met as the local authority remains concerned about a possible risk of sexual harm that he may present to S and the risk that S may be abducted. As to the former, I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that S would be at risk of sexual harm, particularly in the confines of a supervised setting. This issue may be further assessed once the fact finding in this case has concluded. The latter issue is much more present and is a major limb of the findings that the local authority is seeking.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">In previous hearings, I have been informed that the father has not taken up the opportunity of all of the virtual contact sessions and has missed a significant proportion of them. This has raised further concerns about the father&#8217;s commitment to maintaining contact with S. To address the latter two concerns, I have invited the father to demonstrate a period of commitment by attending all of the available virtual contact sessions and engaging in some supportive work with the allocated social work team so that the local authority can better manage the perceived risk of abduction and meaningful contact can progress and be sustained. This work was intended to be concluded within weeks. Regrettably, AB has not engaged with the programme that was on offer and has missed more of his contact with S.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">I note that AB is a teenager and understandably feeling a great deal of frustration that his contact with S has not progressed at the speed that he had hoped for. I have no doubt that this has contributed to his lack of engagement in all of the contact sessions and giving the impression that he is perhaps less committed that he would want to be. Despite his youth, AB is now a father and as a parent he must prioritise the needs of his child over and above others, including himself. S&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration and I must decide this issue by reference to the welfare checklist as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. The real issue is AB&#8217;s capacity as a parent to commit and maintain a consistent and safe pattern of contact which would serve S&#8217;s best interest. Sadly, the evidence that is before me does not at this stage allow me to conclude that AB can do this. Therefore, all I can do at this stage is to offer the father another opportunity to commit to contact with S and to undertake a short, focused piece of work that has been offered by the local authority before face to face contact can begin. I know that at present the father has a great deal to contend with and if he requires more time, then he must be frank with himself and the professionals about what he can realistically commit to. I have every confidence that the local authority will accommodate any reasonable request that he makes to ensure that he has had every fair opportunity to deal with the identified concerns and to begin regular face to face contact with his daughter. Accordingly, I decline the invitation to make a contact order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s34</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. </p>

Therefore, in such circumstances the court must determine whether it had jurisdiction at the time the wrongful act was committed.

Namely whether another member state is </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;better placed&#8221; </span><span style="color:#000000">to hear the case and whether it is in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;best interest&#8221; </span><span style="color:#000000">of the relevant child that the proceedings are transferred. These are separate but interrelated questions, the answers to which may be informed by common relevant factors. The second question is separate and different to any welfare determination or final outcome of the case. The second question asks the court to decide if the transfer would be in the child&#8217;s best interest. This will includes consideration of the impact of any transfer (or refusal) on the child&#8217;s welfare and may encompass considerations of the impact of any transfer on the child&#8217;s short and long term welfare. This is different to the decisions of the court about the child&#8217;s welfare at the conclusion of the proceedings [Baroness Hale in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Re N (Children) (Adoption: Jurisdiction)</span><span style="color:#000000">].</span></p>
