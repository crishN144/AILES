Father&#8217;s position is that, whilst custody had been awarded to the mother, she did not have permission, and that decision did not give her permission to relocate the children to this jurisdiction without his knowledge and/or his consent. It is important that I determine as an initial decision whether or not I accept that this is a case of a lawful relocation and/or whether this is a case in which the children have been unlawfully removed from Nigeria to this jurisdiction. I had in mind the Court of Appeal decision of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Re R and Y (Children)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> which sets out clear guidance as to the difference in approach to a lawful relocation as opposed to an unlawful removal.</span></p>

No notice has been given to the father that I would be sent these documents, and I initially made it clear that I would not read them until I had heard submissions in relation to them, however, it later transpired that they had been forwarded by the father&#8217;s team to the single joint expert and he had read them before giving his evidence and therefore to me that the proverbial cat was out of the bag and I ought to read them and no party objected to that.

The parties have been separated for over 2 &#189; years time. As will be explored further below, the circumstances in which the mother and the children came to be in the UK remain unclear. As evidence, however, there are two significant factors which form part of my welfare and overarching analysis: those are that the mother was at some point in 2022 diagnosed with Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma and was receiving treatment here in England (she being present in this jurisdiction on a graduate visa). The second is the allegations by the mother that she had been the victim of domestic abuse by the father.</span></p>

I note that the first time the children, or any one of them, travelled to the England was after the decision of the Nigerian court in January 2023. The mother accordingly accepts that she elected to travel alone to this jurisdiction and to leave the children in the care of their father or other trusted family members in Nigeria in October 2021, and from that period until she removed the children from him.</span></p>

It is the mother&#8217;s case that she applied for visas for the children to travel with her when she first came over to the England, but that the applications were refused. I know that the father works remotely as a certified cycle security analysis and there is a great deal of dispute between the parents as to their version of events: as to agreement between them regarding whether they would live together as a family in England if they were successful. I note, however, that the mother did not travel back to Nigeria until 29 December 2021, and there were significant periods of time when the children were cared for by either one of their parents. The father sets out that the mother has not explained why she elected not to remain in Nigeria in January 2022 but returned instead to the England. I noted that the mother was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma in April 2022 but at that stage the mother had already travelled without the children to live in the England.</span></p>

I have in the papers before me a document dated November 2022 which suggests that there was a complaint made by the father to the Deputy Commissioner of police that the mother had applied for passports and visas for the children to travel to the England without his consent. The Commissioner of police in Port Harcourt it seems notified the Controlling General of Immigration Services that they were investigating this complaint. </span></p>

It was put to him that there was evidence that the mother&#8217;s plan was to have the children with her in London. A suggestion was made that the mother&#8217;s address was plainly in London, but Mr Nsugbe noted both addresses had been used (England and Nigeria). Weight was placed on the fact that the father&#8217;s case was that the mother had all relevant documents for the children to come to England. There was, Mr Crawley said, a plan.</span></p>

He was plain that any assessment of the evidence was a matter for me, and that he could not assist by speculating as to what the Nigeria Judge knew, or had in his mind, at the time of that judgment in January 2023. He did not resile from his clear view that, in his opinion, the mother ought to have made an application to take the children to live in England. In answer to questions from Ms Guha he informed me that he had read all the documents with care, but could see no reference to an application by the mother to remove the children from Nigeria to England. He looked to whether the court had specifically addressed its mind to a permanent relocation and found nothing in the judgment that alluded to that point. I too, having read the judgment now several times, can see no reference to that application. He was clear to me that it was not an unusual step by a party to apply to the court for clarification and/or variation to enable a relocation.</span></p>

I note of course that the mother made an application on 23 February 2024 and Mr Nsugbe KC could not rule out that the hearing related to that motion.</span></p>

It would not be a quick process, but if by consent it may speed things up. He noted the presence already of the non-molestation order but confirmed to me that that was linked to the Port Harcourt state only.

If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible. A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this.

The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more than give the judge pause ... it may be a decisive factor. On the other hand, if it appears that the mother would not be able to make a good case for relocation, that factor might not be decisive.

It is a welfare determination in respect of which an array of factors will be relevant and which the court must balance when determining what order to make. As Lord Wilson said in Re NY, part of that exercise will include the court determining, in respect of all relevant matters, but in particular in respect of the matters set out in s 1(3) of the CA 1989 and any allegations of domestic abuse, whether, in order sufficiently to identify what the child&#8217;s welfare requires, the court should conduct an inquiry into any or all of those matters and, if so, how extensive that inquiry should be. </span></p>

Neither the absence of any fact-finding inquiry in respect of the mother&#8217;s allegations by the Dubai courts nor the fact that those allegations would not be relevant in any child proceedings in Dubai meant that the English court must undertake such an inquiry before determining whether to make a return order. As in all welfare decisions, the extent of the court&#8217;s inquiry and the court&#8217;s determination of what order to make will depend on the facts of the particular case. As Baroness Hale said in Re J (at para [37]), in respect of &#8216;different legal conceptions of welfare&#8217;: &#8216;Like everything else, the extent to which it is relevant that the legal system of the other country is different from our own depends upon the facts of the particular case ...&#8217; (my emphasis) &#8232;</span></p>

He flags the very serious concern he has had about where the children were living and what their life looked like here.</span></p>

Firstly, it is her case that the decision in the Nigerian courts awarding to her of custody of all three children gave her the permission to remove the children from Nigeria to live. Mr Crawley, who took me to the parts of the mother&#8217;s statement and evidence within the Nigerian proceedings in which the discussion around the relocation to England was debated, pointed out to me that the mother gave her addresses as her home within those proceedings: one being in Nigeria and one being in England. He points within the judgment and summary of proceedings of reference to living in London, and that there was reference to the father having a visa which meant he could visit the children in England. I note too that the father&#8217;s written address advises the court &#8220;not to be swayed to grant custody to the respondent based on her bogus claims of taking them to England and having gotten them a scholarship without any evidence to this.&#8221;</span></p>

His position is that the father has consented for children be in England. He reminds me that, in April 2021, the mother applied for a visa to study for three years as an undergraduate, and for her children and husband to join her. The father provided a letter of consent for his children to apply for a &#8216;dependent visa&#8217; to travel with his wife on 22 September 2021. The application for the children to join the mother in England was held up. I am told that, on 3 November 2021, the father was granted a visa to enter England freely until 31 December 2023 and it is submitted to me that shortly thereafter the father did indeed come to England and stayed with a family friend who was at that time living in Northampton. It is plainly the mother&#8217;s case there was express consent of the Nigerian court for the children to be removed from Nigeria to live with their mother in England whilst she was studying here. Further it is submitted to me by Mr Crawley that I can find that implicit consent from the cross-examination of the mother, that it says in the documentation that on 30 November 2022 the father knew that she  had every intention of taking all three children in England in January 2023. He refers me to the part of the documentation where the learned Judge in Nigerian notes that the mother had all necessary documents to remove the children from Nigeria to England. </span></p>

The evidence that the father took steps to place the children&#8217;s names on a watchlist, which I accept he did, lends weight to his arguments that he did not consent to their removal at the operative time, regardless of any earlier joint family decision. I concur with the views of Mr Nsugbe KC that one needs to look at the situation in January 2023 and the disputes between the parents. I looked too for evidence from the mother as to what plans she had to care for the children in England: where they would live, what schools they would go to etc. There was none, save as to the reference by the father&#8217;s lawyer in written closing submissions, that the court should not be taken in by the mother&#8217;s reference to having obtained scholarships for the children.</span></p>

I have asked myself the question why the mother would act in this way and fail to ensure that she abided by the court order if she was clear in her mind that the decision had permitted her to remove the children to Nigeria. I question to why she did not answer police bail and why she took no steps to secure &#8216;J&#8217;s move to her care under the custody order. I form the very clear view and find that the mother knew that she did not have permission to remove the children to England and acted in a clandestine way and one which breached the Nigerian court order for reasonable contact between the children.</span></p>

However, it is a fact that no allegations of risk of harm were made in those proceedings.

The children require stability and the opportunity to have secure and healthy relationships with both of their parents. They have no particular physical needs, but they do need to have a consistent education and stability in their education, which to date I find has been lacking. The children have a strong and clearly-expressed link to their Nigerian roots and culture. &#8216;M&#8217; was proud to be Igbu and expressed a clear wish to return to Nigeria, if only to visit people he misses there. A return to Nigeria would bring some stability, in particular with regard to the ongoing uncertainty of their visa status here in England.  I find that the children&#8217;s clear preference is to live with their mother, and this is the current legal status of the order in Nigeria. The mother can make a decision to care for her children in Nigeria under that order. I find that the risk of harm of the ongoing separation from their father and sister is greater than any risk of harm which the children may be exposed to by an order that they return to Nigeria. Living in this jurisdiction, the mother has struggled financially and has provided no evidence to me to assure the court, and indeed the father, that she is able to remedy that and meet the children&#8217;s needs. Against this the father is financially comfortable and there are orders in place that he assist the mother financially. </span></p>

I note too and find that N was clear that, whilst he did not want his father to beat him in that way, he was not scared of his father, missed him and wanted to see him.</span></p>

I have heard little &#8211; save, though, the voice of &#8216;M&#8217; as to his connections here, and note that these are recent in the making (&#8216;M&#8217; only having been at school since May 2023 and moving to a new home in recent weeks). I have given careful thought to the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse and her assertions that she would be at serious risk from the father were she return to Nigeria. I am fortified by not only the assurances the father has given to me, but also the fact that the mother has in place a protective order and that, with the father&#8217;s consent, which he has given to me, she could obtain another protective order in the federal court rather than the state court. </span></p>

There was no evidence that the mother was prepared to take the children back to Nigeria: notwithstanding that they so very much want to see their sister. I find that mother only enabled contact to take place once ordered by the court. It was a particular feature of this case that there were and are no proposals for contact and links to Nigeria. The longer the children remain in this jurisdiction away from their home country the more they would become connected to this jurisdiction and the harder it will be for them to leave in circumstances when neither currently have a visa to remain here.</span></p>

I am mindful too that both parents have throughout continued to engage in ongoing proceedings in Nigeria tasked with assessing the welfare of the children.

There is a significant risk that the mother will seek to frustrate the orders made by the court if this amendment is not made by failing to board the scheduled flight to exploit the fact that the father does not have the financial means to pay for repeat flight bookings.:&#8221;</span></p>

In my judgment the need for the children to establish their lives back in Nigeria where (save any appeal to set aside this decision), the mother now submits they should live with their father and sister. I have given careful consideration to the welfare benefits of the children remaining in their jurisdiction for the remainder of the academic year and in particular have regard to any possible changes in the mother&#8217;s health. This latter point concerns me as I heard evidence that N worries about his mother and I remain concerned that he will be here without the support of his father if his mother&#8217;s health matters become more acute. I continue to have no evidence about how the mother meets the children&#8217;s needs here and in my assessment their welfare needs are best met by an immediate return to their home country.</span></p>
