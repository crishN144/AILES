They are the parents of X, who is of primary school age.  X is a lively and very intelligent young boy.  He also has autism which brings with it a range of additional needs, including a dietary condition called &#8220;avoidant restrictive food intake disorder&#8221; and sensory modulation difficulties.</p>

The application is opposed by the father.  Both parents are of Asian origin.  The father grew up in Asia; the mother lived from her early years in Australia, living in City B until she was about 19 and then moving to Town L.  In his six years of life X has lived for substantial periods in Asia, Australia, and the United Kingdom.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2023 I gave a judgment at the conclusion of a fact-finding hearing in these proceedings, which was listed to determine allegations of domestic abuse.  In that judgment I set out a full background to the parents&#8217; relationship prior to their separation in 2022.  I will not repeat that background and so it is important that both of these judgments are read together.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Relevant findings for the purposes of this welfare hearing were as follows.  I found there had been occasions during the parties&#8217; relationship when arguments escalated to physical violence.  There was one occasion when the father threw a rolling pin at a wall and an incident in January 2022 which precipitated the separation when the mother hit the father with a metal plate.  I found that the mother had exaggerated and on occasion fabricated her allegations against the father.  I found that the mother had demonstrated rigid, demanding, and inflexible behaviour, and controlling behaviour over contact.  I found that the mother had been unjustifiably critical of the father and had showed a lack of insight or even interest in his feelings.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the fact-finding hearing both parents have continued to live in South London, in homes which are very close together.  Contact has been extended and now takes place on alternate weekends for three nights and additionally for one night each week, so that X spends five nights per fortnight with his father.  The contact arrangements have not gone entirely smoothly, and it will be necessary a little later in this judgment to review how they have worked.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">X&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration in these proceedings and I must have regard to the factors in the welfare checklist in section 1 (3) of the Children Act.  The presumption in section 1 (2)(a) of the Act applies in this case.  That requires the court to presume, unless the contrary is shown or where specific exceptions apply, that the involvement of both parents in the child&#8217;s life will further the child&#8217;s welfare.  There is a line of case law which deals with issues specific to relocation cases.  There is no issue between the parties as to the law and it is an area with which I am familiar.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reread the key authorities which are <span style="font-style:italic">Payne </span>in 2001, <span style="font-style:italic">K and K</span> in 2011, <span style="font-style:italic">Re F</span> [2017] 1 FLR 979, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> [2017] 1 FLR 1052.  A more recent decision of Williams J <span style="font-style:italic">V v M </span>[2020] EWHC 448 (Fam) provides a helpful summary of the previous authorities.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Those authorities set down two key principles.  First, the court is required to undertake a broad welfare evaluation, including not only the factors in the Children Act welfare checklist but also a range of other factors which arise frequently in relocation applications.  Those are set out in paragraph 50 of the judgment in Williams J in <span style="font-style:italic">V and M.</span>  They include consideration of the motivation and the plans of the relocating parents, the impact on that parent and consequently on the child of the application being refused, and the impact of a relocation on the child&#8217;s relationship with the left behind parent.  Determining those issues necessarily involves a careful and thorough analysis of each side&#8217;s proposals and the advantages and disadvantages of each option.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, as part of the process of carrying out the welfare evaluation, the court must have regard to the proportionality of each proposed option.  That is because one or both options in relocation cases are likely to involve a significant interference with both the child and the parents&#8217; Article 8 rights to respect for their private or family life.  Such interference can only be justified if it is a necessary and proportionate response, grounded in the child&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The bundle prepared for these proceedings has been unfortunately much longer than was necessary, and in addition to the core bundle I have been provided with what the parties have called a &#8220;supplementary bundle&#8221;, in direct contravention of the rules.  It is agreed between counsel that I need not read the supplementary bundle and I have not done so.  I think out of 1,000 pages in that bundle I was taken to two during the course of this hearing.  I make it clear that I have not read anything else, so this breach of the rules has not directly impacted on me or on the trial process; all it has done, I am afraid, is unnecessarily escalated the parties&#8217; costs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The 700 pages in the core bundle include some useful documentary evidence in the form of school reports and medical evidence that sheds light on the issues I have to decide, in particular X&#8217;s needs.  This evidence has been of particular importance because of X&#8217;s autism, and it has been necessary to understand how that impacts his needs.  The bundle also includes expert evidence on immigration issues.  The parties have been given permission to instruct two experts: one to advise on each parent&#8217;s immigration status in the United Kingdom, and the other on immigration issues connected with a potential move to Australia.  The immigration evidence is unchallenged and so neither expert has given live evidence.  It is, of course, significant, and I intend to deal with it a little later when I consider each parent&#8217;s immigration status here, and the options for them to live and travel elsewhere.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard oral evidence from three witnesses: each of the parents, and an independent social worker Melissa Wright, for whose instruction permission was granted after the fact-finding hearing.  Her report is dated 27 September 2023.  I regret to say that it has been some time since I read a report of such poor quality.  It has significant, obvious, and fundamental flaws.  I intend to highlight only the most troubling ones.  Ms Wright had no idea about the status of the findings made by this court in June 2023.  She referred in her evidence to my fact-finding judgment on several occasions as a &#8220;report&#8221;.  When the nature of a judgment was explained to her, and it was put to her that she had expressed views that were directly contradictory to my findings, she said simply that she needed to draw her own conclusions.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Wright&#8217;s report included the startling assertion that there were &#8220;likely elements of alleged domestic abuse perpetrated by the father, despite the allegations being denied&#8221;.  She went on to say that the fact-finding &#8220;investigation&#8221;, as she called it, had concluded that there was no evidence of domestic abuse, &#8220;due to lack of evidence, for example, not having police incident reports or photos&#8221;.  When it was put to her that this paragraph was inconsistent with any possible reading of my judgment, she argued that that was not the case, and insisted that she had in fact read my judgment several times.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The report contains no analysis of the mother&#8217;s ability or willingness to support X&#8217;s relationship with his father.  Given my findings that was obviously a crucial issue.  In her oral evidence Ms Wright repeatedly gave the bland and generic response to questions about this, that the parents needed to put their differences aside and work together for the sake of X.  That is no doubt true, but what was needed and expected from an independent social worker was an analysis of their ability to do that.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There was no consideration in the report of the arrangements for contact if the relocation were to take place.  Ms Wright, it seems, had not even considered the travel options and in her oral evidence did not appear to see why that would be a relevant issue.  There was therefore no consideration at all of the likely impact of a relocation on X&#8217;s relationship with his father, and finally no balancing of the advantages and disadvantages of each option.</p>

	  <num>16</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, Ms Wright&#8217;s oral evidence did not fill any of those gaps and only increased my concerns.  More than once she doubled down on her assertion that it is likely that the father perpetrated domestic abuse against the mother, saying for example that &#8220;we will never know what has happened behind closed doors&#8221;.  She dismissed my findings about the parents&#8217; respective roles in the relationship, the mother&#8217;s criticism of the father and her lack of insight, telling me simply that she had to stand by her own views.  It should not need saying that it is simply not open to a witness, including an expert witness, to reject the court&#8217;s findings of fact.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Beyond that, I formed the view that Ms Wright&#8217;s conclusions were themselves poorly reasoned and that she was repeatedly unable to give any basis for opinions that she asserted.  In some instances the basis for her opinion was the mother&#8217;s bare assertion, and she had to admit she had not considered any of the other evidence, including messages passing between the parties that might shed a different light.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considered whether it is any mitigation for Miss Wright that this was her first relocation case.  I do not think it is.  In my judgment, it was not because this was a relocation case that she went so wrong.  The errors are more fundamental.  Her evidence displayed a misunderstanding of her role and that of the court and a tendency to express views that were based, as far as can I see, on nothing of any substance.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The inevitable conclusion is that I cannot give any weight to Ms Wright&#8217;s conclusions and recommendation.  I make it clear that I do not disregard her evidence entirely.  I can put some weight on some limited parts of her evidence.  She spent some time with X and spoke to other professionals, including his school.  She has recorded the information that she gathered in her report.  The expectation, of course, is that this would enable her to build up a picture of X&#8217;s needs and to inform the court about issues, including the impact of his autism on his relationships and functioning.  To an extent Ms Wright did that; however, even those parts of her evidence need to be treated with some caution.  That is because, in my view, there were aspects of her approach even to ordinary social work issues that were unusual.  Just one example is that she seemed to place great weight on X&#8217;s expressed views, could not entertain any possibility that the underlying reality might be more nuanced, and referred more than once to what she described as X&#8217;s &#8220;decision&#8221; about a relocation, as though this were in some way determinative.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a great shame for the parties that they spent money on this expert and have gained so little value from her report.  She was not, I can see, the first choice of either of these experienced firms of solicitors.  For reasons I have not been able to go into, it seems that they found it very difficult to find an independent social worker with availability to complete the work.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence sets out in a witness statement in some detail her reasons for pursuing the application.  Town L is where she lived from 2012 until 2016, and again with X during the Covid lockdowns from 2020 to 2021.  Most importantly it is where her parents still live, and she has there a small but close network of others in the community and friends.  The mother&#8217;s case for a relocation is primarily focused on the instability of her current circumstances.  Her financial position is insecure and she faces some difficulties in securing immigration status in the United Kingdom.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Given the content of my fact-finding judgment, it is inevitable that there would be some focus at this hearing on the mother&#8217;s ability to support X&#8217;s relationship with his father if a relocation takes place.  I was therefore surprised to see that there was no acceptance or even acknowledgment of my findings in the mother&#8217;s witness statement.  Indeed, the theme of criticism of the father persisted, and it was quite hard to ascertain from the mother&#8217;s written statement what, if any, value she saw in X&#8217;s relationship with his father.  I therefore approached the mother&#8217;s oral evidence without any initial confidence that she had taken anything on board.  In fact, as the mother&#8217;s oral evidence progressed I thought I discerned some modest changes in approach.  She was able on occasion to look back at some of her past responses to the father&#8217;s actions and to admit the possibility that she had been mistaken.  On one occasion she told me spontaneously, and I think genuinely, that she had enjoyed looking though the photos the father had produced of his time spent with X because in her words they &#8220;showed me a very different H from what I have seen&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I fully acknowledge given the limited time since the fact-finding hearing and the obvious forensic advantage to the mother in demonstrating a change in perspective on this important issue, that I must treat these impressions with some caution, but I did consider that the mother&#8217;s oral evidence demonstrated at least the beginnings of a shift in approach.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s evidence was much as it was during the fact-finding hearing.  He opposes a relocation for what I am satisfied, and I do not think it is disputed, are entirely genuine and rational reasons.  He has been delighted to have spent much more time with X since the fact-finding hearing and to have been able to progress his relationship with his son whom he loves very deeply.  He was able to express frustration and disappointment at some of the mother&#8217;s behaviours, especially the behaviours that were the subject of a fact-finding hearing, but also able to accept that these were part of her personality and that he needed nevertheless to find a way of co-parenting with her in the future.</p>

That job is, of course, significant because it is his livelihood, but I know from the evidence I have reviewed at this hearing, and the more detailed evidence about the parties&#8217; backgrounds, which I considered during the fact-finding hearing, that when the family moved to London it was not the only option for them.  The father was honest enough to acknowledge that, and to accept that while he likes living in London and it is a good fit for him, particularly professionally, he has not yet established deep-rooted connections here himself.  </p>

After the fact-finding hearing it took the parents nearly three weeks to reach agreement on the interim arrangements for X.

In writing, prior to this hearing, the concern she raised was the possibility that the father might not return.  That concern was very obviously ill-founded.  In oral evidence the mother admitted, I thought honestly, that she could not see why the father should have a holiday with X when she herself was struggling financially and unable to pay her bills.  It is, I suppose, the case that the mother was not putting X&#8217;s best interests first when she resisted the proposal for a holiday, but I think her reaction was human and probably understandable.</p>

It is important to recognise that for much of X&#8217;s life it is the mother who has been in the driving seat when it comes to issues around his health and education.  It can sometimes be hard for a parent in that position to adjust their approach after separation and allow the other parent to play a full role.  I have some concern that the messages between the parents indicate that the mother has not always fully welcomed the father&#8217;s involvement.  She has not, for example, told him about the homework app used by the school.  There is an argument that the father might have found out some of these things for himself, but the spotlight in this application for obvious reasons is on the mother&#8217;s willingness to go out of her way to welcome and proactively support the father&#8217;s involvement in X&#8217;s life, and in my judgement she still has some way to go on this issue.</p>

Through his reports it is possible to identify X&#8217;s particular need for routine and order, his attention to detail, social anxiety and noise sensitivity as key features of his autism.  X can have meltdowns when overwhelmed by social or communication demands, and he needs help managing his emotions and his sensory responses.  X has seen a dietician for his food intake disorder.  His dietary issues have led to constipation in the past.

When faced with an activity for which he has not been properly prepared, or which he does not want to do, he can be forceful in resisting.  It is important to recognise that X has past experiences which are likely also to impact on his needs.  At the fact-finding hearing I found that he had been exposed to a parental relationship which was characterised by high levels of conflict.  Previous welfare evidence, which was available to me at the fact-finding hearing, suggested that when the parents were arguing in the home X would remove himself from the situation using headphones and an iPad to block out noise and calm himself.  Those experiences are likely to have impacted on his sense of psychological safety, and the consequences may well be felt in the longer term.</p>

The father himself said that it had been a learning curve for him after contact had become unsupervised at the end of the fact-finding hearing.  Food is a particularly difficult issue for X.

There can be no possible criticism of the father in this regard and the mother does not make any.  She herself pointed out that it is very necessary that the father should keep his job because the family&#8217;s livelihood, the father&#8217;s immigration status, and for the time being the mother&#8217;s and X&#8217;s, depend on it.

Her earnings are limited and even though her housing is modest &#8211; she and X share a one-bedroom flat &#8211; she faces a substantial shortfall each month in expenditure over income.

However, both parents have described how X&#8217;s autism means that he needs additional support with day-to-day routines.  I accept the mother&#8217;s case, because the evidence from the school paints the same picture, that it took a long time to settle him into the normal school routine and that the mother has not yet been able to put him into wraparound care.  She tried a childminder, but that was not successful and so at the moment X has to be taken to and collected from school by the mother, at the normal school times.  That is why the mother&#8217;s parents have been spending so much time in the UK, because in order for the mother to work at all she needs some support with childcare, and X needs that care to be provided by a family member that he knows well.</p>

The maternal grandmother gave up her job as a nurse to spend a period of several months in this country, but she intends to return to work and it is, of course, entirely reasonable that she would wish to do so.  The fact that X&#8217;s grandparents have spent such a long period of time in London demonstrates the extent of the mother&#8217;s need for their support, but it does not, in my judgement, lead to a conclusion that these arrangements can continue indefinitely. </p>

However, it is likely that at the end of the two-year period of support that the father has offered, the expectation on his side will be that the mother should have achieved a considerable degree of financial independence.  For the reasons I have given, I do not think that is realistic.  It is likely, therefore, that the father&#8217;s proposal will alleviate the position only in the short term and will leave the mother facing similar financial insecurity in a couple of years&#8217; time.  In the longer term, the difficulties that the mother faces in establishing a career which would give her some prospect of financial independence will remain.</p>

In many cases it is reasonable to expect the parent of a school aged child to develop social networks and integrate into the community.  For what it is worth I consider the mother to be the sort of person who in ordinary circumstances would be quite well placed to do that.  However, it is much harder for her to do that as X&#8217;s parent.  She has, I accept, worked to develop friendships and a community network, but these are often based on friendships between children and those clearly come much more slowly for X than for a different child.  A small piece of evidence was the fact that he has been invited to just two birthday parties since he has been at primary school.  That, I think, is an indication of the struggle that he experiences in forming the friendships that other children of his age are making relatively easily.  </p>

The expert is cautious as to the impact on Home Office decision-making of an order in this court preventing X from relocating to Australia on the basis of the impact that would have on his relationship with his father.  The evidence is that such an order would be likely to be taken into account particularly if accompanied, as, of course, it would be, by a judgment spelling out the reasons for the decision.  However, there is no guarantee that an order of the family court would carry decisive weight and effectively prevent the mother and X from being deported.  Again, the Home Office would be likely to look at other options which might enable all family members to continue living together, and Asia at least would be a possibility.</p>

There are no direct flights  between Town L and the UK.  That means that the burden of travel, including some adjustment time because of the time difference, is likely to be two days at each end of any trip.  The costs of each trip are likely to be in the region of &#163;3,500 to &#163;5,000.  The mother suggests that it may be possible for the father to visit X in Australia three times a year.  The father says that it is only realistic for him to visit once a year or possibly and at a maximum twice.  He has 25 days&#8217; holiday and he says that if he is going to spend two weeks with X each trip will take up, once one adds the travel time, 15 days of his overall holiday entitlement.</p>

The father points out that Town L has limited public transport.  He would need to stay in a hotel or, I suppose, an Airbnb.  He would not be able to offer X anything like a home environment.

If the mother&#8217;s financial position improves as a result of a move to Australia, as I think is likely, it seems to me that it should be possible for her to do the trip once a year, but probably not more than that.  The mother too will be working and given the distance and the travel time she would have to stay in the UK herself while X is spending time with his father.  That will use up a considerable amount of her own holiday entitlement.

It will be increasingly difficult for the father to maintain meaningful conversation, and so far the evidence suggests that indirect contact, for whatever reason, has not worked particularly well.  X is reluctant and quite often simply runs away when his father has tried to speak to him.  It seems to me unlikely in this case that indirect contact will offer much as a route to maintaining the relationship between X and his father.</p>

That will be exacerbated by the fact that there will be significant gaps between contact of probably three or four months on each occasion, which combined with the limited prospects offered by indirect contact mean that each time X sees his father they will be spending time rebuilding their relationship.

He sees it as a remote place, very different to London, and somewhere where the opportunities for someone with his cultural background, skillset, and life experience will be very limited indeed.  In addition to that, I am aware that the father&#8217;s relationship with the mother&#8217;s family is not warm and that might well impact his ability to integrate into the small Asian community there.

In his evidence the father agreed that either City A or City B would be likely to offer him some possible opportunities for employment.  He would probably have to take a step down.  The opportunities for career advancement are more limited than they are in London, but he could, if it was necessary, obtain employment that would allow him to live in another city in Australia.  That move could be achieved without imposing such a significant burden on the father.  The other side of the cosmopolitan nature of City B or City A and the accessibility of those cities is that they are themselves some distance from Town L, so in terms of the father&#8217;s relationship with X they would probably allow more frequent contact, but not facilitate the sort of arrangements that X enjoys at present.

This has been an unusually difficult relocation case where the court has been presented with two unpalatable alternatives driven by a combination of factors, including X&#8217;s needs, the immigration and financial issues, and the personalities and relationship of the parents.  That has led me to conclude that if I allow the application X&#8217;s relationship with one of his parents may well be damaged significantly and possibly irreparably, but if I refuse the application I leave him in a situation where his mother on whom he is primarily dependent faces a precarious and unstable situation both in terms of financial security and immigration status.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I turn to the timings.  There will need to be a little time to make arrangements, but now that the decision is made it is not in X&#8217;s interest for there to be significant delay.  I intend to give the mother permission to leave from the end of this school term.  That is, I think, about eight or nine weeks away, at the end of March.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In terms of contact, I will make an order for contact on the basis that the father remains living in London or anywhere else that is not Australia.  I will make an order that the mother must make X available to spend time with the father on as many occasions as the father is able to visit him in Town L.  I recognise, as I have said, that it is likely that the father will only be able to visit at a maximum of twice a year, but I do not intend to put that limit in the order in case there are some years when the father is able to visit more.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I will also order that the mother must bring X to the UK at least once each year so that X spends a minimum of two weeks a year in the UK with his father.  It will also be recorded in the order that if the father moves to Australia at any point in the future the expectation is that contact arrangements will be reviewed and that the arrangements put in place for X should be as close as possible to the current arrangements depending on where in Australia the father is living.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">As for the costs of contact, the father has a higher earning capacity than the mother.  I will order that the father should pay the costs of his travel to Australia to visit X.  However, the mother&#8217;s financial position will be improved if she moves to Australia, and that is in part the basis on which I have given permission, and so it is reasonable to direct that she should pay the costs for herself and X when they travel to the UK.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">As for the costs of the move, I recognise that the mother&#8217;s financial position currently is very precarious.  I think that she has no immediate access to funds whereas the father has, and in reality these are matrimonial assets.  I will direct that the father should pay the costs of the mother and X&#8217;s relocation to Australia on the basis that in reality this is coming out of the mother&#8217;s share of the matrimonial pot.  I will direct, however, that the mirror order, which the mother has agreed to obtain in Australia, should be obtained at the mother&#8217;s cost.  Again, that is because by that stage I am anticipating that the mother&#8217;s financial situation will at least have prospects of improvement.  She may need to borrow in the short term, but I think it is reasonable to expect her to pay those costs.  </p>
