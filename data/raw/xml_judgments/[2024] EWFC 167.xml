The father shall send to the children one letter per child per month. In addition, he may send each child a small gift and card on special occasions. The mother should encourage the children to write back and to say thank you for any gifts they receive from their father. The father should send the letters and the gifts and cards by registered post or similar modes of communication. That will avoid direct contact between the parents. The mother can and should send &#8216;no reply&#8217; emails four times a year to which she attaches a short report on the children for the father&#8217;s benefit. That way the father should be able to stay abreast of important developments in the children&#8217;s lives and will have subject matter that is pertinent to the children for the letters. That will be in addition to any information the father receives directly from the schools.</p>

The mother has two further children by her new partner. B and K live with their mother, her new partner and their two children. The issue before me is what contact B and K should have with their father. Their mother admits that she has breached previous contact orders but asserts that she has had reasonable cause to do so, namely: the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings; and to protect both children from what she says is the aggressive, manipulative, and impulsive behaviours of the father and resultant emotional harm. The father asserts that the mother has alienated the children from him. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The application before me is made by their father. In closing, he told me passionately that he just wanted to be a father to his children. He wants contact to be encouraged and supported and he will be led by CAFCASS to that goal. He seeks to increase contact over time from letter contact to supervised telephone and video contact. The calls can be video recorded. He told me that he would do what he can to prove himself. In closing, the father sought to resist a s.91(14) order and said he would abide by any contact order the court made. He cited as an example how he had abided by the contact order made in July 2023 by the Recorder, even though he wanted more. He told me that the gateway provided by s.91(14) would be a waste of everyone&#8217;s time. He apologized to this court for his behaviour during the mother&#8217;s cross-examination by the QLR. He accepted that his behaviour before the Recorder in July 2023 was unacceptable. He wished he could turn the clock back and that he had just kept his mouth shut. He told me that he would always fight to be a father to his children, and he would never stop; his whole life is built on being a father to them. He was willing to reflect on what had been asked of him in the hearing before me and he was willing to work towards better insight and understanding of his behaviours on others. In closing, he accepted that he was not an easy person to deal with but told me he was willing to change. He said in closing that he will undertake any and all courses recommended for him by the Guardian. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In closing, the Guardian&#8217;s view remained that the children should only have indirect contact with their father in the form of one letter a month from him to each child and small gifts and cards to mark special occasions such as birthdays, Christmas, and Easter. She seeks the continuation of the non-molestation order and the prohibited steps order. The guardian wishes me to make a s.91(14) order until each child is 16 years old to maintain the stability that they have each achieved since direct contact stopped. The father has a blind spot to his own deficits and there is going to be no lightbulb moment in this case. His behaviour before this court has been performative. The trouble is that it is difficult to know what lies behind the performance and see the father&#8217;s true self. It is as if he has to fight to prove himself. He is unlikely to change because he cannot reflect. The Guardian has applied the appropriate tools to the evidence in this case and there is no evidence of alienating behaviours. Here, B gives cogent reasons grounded in her own experience for not wanting to see her father. K is not alienated from his father. He has his photograph on display and keeps his father&#8217;s letters under his pillow. K&#8217;s current expression of wishes and feelings is a justified response to all that has happened to date. </p>

The father denied this and says he was put upon by four adults. He says that he was the victim. I have before me a letter from the Professional Standards Department of the local police force dated 2 December 2015 which upholds the father&#8217;s complaints against the police, namely that on 14 February 2014 the police failed to treat him as a victim; failed to take a statement from him or photographic evidence of his injuries and failed to conduct house-to-house enquiries. </p>

The father is said to have reacted badly to this and the partner is alleged to have had to intervene. The situation is alleged to have escalated as the children reported on return to their mother that they had observed their father breaking into the partner&#8217;s home. Their father is then said to have let them into the house through the front door. Once in the home it is said they witnessed their father shouting angrily at his partner and B is said to have heard the partner tell the father to get off her as he was hurting her. The father admits that he did break into his partner&#8217;s house when he had the children with him. He says his actions were justified as it was a medical emergency; his partner was potentially overdosing on cocaine. He tells me that the children witnessed nothing more than him climbing over the garage and into the house as once he let the children in, they remained downstairs in a room whilst he tended to his partner. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">An updated position statement on behalf of the Guardian was prepared for the hearing on 16 June 2023. Within that position statement, she reported to the court that B was settled at school and is progressing well academically. K was also progressing well at his school, having initially struggled with the transition from primary school. He has access to support in a wellbeing drop-in session should he need to talk. K told the Guardian that he still found school difficult. The guardian was of the view that K struggled with divided loyalties. She also expressed the view that the father&#8217;s continued dismissal of the mother&#8217;s role with K and her position, raises considerable difficulties. K is in the middle and has too much pressure on his shoulders which his father does not appreciate. K is, according to his Guardian, a compliant child who wishes to please and is likely to be struggling to voice his own views. She considered that in the circumstances she described in the position statement, contact should be reduced to one day a month. It is worth pausing and noting at this point in the judgment that the father used to have a lot of contact with the children; there was a shared care arrangement until 2020 or 2021 and for about the next two years, until July 2023, K was with his father every Wednesday night and every other Saturday night, which meant that in any period of 14 days K was spending three nights and substantial parts of six days with his father</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The next substantive hearing was before Recorder Trussler on 16 June and 5 July 2023. At the beginning of that hearing, the judge clarified with the father that his primary focus was not on enforcement action but upon ensuring that the children spent time with him. Thus, she did not feel it necessary to determine the allegations of breach but focused on the future arrangements for the children. At the hearing the father sought direct contact with both children. Having heard evidence from the father, the mother and the children&#8217;s Guardian she made no order on the father&#8217;s application dated 22 October 2022 to enforce the Child Arrangements Order made on 22 January 2018 and the Child Arrangements Order was discharged. She made an order that the children should live with their mother and ordered that the father be prohibited from removing the children from the care and control of the mother or any third party, school, club, or venue to whom she had entrusted the children&#8217;s care until further order. In relation to contact with the children, the learned Recorder followed the recommendations of the Guardian. Thus, she initially ordered that K&#8217;s contact with his father should be reduced to one day a month. That decision prompted what the Recorder at the time described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unacceptable and very concerning behaviour</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>from the father in the courtroom and outside of it.  His conduct was such that the Guardian changed her recommendations in relation to contact for K. In her opinion, the children could only be kept safe from any emotional harm from the father if there was an order for indirect contact only for the children with their father. At the same time, the Recorder made a Non-molestation order to protect the mother, B, K, and their half-siblings. The order extended to prohibit the father from telephoning, texting, emailing or otherwise contacting or attempting to contact the children except as directed by the court and from entering their schools between specified hours. The Non-molestation order also forbade the father from using or threatening to use violence against the children and from intimidating, harassing or pestering them.</p>

Amongst their views K expressed he did not like school. He is struggling with attendance and with his behaviours in school. The Guardian, in her report, has concluded that K&#8217;s non-attendance at school is more to do with his own difficulties with education than it is with his views about his father.  In relation to contact, B&#8217;s view that she should have no contact with her father was maintained. She however has told the Guardian that her mother does share the contents with her. K was different.

He was confident his mother would act on those requests. In the circumstances the Guardian recommended to the court that the Child Arrangements Order and the Non-molestation order should remain as they are. There should be indirect monthly correspondence from the father to each child and that can include a small gift and card on birthdays and special occasions. There is an expectation that the mother will share the letters etc. with the children and encourage a response. The Guardian also recommends, in this report, that both parents should attend the Planning Together for Children course and the father should complete the online Solihull course choosing the teenager modules or the Teen Triple P course in person. A s.91(14) order until the end of the non-molestation order was proposed. The purpose would be to give the children a break from continued and continual litigation. </p>

It captures him driving and speaking to K.  The clip captures him saying to J, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I will drop you here, not far to walk</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> Further on, you hear the father interacting with K. I remind myself that the father knows that he is recording on his phone. The father&#8217;s interaction may thus be staged and of little evidential value.  K&#8217;s is not. From the clip, K appears to have a natural relationship with his father. The clip also captures the mother&#8217;s reaction to the father dropping the children after contact at a spot other than that agreed. The mother does not know she is being recorded. Her reaction is one of irritation that the father will not do as agreed. The clip records her becoming angry about the father and his attitude to child maintenance. She explains to him forcefully her view that he should contribute to the children&#8217;s school uniform. The father does not respond well. He will buy the uniform for the children&#8217;s use at his home, and she can buy that for use at her home.  I find that there is a childishness about the father&#8217;s reaction.  It winds up the mother. Having listened to the memo and taking into account that the father knows it was being recorded, I find he is likely to be trying to wind the mother up.  Towards the end, the mother tells the father to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">go over there</span>&#8221; and threatens him with a Non-molestation order. Having listened to the clip as a whole, I find she was provoked by the father, probably deliberately, to catch her reaction on the memo but I also find that her reaction is not of someone who is fearful of the father. Rather, it is someone who has had enough of him and his irritating ways.  I also record in this judgment that whilst the children were in the mother&#8217;s home during this incident, the father remarks that B is poking her head out. I consider that the children are likely to have been aware of the unpleasant scene that developed between their parents.  RSA2 is a short video clip of 28 September 2022. The father knows he is recording and thus what he says and how he acts during that clip has, I find, little evidential value. </p>

The father admitted their content and asked that I listen to them in private so that he did not relive the trauma of that day. I acceded to that request. Having listened to the records I find that they capture the raw distress of the father. His reaction to the judgment was one of despair and anger. It was extreme. In the moment, he blamed everyone but himself. I have said &#8216;in the moment&#8217; because I consider that the clips must be viewed in context. I find that context provides an explanation for what he did and said that day but not an excuse.</p>

He described himself as a good, loving, and doting father. He confirmed the truth of the statements and position statements he had placed before me and the Appellate court. He considered that he was a good role model for his children. Within his statements before this court and in his oral evidence he emphasized his business acumen, his social responsibility, and his philanthropy. He was obviously proud of all he had achieved. The father was anxious to emphasize to me that he considered the mother to be a liar and a manipulator. He denied that he has ever been aggressive or abusive (physically or verbally) to the mother and asserts that over the past 4 years or more the relationship between them has become &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">peaceful and somewhat enjoyable</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> He accepted in his written evidence that he had raised his voice to the children but denied that this was ever emotionally abusive, asserting that it was only ever in context and appropriate as part of normal parenting. He denies manipulating his children. He asserts that the mother&#8217;s current partner has been violent to him. He tells this court that the partner has sent him messages which are homophobic, discriminatory, and abusive. He alleges that the mother&#8217;s new partner has been violent to her, and the children have witnessed this. He asserts that he had a good, healthy relationship with B and K until such time as the mother wanted more money from him, obstructed contact and alienated the children from him. He links the mother&#8217;s mental ill-health to the alienating behaviours he alleges she demonstrates and says that she transposes the abuse she suffered as a child into his relationship with their children. In one of his statements, he pinpoints that demand for more money to in or around July 2022. The father relies upon a voice message dated 26 August 2022 as showing that the mother&#8217;s claims to be frightened of him are false. He accuses the Guardian of not doing her job asserting that she has conducted a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">witch-hunt</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>against him and that it is easier for her to paint the mother as a victim than to confront the truth which is that this is a case of parental alienation. He does not accept his children&#8217;s wishes and feelings as reported by their Guardian. He says that she is biased against him and that her investigations have been one-sided. The father asserts a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very unethical, unprofessional and a very close relationship</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>between the Guardian and the mother. He accuses the Guardian of not listening to his son&#8217;s voice.</p>

The father has previously said he has gained insight but there has been no real change in his behaviours since 2018. There is unlikely to be the necessary change in the future. The mother has been a very good mother to these children. There is no concern that would justify their removal from her care.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The modern context in which King LJ considered s.91(14) is set out in paragraphs 34-36 of her judgment. The modern legal landscape includes the advent of the smart phone and social media and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the almost universal use of email as a means of instant communication</span>&#8221;. Another development considered of relevance by King LJ is the withdrawal of legal aid in the majority of private law cases leaving litigants unrepresented without the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">steadying influence</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>of legal advisers. According to King LJ, one of the consequences of these changes not uncommonly seen in private law proceedings is that the other parties, and often the judge themself, can be (and often are) bombarded with emails from a parent, whether male or female, who is representing him or herself. Such behaviour may be the result of anxiety but in other cases, as in the case before King LJ, it is part of a campaign of behaviour by one parent against the other which amounts to a deeply disturbing form of oppressive behaviour on their part.&#8239;&#160;</p>

All too often such communications are ill-considered and ill-judged with the consequence that every minor dispute or misunderstanding is met with an application to the judge. More importantly, the distress and anxiety caused to the other parent and to the children at the centre of such a raging dispute cannot be overestimated, nor can the damaging consequences where the focus of the litigation veers away from what, on any objective view, would and should be regarded as the real issues going to the welfare of the children concerned.</span>&#8221;&#8239;&#160;</p>

In particular the provision at section 91A(2) , if brought into effect, gives statutory effect to Guideline 6 of Re P (see para 39 above) by permitting a s.91(14) order to be made where the making of an application under the Children Act 1989 would put the parent or child at risk of physical or emotional harm.</span></p>

However, I find that she takes steps to manage her mental ill-health. She regularly attends her GP. She takes the medication that is prescribed for her. She accesses talking therapies. As a consequence, she is able to work five days a week as an accountant and bring up the four children who live with her. I find as a fact that as long as the mother takes steps to manage her mental ill-health, it does not impair her functioning or impact on her ability to live her daily life or care for the children.  In the circumstances, I find that there is no need for the expert assessment that the father applied for in March 2024 (see above). I therefore formally dismiss that application.</p>

However, he acknowledges that he has not sought any help through his GP. As he gave evidence before me and as he closed his own case, I formed the impression that he is emotionally fragile. My assessment of him is consistent with his assessment of himself. Accordingly, I find that the father is emotionally fragile and in his own way vulnerable at this time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The mother is a victim of domestic abuse of which the father is a perpetrator. In 2009 the father was cautioned for common assault of the mother. I remind myself that a caution is based on an admission. The father has thus previously admitted such abuse which, to his credit, he has not sought to retract at this hearing. In 2014 the father pleaded guilty to offences of harassing the mother by sending text messages and on one occasion in person. I have heard no evidence which undermines those convictions, and they stand. I accept that a significant passage of time has passed since the date of conviction and that overtime the dynamic of the relationship may have changed. However, I find that harassment through texts and emails is part of how the father reacts to stress and decisions adverse to him. I find that he has, as recently as earlier this year, bombarded the Guardian and the solicitor with emails. I further find that the father&#8217;s past behaviours towards the mother are likely to have impacted on the mother at the time and that even in 2023, when the relationship between the mother and the father broke  down again are likely to impact on her reaction to the  father, in that she is likely not to trust him and to wonder (with good cause given his recent behaviour to the Guardian and the Childrens solicitor) whether history is about to repeat itself. That said the voice memo of 26 August 2022 demonstrates that the mother is not physically afraid of the father and will stand her ground with him. However, like life, matters are not straightforward. Having heard all the evidence, I find that the need to be firm and set boundaries as she did on 26 August 2022 is likely to take its toll on her. </p>

Whereas in business that is likely to be a positive, in family life it is likely to leave others feeling dominated and forced into choices they do not want to make. Have considered all the evidence in the case, I do not think the father truly understands or appreciates that the manner in which he pursues his goals impacts on others. I find that the mother in daily life, as she was in evidence, is likely to be worn down and tired of his relentless pursuit of what he wants on his terms without consideration of others. She is, I find, exhausted by the battle between them, the need to constantly assert her point of view and with the legal process. </p>

I do not find on the evidence I have heard that the mother forced the children to call her new partner daddy in 2017. That does not mean that they did not but that what caused them to call him daddy is not proven. I find that the history of the case is that this mother has done her best to promote contact between the children and their father in difficult circumstances. Despite the long history of this case, I accept what the children say to the Guardian about their mother reading the father&#8217;s letters to them when they are reluctant to do so themselves or when she has needed to edit them because of inappropriate comment. I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that K sleeps with his father&#8217;s letters under his pillow and with his father&#8217;s photograph in his bedroom. That is evidence of the mother promoting a relationship between the children and the father even in difficult circumstances such as these.</p>

The reality is that whereas the children may have been in the back garden at the time, they will have been aware of the incident even if they did not see it and they will have been aware of the aftermath. Children pick up on tensions and conversations between adults about events, however well the adult thinks they hide things.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have considered long and hard about what I should make of the children being asked in their schools on 28 September 2022 whether they wanted to go to contact with their father or home with their mother. I do not have sufficient evidence before me to determine why on that day the schools were asking those questions, but they did. Both did not want to see their father, and both told their schools they wanted to go home with their mother. The mother has criticized the father&#8217;s reaction to the children not being at school when he went to pick them up for contact. However, I remind myself that the context is that he was expecting to collect them and that the plans were changed without any prior warning to him. He is likely to have been shocked, angry and distressed by what occurred and those initially reactions are likely to be justified. The staged video is however a step too far. It has no evidential worth. It demonstrates almost a child-like reaction to prove himself right rather than an understanding of the need to behave responsibly and put the children first, however distressed he was.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I agree with the Guardian that it is positive that the father has shown his commitment to his children by persevering with letters to his children even when he gets no response. I have read the letters sent by the father to the children. I find that although the Guardian described them as <span style="font-style:italic">largely positive, </span>those from July 2023 until January 2024 also contained content which was clearly inappropriate to be sent to children, especially those who are subject of litigation. They included passages such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am sorry, I am not seeing you at the moment. I want to make it clear, and that if it were up to me, we would go back seeing you every week</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>etc. In another letter, the father writes &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Don&#8217;t forget little lady I have a huge pile of presents for you at my house for last Christmas and your birthday</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>In another letter containing many positive expressions of love and affection for his daughter which cannot be criticized, the father then states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am still paying your mum to ensure you have a good life, and I am also putting lots of money into savings for you so that you can afford a house of your own when you are 18</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>he wrote. To his son in November 2023, he stated<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I know there are people in this world who do not want me to be your Dad</span>&#8221;. These are only a few examples. They illustrate the dichotomy between the father who expresses love and commitment to his children and the father who cannot hide his bitterness at being kept away from his children or his antipathy to the children&#8217;s mother and her partner. What is sad is that the father sought initially to defend content which was clearly inappropriate until he gained insight after speaking with the Guardian in February 2024 and took on board her advice. That tells me that he can learn, and he can change albeit his first instinct appears to be hyper defensive and to battle against the world. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">It is one of the ironies of this case that the father accuses the Guardian of bias and unprofessional conduct, asserting that she is in the mother&#8217;s camp when in fact, an objective analysis of the evidence is that she has acted to help the father even when it must have been personally difficult to do so because of his harsh and unjustified criticisms of her. As is implicit in the previous sentences, I reject the father&#8217;s criticisms of the Guardian. She has acted in good faith and with the children at the forefront of her decision-making and actions since her appointment back in 2018. It is telling that it was to the Guardian the father turned when he reflected on the evidence he gave at the beginning of this hearing. At that point he had sufficient insight into a need to change if he is to rebuild his relationship with the children. </p>

When asked if he wants to see him now, he says no but that he may wish to do so in the future but does not specify when in the future that may be. K&#8217;s letter of February 2024 to his father is evidence of their mutual love for each other and their shared interests. He wrote to his father when he had the time and space to do so. In the mother&#8217;s busy household, he may rarely have the peace to think and write letters. That is no direct fault of the mother but is a reflection of the circumstance in which she and K live. Having heard the evidence I strongly urge the mother to ensure that K&#8217;s need for contact with his father is not overlooked and that K should have the space and time within their home to read his father&#8217;s letters to him and to write back.  K is confident that when he is ready to see his father again, his mother will arrange it for him.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I accept the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation for contact now and thus affirm that there should be indirect contact by the father sending to the children one letter a month together with a small gift and card on special occasions. The mother should encourage the children to write back and to say thank you for any gifts they receive from their father. The father should send the letters and the gifts and cards by registered post or similar. That will avoid direct contact between the parents. The mother can and should send &#8216;no reply&#8217; emails four times a year to which she attaches a short report on the children for the father&#8217;s benefit. That way the father should be able to stay abreast of important developments in the children&#8217;s lives and will have subject matter that is pertinent to the children for the letters.  The father wishes to have telephone contact leading to video contact with his children which he says he will accept should be supervised. The problem with that progression of contact is that (i) neither child wants it and is thus unlikely to cooperate with it and (ii) telephone and video contact can be very intrusive. It brings the parent into the child&#8217;s home. It is hard to proactively monitor. If the father were to speak to either child in the inappropriate terms as seen in the earlier letter, the recording would capture what he had said but would not prevent it from being said or the harm that might flow from it. Hence, I reject the father&#8217;s trajectory plan. </p>

It will expire at the same time as the extant non-molestation order and prohibited steps order. I have made such an order to give the children respite from the almost continuous litigation and to remove any pressure from their shoulders which comes from being the subject of applications such as these. I consider that such an order is in the welfare interest of the children.  It will also be long enough for the mother and the father to undertake the programmes of work they committed to in the witness box. It will allow for a period of settlement and respite.  However, I do not agree with the Guardian that the order should be made until each child respectively reaches 16 years of age. The purpose of the order in this case is to give the children respite from the litigation and the stresses that go with it, the purpose is not to send a message that they need not have contact with their father until they are 16 years old. Such an order would be too long. Further, I factor in that towards the expiry of the non-molestation order and the prohibited steps order, the mother will need to return to court for their extension if the need for such orders remains.</p>

If the court hearing the permission application, then considers the application should go forward, the mother can be notified. If the permission application has no merit whatsoever, then this initial sift should protect the mother from meritless applications. </p>
