	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings were commenced in February 2022 after the youngest child, BQM was taken to hospital by the parents unwell and suffering from Covid.  He was examined, and later cannulated so that blood tests could be carried out. At some point after this procedure the mother informed doctors that his left leg was swollen and that he appeared to be in pain when it was touched.  His leg was x-rayed and found to have been fractured. Then a skeletal survey was carried out and further fractures were found to his legs and ribs.</p>

He said he had been told he was somewhat heavy handed and could have squeezed BQM too tightly when changing or bathing him, or in play.  He said that he had never lost his temper with him and had never meant to hurt him.</span></p>

First it is submitted that tibial shaft fractures found on x-ray on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February were caused by the cannulation in hospital on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January.  There is a detailed analysis of the evidence surrounding this in the written closing submissions prepared by Mr Sampson KC and Mr Bergin. I should add that I also found their opening note extremely helpful. Following the point made by both Dr. Saggar and Dr. Cartlidge, Mr. Sampson submits that this demonstrates that BQM has fragile bones, stating &#8216;the clinical scenario indicates a far greater level of bone fragility than might at first have been thought&#8217;.   In those circumstances, the metaphyseal fractures are likely to have been caused during the massages and it is submitted that as such the father cannot be considered to have been either reckless or negligent.  As to the rib fractures, they could have been caused either by the father when handling BQM somewhat heavily in the bath or, in the event recounted by the mother, when BQM was taken out of his bouncer by GSM.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Failure to protect comes in innumerable guises. It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</p>

A finding of failing to protect can lead a Court to conclude that the children's best interests will not be served by remaining with, or returning to, the care of that parent, even though that parent may have been wholly exonerated from having caused any physical injuries.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Any Court conducting a Finding of Fact Hearing should be alert to the danger of such a serious finding becoming 'a bolt on' to the central issue of perpetration or of falling into the trap of assuming too easily that, if a person was living in the same household as the perpetrator, such a finding is almost inevitable. As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.</p>

Genetic factors are permanent so that a tendency to easy fracture would be expected to remain apparent as a child grows up.   She stated that the variation in the LRP5 gene is now being regarded as more common than it once was (referencing a discussion she had had with another expert) and that there was no known association between this and increased tendency to fracture.</p>

When asked in particular about the history from the mother that she suffered a hairline fracture when a teenager from standing in an awkward position, she said first of all &#8216;I do not put that in the bracket of a significant fracture&#8217; and then that &#8216;to my mind that does not constitute a sound clinical history&#8217;.</p>

This led Dr. Saggar to conclude that he could not exclude an effect of the variant being reduced bone integrity and strength (independent of any risk of inheriting Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder).  Dr. Irving stated that it was risky to come to conclusions based on only one individual and also stated that the research papers, being published in 2017 and 2015 were old, and a lot had happened since they were written.  She said she had contacted the authors to see whether there was any update and they told her &#8211; in the context of osteoporosis &#8211; that the variant was more common without an uptick in the number of cases of osteoporosis in young people.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Dr. Irving is plainly an eminent expert, I felt that her response to the questions was somewhat narrow.  She was not really willing to consider any possibility that BQM could have had any bony fragility and tended to find reasons to discount evidence which might go the other way.  At one point she used the phrase &#8216;I cannot say it is absolutely conclusive&#8217; to explain why she discounted the relevance of the child with the same gene variant as BQM in the <span style="font-style:italic">Korvala</span> paper.   In my experience, experts have a variety of approaches to cases in which they advise.  I thought Dr. Irving&#8217;s approach was to discount the relevance of any particular piece of medical or research evidence unless it was positively proved to be reliable and relevant. Some other experts such as Dr. Saggar and Dr. Cartlidge in this case tend to look at the issue from a different angle.  I do not say that Dr. Irving is wrong to look at it from her perspective but it is something that I bear in mind. It is one of the reasons why it is important to remember that in cases such as this, experts advise and judges decide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Saggar&#8217;s evidence, both written and oral included a great deal of detail about genetic variants, dominant and recessive genes, the variable effects of these as between individuals, and research material.  I will not set all this out in detail as it would add a great deal to the length of this judgment.  In summary Dr Saggar was clear that BQM does not have what he described as a &#8216;major susceptibility&#8217; gene that would cause fractures with normal handling. In this he was in agreement with Dr. Irving. Unlike her, however, he believed that the existence of the gene variant was something (and I believe from his perspective, something important) for the court to consider.  The LRP5 gene in which the variant existed, and which was inherited from his father, is known to be relevant for bone metabolism.  There are reports in the literature of children with this variant suffering fractures although when descending to the detail some of the reported children had other variants too, and some also had vertebral fractures.  A recent article (2021) shows identification of LRP5 variants in some adult males with osteoporosis. Whilst Dr Irving considered that the differences between the cohort of individuals who were the subjects of the research and BQM were such as to render the research of very little (if any) relevance to this case, Dr. Saggar did not agree.  To him, they demonstrate the association of the LRP5 variant with reduced bone mineralisation albeit it is difficult to understand how and why, and which individuals are affected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Added to this, Dr Saggar agreed that there are other features of the family history in this case, for example the mother&#8217;s HDS (formerly known as EDS type 3) and history of fracturing which could have also had an effect, something that he agreed could, potentially, make for a &#8216;perfect storm&#8217; of factors affecting the strength of BQM&#8217;s bones.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, Dr Saggar was saying that the features of BQM&#8217;s genetic makeup and family history were something that should be considered by the court. Even if BQM did have weaker bones, however, the fractures still needed an explanation and a mechanism.  Like Dr Cartlidge he said that, if I was to find that BQM&#8217;s leg had been fractured by the process of cannulation in hospital on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January that strongly suggested that his bones were susceptible to fracture with lesser force than normal, but the lack of any fractures since that date was also relevant. When considering the mechanism required for all the fractures, he deferred to Dr. Cartlidge and stated that individuals who are more susceptible to suffering fractures still suffer the same amount of pain as anyone else.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Saggar&#8217;s evidence differed from that of Dr Irving in that he did not exclude the possibility that BQM&#8217;s bones were of less than normal strength, causing his to suffer fractures with a lower level of force than a so-called &#8216;normal&#8217; child, whereas, in her oral evidence at least, she discounted it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Saggar was an impressive witness. He is clearly very eminent in his field, which is fast developing and complicated.  His enthusiasm for his subject was apparent throughout.   He was confident without being dogmatic, willing to consider propositions put to him in an open-minded way but did not allow himself to led along any particular evidential paths that he did not agree with or to step outside his field of expertise.  Whilst not wishing to criticise Dr Irving in any way, I preferred Dr Saggar&#8217;s approach.  There are a lot of &#8216;known unknowns&#8217; in this case and I must bear in mind that BQM has a genetic variant associated with bone density even if it is becoming apparent that this gene may be more common than once thought and the number of reports of fractures in the population of those who have it limited.  His mother has somewhat grey sclerae and HDS, which BQM has a 50% chance of inheriting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looking at the metaphyseal fractures, he considered that they would have been immediately painful upon infliction for about five minutes.  He might have had some reduced movement of the joint adjacent to each fracture but in an infant, this might be easily overlooked.  Any tenderness might also not be noticed in such a young baby because they cry so frequently.  He did not consider non-recognition of such a fracture to be surprising.   Like Dr. Johnson he believed the mechanism would be yanking, twisting or bending force applied to the joint adjacent to each fracture.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the rib fractures, Dr. Cartlidge thought that they would be initially painful, typically for about 10 minutes. The pain would have lessened thereafter but BQM might have been more fractious than usual for a few days.  Again, this might be difficult to identify because babies cry so frequently.  Lateral rib fractures are caused by compression on the chest (this can be from one side, unlike posterior rib fractures) or occasionally by direct impact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mid shaft and metadiaphyseal fractures of the left tibia would be initially painful, for about 10 minutes. He would have been in obvious pain immediately after the fractures were inflicted and demonstrated lessened movement of the left leg. The spiral fracture would have been caused by a twisting force (although he clarified in evidence that not very significant twisting would be needed) and the metadiaphyseal fracture would have been caused by a bending force, typically be the leg being grasped by the ankle and bent.  Such fractures can also be caused by an impact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Cartlidge considered that any person witnessing the causal event for the tibial shaft and metadiaphyseal fractures would have known BQM had been hurt, as they would for the rib and metaphyseal fractures.  A person not present may well not notice the latter fractures had happened but so far as the former were concerned, they would notice that the left knee or ankle was painful when moved and that there was reduced movement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the experts meeting and upon listening to the views of the geneticists, Dr. Cartlidge summarised that they both believed that BQM did not have a degree of bone fragility which would cause fractures with normal gentle handling of a baby, but that nevertheless he might have a degree of bone fragility that wouldn&#8217;t normally cause fractures unless the child was roughly handled.  He suggested that neither of the geneticists appeared to be excluding the possibility that BQM had a mild degree of bone fragility but they did exclude his having this to a marked degree. This was a proposition with which, during the course of the meeting, both agreed.  On further reflection after the meeting Dr. Irving somewhat drew back from it, stating that she did not believe that BQM&#8217;s bone strength was outside the normal range.</p>

In this he explains that he was taken aback by the vigour with which the Indian massage was being done on the recordings sent to him and that, whilst this was unlikely to cause injury to a child with normal bones, it could cause metaphyseal fractures in a child with some bony fragility. He made clear this did not relate to the shaft of the tibia and he could not see a mechanism for the rib fractures during massage.</p>

He said that most doctors would not choose to cannulate a leg if they perceived there to be a problem with it. That evidence, he thought pointed to an absence of any obvious injury to the left leg during cannulation.  This was a theme that he returned to in the course of his oral evidence, stating, like Dr. Saggar, that if I concluded that BQM&#8217;s leg had been fractured during the course of the cannulation then this would be very important evidence so far as the fragility of his bones was concerned.  In the meeting he said that you would not really expect to put a twisting force onto the tibia but in his oral evidence he clarified that, to say that he did not think much twisting force would be necessary at all and he would be uncomfortable about excluding cannulation as a mechanism for the fracture on those grounds.</p>

As to the bruise on the arm which the mother saw and photographed on 11.11.21, he said it was unusual for a child of this age to sustain a bruise. He said he would feel more comfortable with an accidental explanation if there were poppers on BQM&#8217;s clothing on the arm and somebody had caught the skin in between.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Cartlidge was a very measured, careful and open-minded witness. He has a very great deal of experience as a paediatrician and in giving evidence in cases such as this.  It seemed to me that throughout his evidence he was bearing in mind the fact that a number of things in medicine still remain unknown and unlikely things happen.  He was willing to accept that BQM might have weaker than normal bones, and certainly took the view that, should the court conclude that the shaft fracture have happened during cannulation, this was firm evidence of bony fragility.  He was also willing to accept that Indian massage of a type demonstrated in the videos could provide a mechanism for the metaphyseal fractures, but not the fractures to the ribs.  He would have expected a doctor carrying out a cannulation procedure to have noticed and avoided a sore leg.  Nonetheless, he would have expected BQM to respond to pain like any other baby and for anyone present when the fractures occurred to have realised that something was wrong. He did not believe a shaft fracture would have gone undetected for more than a day or so and would expect a primary carer to be aware of it even if not responsible for what had happened.</p>

She clearly loves her children very much, and it is obvious that they are the centre of her life (indeed that was true for the father and grandmother as well).  Within this, I also thought that she found it very difficult to believe that BQM had suffered so many fractures in the home and that the repercussions of this remain hard for her to take in.  This in turn affected her evidence. Her acceptance that the November 2021 bruise could have been caused at the photoshoot was uncritical and somewhat at odds with her immediate reaction when she saw it which was to ask the father how it had happened.  I also considered that her evidence as to whether BQM had a sore leg before the admission to hospital to be inconsistent with the contemporaneous messages. My view was that this was motivated by wishful thinking and rationalisation after the event rather than deliberate dishonesty.</p>

The father told the police that they had noticed at home, probably the night before, that BQM was moving his left leg less than the other one. He suggested to them that they had intended to mention this when he was taken to the doctor. This piece of evidence fits with the WhatsApp message from the mother to the father on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> in the evening that the doctors had taken blood from &#8216;that sore leg&#8217; to suggest that that BQM&#8217;s leg symptoms predated his admission to hospital and the cannulation. There is no record anywhere of the mother pointing out that mark or bruise to the doctors on admission to the CAU or at the urgent treatment centre although she said she did.  Whilst medical records can be inaccurate, I think that if she had pointed it out it would have appeared somewhere in the notes at that time.

None of them noticed the mark to the leg until much later.  If a child is crying anyway, then it may be harder to notice a specific area of pain. Dr. Cartlidge stated that the appearance of swelling following a fracture was very variable as to timing, in that it could appear up to 24 hours afterwards.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If it had not been for the possibility of the cannulation causing a fracture, none of the experts believed that from a medical perspective that BQM was likely to suffer from more than a mild degree of bony fragility as a result of the genetic variant, either by itself or in combination with HDS.  Whilst individuals with conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta or osteopenia do not fracture at a predictable and regular rate throughout their lives these conditions do not disappear and so, had BQM suffered from a fracture from the relatively gentle process of cannulation, it is surprising that he has not suffered anything like that since even though he is now mobile and walking. It is true he has not had any x-rays but there is no account of his appearing to suffer any injury in circumstances where his mother would now be very vigilant.   There is some research evidence of cannulation causing a fracture in an infant with acknowledged bony fragility but it is extremely rare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On a balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the shaft fractures were caused before BQM was brought to hospital that day and not during the cannulation procedure.   I do not think the father was confused or mistaken when he said what he did to the police, and I do not think that the mother was referring to BQM having a sore leg in the text messages only because she thought he had a bruise.  BQM was very unwell that day, with symptoms of covid, poor feeding, and diarrhoea.  I believe that concern over those took priority over his leg, and those symptoms were likely to have masked it somewhat, not just to the treating doctors and nurses but the mother too, especially when she would have had no reason to think that BQM could have been seriously injured.  Also, when listening to her evidence I found her to be reluctant to accept or believe that BQM could have been injured by the father without her picking this up, and that this had clouded her recollection. She does not want to believe the father caused the fractures and therefore has focussed her mind on factors which point away from his being responsible. I did not find her evidence about these matters to be reliable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the mother knew that BQM had a sore leg that day but did not become aware of how bad it was until later on when it began to swell.  I appreciate that in making this finding that it is surprising that Dr. Kanendran (or any of the professionals) did not notice anything wrong with BQM&#8217;s leg either when she examined or cannulated him but it seems to me that she either missed BQM having a sore leg before or during the cannulation or that she and the mother failed to notice she had broken his leg in doing it.  The cannulation did not involve the use of very much force, and I do not accept that this was the cause of the tibial fractures.</p>

Although there is only a small photograph from the mother&#8217;s phone it is clear that this was a significant bruise in a tiny baby not yet two weeks old.  I do not accept that this bruise was caused at the photoshoot.  It was two days before the mother saw the bruise and it seems unlikely that she would have noticed nothing in the intervening 48 hours.  Additionally, nobody noticed anything untoward at the photoshoot itself. Even if there had been times when the mother and father were not there, the grandmother noticed nothing and the bruise was not discussed with her.  I do not think the mother was responsible because upon noticing it she immediately sent a photograph to the father asking him if he knew what had happened. Rather than wait until he arrived home with GSM, he telephoned her immediately.</p>

On the balance of probabilities, I find that it was not caused by the mother or at the photoshoot but by the father at an undisclosed time.  The injury was likely to have been painful.  The existence of this bruise is relevant because it shows that the father was capable of being rough although I do not know whether he was aware he caused a bruise at the time. It does show that the mother, against her better judgment, accepted the father&#8217;s explanation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have noted above that the father&#8217;s initial reaction, which he voiced to the police, was that he was responsible for the fractures to BQM&#8217;s legs and ribs. He is an intelligent man who was fully able to appreciate the significance of what he was saying in such a context, in an interview that was being recorded. There was no sense that his statements to the police were led in any way.  Whilst I accept the submission of Mr. Sampson on his behalf that a lay person would not be expected to know how much force is required to cause rib fractures, I believe that most people, this father included, are aware that fractures to the limbs do not happen easily.  I do not think he would have made such admissions to the police without good reason.  He repeated these admissions in his oral evidence, particularly in response to questions from Ms Webber on behalf of the Guardian. At one point he said &#8216;I don&#8217;t know if this is a subconscious thing but his legs were chunkier &#8211; I was gentle on the arms because they are thinner. His legs were chunkier so I thought I could go a bit deeper&#8217;.  When asked if he saw a link between his heavy handedness and the fractures and he said that on reflection he did.  He also said that he could have caused the rib fractures by pressing his ribs when he was face down on his knee. He also agreed that it was possible that the machine they used to soothe BQM (with white noise) could have masked the pain.  In other parts of his evidence, it is true to say that the father said other things, for example that he did not think he had caused the fractures and certainly he maintained throughout that he had not seen anything like the pain reaction described by Dr. Cartlidge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Saggar&#8217;s evidence is that (absent the cannulation causing BQM&#8217;s leg to fracture) the genetic findings are not of such a nature to suggest BQM would suffer fractures with normal gentle handling and that he would be expected to demonstrate the same pain reaction as any child. Dr Cartlidge agrees. These factors, together with the father&#8217;s admissions lead me to conclude that he was responsible for causing the fractures by the use of excessive force.</p>

She did not massage him very much at all, and nobody has ever suggested that she is &#8216;heavy handed&#8217;.  I understand why the mother did not like the grandmother straightening BQM&#8217;s legs &#8211; after all he was only tiny and babies&#8217; legs at this age are not held straight &#8211; but a desire that a young baby should grow up with strong limbs is common to all cultures.

I also do not know whether the fractures were caused during the course of massaging his limbs or handling him when changing his nappies, feeding or winding him because the father has said different things at different times.  He did say that he did not massage BQM when he was ill which suggests that the most recent tibial fractures were not caused in this way.</p>

Certainly Dr. Cartlidge had never seen this before and was surprised. Nonetheless this is a common practice and it would not be if babies were known to be seriously injured as a result. Some element of bony fragility might mean fractures are more likely in this context, especially if BQM&#8217;s very young age is taken into account but massage does not explain the rib fractures. Nor, if the father is right about not giving BQM massage when he was ill, do they explain the shaft fractures.</p>

Of course, they are both partisan witnesses, but from my assessment of the mother in particular I do not think she would have chosen to cover this up. There is no suggestion in the messages that pass between the parents that this is the case, or that the father does not love his son.   Quite the contrary.  In some cases, injuries such as we see here are caused by anger towards the child and a lack of self-control. That does not seem to be the position here.</p>

Certainly, this would fit with all the other evidence, including the father&#8217;s handling of BQM on one occasion during the parenting assessment. This still remains a serious finding, however, because the injuries were very significant and happened on several occasions. Also, the father does not seem to have been attuned to the pain BQM must have suffered.  This is something that must be considered at the welfare stage of the case. It is to the father&#8217;s credit that he accepted responsibility for the fractures; this fact means that it should be possible to work with him to reduce the level of risk in the future.</p>

Dr. Cartlidge&#8217;s clear evidence is that the rib and metaphyseal fractures would not have been obvious to a non-perpetrator. The only fractures which would have been so were the shaft fractures to the left tibia which happened very shortly before the admission to hospital. The parents were worried about BQM generally and sought treatment for him on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January. Even if the mother failed to point out the problem with the leg straight away, she drew attention to it when it became incontrovertible that something was seriously wrong, including asking that he have an x-ray.

It was clear that in the light of the Guardian&#8217;s view that the father&#8217;s behaviour was not intentional or malicious that this was a reference to the family being reunited once again.   I hope that the local authority will carry out some work with both parents, individually and together with a view to considering how this might be achieved.
