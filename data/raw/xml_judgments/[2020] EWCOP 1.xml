	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A permission requirement is a not uncommon feature of our legal procedure. For example, permission is needed to make an application for judicial review. Permission is needed to mount an appeal. Permission is needed to make a claim under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. In the field of judicial review, the permission requirement is not merely there to weed out applications which are abusive or nonsensical: to gain permission the claimant has to demonstrate a good arguable case. Permission to appeal will only be granted where the court is satisfied that the appellant has shown a real prospect of success or some other good reason why an appeal should be heard. Under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> permission will only be granted if the applicant demonstrates solid grounds for making the substantive application: see <span style="font-style:italic">Agbaje v Akinnoye-Agbaje</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/13" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 13" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 13</ref> at [33] per Lord Collins.

That required two psychiatric assessments and the involvement of the Guardian ad Litem. A final order was made by Coleridge J on 24 September 2002. Just seven months later, when D was 4 years old, [the mother] issued her second application for increased contact. That involved an investigation at the Tavistock Centre and the re-involvement of the Guardian ad Litem. Heather Swindells QC, sitting as a DHCJ, made a final order on 11 December 2003. The third application was made on 25 November 2005, when D was 6 years old. This time the application involved Cafcass, the Guardian ad Litem, an adult psychiatrist, a child psychiatrist and further investigations at the Tavistock. Moylan QC, sitting as a DHCJ, gave a final order on 13 March 2007, including the first s.91(14) restriction, which was imposed to last until March 2011. On 7 May 2005, when D was then aged 10, [the mother] issued her fourth substantive application for increased contact. In order to consider whether leave should be granted, investigations were carried out by the Guardian, a child psychiatrist and Cafcass. HHJ Wilcox refused leave to apply on 3 August 2009.  A fifth application was issued by [the mother] on 13 November 2010 (the second application issued within the s.91(14) restriction), when D was aged 11. Further psychiatric assessments were carried out and the court was assisted by Cafcass and the Guardian. After a 7-day hearing, Wood J handed down a final judgment [on 2 November 2012] with the second s.91(14) restriction, this one lasting until D was 18 in 2017. On 5 January 2016 [the mother] made her sixth application for contact. Her permission hearing was heard by HHJ Richards, sitting as a DHCJ, without notice to [the father] or C, who gave permission and allowed an increase in contact. </p>

There, she states that it is her view that the contact should be increased to fortnightly; that it should be unsupervised; and that it should take place in her own residence. Miss Miles, who has argued the mother&#8217;s case eloquently and with circumspection, recognises that this ambition is completely unrealistic. Nonetheless, she argues that with the attainment by D of the age of majority, and with the passage of time generally, now is the time when there should be a further full welfare investigation as to whether the contact arrangements should be altered. </p>

It is not suggested by him that the mother behaves during the contact sessions other than appropriately and sensitively, nor that D does not derive some pleasure from the visits. Nonetheless he argues that contact is stressful for D and for his family members. He maintains that it is not arguably shown that D would benefit from any increase in contact. Further, he argues that the litigation process would be highly stressful both to D and his family members. Essentially, it is submitted that the present contact is as much as D and his family members can cope with. For these reasons it is submitted that the mother should not be granted permission to make her application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">During submissions I made it clear that were I to grant permission I would nonetheless endeavour to make the litigation process as compressed and painless as possible. However, it cannot be gainsaid that it will be lengthy and expensive. Steps will need to be taken formally to assess D&#8217;s capacity, although the result of this is agreed by all to be a foregone conclusion. Steps will need to be taken to ensure that his voice is heard by the court. At the least this will mean inviting the local authority to appoint in his favour an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate. He or she will need to meet and get to know D and will have to file evidence. There will need to be evidence from the local authority as to whether their present care plan should be altered. There will need to be evidence from the father, the mother and C. There will need to be evidence from the present caring team. There will need to be a final hearing, probably lasting at least two days, at which oral evidence will be given; that would be unlikely to be concluded before next summer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not place any material weight on the attainment by D the age of majority. His father and C told me that he has a mental age of about seven years. Symbolism aside, his attainment of majority signifies nothing. I do not agree that because this arbitrary chronological threshold has been passed that D is entitled to be afforded more respect to his right to autonomy than prevailed in the period leading up to his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. </p>

This has included obsessively lining up all his toys and other belongings, teeth-grinding, eye-closing and compulsive masturbation. </p>

I cannot say that I am satisfied that the mother has shown a good arguable case that a substantive application would succeed if permission were granted. Fundamentally, I am not satisfied that circumstances have changed to any material extent since the contact regime was fixed seven years ago and confirmed by me two years ago. I cannot discern any material benefit that would accrue to D if this permission application were granted. On the contrary, I can see the potential for much stress and unhappiness not only for D but also for his family members if the application were to be allowed to proceed. </p>
