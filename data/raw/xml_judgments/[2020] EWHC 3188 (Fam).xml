	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.02in">The issue before me is whether or not I have power to rectify an order dated 28 September 2017 (&#8220;the September 2017 order&#8221;) made by District Judge Aitkens, sitting as a district judge, (&#8220;the district judge&#8221;) of the Principal Registry of the Family Division (&#8220;PRFD&#8221;) by which she registered an order made by the Paris Regional Court on 16 </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0in">November 2010 (&#8220;the French order&#8221;). The substantive case is being heard in the Central Family Court as it involves enforcement of maintenance obligations in the French order.  Even though I am sitting in the Family Court as a judge of the High Court, I have no power, while sitting in that Court, to rectify or otherwise deal with orders made in the PRFD.  However, I am authorised by Mr Justice Mostyn, to sit concurrently in the High Court in order to address the issues arising out of the order of the district judge. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.02in">The question arises because the district judge registered the French order pursuant to Article 28 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 (&#8220;BIIA&#8221;), which, to be fair to her, was what she was asked to do.  The form used was C69 which was that designated for registration of parental responsibility orders under BIIA.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.02in">Following registration, as indicated, the applicant wife (&#8220;the wife&#8221;) made applications to the Family Court sitting at the Central Family Court (&#8220;the CFC&#8221;) for enforcement of the husband&#8217;s maintenance obligations, as set out in the French order. The enforcement applications were made on the basis that the order being enforced had been registered under BIIA.  Notwithstanding this, some of the orders made in the CFC were marked as being made pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 4/2009 (&#8220;the Maintenance Regulation&#8221;).  I have not set out the full history of the procedure in this case, which is extensive, and helpfully contained in the Chronology provided by Ms Amaouche, for which I am grateful.  It is now common ground that there was no jurisdiction to register the French order pursuant to BIIA because the French order concerned only maintenance obligations which are excluded under Article 1(3) of BIIA.  The application should have been for a declaration of enforceability under Article 26 of the Maintenance Regulation or registration as it is usually called in this jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.02in">Unfortunately, nobody noticed that the French order had been incorrectly registered until 17 March 2020 when the respondent husband took the point and argued that the failure to obtain a declaration of enforcement of the French order in accordance with the provisions of the Maintenance Regulation means that the registration was made without jurisdiction and consequently all the orders made by the CFC are void <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>.  As these include costs orders running to over &#163;76,000 in the applicant&#8217;s favour, one can see the importance of the issue to both parties. He argued that all the CFC orders should be struck out but it seems to me that if they are void <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span> they are simply ineffective and no action needs to be taken.  </p>

The case concerned the issue of whether service of orders and documents on the husband out of the jurisdiction by email was valid and whether or not Mostyn J had properly exercised his discretion under the Rule when he refused to set aside the orders permitting service on the husband by email. In that case Moylan LJ reviewed relevant cases on the extent of the court&#8217;s power to rectify orders both under the Rule and CPR 3.1(7), which is the same terms.  He first noted that the Rule applies to orders made &#8220;under these rules&#8221; and that while it is not expressly confined to procedural orders, it clearly applies to such orders, as held in <span style="font-style:italic">Roult v North West Strategic Health Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/444" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 444" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 444</ref> [paragraph 85].  He then went on to set out the principles applicable to the exercise of the jurisdiction to vary, set aside or revoke orders in the light of the authorities.  I acknowledge that Moylan LJ proceeded on the basis that Mostyn J had the necessary power to rectify and that what he said about the relevant principles was <span style="font-style:italic">obiter </span>in light of his decision that the FPR confer power to order service out of the jurisdiction by alternative means provided such alternative means were not contrary to the law of the place of service.  Nevertheless, he considered the authorities carefully and his judgment carries great weight: the authorities to which he referred were not <span style="font-style:italic">obiter </span>and I have no difficulty in adopting and applying the principles he set out.

That case concerned the question of whether the court had power under the Rule (or otherwise) to vary or set aside an order made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court (a return order) even where no error had been made by the court.  He concluded that the power in the Rule was wide enough for that purpose, that it could be exercised by a first instance court and it was unnecessary to resort to the inherent jurisdiction notwithstanding the nature of the original order.   </p>

The relevant decrees could not be void because the petition had been presented more than 1 year after the marriage, it pleaded the appropriate ground, namely that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and there was a fact in existence at the date of the petition which, if pleaded, would have justified the grant of a decree nisi and decree absolute.  In those circumstances the decrees were valid and the discretion would be exercised to vary them.   </p>

In that case (I omit irrelevant details) a decree nisi and decree absolute had been granted unopposed on the husband&#8217;s petition in relation to an English marriage between the parties in 1994: the grounds were adultery.  In fact, the parties had been validly married in Madrid the previous year.  In 2020, the wife asserted that the parties were still married because the relevant marriage was the Spanish marriage not the English marriage.  The husband sought rectification of both decrees.  The issue, as identified by the President, was whether the court had jurisdiction to make the alteration sought and, if so, whether it should exercise that jurisdiction.  The President was satisfied that he had jurisdiction to vary the decrees and that he should exercise it to rectify them because the original orders were valid and rectification would simply &#8220;put right that which should have been the case all the way along.&#8221;  He further stated that where the error is one of process the jurisdiction to rectify should be that provided by the rules as there is no need to invoke any higher inherent jurisdiction. </p>

I agree with Ms Dunseath that whether the court had jurisdiction to register the French order in September 2017 depends on whether the wife can establish &#8220;local jurisdiction&#8221;, within the meaning of Article 28(2) of the Maintenance Regulation.  This involves satisfying the court of the matters required by Part 34 and PD 34E of the FPR, as set out above.  I do not agree that the FPR and PD34A conferred jurisdiction on the court: in my judgment, that is confusing process and practice with jurisdiction.  The latter is conferred on the court by the Maintenance Regulation itself, the former is addressed by the FPR.  The fact that the district judge was asked to recognise an order pursuant to BIIA does not, in my judgment, deprive her of the power to recognise it under the Maintenance Regulation, if she had been satisfied of the matters necessary to confer local jurisdiction.

Ms Amaouche criticizes the husband for not promptly raising this issue.  Notwithstanding the husband&#8217;s unacceptable conduct in relation to the enforcement proceedings, I feel it is somewhat harsh to condemn him for not noticing the error in circumstances where that error was overlooked by so many on both sides and by the courts.  There is no suggestion that the husband has acted deliberately in this respect.  Once the parties became aware of the problem, the (informal) application to rectify by the wife was made reasonably promptly given the need to consider the technicalities of the EU Regulations and the history of this particular case. Arguably, the issue of finality is somewhat moot as the applicant can immediately issue a new, properly constituted application for registration/a declaration of enforcement, if my decision goes against her.  In any event, she has another application on foot in relation to lump sum orders &#8211; the current enforcement application relates only to periodical payments, although I am not aware of the basis of that application.  Finality is not, therefore, necessarily achievable.   </p>

While it was certainly a necessary step to take in seeking enforcement of the French order, in my judgment it was not a purely procedural order either.  The order was substantive in that it conferred jurisdiction on the Family Court to entertain the enforcement application.  However, in my judgment the type of order it was is neither here nor there: as <span style="font-style:italic">N v J, G &amp; H</span>; <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">X v Y </span>make clear, the power is exercisable in relation to substantive and final orders too. </p>

If my decision goes against her, the wife will also lose the benefit of the costs orders made in her favour.  Those costs have been driven up by the husband&#8217;s failure to comply with court orders, hence the adverse costs orders.  I have some doubt as to whether there was any mistake of fact made, as opposed to a mistake of procedure, unless it can be said that the district judge made a mistake of fact in believing that the order sought to be enforced was a parental responsibility order, or ancillary to such an order, and thus registerable under BIIA.

The copy of the C69 with which I have been provided is partly illegible so I cannot see what was said about the reasons for the application but I assume that they included enforcement of periodical payments.  In any event, the translation of the French order provided to the district judge made it clear that enforcement of a parental responsibility order was not sought as the youngest child was born in 1997 and was 20 years old in September 2017.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there is a proper basis, namely manifest error, for rectification, so the final issue is whether or not the district judge could and would have declared the French order enforceable under the Maintenance Regulation if she had appreciated the true nature of the application.   </p>

The use of English law is not a sufficient basis, in my judgment, to draw an inference that the DB Pension Fund is based in England and Wales: indeed, I would be very surprised if it was, given Deutsche Bank&#8217;s origins and its likely eye to the fiscal advantages of off-shore pension funds.   </p>

In her skeleton arguments Ms Amaouche says that she is instructed that the husband and his current wife had or have a periodic tenancy on a flat in Cadogan Gardens where, it is common ground, the husband was subsequently served with the enforcement proceedings.  She submits that I can infer that the husband was habitually resident in this jurisdiction in September 2017 by virtue of that tenancy.  With regret, I cannot accept that submission in the light of the address given for the husband in the C69 and in the absence of any evidence as to when the tenancy arose or when existence of the tenancy was discovered.  The C69, in response to Part 6, on mediation, did not state that the husband&#8217;s whereabouts were unknown but simply stated that he could not be reached for mediation purposes.  In Part 9, it was not suggested that the husband &#8216;s address, as given, was his last known address, it simply stated that it was not known how long he had lived there, with the clear implication being that he lived there at that time.  The D50 dated 11 September 2018 asserts that the husband&#8217;s address is in Budapest, as do the committal applications of 29 November 2018, 8 January 2020 and 4 June 2020.  The wife plainly knew when the husband was in the Cadogan Gardens flat, perhaps via her children, as he was served there; but that does not establish habitual residence, particularly in light of the addresses she gave for him in her subsequent applications.  None of the witness statements made by her assert that the husband is habitually resident in England and Wales. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the husband was habitually resident in England and Wales in September 2017 or, indeed, at all. </p>

Firstly, she asks me to infer that he has other assets in the jurisdiction from the fact of the tenancy.  Secondly, Ms Amaouche points to a second pension, a JP Morgan pension which the husband has disclosed in his Form E [B174] but which, it is said, is international.

A mere assertion in a skeleton argument is not enough, nor is the fact that it existed in October 2018. If it was held in September 2017, it may be capable of giving rise to an inference that the husband had, at least, a UK bank account out of which he could conveniently pay rent, bills etc.  However, such a bank account could equally have been held in his now wife&#8217;s name.  Alternatively, the husband might have had a sterling account in France or in some other jurisdiction out of which he paid the bills.  However, in my judgment, too much speculation is required for me safely to infer that the husband had an English bank account in September 2017 or any other connected assets even were I satisfied that the tenancy existed in September 2017. </p>

He has also dragged his heels in providing a signed Form E and appears to have provided inadequate disclosure.  In addition, he has launched numerous appeals both in France and in England.  I note that the original Schedule 1 proceedings issued by the wife were withdrawn because the children were all adults at the date that application was made.  However, in order to draw adverse inferences from non or defective disclosure, there must still be some evidence on which such inferences can be based.   This is not a case of establishing that the husband has assets, he plainly has, as he acknowledges in his Form E.  It is a question of establishing that he has assets in this jurisdiction and that he held them in September 2017.  The wife has not put forward any evidence to support those basic findings nor much evidence that the husband currently has such assets notwithstanding filing three witness statements. </p>
