The issues upon which I have concentrated, because I see them as relevant to welfare determinations and, in due course, so that the children have an understanding of their history are these &#8211;  </p>

W and U have made allegations about the way in which they were treated by the mother historically and more recently.

The father&#8217;s sister, ST, also gave her evidence through an interpreter over a period of about two hours. The father&#8217;s evidence occupied a shorter time than the mother&#8217;s; and for the most part he managed to give his answers in English and without recourse to his interpreter.

I found the mother to be a persuasive, mild mannered and articulate witness who had no difficulty in responding in detail to whatever was asked of her. Her account of harsh treatment from the father&#8217;s family seemed to me to be entirely plausible. The detail with which she described being hit both by the father and the paternal grandmother was compelling. It obviously concerned her that, as she said, the father had beaten her up when she was pregnant with M.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the father&#8217;s claims that the mother wished to leave the family home, the children and asked him for a divorce so that she could be with his step sister&#8217;s son. In the light of subsequent events, particularly the lengths to which the mother went to initiate and then pursue these proceedings it is wholly unlikely that the father&#8217;s version of events is true. Having had the opportunity to assess the mother&#8217;s commitment to the children over the several days of this hearing, I can be confident that he is attempting to deceive when he suggests the mother voluntarily left the children. I am convinced she was ejected from the house because that is what the father and the paternal family wanted. They had no respect for her and would have made no secret of their feelings in front of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Now I turn to my conclusions relating to the father&#8217;s claims against the mother of caring very little for and having harmed the children. I do so in the light of his evidence yesterday. The father said he had changed his mind. He has thought a lot about what would be best for the children and agrees that their relationship with their mother is &#8220;most important.&#8221; He now wants them to develop their links with their mother and has suggested they should be spending every other weekend and half the holidays with her. The father now believes a shared parenting arrangement would be the best thing for the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of that evidence it is fairly straightforward to decide how and why the father came to make his extravagant, groundless and extremely critical claims against the mother. I am as sure as I can be that his response to being faced with these proceedings was to seek to build the strongest case he could against her. Accusing her of being a bad parent was just one part of his defence. But the father knows there was and is no truth in those suggestions. The mother was and is a very caring, affectionate and loving individual. She has not burnt any of the children other than accidentally. She cares deeply for them and is entirely committed to their welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final matter for determination before I turn to welfare considerations is the cause of the difficulties at contact. There was, as is accepted by the father, a complete absence of communication between the children and their mother from February 2012 and February 2013 when these proceedings began. Earlier in his evidence had said he did not know where the mother was and how to get in touch with her. Later on, he accepted he should have done more to ensure there was contact. In the context of the wide family networks, including relatives with whom both the father and mother have links, it is simply incredible that the father was unable to locate the mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The absence of a parent for a significant period, in all probability, will cause harm especially where the children are so young that making sense of the situation for themselves will have been impossible. They may sense that they have been abandoned; they may feel that in some way they were at fault so that their mother was no longer part of their lives. But where, as here, there is adverse influence, the situation becomes a great deal worse. It is extremely painful to read of the hurtful, disrespectful and unkind comments made to the mother by the children. </p>

It is a large house where a number of others live including NM&#8217;s son and daughter in law together with their two children. Their third child is expected soon. The mother and M have been accommodated there and have been very well supported in particular by Mr I, NM&#8217;s husband.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very understandably, Ms Chaudhry draws attention to the father&#8217;s actions in bringing the children here unilaterally, in separating them from their loving mother and in exposing them to significant emotional harm in that their relationship with their mother has not been promoted or nurtured. Thus far, argues Ms Chaudhry, the father has shown little insight into the role the mother should be playing in the children&#8217;s lives; and it is a real concern that ST, the children&#8217;s aunt has seemingly exerted such influence. The mother is therefore extremely concerned about the situation in the father&#8217;s home, pointing to the likelihood that the responsibility for looking after the children would seem to be delegated to IK and ST. Ms Chaudhry argues there must be a real question as to where the children&#8217;s real home is arising out of the findings of the welfare inquiry performed by the local authority albeit some time ago.</p>

There would be one obvious and very clear advantage which is that the sibling group would be together and able to share their day to day lives. There would also be a clear advantage in that the children would have more or less continuous time with their mother from whom they have been separated for so long. There would be an opportunity for them to restore their fractured relationship by sharing her home, her routines and experiencing her ways of looking after them.</p>

They are accustomed to life with their father, ST, her children and now the father&#8217;s new wife IK. They are making good progress in school and in almost every area of their development. Their significant problem, currently, is that they have not been truly encouraged and permitted to have a loving relationship with their mother. Now there are good indications, from the father&#8217;s evidence at this hearing, that he is prepared to make real and significant changes so that the defect is addressed.</p>

Though at his age W&#8217;s wishes could never be viewed as having a major influence upon decision making, it is a factor against any change in the residential arrangements that he and his sisters would make their objections plain. Their emotional needs are to feel stable, settled and secure wherever they live. They are confident in their father&#8217;s care and making the most of their educational opportunities. All of their physical needs are met as the result, no doubt, of the service provided to them by IK supplemented by ST. I have no doubt at all but that they look up to and respect their father. Any abrupt change into the home of NM on the basis that their mother&#8217;s immigration status is not yet determined would not be beneficial to the children. </p>

Once evidence has been given, positions made clear and decisions taken very often there is potential for rapprochement and progress. I am optimistic that from the seeds sown at this hearing there will be a dramatic change in family relationships most of all between the mother and father. I would hope that he will pay attention to ensuring that all members of his family, both here and in Pakistan, apply themselves to supporting the essential aim of rebuilding trust and cooperation with the mother for the children&#8217;s sake.  The time for allegations and cross allegations is now at an end. The parents must stop building cases against one another and start constructing a solid basis for collaboratively supporting every area of their children&#8217;s development.</p>

If they do not, then there will be a need to investigate the cause of any continuing problems and tailor the children&#8217;s arrangements accordingly.</p>
