	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The brief background is as follows.  The parties are Russian nationals in their mid-40s who have lived in England since August 2005.  They married in Moscow in 1991.   Including pre-marriage cohabitation the marriage lasted for nearly 20 years.  There are two children of the marriage who are 16 and 12 years of age. Both the boys are educated in England and both are attending boarding school.  The parties each have a child from a previous marriage.  The wife&#8217;s daughter is 25 years old and was adopted by the husband in Russia.  The family&#8217;s connection with England started as long ago as 1998, when the wife&#8217;s daughter was first sent to school in the UK.  The husband&#8217;s son, is 23 years of age and he, it would appear from the limited information available to the court, is very involved with the husband in his business affairs.</span></p>

It is alleged by the wife that this was done without her knowledge and consent.  Indeed, Parker J. at the recent directions hearing ordered the husband to produce the transfer in order to allow the signature to be examined.  Parker J attached a penal notice to that order. I have not got a copy of the draft order and do not know not the date when the transfer was to be filed.</span></p>

After a year or so living in rented accommodation they bought their first London home for approaching &#163;4 million.  This property was and remains in the parties&#8217; joint names.  This is where their family life was conducted and it was to there that the boys returned to from boarding school during the school holidays. Before the breakdown of the marriage the family moved into rented accommodation whilst the former matrimonial homewas being renovated.</span></p>

It had no supporting documentation whatsoever, and as Mr. Scott sensibly and realistically concedes on the husband&#8217;s behalf, it is very limited in the information it gives.  In fact, it is more than limited; it gives the court absolutely no idea of the extent of the husband&#8217;s wealth other than the properties already identified by the wife and frozen under the July order as being in the United Kingdom; he says that a Forbes estimate of his wealth at &#163;150 million was an exaggeration.  Income is not even mentioned.</span></p>

It is a strong thing for a court to refuse to hear a party to a cause, and it is only to be justified by great considerations of public policy.  It is a step which a court will only take when the party itself impedes the course of justice and there is no other effective means of securing his compliance &#8230; Applying this principle, I am of the opinion that the fact that a party to a cause has disobeyed an order of the court is not of itself a bar to his being heard, but if his disobedience is such that, so long as it continues it impedes the course of justice in the cause by making it more difficult for the court to ascertain the truth or enforce the orders which it may make, then the court may, in its discretion, refuse to hear him until the impediment is removed or good reason is shown why it should not be removed.&#8221;</span></p>

The husband has set out to deprive the court of the information which it needs and to which it is entitled and the provision of which is in his gift.  In those circumstances, in my judgment, the fact that the contemnor in the present case is the respondent, as opposed to the applicant, does not preclude the court from declining to hear him, nor does it fall foul of Art. 6.</span></p>

As Mr. Dyer submitted, this court can have no idea whether the very substantial sum (over &#163;500,000 per annum) which is sought by the wife by way of interim provision is, at one extreme ludicrously aspirational, or, at the other, wholly reasonable when taken against the backdrop of the family&#8217;s wealth.</span></p>

As of September 2009 he stopped all financial support and put her (and the children), in a situation where she has to live in rented accommodation (albeit expensive accommodation in a fashionable part of London), and support the family on loans from a friend. The husband cannot now, submits Mr Dyer, use the  generosity of those friends who have no obligation, whether moral or financial, to provide any financial assistance, to pray in aid  an argument that the wife has no &#8216;immediate need&#8217; for maintenance and that he should as a consequence be allowed to shirk his obligation towards her and his children.</p>

Such temporary assistance should not subsequently be used as a basis for resisting the making of an order for interim maintenance which would otherwise be appropriate. The fact that the sums involved in this case are very considerable matters not; this is a family who lived at a very high level, as do their friends and acquaintances.</p>

The wife continues to pay the standing charges in relation to the property. It was the family home. It is empty and the wife would like to move back in with the boys. The husband refuses and has changed the locks. The wife has no idea what sort of condition the flat is in given that the family originally moved out of the property on a temporary basis prior to the breakdown of the marriage in order for it to be refurbished. The wife has consequently been driven to make an application in the County Court for a declaration that she is entitled to occupy her own property. The husband opposes the application on the basis that the flat should be sold and the proceeds of sale be divided between the parties.</p>

The lease on the rented property comes to an end on 31 October 2010; the husband however maintains his refusal to allow the wife to move back into the former matrimonial home and the County Court proceedings continue. The wife and children have no alternative therefore but to remain at the rented property and the husband will have to pay for his intransigence as the wife&#8217;s maintenance will have to provide not only for rent but also for the essential recurring charges in relation to the former matrimonial home.</p>

The failure of the husband to comply with the court&#8217;s order to file an affidavit in response to the wife&#8217;s application means that he has deprived the court of the opportunity adequately to carry out an analysis of both sides&#8217; contentions when  exercising  its&#8217; discretion.</p>

On the contrary, when he leaves a gap in such  a state that two alternative inferences may be drawn, the court will normally draw the less favourable inference &#8211; especially where it seems likely that his able legal advisers would have hastened to put forward affirmatively any facts, if they had existed, establishing the more favourable alternative&#8221;</p>
