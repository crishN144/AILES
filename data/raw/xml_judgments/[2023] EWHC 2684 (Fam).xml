The Defendant sought sight of the court file created in respect of this contempt application in order (he said) to satisfy himself that it existed, that the application had been properly entered into the file, and the fee paid; indeed, he indicated that he would not engage with the contempt proceedings unless he could be so reassured.  Deploying my powers under rule 29.12 FPR 2010, I gave my permission for him to be provided with a screenshot of the index of the FamilyMan digital file which confirmed the date on which the process had been launched, the fee paid, and documents entered on the court file.</p>

Mr Payter therefore applied to adjourn the hearing in order to obtain the audio-recording and a full transcript. I adjourned the hearing for one week so that an audio-recording could be obtained of the Defendant&#8217;s interview, a transcript prepared, and both served on the court and the Defendant.  This was done, but at the adjourned hearing (9 August), the Defendant was unwell and could not attend court; he submitted a medical certificate.  The adjourned hearing was therefore re-listed for 25 October 2023.</p>

The child was placed for adoption.  An adoption application was then issued by the prospective adopters under a confidential serial number (see rule 14.2 FPR 2010).

This was a case in which the Defendant had made a number of recordings of family court hearings, which were then posted on YouTube.  Among the issues in that case were that (a) the Defendant contended that he was not in contempt of court in circumstances where at the time he uploaded the videos he was not aware that the family proceedings were heard in private, it being only later that he realised his actions were unlawful, and (b) the publication of the videos had no impact on the Children Act proceedings long since concluded and that there is no evidence that the publication in fact undermined the administration of justice more widely.</p>

It is, in my judgment, a most serious contempt of court to defy the long-established principle of privacy in adoption cases by covert recording of a hearing; the contempt is aggravated when the recording is published.  Whether proceedings are current or completed, the protection granted by Parliament remains operational.</p>
