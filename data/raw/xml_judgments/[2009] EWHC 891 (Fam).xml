		    <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0.06in">McFarlane was a paradigm case for an award of compensation in respect of the significant future economic disparity sustained by the wife, arising from the way the parties conducted their marriage.  Equal division of the capital was not enough to provide for needs or compensate for disadvantage but unusually the husband&#8217;s very substantial earning power was far in excess of the family's financial needs after separation.  The wife, having given up her own highly paid career for the family, was not only entitled to generous income provision, including sums which would enable her to provide for her old age and insure the husband's life, she was also entitled to a share in the very large surplus, on the principles both of sharing and of compensation.  The Court of Appeal had been wrong to set a 5-year time limit on the order, on the basis that the wife would save the whole surplus above her requirements and that she would have the burden of justifying continuing payments at the end of the order, especially given the high threshold.  The burden should be on the husband to justify a reduction, at which stage the court could consider whether a clean break was practicable, which would depend on the amount of capital generated by the husband. &#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The issues now before me concern (1) the amount and period of periodical payments to the wife, whether they should be capitalised and whether there should now be a clean break, and (2) the amount and period of periodical payments for the children.  These issues have not been brought before the court in the way that the House of Lords envisaged (i.e. by an application by the husband).  The application before the court was issued by the wife.  Initially her application issued on 17 May 2007 sought only an upward variation of the order of the District Judge dated 22 December 2002 relating to the periodical payments to be made for the children. The application was amended on 25 June 2007 to add an application for upward variation of the periodical payments to the wife.  That application introduces the question whether the time has now been reached for a clean break or a deferred clean break. </p>

When giving her evidence she became upset when describing aspects of the history concerning the move of the husband to live near to her and the children.  Her affidavit sworn on 13 February 2009 does not do her justice and contains a number of passages that have the character of submissions or assertions.  As will become apparent in my judgment some of these were not made out.  I however hasten to add that in my judgment by her oral evidence she demonstrated that she was transparently honest and was doing her best to give an accurate account in respect of all aspects of her evidence, and thus as to the past, the present and the future.  What shone through from her evidence was that she was genuinely and understandably concerned about her medium to long term future and her ability to maintain her present, or an appropriate, standard of living throughout her life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">In short both parties were impressive and in their own ways demonstrated their scars arising from the breakdown of their marriage and thus the existence of emotional and other factors which support and found the public and private interests in favour of a clean break.  For example, I note that the husband submitted that the words of Lord Scarman in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Minton v Minton</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1979] AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1979">[1979] AC 593</ref> in particular at 608G that an object of the modern law is to encourage each spouse to put the past behind them and to begin a new life which is not overshadowed by the relationship that has broken down, remained wise and appropriate guidance.  I found this an interesting recognition by a paying party of the benefits of a clean break and the taking of the risks inherent in it for him.  The problem for both sides and the court is whether in all the circumstances a clean break can be achieved fairly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0.12in">When they began to cohabit in 1982, the Appellant was about to commence work as a solicitor&#8217;s articled clerk working at Clifford Turner, a well-known City firm of solicitors.  The Respondent was a trainee chartered accountant working for Touche Ross.  Prior to their marriage, the parties purchased the first of four homes that they bought together during the course of their relationship and marriage.  By about the time that they married in 1984, they had both qualified in their respective professions.  In 1985, the Appellant moved to 3i, a large venture capital company, which provided the parties with the benefit of a reduced rate mortgage.  After the birth of J she returned to work for 3i.  In 1990, the Respondent became a partner in Touche Ross.  Until this time, the Appellant earned as much as and, for a period, more than the Respondent.  In 1991, just before S&#8217;s birth, the parties agreed that the Appellant should give up work.  They agreed to concentrate on the husband's career in order to provide the funding of the family's lifestyle.  The Appellant has not since returned to work as a solicitor, but has on two occasions begun to re-train.  When J and S were in full-time education the Appellant started a P.G.C.E. (Professional Graduate Certificate in Education) course with a view to becoming a full-time teacher.  This was abandoned when H was born.  Later the Appellant trained as a teacher of English as a Foreign Language, having some paid employment in 2001 and 2002.  In Summer 2002 the Appellant sat and passed two of the three exams required to become an Independent Financial Adviser.  Her case was that this was primarily so that she could understand the advice she was being given in relation to her wish to secure her future and that of the children. </p>

It was purchased in the Appellant's sole name in an attempt to protect it from possible claims arising from the Respondent&#8217;s profession.  The parties resolved to and did pay off the large mortgage on the property in 1999.  Shortly before they separated, the parties had purchased in their joint names a holiday home in Salcombe, Devon, which at trial was valued at &#163;255,000.  In June 2000, a flat was bought in the Respondent&#8217;s name in Clerkenwell for &#163;415,000.  This gave rise to borrowings of approximately &#163;450,000, which he paid off almost entirely in some 16 months.  By 1 March 2002 he had reduced the borrowing to &#163;50,000.  After the parties separated in December 2000, the Respondent moved into this flat. </p>

The parties agreed that the Appellant was to retain the former matrimonial home in Barnes, in which she and the children continue to live, and which at the trial before the District Judge had an agreed value of &#163;1.5 million and no mortgage.  The Appellant also had some modest investments and funds at the bank.  The Appellant and the children continued to live in the former matrimonial home until the judgment of the Court of Appeal, when the Appellant then sold 12 Ranelagh Avenue for &#163;1,790,500 and purchased a property in South Kensington for &#163;2.542 million, including costs of purchase. </p>

In addition, he was to have his partnership current-account in Deloittes.  The Respondent also retained other Deloittes interests.  There was an issue between the parties as to whether the Respondent&#8217;s partnership currentaccount should be included in the calculation of capital.  The Appellant argued that it should and that the division of capital was therefore unequal in favour of the Respondent.  The  Respondent left it out of the account and argued that the division of capital slightly favoured the Appellant.  The various capital figures changed over the course of the proceedings, but the District Judge, who did not expressly deal with the dispute about the partnership current-account, held that the division of capital "<span style="font-style:italic">is roughly a 50-50 split</span>&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0.12in">In August 2002, the Respondent and his partner Ms Carol Atha (who were married in June 2003) purchased a new home at 108 Castlenau, London, SW13 for &#163;2.94 million, including costs.  The Respondent and Ms Atha executed a trust deed recording their interests in the property in the ratio of 70: 30 in the Respondent&#8217;s favour to reflect their respective contributions.  The Respondent had contributed &#163;2.054 million to the purchase cost, of which approximately &#163;1.6 million had been borrowed by way of mortgage.  The balance of the Respondent's contribution came from the proceeds of the sale of the flat in Clerkenwell, which the Respondent sold for &#163;551,000 net. Ms Atha, who is a junior partner in Deloittes, contributed the remainder of the purchase price, largely by borrowing.  The Respondent stated that, as had been done in the case of the former matrimonial home at Ranelagh Avenue, he intended to repay his mortgage over five years at the rate of &#163;347,000 per annum. </p>

The Respondent drew about &#163;12,000 per month from his partnership.  In addition, there was an annual distribution of the preceding year&#8217;s profits on a quarterly basis.  This amount was determined by the number of units allocated to each partner.  The husband, then head of corporate tax planning, was on level five of seven possible levels, for which he was allocated a fixed number of units.  He also had the ability to earn extra secondary units based on his performance throughout the year.  At the date of the trial, he had 250 units and since the parties separated had been allocated a further 50 performance units for the year ended 31 May 2002. </p>

In my judgment the husband is right that the order of the House of Lords (which I have not seen) did not reinstate the index linking and the result was that he was to pay periodical payments of &#163;250,000 per annum to the wife for their joint lives (or earlier re-marriage or further order) and periodical payments of &#163;20,000 per annum for each of the children until the age of 23 or the cessation of tertiary education plus school fees and health insurance.

It was not pursued in argument before me, rather it was in my view correctly accepted on behalf of the wife that the removal of index linking by Bennett J had unsurprisingly not been redressed by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords and so the wife had not benefited from any increases over the last 6 years, although the RPI had increased by 19.3%.  Index linking was only sought for the future (back dated to the date of the application to vary, namely from 25 June 2007).  </p>

She was working a 4 day week.  At 3i and Freshfields she was not working in a fee earning role.  At Freshfields she worked in a support role relating to information and know how, computers were gaining in importance and a lot of information was in paper form and was not organised properly.  The job was a demanding, important and valuable one but by this stage she was not earning as much as the husband.  She told me that a colleague of hers was made a partner about two years after she left (although she could not remember her name) and that at the time this was regarded as a big deal because it was unusual for a non fee earner to be offered a partnership and this was a recognition of the importance of such support roles in the building up of a successful partnership.  </p>

He has worked extremely hard and has been and continues to be very successful.  In 1991 the parties made a joint decision that their children would be brought up by the mother on a day-to-day basis and she would abandon her career.  It has been suggested on behalf of the husband that the wife did not enjoy her work and found it stressful; that she willingly gave up her career; implying thereby that it diminished the value of her contribution in running the home and protecting the husband from the day-today stresses of child rearing.  I reject this argument.  The value of the wife's contribution is derived from what she did and how well she did it, rather than her motivation for doing it and, in any event, she disputes that she did not enjoy her job.  There has not been a scintilla of criticism of the wife, either as a partner or as a mother.  The parties contribution to this long marriage has been different but of equal value.&#8221; </p>

It seems to me that that passage recognises that it is the consequences of the agreement of the parties, and thus the way they chose to run their lives together, that are centrally relevant.  Further, in my view, whatever reluctance or wish either party had for deciding on this way of life, and to my mind it is plain that the husband was committed to and wanted to pursue his career (and thus work hard and for long hours and as Baroness Hale says carry on breadwinning), what they decided to do resulted in benefits and burdens for both of them. </p>

I accept her assertion that partners of her age in very large firms of solicitors earn equivalent amounts to the husband but it is also the case that successful partners of her age (and his age) in large firms of accountants and solicitors earn less (and significantly less) than the husband. </p>

Given the uncertainties relating to the economic climate, and the recent graphic evidence that an approach based on the view that the income of high achievers in the City and the professions (and house prices) will continue to rise as they have in the recent past may well be seriously flawed, it seems to me that an approach which includes (or is entirely based on) a percentage of net earnings is likely to be sensible and one that caters for caution, optimism, inaccuracy and annual increases (decreases).  </p>

The parties share the roles of money-earner, home-maker and childcarer.  Mutual dependence begets mutual obligations of support.  When the marriage ends fairness requires that the assets of the parties should be divided primarily so as to make provision for the parties&#8217; housing and financial needs, taking into account a wide range of matters such as the parties&#8217; ages, their future earning capacity, the family's standard of living, and any disability of either party.  Most of these needs will have been generated by the marriage, but not all of them.  Needs arising from age or disability are instances of the latter. </p>

This is aimed at redressing any significant prospective economic disparity between the parties arising from the way they conducted their marriage.  For instance, the parties may have arranged their affairs in a way which has greatly advantaged the husband in terms of his earning capacity but left the wife severely handicapped so far as her own earning capacity is concerned.  Then the wife suffers a double loss: a diminution in her earning capacity and the loss of a share in her husband's enhanced income.  This is often the case.  Although less marked than in the past, women may still suffer a disproportionate financial loss on the breakdown of a marriage because of their traditional role as home-maker and childcarer. </p>

It would be extraordinary if this were not so.  If one party&#8217;s earning capacity has been advantaged at the expense of the other party during the marriage it would be extraordinary if, where necessary, the court could not order the advantaged party to pay compensation to the other out of his enhanced earnings when he receives them.

As to needs, the claimant's resources are always a matter to be taken into account.  And claimants for financial ancillary relief are expected to manage their financial affairs sensibly and responsibly.  Thus far I agree with the Court of Appeal.  But the wife&#8217;s claim for compensation stands differently.  Her compensation claim is not needs-related; it is loss related.  So the compensation element of her claim is not directly affected by the use she makes of her resources.&#8221; </p>

Even if they do their best to reenter the employment market, it will often be at a lesser level than before, and they will hardly ever be able to make up what they have lost in pension entitlements.  A further source of need maybe the way in which the parties&#8217; chose to run their life together.  Even dual career families are difficult to manage with completely equal opportunity for both.  Compromises often have to be made by one so that the other can get ahead.  All couples throughout their lives together have to make choices about who will do what, sometimes forced upon them by circumstances such as redundancy or low pay, sometimes freely made in the interests of them both.  The needs generated by such choices are a perfectly sound rationale for adjusting the parties respective resources in compensation. </p>

Indeed, some consider that provision for need is compensation for relationship-generated disadvantage.  But the economic disadvantage generated by the relationship may go beyond need, however generously interpreted.  The best example is a wife, like Mrs McFarlane, who has given up what would very probably have been a lucrative and successful career.  If the other party, who has been the beneficiary of the choices made during the marriage, is a high earner with a substantial surplus over what is required to meet both parties needs, then a premium above needs can reflect that relationship generated disadvantage. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0in">[144] Thus far, in common with my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, I have identified three principles which might guide the court in making an award: need (generously interpreted), compensation, and sharing.  I agree that there cannot be a hard and fast rule about whether one starts with equal sharing and departs if need or compensation supply a reason to do so, or whether one starts with need and compensation and shares the balance.  Much will depend upon how far future income is to be shared as well as current assets.  In general, it can be assumed that the marital partnership does not stay alive for the purpose of sharing future resources unless this is justified by need or compensation.  The ultimate objective is to give each party an equal start on the road to independent living. </p>

If capital has been equally shared and is enough to provide for need and compensate for disadvantage, then there should be no continuing financial provision.  In <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane, </span>there has been an equal division of property, but this largely consisted of homes which can be characterised as family assets.  This was not enough to provide for needs or compensate for disadvantage.  The main family asset is the husband&#8217;s very substantial earning power, generated over a lengthy marriage in which the couple deliberately chose that the wife should devote herself to home and family and the husband to work and career.  The wife is undoubtedly entitled to generous income provision for herself and for the sake of their children, including sums which will enable her to provide for her own old age and insure the husband's life.  She is also entitled to a share in the very large surplus, on the principles both of sharing the fruits of the matrimonial partnership and of compensation for the comparable position which she might have been in had she not compromised her own career for the sake of them all.  The fact that she might have wanted to do this is neither here nor there.  Most breadwinners want to go on breadwinning.  The fact that they enjoy their work does not disentitle them to a proper share in the fruits of their labours. </p>

The children will eventually take up much less of her time and energy.  She could either return to work as a solicitor or retrain for other satisfying and gainful activity.  She cannot, therefore rely upon the present level of provision for the rest of her life.  But the Court of Appeal was wrong to set a limit to it on the basis that she would save the whole surplus above her requirements with a view to providing for herself once the time limit was up.  They were wrong to place the burden upon her of justifying continuing payments, especially now that they have set a high threshold for doing so: see <span style="font-style:italic">Fleming v Fleming</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/1841" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 1841" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 1841</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 667" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 667</ref>.  On any view she will continue to be entitled to some continuing compensation, even if the needs generated by the relationship diminish or eventually vanish (although that cannot be guaranteed, despite her best endeavours, given the length of time she has been out of the labour market and the difficulties of repairing her pension position).  The burden should be upon the husband to justify a reduction.  At that stage, the court will again have to consider whether a clean break is practicable, as it could be if the husband has generated enough capital to make it realistic. &#8221; </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[59] In my view there emerged from the post  - <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane </span>authorities to which I have been referred the following propositions in elaboration of, but consistent with, the House of Lords decision.  First, it is at the exit of the marriage and in relation to the division / redistribution of the family assets that the consideration of the element of compensation immediately arises, but as a feature of the concept of fairness rather than as a head of claim in its own right.  Second, on the exit from the marriage, the partnership ends and in ordinary circumstances a wife has no right or expectation of continuing economic parity (&#8220;sharing &#8220;) unless and to the extent that consideration of her needs, or compensation for relationship generated disadvantage so require.  A clean break is to be encouraged wherever possible.  Third, in big-money cases, where the matrimonial assets are sufficient for a clean break to be achieved, a wife with ordinary career prospects is likely to have been compensated by an equal division of the assets and consideration of how the wife&#8217;s career might have progressed is unnecessary and should be avoided.  Where, however, that is not the case and the parties accept or the court decides that fairness can only be achieved by an award of continuing periodical payments in respect of a wife's maintenance, then the matter of compensation in respect of relationship generated disadvantage requires consideration, again as a strand or element of fairness.  Fourth, in cases other than big-money cases where a continuing award of periodic payments is necessary and the wife has plainly sacrificed her own earning capacity, compensation will rarely be amenable to consideration as a separate element in the sense of a premium susceptible of calculation with any precision.  Where it is necessary to provide ongoing periodical payments for the wife after the division of capital assets insufficient to cover her future maintenance needs, any element of compensation is best dealt with by a generous assessment of her continuing needs unrestricted by purely budgetary considerations, in the light of the contribution of the wife to the marriage and the broad effect of the sacrifice of her own earning capacity upon her ability to provide for her own needs following the end of the matrimonial partnership.  These considerations are of course inherent in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25</ref>(a)(b)(d) and (f) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:0in">[60] This is not a big-money case; that is to say a case where the matrimonial assets are amply sufficient to provide for the needs of the parties and the area of debate relates solely to the fair and proper proportion of their distribution as between the breadwinner and the homemaker and carer.  Nor is it a case like <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span> where, although the assets were insufficient to make a clean break possible, not only was the husband's annual income far in excess of the financial needs of both the parties even after separation, but the economic disadvantage generated by the wife's abandonment of an established career as highly paid as that of her husband went well beyond the compensation afforded by a generous interpretation of needs: see <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span> paras 90 and 92.  It was of course those features which led the court to describe Mrs McFarlane as a &#8220;paradigm case&#8221; for an award of compensation for future economic disparity.

Their Lordships confirmed the amount of the periodical payments.

This means that an approach that seeks to quantify what the wife would have earned and be earning and provides that the husband pays her that in compensation would be wrong.  This goes back to the general point I have made earlier that it is the consequences of the choices that have been made that are of central importance and the focus should be on a fair distribution and allocation of the relevant resources they have produced.

Whatever the income or earning capacity that is given up, the choice and the support given to the family, and the husband&#8217;s career, success and earning capacity would effectively be the same.

That rate of saving puts her spend at about &#163;145,000.  Her budget in her Form E dated June 2007, which she divides between herself and the children, puts her element at &#163;155,326 (an increase of &#163;29,114 over her 2002 Form E).  That excludes repayments and interest on the mortgage. It includes a figure of &#163;31,021 for a full time housekeeper on her return to work plus &#163;1,000 for babysitting and she attributed &#163;7,000 of this to the children (&#163;5,000 to the youngest).  She recognises in her affidavit that she let her full time help go in 2008 and now spends in average &#163;1,500 a month on regular help and babysitting (&#163;18,000 a year).  On the same apportionments this reduces her budget by &#163;14,000 and thus to about &#163;141,000.

The wife&#8217;s response is that she does not want to have to deal with the firm in such circumstances and wants the security of this insurance.  I also note that the House of Lords recognised that her periodical payments should cover life (not critical illness) insurance premiums (see para [158]).  In my view this understandable view of the wife on critical illness cover is again something of a luxury whereas the premiums for term life cover (I was told at &#163;6,000 a year &#8211; but I have not found this listed separately) are not.  </p>

His analysis also shows that for the year to 31 May 2007 she spent &#163;195,565 on herself and the children and the average for the years December 2002 to May 2007 was &#163;178,030.

Also as I indicated when dealing with issues relating to the terms of this judgment and the order, in my judgment the underlying logic of these provisions for the girls supports the view, and I direct, that in respect of J the order should continue until the completion of a Masters degree (or an equivalent) if he decides to take one after completing his first degree next year (when he will be 21) or his 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> birthday whichever is the earlier (at present he is doing a three year degree course and may or may not embark on a further degree and it was not argued that his award should extend beyond the age of 23). </p>

For example the sum for holidays of &#163;27,000 for the three children is to my mind very high and those for clothes are high.  Also her budget includes a sum for University tuition costs which the husband agrees to pay separately.<span style="font-style:italic"/>Adjustments for these items would effectively cover the difference between the parties.  This also treats the school extras that are included as expenditure that is not covered by the order that the husband is to pay the school fees. </p>

(I add, for the avoidance of doubt that in my view this would cover the running costs of a car for the relevant child.)  Unlike the change in respect of the wife I have concluded that this change should not be back dated.  My main reasons for this are that (a) because, as I have indicated in the preceding paragraph, in my view parts of the wife&#8217;s expenditure on the children (and her appropriately prepared budget by reference to that) have been or are over generous and I am therefore not satisfied that the payments made to date for the children have not covered all their reasonable costs over their years of payment (and indeed when considered with those to the wife have resulted in her being able to make significant savings as intended from her award), (b) my figure for the children is based on the present and the future, (c) the overall basis of my award is to look at savings that the wife can make from the payments to her from her present position (which reflects the savings she has made in the past based on the totality of the payments made by the husband), and (d) the back dating of her award provides her with a sum which would cover any shortfall in respect of the payments for the children and which she can apply in the manner I indicate later.   </p>

So it would enable him to make some savings, and to continue to make the payments he does to his parents.   Generally it seems to me that for this purpose (namely deductions from his income to identify a surplus available to them both for saving) it would not be fair to attribute a lower figure than that included for the wife because for example his lifestyle spend is contributed to by his second wife. </p>

Naturally I acknowledge that the bracket is based on income resources and capital that are lower than would have been available if the wife had continued her career and represent a retirement income and capital base for them both that is less than they would have had if they had both continued their careers.   But the decision they made inevitably had these effects.  Also it had the effect that if their marriage ended part of the resource they chose to rely on would not produce all its fruit during the marriage. </p>

But that level represents a very high level of success that is to a large degree based on his talents and hard work.  If his income drops the disparity will be less and this would in my view be a factor in favour of an award which by its result provides less for the wife. </p>

It seems to me that that would protect him against falls in his income as a partner of Deloitte.  The award leaves out of account other income that he may have but to cover the risk that the husband does not continue to work full time as a partner the order is to provide that if that occurs the periodical payments are to be either (a) calculated from the total of his actual net income in the relevant year or from such other sum as the court may fix, or (b) at a rate fixed by the court. </p>
