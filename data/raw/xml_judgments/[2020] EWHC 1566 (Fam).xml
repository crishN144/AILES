	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">The court is concerned with three of the parties&#8217; children, E, a boy aged 9, F, a boy aged 12, and G, a girl aged 14. The mother issued an application on 17 December 2019 for the summary return of the three children from Wales, where they live with the Respondent father, to the Republic of Ireland. The father opposes the application. The parties have a fourth child, H, a boy aged 6, who lives with the mother in Ireland.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">In early November 2018 the mother and four children found themselves homeless, living in a bus in County X, Ireland. The mother asked the father to take over the care of the children on a temporary basis until she found accommodation. The father brought all four children to his home in Wales. The mother&#8217;s application states that &#8220;o<span style="font-style:italic">n 19th December 2018 the mother travelled to England to collect the children but the father refused to return them to her care</span>.&#8221; That is disputed. On 3 January 2019 the mother wrote an email to the father seeking his agreement to return the children. He did not do so. In March 2019 the mother turned up at the school attended by the youngest three children, put H in her car, and returned with him to Ireland. There is then no evidence of communication between the mother and father from 3 January 2019 until the mother made her application over 11 </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">I have been provided with a bundle of documents including with three witness statements from the mother and one from her solicitor, Lucy Cohen. The father has made two statements. Ms Toni Jolly, Family Court Adviser from Cafcass, has provided a report following discussions with the three children at court on 30 January 2020. She gave oral evidence about that report and about further discussions she had with the children on 26 May, the day before the hearing. She also provided me with an email that G asked I should see, dated 26 May 2020 and headed, &#8220;Things I wanted to say&#8221;. I have been provided with records of social services&#8217; involvement with the family. Other than the email of 3 January 2019, the bundle contains no written communications between the parties. Page references in this judgment refer to the section and page number within the bundle. There are inconsistencies and gaps in the evidence about the children&#8217;s whereabouts and circumstances in early 2018. However, these are summary proceedings, there was no submission that I should hear oral evidence from the parties, and I must make determinations on the evidence available. I am very grateful to Counsel, Mr Hepher and Mr Gration, for their helpful submissions.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">In January 2018, the mother moved the children away from Holyhead. They lived in a campervan, arriving in the Republic of Ireland probably in or about March 2018. I do not know where they were in the early months of 2018 but probably in Scotland for at least part of that time. The Social Services records reveal at [E70] that when the children were reported missing, vehicle registration number checks led the police to conclude on 16 May 2018 that the mother&#8217;s campervan was in Scotland. The mother contends that she arrived in Ireland in January 2018 but on the face of her application, and in Ms Cohen&#8217;s statement, the date given is May 2018. Mr Gration accepts that the mother and children arrived in the Republic of Ireland in March 2018 and I am prepared to proceed on that basis. </p>

The email shows that the purpose of her attendance was to see the children before Christmas, not to return them to Ireland as she claims in her first statement noted above. It is now accepted that there was no meeting between the parties in December 2018. I can find no evidence that the mother was &#8220;top of the housing list in Ireland&#8221;. The evidence suggests that at most the mother had the opportunity to move into a 3 bedroom house in the spring or summer of 2019, but not that she had one available for her and the children in December 2019. Paragraph 19 of the mother&#8217;s first statement, dealing with the date on which she claims the father was guilty of wrongful retention, is at odds with the other evidence before me.  </p>

It would be wrong to be over-analytical. Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that the mother and father made an agreement on or about 8 November 2018 which they intended to be the basis of arrangements for the children in the immediate future. The agreement was that the children would live with their father in Wales for a temporary period until the mother had secured suitable accommodation in which she and the children could live. There was no agreement as to the duration of this temporary arrangement. The mother hoped it would be for a period of only two weeks but there was not agreement to that effect. The agreement was reached in the context of the mother and children finding themselves homeless. The family had not been used to living in expensive or wellappointed housing, and so there was no agreement or expectation that any newly found accommodation should be of a good standard. However, both parties understood that accommodation found by the mother would only be &#8220;suitable&#8221; accommodation if it met some basic standards. It had to be fit for habitation by the four children and the mother, it had to be located so that the children could go to school, and it had to be stable and secure in the sense that there would be no substantial risk of the children having to move from the accommodation, or of them becoming homeless, within a short time after return. These were not express conditions, but I am satisfied that in the circumstances they were features of &#8220;suitable&#8221; accommodation that the parties mutually understood at the time.  The parties agreed that once the mother had secured accommodation meeting those minimum requirements the children would be returned.  </p>

It is clearly true that if the two parents agree that the child is to travel abroad for a period, or for that matter if the court of the home State permits such travel by order, the travelling parent first removes, and then retains the child abroad. It is equally true that both removal and retention are, at that stage, sanctioned and not wrongful.

He has agreed to the travel only on terms that the stay is to be temporary and the child will be returned as agreed. So long as the travelling parent honours the temporary nature of the stay abroad, he is not infringing the left-behind parent's rights of custody. But once he repudiates the agreement, and keeps the child without the intention to return, and denying the temporary nature of the stay, his retention is no longer on the terms agreed. It amounts to a claim to unilateral decision where the child shall live. It repudiates the rights of custody of the leftbehind parent, and becomes wrongful. </span></p>

It is enough to say that if there is a preemptive denial it would be inconsistent with the aim of the Abduction Convention to provide a swift, prompt and summary remedy designed to restore the status quo ante to insist that the left-behind parent wait until the aeroplane lands on the due date, without the child disembarking, before any complaint can be made about such infringement.</span>" </p>

The wrongful retention of a child in one place in the state of its habitual residence, instead of its being returned to another place within the same state, would not be a wrongful retention for the purposes of the Convention. The typical (but not necessarily the only) case of a child within category (2) is that of a child who is rightfully taken out of the state of its habitual residence to another contracting state for a specified period of staying access with its non-custodial parent, and wrongfully not returned to the state of its habitual residence at the expiry of that period.&#8221;</span></p>

For the purposes of the Convention, removal occurs when a child, which has previously been in the State of its habitual residence, is taken away across the frontier of that State; whereas retention occurs where a child, which has previously been for a limited time outside the State of its habitual residence, is not returned to that State on the expiry of such limited period. That being so, it seems to be that removal and retention are basically different concepts, so that it is impossible either for them to overlap each other or for either to follow upon the other.&#8221; </span></p>

It will usually be when the agreed end-date has passed and the child has not been returned. Counsel have not been able to refer me to any judgment in which the end date was fixed by reference to a condition such as suitable accommodation being acquired, and there is a dispute as to whether the condition has been met.

The premises were on a small island, YY, with a population of about 120, where she had resided for at most a few weeks. There was no secondary school on the island and any children at the primary school were taught in Irish not English. She was at that stage entirely reliant, as Mr Gration put it, on the kindness of strangers for her accommodation. There is no evidence of any security of tenure or occupation of the floor in the house. There is no evidence of how long the mother was in fact able to continue to occupy those premises after 3 January 2019. There is no evidence that the 3 bedroom house was completed and ready for her occupation by spring or summer 2019 or at all. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">I have given this matter very anxious consideration but am driven to conclude that the evidence does not establish that the mother had secured suitable accommodation by December 2018 or early January 2019. It can barely be said that the accommodation would have allowed the children to go to school &#8211; the younger children would have had access only to a school where teaching was in Irish, a language they did not have, and G would have had to live alone on the mainland for much of the week during term times. Nevertheless, the children would have had schools to attend. However there is insufficient evidence to establish that the accommodation was otherwise suitable. All the mother had secured was temporary permission, for an unknown duration, to use two rooms on a floor of V Farm. I have no evidence of her accommodation arrangements thereafter until her statement in April 2020 that she was living in accommodation provided by the Co-operative. There is insufficient evidence to show that the V Farm arrangement provided sufficient room for all four children and the mother, that it was in a suitable condition for them to live in together, or that it provided any kind of stability.  Even allowing for low expectations, given the standards of accommodation the children had been living in previously, this was not suitable accommodation as the parents had agreed would be required before return. </p>

Mr Hepher for the mother rightly submits that the arrangement between the parties was only ever intended to be temporary. The difficulty with that submission is that a temporary arrangement could last for several days, several weeks or several months. The mother could not have rightly alleged wrongful retention if she had continued to be homeless, however long that had lasted. She had to have secured suitable accommodation in order for the agreed period of care of the children in the UK to come to an end. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">The mother&#8217;s case that retention was wrongful from 19 December 2018 faces a further obstacle. As already noted, I am not persuaded that on or before that date the mother sought return of the children. There is no evidence that she informed the father verbally or in writing that she had secured accommodation and wanted the children to be returned. Accordingly, she had not sought to bring the agreed period of relocation of the children in the United Kingdom to an end. Even if she had done so, I have found that she had not secured suitable accommodation and so could not unilaterally resile from the agreement. I am not satisfied that there was wrongful retention on 19 December 2018. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0in">On receipt of the email of 3 January 2019 it must have been evident to the father that the mother had obtained some accommodation and was seeking the return of the children. She clearly considered that the temporary arrangement had come to an end and wanted to arrange for the children to return to her care in Ireland. However, as I have already concluded, there is insufficient evidence before me that the accommodation at V Farm was &#8220;suitable&#8221; accommodation. Accordingly, I find that the condition that the parties had agreed would trigger the children&#8217;s return had not been met by 3 January 2019. The information in the email certainly did not demonstrate that the accommodation was suitable. I have not been provided with any response from the father but he says at [C28, para.12] that he has not returned the children because the mother has not found a suitable property in which to look after them. On my findings, as at 3 January 2019, the father was entitled to take that position and was not pre-empting the custody rights of the mother by doing so. His retention of the children at that time was not wrongful. </p>

Accordingly, the mother has provided the Court with no evidence on which to make a finding that she had found suitable accommodation after 3 January 2019. I am unable to find that the mother had secured suitable accommodation prior to 17 December 2019 when she made this application. I am not satisfied that the father was guilty of wrongful retention of the children at any point prior to the application being made. The Convention and Regulations do not bite, and cannot assist the mother in her application for summary return. </p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.  </span></p>

In contrast, their life in Ireland was peripatetic and unstable. From arrival in or about March 2018 until August 2018, and again from 25 October to 9 November 2018, they were perpetually on the move and the children were not in school. Their life became frankly chaotic by the end of October 2018. There is no evidence of them becoming integrated in any wider family or social life in Ireland during those periods. The children did enjoy a period of relative calm from about the beginning of August 2018 to 25 October 2018 when living in Mick&#8217;s cottage. In early September they attended schools. Nevertheless, their school attendance lasted for only six weeks and a few days. Mick&#8217;s cottage was only ever a temporary arrangement, and when Mick evicted the mother and children they moved on again and the children had to leave their schools.  </p>

Although the parents had expected the return to Wales to be temporary, there was no agreed timescale and by 19 December 2018 the children were not expecting any imminent changes. They had a stable home with their father. By the end of 2018, as I have found, the mother had not even asked the father to return the children, so the children had certainly not been prepared for a return to Ireland. Powys Social Services had become involved and were encouraging the father to register the children with local doctors and to enrol them in school. The Social Services records show that G was looking forward to returning to school and seeing friends, and was also making plans for her bedroom at her father&#8217;s house. The children had no face to face, and only sporadic telephone contact with their mother during this period </p>

The mother did not seek the return of the children until her email of 3 January 2019. From that point it is clear to me that she did not acquiesce in their retention. Rather, since she probably did not have suitable accommodation, she was seeking unilaterally to resile from the agreement reached. </p>

No evidence has been produced that would allow me to find that that the father had pre-emptively decided to repudiate the mother&#8217;s rights and to refuse to return the children irrespective of the suitability accommodation she had secured. The mother&#8217;s email of 3 January 2019 purports to quote a text from the father, which I have not seen, in which he says that the mother cannot have the children returned until &#8220;you have got on your feet&#8221; [C24]. This is not an assertion that the children are to be retained permanently.

Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.&#8221; </span></p>

Until a few days before the final hearing, the mother&#8217;s case was that the children should return to Ireland to live on YY. Arrangements had been made, she said, for G to attend the secondary school she had previously attended which is on the mainland, and to lodge with a family there. The same arrangements would have applied to F were he to attend the same school. E would attend the Irish speaking primary school on the island. The mother then changed the plan. She filed and served a third statement dated 21 May 2020 saying that she had rented a three bedroom flat on the mainland, paying a deposit and two months&#8217; rent. She exhibited a rental agreement which she said was signed. The copy exhibited is not signed by her and is dated &#8220;April 2020&#8221;. Its terms indicate that the total cost of a deposit and two months&#8217; rent would be EUR 2,850. She says that future rent would be covered by benefits. The mother has exhibited evidence that she has taken steps to enrol the children in schools on the mainland. However, the mother&#8217;s address remains on YY, indicating that although she says she has paid a deposit and two months&#8217; rent in advance, she has not moved into the rental property on the mainland. Under the heading &#8220;income&#8221; the mother says that on moving to the mainland she will try to obtain work. She does not say whether she still works for the Co-operative on YY. In any event she would be not be able to continue that work were she to move to the mainland.  </p>

At [C36] the mother sets out undertakings she would be willing to give if return of the children were ordered. These envisage the possibility of LM returning with the children. LM has a house, and partner, in Wales and has no desire to live in Ireland. He is not a man of significant means. Caring of his children though he is, it is not a realistic expectation that he would travel to Ireland and stay there with or near to the children. The mother&#8217;s undertakings do not provide clarity as to where the father would live with the children, or how that would be funded. In any event the mother&#8217;s case, as stated clearly at the conclusion of her third statement [C57, para.13], is that the father should hand over the children to her.

Return to Ireland would not resolve the question of the longer term arrangements but it would cause the children to return to Ireland in very uncertain and precarious circumstances. In my judgement there would be a grave risk that return would place the children in an intolerable situation. It would place them into a situation which these children should not be expected to tolerate. &#8220;Intolerable&#8221; is a strong word, but it applies in this case where there would be a grave risk of the children being plunged into the same chaotic circumstances that prevailed in Ireland in 2018. The undertakings offered would not provide any real protection for the children. In reality, on return to Ireland the children would not have any security. Given the mother&#8217;s previous fortunes, bare statements that she will occupy a suitable rented property or that she intends to acquire work, provide no real reassurance. The rental agreement is unsigned. There is no evidence of the payment of monies to the landlord. The fact that the proposed arrangements upon the children&#8217;s return, having been settled in the mother&#8217;s mind for well over a year after the issue of the application, have so recently and significantly changed, adds to the concern about how realistic, stable and secure they are. Given past events, it would be intolerable for these children to be placed back into the care of the mother in Ireland amidst such lack of stability and security.  </p>
