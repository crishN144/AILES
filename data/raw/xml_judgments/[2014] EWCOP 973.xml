	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2013, I handed down a judgment in these proceedings in the Court of Protection explaining my reasons for declaring that TZ, a 24-year-old man with mild learning disabilities, atypical autism and hyperactivity disorder, who lacks the capacity to litigate, has the capacity to consent to and engage in sexual relations. That judgment is reported under neutral citation number <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/2322" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 2322" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2322 (COP)</ref>. At that hearing, I adjourned two further issues, namely whether he has the capacity (1) to make decisions as to his contact with other people, and (2) to make decisions as to his care needs. After further assessments, those issues, and others consequential issues, were listed for a further hearing in early December 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that point, it was generally known that the question of capacity to consent to sexual relations had been considered by the Court of Appeal in a case in which judgment had been reserved. I therefore decided, with the agreement of the parties&#8217; representatives, to adjourn the hearing until after the Court of Appeal judgment was available, and to permit the parties to file addendum written submissions as to the impact of that decision on this case. I was concerned that, if the Court of Appeal took a different view as to the legal test for capacity to consent to sexual relations from that adopted in my earlier judgment, it might be necessary to revisit the issues considered in both hearings. In the event, the Court of Appeal judgment, reported as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">IM v LM and others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/37" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 37</ref>, upheld the interpretation of the law concerning capacity to consent to sexual relations that I (following other judges at first instance) had adopted in these proceedings. As a result, the supplemental submissions delivered by the parties were brief. However, due to pressure of other cases, there has been a further delay in the delivery of this judgment, for which I apologise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After being removed from his birth mother at the age of two, TZ was adopted, together with his brother. In his teenage years, there were various reports of inappropriate sexual behaviour between TZ and his brother. In his early twenties, he became involved in a relationship with another man, hereafter referred to as A, by whom he was significantly ill-treated. In 2011, the local authority filed an application in the Court of Protection seeking declarations as to his capacity and orders as to his welfare.  TZ was placed in a residential unit, hereafter referred to as H Home, run by an organisation specialising in offering supportive accommodation for people with a learning disability. TZ has continued to live at H Home since that date and is by all accounts very happy and settled there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2011, Her Honour Judge Susan Darwall-Smith ordered that it was lawful and TZ&#8217;s best interests to live at H Home until further order, and further that it was lawful and in his best interests for his contact with A to be restricted. Other orders were made, including a direction giving permission for the parties to instruct an expert psychiatrist, Dr X, to advise as to TZ&#8217;s capacity. In a series of reports, Dr X concluded that TZ lacked capacity to litigate in these proceedings, make decisions regarding his residence and care, make decisions as to his contact with other people, or to consent to sexual relations, whether heterosexual or homosexual. The proceedings were subsequently listed before me to determine, in particular, the issue of capacity to consent to sexual relations. Further interim orders and declarations were made pending the hearing. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That hearing took place in July 2013. At the outset, I concluded that, as TZ was currently content to continue to live at H Home, no decision as to residence was required so it was unnecessary to make any determination of his capacity to make decisions as to his residence. I proceeded to hear evidence from professional witnesses, including Dr X, and I also had the benefit of meeting TZ and speaking to him about the issues. In that conversation, summarised at paragraphs 45 to 49 of my earlier judgment, he confirmed to me that he had come out as gay about a year ago, having previously been uncertain as to his sexuality. As already stated, at the conclusion of the hearing I found and declared that TZ has the capacity to consent to and engage in sexual relations. I then gave directions for the preparation of supplemental assessments as to TZ&#8217;s capacity to make decisions as to contact with others and as to his care needs, and for a further hearing when those reports were available.</p>

Dr. X also prepared a further report, dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013. Those documents were before me at the adjourned hearing in December, together with a number of other documents, including progress reports from H Home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event, the hearing in December took a slightly different course from that anticipated in July because of a refinement of the issues as identified by the parties. The principal focus of the latest assessments has been the issues that may arise as TZ endeavours to meet, and form intimate relations with, other men. TZ is clear that he wishes to have the opportunity to have these experiences, and all professionals involved in supporting him agree that he should be given that opportunity. The question is whether he had the capacity in respect of decisions that may have to be made when that opportunity arises.</p>

Some decisions, for example agreeing to marry or consenting to divorce, are status or act specific. Some other decision, for example whether P should have contact with a particular individual, may be person specific. But all decisions, whatever their nature, fall to be evaluated within the straightforward and clear structure of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1</ref> to 3, which requires the court to have regard to &#8220;a matter&#8221; requiring &#8220;a decision&#8221;. There is neither need nor justification for the plain words of the statute to be embellished. I do not agree with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission that absurd consequences flow from a failure to adopt either an act-specific or a person-specific approach to each category of decision that may fall for the consideration. To the contrary, I endorse [the local authority counsel]&#8217;s argument to the effect that removing the specific factual context from some decisions leaves nothing for the evaluation of capacity to bite upon.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the local authority, Mr Dooley argued initially that the relevant decision in this case was whether TZ had the capacity to make decisions regarding contact with others, either generally or with one or more named individuals. The difficulty with this formulation is that it does not focus on what McFarlane LJ described as the &#8220;specific factual context&#8221; arising at this stage, namely the prospect of future contact of a personal and intimate nature between TZ and an individual or individuals as yet unidentified. It is not asserted that TZ lacks capacity generally to make decisions as to contact. Equally, there are at present no named individuals who can be identified with whom he may have contact of a personal intimate nature. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result, in closing submissions, Mr Dooley reformulated his argument so as to contend that the relevant decision arising at this stage is the decision concerning risk around contact. Mr. Dooley submitted that TZ lacked the capacity to assess risk to himself from contact with others. Developing this argument in oral submissions Mr Dooley pointed out that a &#8220;decision&#8221; is defined as &#8220;a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration&#8221;. He submitted that risk is the live issue in this case, given the current situation in which the court has determined that TZ has capacity to consent to sexual relations and that TZ now wishes to have contact with other men which may include intimate sexual relations. Mr Dooley submitted that the key question in this context was whether TZ lacked capacity to assess risks to himself from such contact. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reply, Mr McKendrick on behalf of the Official Solicitor characterised the relevant decision arising at this stage in a different way. He submitted that the key question was whether TZ could decide what support he requires when meeting unfamiliar adults. Like Mr. Dooley, he rejected the suggestion that the relevant decision could be characterized simply as a decision about contact in general or with any specific individuals. He submitted that the better analysis is that the relevant decision at this stage was whether TZ can make a decision about whether or not to receive care and support when meeting unfamiliar adults. Mr McKendrick argued that assessment of risk is not, as Mr Dooley contends, the decision in question but rather part of the information relevant to making the decision.</p>

On the one hand, I do not agree with Mr. McKendrick and the Official Solicitor that the relevant decision can be characterised merely as whether TZ can decide what support he requires when meeting unfamiliar adults. The question of support required when meeting unfamiliar adults only arises if he lacks capacity in making decisions when meeting unfamiliar adults.</p>

I agree with Mr McKendrick that the assessment of risk is not the decision but rather part of the information relevant to making the decision This is indeed expressly set out in s. 3(4) of the MCA which provides that information relevant to a decision includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of (a) deciding one way or another, or (b) failing to make the decision. It seemed to me that Mr Dooley in fact acknowledged this point himself in the course of his oral submissions when he observed that the decision must include consideration of the benefits and disbenefits arising from that decision. Thus the analysis of risk is part of the decision-making process, not the decision itself. </p>

That is the &#8220;specific factual context&#8221; in this case. Thus the relevant decision is not the decision whether to have contact with people generally. That is too broad. It is not a decision whether to have contact with a named individual. Since no individual has been named, that is too narrow. The primary relevant decision is whether or not an individual with whom TZ may wish to have sexual relations is safe. The secondary relevant decision is whether, in those circumstances, he then has the capacity to make a decision as to the support he requires.</p>

Thus the test for lacking capacity involves two stages. The first stage, often called the &#8220;diagnostic test&#8221;, is whether the person has such an impairment or disturbance. The second stage, often known as the &#8220;functional test&#8221;, is whether the impairment or disturbance renders the person unable to make the decision.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, in assessing the question of capacity, the court must consider all the relevant evidence.  Clearly, the opinion of an independently-instructed expert will be likely to be of very considerable importance, but in addition the court in these cases will invariably have evidence from other professionals who have experience of treating and working with P, the subject of the proceedings, and sometimes from friends and family and indeed from P himself.. <span style="font-family:Arial">As Charles J observed (in the analogous context of care proceedings) in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial">A County Council v KD and L </span><span style="font-family:Arial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> at paras 39 and 44, &#8220;it is important to remember (i) that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and (ii) it is the court that is in the position to weigh the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence&#8230; the judge must always remember that he or she is the person who makes the final decision&#8221;.

The principal evidence on which I must decide whether TZ has these capacities is set out in the reports and oral evidence of JS, who is TZ&#8217;s allocated social worker and Dr X, the consultant psychiatrist who has carried out assessments of TZ&#8217;s capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">JS sets out the results of her assessments in two reports, one addressing TZ&#8217;s capacity regarding his contact with other people and, separately, regarding his care and support. So far as contact capacity was concerned, JS found that TZ had the ability to understand and retain information relating to the decision to be made, but that he did not have the ability to use or access that information whilst considering the decision. He told JS repeatedly that he wanted to find a partner and was not good at knowing whether they were okay or not. JS observed that he appeared to have strong perceptions that other males show an interest in him when this may not in fact be the case. She observed that there also appeared to be some variability in his consistency at taking in, remembering and interpreting information. His process of taking in information about how a person presents, what they say, how they are with him, is coloured by his learning disability, impulsivity and autistic features. JS concluded that; &#8220;based on these issues, I believe [TZ] is unable to weigh up the pros and cons of anyone he comes into contact with. He is unable to recognise anyone who might cause him harm. Being able to risk assess another person&#8217;s integrity is an abstract concept which TZ is unable to do.&#8221;</p>

She found that he was able to relate the need for support to keep himself safe regarding his contact with others. He acknowledged he was not good about knowing who is okay and who is not okay. However he understands in general terms what the support is for and that he needs it for good relationships to keep himself safe. He said that he was happy to accept support with practical tasks and relationships. </p>

She thought, however, that his capacity in this respect was variable. A lot depends on how he is feeling at the time and his frame of mind. She thought that TZ tended to rely on his support worker when making decisions about safety. </p>

He observed that TZ is socially na&#239;ve and has concrete thinking both as a result of his autism and his learning disabilities. In addition, he lacks the ability to interpret subtle details in a person&#8217;s communications, either verbal or non-verbal. Dr X gave an example of TZ telling him that, in order to tell whether a person is &#8220;nice or nasty&#8221;, he would ask the person concerned. He concluded that TZ lacked the capacity to make decisions about his contact with others, because he is unable to understand the relevant information. He thought that there was the potential for an education and training programme and care plan, over a period of years, to assist him in gaining these capacities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr X was further asked to consider whether TZ has capacity to make decisions about how to manage risks to himself from contact with others including, inter alia, by seeking guidance and support from his carers. Dr X observed that, as the ability to assess risk is a prerequisite to managing risk, it was his opinion that TZ&#8217;s main difficulty in managing risk to himself from contact with others arises from his difficulty in assessing risk as described above. He noted that TZ&#8217;s history demonstrated that he has been compliant with the regime of support in the community. He added, however, that this had been whilst a member of staff was escorting him. Given his impulsivity and intellectual impairment, he thought he would be unlikely to seek such help if a member of staff is not immediately available. Cross-examined in oral evidence by Mr McKendrick, Dr X said that he did not think that the fact that TZ is currently complying with support means that he understands the need for that support. The fact that he says that he knows he is no good at knowing who is or is not safe does not mean that he would always accept the need for support. In addition, Dr X thought it quite likely that in due course TZ would ask the support worker to leave. In his view, TZ lacks the capacity to decide what support he requires.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find on a balance of probabilities that TZ does not have the capacity to decide whether a person with whom he may wish to have sexual relations is safe. I base that finding on the detailed assessments of TZ carried out by JS and Dr X, both of whom have had an opportunity to assess him over a period of time. These assessments include extensive conversations with TZ in which he has himself acknowledged that he lacks this capacity. In particular, while he has the ability to understand and retain information, he lacks the ability to use or weigh up the information, including the ability to assess risk and, in the language of s. 3(4), to understand the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the decision. This is, in my judgment, a good example of the distinction identified in paragraph 4.30 of the Code of Practice between, on the one hand, unwise decisions, which a person has the right to make, and, on the other hand, decisions based on a lack of understanding of risks and the inability to weigh up the information concerning a decision. </p>

In oral evidence, however, JS qualified this opinion, saying that TZ can understand why he needs support &#8220;if he is in the right frame of mind&#8221;, and that his capacity in this respect is variable. She said that sometimes he is more open about taking things on board than at other times. Dr X concluded that TZ lacked this capacity.

In that case (decided under the inherent jurisdiction), the Court was concerned with the approach to be adopted in a case of a person who had capacity to consent to sexual relations but lacked the capacity to make decisions about contact with a long-term partner. In such circumstances, Munby J held that &#8220;the court &#8230; is entitled to intervene to protect a vulnerable adult from the risk of future harm &#8211; the risk of future abuse or future exploitation &#8211; so long as there is a real possibility, rather than a merely fanciful risk, of such harm.

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be brought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">happiness</span>.

Neither party is advocating for the first option. Both parties agree that the court should direct the local authority to file a care plan.

This provides, for example, that, prior to going out, the support worker will remind TZ of appropriate behaviour which would include: not staring at people; not using exaggerated body language and posture to try to attract the attention of a man he might &#8216;fancy&#8217;; not to make comments about sex and sexuality that can be easily heard or are directed at certain men. Support workers need to remind TZ of these points whenever required. The plan should provide, as set out in the draft plan, that the aim of the support should be to assess and step back when they feel that TZ is managing himself appropriately and is safe. In this way, the support will become gradually more &#8216;light touch&#8217;.

If the outcome is that he has capacity, the sexual relationship should be facilitated, unless it is concluded that there is a significant risk of harm. If the assessment concludes that he lacks that capacity, or that there is a likelihood that he will suffer significant harm as a result of a relationship, a further application will have to be made to the court. If the court accepts that he lacks capacity, a best interests decision will then be made. If the court concludes that he has capacity, but that he is at risk of harm, it may be that the court would resort to protective powers under its inherent jurisdiction as to vulnerable adults. At all stages, of course, TZ must be assisted to participate in the decision-making process. </p>

The vast majority of decisions are taken by those individuals involved in the care, treatment and support of P, either individually, or collaboratively, without application to the court and without any individual or group of individuals being given any special status such as deputy. More serious decisions may be referred to the court which, under s. 16, may either make the decision itself or appoint a deputy to do so. The terms of section 16(4) are clear. A decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy to make the decision and the powers conferred on a deputy should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In certain cases, as explained in paragraphs 8.38 and 8.39 of the Code, it will be more appropriate to appoint a deputy. But because it is important that such decisions should wherever possible be taken collaboratively and informally, such appointments must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the local authority, Mr Dooley submitted that the purpose of the appointment of a personal welfare deputy would be to authorise those elements in the plan that may need to be exercised to safeguard TZ in the event that the reduced levels of support and supervision of his contact with others may lead him to situations of risk. In cases where the risk arises from contact with named individuals, so that s. 20 precluded any powers to prevent contact being exercised by a deputy, it would be necessary to make an application to the court for an injunctive order, but in cases where the concerns arose because of unnamed individuals, such an application might not be possible. The local authority sees the appointment of a deputy as in keeping with the greater flexibility required in these circumstances, and also as part of the support being offered to TZ to provide greater independence of living and the means to acquire through experience the skills that will address the deficits in his functional capacity to make decisions about risk in his contact with others.</p>

The Code clearly provides that deputies for personal welfare decisions will only be required in the most difficult cases (paragraph 8.38) and that, for most day to day actions or decisions, the decision-maker should be the carer most directly involved with the person at the time (paragraph 5.8). That is simply a matter of common-sense. If a situation arises in which TZ is perceived to be at risk, a decision needs to be taken by the person on the ground who is giving him support. It would be impractical to refer the decision to anyone else, either the Court or a deputy. Any decision that has to be taken arising out of an immediate risk of harm should be taken, so far as possible, collaboratively and informally by TZ&#8217;s care worker. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question arises as to the course to be followed if the support worker is unable to extract TZ from a situation where he is at immediate risk of harm. The MCA does permit a deputy to restrain P if certain conditions are satisfied: see s.20 (8) to (11). Parliament has expressly provided, however, that a deputy cannot make a decision preventing contact between an incapacitated adult and a named individual. By the time action is needed to remove TZ from a situation where there is a risk of harm, the individual or individuals who are the source of the risk will in all probability be identified or identifiable, so a deputy would be unable lawfully to prevent that contact with or without using restraint. If the situation cannot be resolved by the support worker, consideration must then be given to applying to the court for injunctive relief. In an emergency, the police should be called. To my mind, the appointment of a deputy to be given the power to make decisions for the removal of TZ from such situations, enforceable by acts of restraint under s.20, would be inconsistent with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and Code.</p>
