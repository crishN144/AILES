One of the orders that I made on that occasion was that the allegation should be set out in form N601 and served on the mother.  </span></p>

Within the bundle prepared for this hearing, there is a statement of service at page E60 in which it is recorded that a process&#160;server served documents personally on the mother on 30 September 2023.  Attached to that statement of service were the two documents that I have referred to but in English.  The mother has confirmed to me today that at the same time she received the Hungarian translations of those two documents which are also set out in the bundle starting at page E27.</span></p>

The other parties before the Court are the father, Mr Raza, assisted by a McKenzie friend, and a Guardian appointed on behalf of the child with whom I am concerned in the substantive proceedings; that is Ms Philips who is represented today by counsel, Ms Ferguson.  </span></p>

At the outset of the hearing, I confirmed that nobody had applied for the hearing to take place in private.  I explained to Ms Gall that she has a right to free legal representation.  Indeed, I had explained that to her at the previous hearing.  She told me that she had not been able to secure such representation and I invited her to consider whether, in the circumstances, she wanted to apply for an adjournment.  She told me through the interpreter that she wished to proceed today.  I also explained to Ms Gall at the outset of the hearing that she may, if she wished, give oral evidence.  She indicated she did not wish to do so.  I confirmed with her that I had made a previous order on 13 September, inviting her to file at court a witness statement in response to the application. Again, I explained to her she did not have to do that if she did not wish to do so.  I ascertained that she had not done so and did not intend to do so.  Accordingly, the evidence before the Court for this hearing is limited to a witness statement prepared by the child&#8217;s Guardian which is in the bundle at page C1, a statement of Ms Philips originally dated 7 September 2023 and re-dated with the correct statement of truth, 15 September 2023.  The mother confirmed that she had a copy of the bundle which includes that statement.  </span></p>

The father says, and I do not understand this to be in dispute, there has been no contact between him and the child since August 2022.  </span></p>

Accordingly, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that she is in breach of the order which I made on 21 July which required her to attend such a meeting, that order having a penal notice attached and personal service having been dispensed with because of her presence in court with an interpreter who explained the order to her in her first language.

Family cases, it has long been recognised, raise different considerations from those elsewhere in the civil law. The two most obvious are the heightened emotional tensions that arise between family members and often the need for those family members to continue to be in contact with one another because they have children together or the like. Those two factors make the task of the court, in dealing with these issues, quite different from the task when dealing with commercial disputes or other types of case in which sometimes, in fact rarely, sanctions have to be imposed for contempt of court.

That is the only procedure which is available. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court is directing its mind to whether or not committal to prison is the appropriate order. But it does not follow from that that imprisonment is to be regarded as the automatic consequence of the breach of an order. Clearly it is not. There is, however, no principle that imprisonment is not to be imposed at the first occasion: see Thorpe v. Thorpe <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 F.L.R. 127" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 F.L.R. 127</ref>, a decision of this court.

The full range of sentencing options is not available for contempt of court. Nevertheless, there is a range of things that the court can consider. It may do nothing&#8212;make no order. It may adjourn, and in a case where the alleged contemnor has not attended court that may be an appropriate course to take, although I would not say so in every case; it depends on the reasons that may be thought to lie behind the non-attendance. There is a power to fine. There is a power of sequestration of assets and there are mental health orders. All of those may, in an appropriate case, need consideration, particularly in a case where the court has not found any actual violence proved. </span></p>

In particular, where the contemnor is the sole or principal carer of children or vulnerable adults, the Court must ensure it is fully informed as to the consequences for those persons of the imprisonment of their carer.  In a borderline case, such considerations may enable the court to avoid making an order for committal which would otherwise be made.  In a case in which nothing less than an order for committal can be justified, the impact on others may provide a compelling reason to suspend its operation&#8221;.</span></p>

In this regard, both principle and the case law to which we were referred lead to the conclusion that in the case of an expert witness, the appropriate term will usually have to be served immediately, and that one or more powerful factors justifying suspension will have to be shown if the term is to be suspended.  We do not think that the Court is necessarily precluded from taking into account, at this stage of the process, factors which have already been considered when deciding the appropriate length of the term of committal.  Usually, however, the Court in deciding the length of the term will already have given full weight to the mitigation, with the result that there is no powerful factor making it appropriate to suspend the term.  If the immediate imprisonment of the contemnor will have a serious adverse effect on others, for example, where the contemnor is the sole or principal carer of children or of vulnerable adults, that may make it appropriate for the term to be suspended; but even then, as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Bashir</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] ACD 69" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] ACD 69</ref> shows, an immediate term, greatly shortened to reflect the personal mitigation, may well be necessary&#8221;.</span></p>

It is not a minor procedural breach.  It is more serious than a failure to attend court when directed to do so or a failure to file evidence.  It is fundamental to the whole nature of this application which is to determine arrangements for this child because the non-compliance with an order to attend at the contact centre for a meeting to arrange interim contact effectively renders the whole purpose of these proceedings pointless.  That seriousness must be marked and in my judgment the only appropriate order is a term of imprisonment.</span></p>

Nevertheless, a term of imprisonment, the absence of the mother from the child&#8217;s life for a period of time is likely to have some emotional effect on the child.  In the absence of any real mitigation, I am not satisfied that a term of imprisonment of 14 days sufficiently reflects the seriousness of the breach and the mother&#8217;s lack of contrition, me having found the breach.  I consider that a proportionate period of imprisonment is 28 days.  </span></p>

I am minded, in the circumstances, to suspend the order of 28 days&#8217; imprisonment but only if the mother attends a meeting at the Wycombe Child Contact Centre on that day between those times.  I reflect that the purpose of the order I make is not to punish the mother but to ensure her compliance with the order that I have previously made.
