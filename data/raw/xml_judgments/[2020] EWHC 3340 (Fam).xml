	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The applicant is the father and the respondent the mother of M, an eight year old boy. His parents were both born in Poland and are Polish nationals. They formed a relationship there in 2011 but the relationship lasted only for three months and ended before M was born. The Polish courts determined that M should live with his mother and limited the father&#8217;s parental authority so that he had a right to share in the making of important decisions about M. In 2015 the Polish courts ordered contact with the father to include alternate weekends and holiday contact. The mother brought M with her to England in July 2018 and, other than a short visit to Poland after Christmas that year, and a period in that country from April to May 2019 which is described more fully below, M has lived in England for nearly two and a half years.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The father applies for a return order under the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention. His application has reached me having been heard in the High Court once before and after having been remitted by the Court of Appeal. The parties are now each represented by leading and junior counsel. The e-bundle for the hearing stretches to 819 pages and further evidence was submitted during the hearing. Page references in this judgment appear in square brackets. I allowed oral evidence from the parents restricted to the issue of retention but due to a combination of factors, including the use of interpreters, occasional technical problems with the remote hearing, and the manner in which some questions were answered, the oral evidence was more protracted than had been envisaged. To ensure that the hearing concluded within a reasonable time I heard oral submissions restricted to one hour for each party but permitted supplementary written submissions which I have gratefully received. </p>

The evidence has resulted in submissions directed to removal, retention and repudiatory retention, habitual residence, settlement, consent, acquiescence, child&#8217;s objections, grave risk of harm or intolerability, and discretion. More specifically the issues for me to determine are: </p>

The mother says that they arrived on 6 July 2018 and stayed in the South West of England with R, who is now her husband, in his two-bedroom rented flat. R has two sons of similar age to M. He is separated from their mother but they stay with him for two days a week in term times and for half of their school holidays. The arrangements were the same in 2018. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In late August 2018, the mother informed the father that she wanted to remain in England for a few months to do further work on a business she was setting up.  The father was working and living in Germany at that time. He was not in Poland. There is a chain of messages at [C34-42] partly repeated at [C445], which begins with a message apparently dated 29 August 2018 from the mother to the father, in which she says: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">just got a great contract and it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll have to stay for a few months to get everything done </span>&#8230;&#8221; [C34]. In response to the father&#8217;s concern about M&#8217;s nursery attendance which had been planned to begin in Poland, the mother said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">He&#8217;ll have to go to school here and there we&#8217;ll book a space for him&#8221;.</span> At [C42] there is an interchange, the father messaging the mother, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the thing is, if M is supposed to be in England, then we have to change dates of winter breaks, holidays and Christmases for longer ones</span>&#8221;. The mother&#8217;s message in response was, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">But he&#8217;s not staying permanently in England &#8211; I said that if I manage to get going, I will have to stay a while, and then regardless I&#8217;m coming back &#8211; I want to live in Poland, not here&#8230;.&#8221;</span>.  </p>

He did not seem to oppose it.&#8221;</span> I shall evaluate the evidence later in this judgment but plainly her statement that the father understood that she had decided to stay here permanently is at odds with her message to the father at the time that she and M were not staying permanently.   </p>

At para. 11 of his first statement at [C72] he says, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I made it clear to </span>[the mother]<span style="font-style:italic"> that I was not happy for M to stay in England but provided that M was returned to and living in Poland by the end of 2018 I told </span>[her] <span style="font-style:italic">that if she had to stay in England temporarily then she had to stay. &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The mother enrolled M in a local school which R&#8217;s sons also attended. She informed the father of this plan and he texted her at the end of September 2018 to ask when M was starting school. He told me that he had checked the location of the school on the internet. M started school in England on 15 October 2018.  As well as R&#8217;s sons, M also knew two other young friends who were pupils at the school. The mother says that he quickly settled in and made a good network of friends, attending playdates and birthday parties. I have seen evidence to show that the mother registered M with a GP, she applied for a national insurance number for herself and in August she was named as an occupier of the flat for the purposes of council tax. Nevertheless the mother says, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Even though I had decided to stay in</span> [England] <span style="font-style:italic">permanently, knowing how hard it is to secure a place in M&#8217;s usual nursery in Poland, I told</span> [my daughter] <span style="font-style:italic">on 1</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span><span style="font-style:italic"> September 2018, the day she left to finish her study in Poland, to</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">keep paying for the nursery just in case</span>&#8221;-  para. 29 of her second statement at [C410].

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In the autumn of 2018, the father was working in Germany but visited England twice to see M.  He visited towards the end of October after Michael had started school and again in November 2018. The mother says that she became engaged to R on 10 November 2018 but in her detailed second statement she does not say that she told the father of the engagement. Under cross-examination she maintained that she told the father of her engagement on 1 January 2019 when both parties were in Poland. The father maintained that the first he knew of the engagement was in May 2019 when he saw a social media post by R. Even then he did not know the date of the engagement. A curious feature of this case is that although Mr Setright QC for the father makes the engagement a central plank of his case on retention, the father himself says that he does not believe that the mother and R became engaged on 10 November 2018. He says in his first statement, para. 43: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I now believe that</span> [the mother] <span style="font-style:italic">is lying about their engagement happening earlier on, in order to paint a picture of false stability in respect of her relationship with R in the hope that this will bolster her application to relocate.</span>&#8221; [C81] </p>

The father had just moved back to Poland after working in Germany. He had been in a relationship that had lasted several months but which had recently ended. M was due to be returned to his mother on 17 or 18 April, but the father did not return M, and instead applied to the Polish court on 17 April 2019 for an order that M should live with him. The  mother  travelled to Poland on 1 May to seek M&#8217;s return to her and she started Hague Convention proceedings in Poland, applying for M&#8217;s return to England and asserting that the father was retaining him away from his country of habitual residence, namely England.  She also cross-applied to the Polish court for a variation to the 2015 contact order seeking permission to relocate to England and to revoke the father&#8217;s parental authority.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The father has explained his reasons for not returning M to his mother&#8217;s care and allowing his return to England. His case is that he witnessed an incident involving domestic violence between the mother and R in their flat on the eve of his departure with M for Poland. As set out at para. 15 of his first statement, he says that he saw the mother kick R in the head and that later saw the mother lying on her bed with her wrists covered in blood. The father says that over the few days after they travelled to Poland in early April 2019, M revealed to him a history of domestic violence between R and the mother. M had a mobile device which the mother had previously used and which contained records of messaging between the mother and R that painted a picture of a troubled relationship and the mother&#8217;s unhappiness in England. Translations of those messages appear at [C96] and following pages. They appear to be from 25 October 2018. They include a colourful dismissal of life in England at [C106]. The mother explained to the court that she had severe back pain at the time and was complaining that she could not purchase strong analgesia over the counter as she could in Poland. The messages clearly record a row between the mother and R. It has not been suggested that this was the entirety of the messaging that remained on the mobile device. It is a snapshot. </p>

The transcript is exhibited to the father&#8217;s first statement. It must be treated with great caution because he was deliberately setting about obtaining evidence to confirm his view that M was not safe to return to live with R and the mother. The mother&#8217;s daughter confirmed to the father that R could be unpredictable in his behaviour and that she herself had had arguments with him. She gave the clear impression of not liking R and she thought that he drank too much. She said that her mother had at times talked about ending her life and she confirmed that the mother had packed her bags to leave on occasions after arguments with R. But she reassured the father that R was not a risk to M.  </p>

There is a transcript of a telephone conversation between the mother and father on 14 April 2019 at [C142] and following pages. The father made this recording &#8211; he knew that what he was saying was being recorded and could be used as evidence, the mother did not. Part way through the conversation the father tells the mother that M does not want to return to England. The mother tried to placate the father to persuade him that he should return M to her as agreed. A translated transcript of the conversation cannot relay tone of voice or use of irony. I have read the transcript but for all these reasons I treat the evidence with caution. The father expresses concern about the mother&#8217;s welfare &#8211; he has concerns about her relationship with R, how he treats her, and her own health. He suggests that she and M should &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">come to Germany</span>&#8221;. The mother seeks to reassure him that she is fine, and that M should return. She says at one point, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">just let me finish, let Michal finish this year &#8230; not much left.</span>&#8221; The mother reassures the father that the row he witnessed was due to R consuming too much alcohol, which he was not used to doing, that it was not an incident to cause him concern, and that it will not be repeated.  </p>

The father arranged for M to be seen by a psychologist in Poland and he exhibits a report dated 6 May 2019 which he relies upon to show that M wanted to live with him in Poland. He also arranged for M to go to school which he did for about one week. At [C571] there is a letter from the school saying that M quickly adapted to his new environment.

Likewise, when the mother told him that she wanted M to finish the school year in England, that is to stay until the summer, he felt he was being strung along but did not take any steps to raise a formal objection or to shorten the stay in England. It was his belief that M was experiencing a very troubled family life in England that caused him to retain care of M in Poland in April 2019.  </p>

He says that M remained habitually resident in Poland on 10 November 2018 and at all times until his visit to Poland in April 2019. Alternatively, if he was habitually resident in England at the beginning of April 2019 his habitual residence changed to Poland soon after arriving there that month. Either way, he was habitually resident in Poland on the mother&#8217;s removal of him on 30 May 2019. The father neither consented to M&#8217;s retention or removal, nor did he subsequently acquiesce. He did not know of the repudiation of his rights by reason of the engagement, until months after it had happened. The father also contends that the Article 13 defences of the child&#8217;s objections and risk of harm or intolerability are not made out.  </p>

This is commonly referred to as the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion. Likewise, if settlement under Article 12 is established then the court has a discretion not to order return. It is not the role of this court to determine the longer-term arrangements for this child. The nature of these proceedings does not allow me to conduct a detailed welfare assessment. However, welfare considerations may apply to the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion if that arises. The burden of proof in relation to wrongful retention and habitual residence is on the applicant father. The burden of proof on settlement and the Article 13(b) defences is on the respondent mother. The civil standard of proof, on the balance of probabilities, applies. </p>

Once it is accepted that retention is not a continuing state of affairs, but an event occurring on a specific occasion, it necessarily follows that removal and retention are mutually exclusive concepts. For the purposes of the Convention, removal occurs when a child, which has previously been in the State of its habitual residence, is taken away across the frontier of that State; whereas retention occurs where a child, which has previously been for a limited period of time outside the State of its habitual residence, is not returned to that State on the expiry of such limited period.&#8221;  </p>

Those rights of custody include the right to be party to any arrangement as to which country the child is to live in. It is not accurate to say that he gives up a right to veto the child&#8217;s movements abroad; he exercises that right by permitting such movement on terms. He has agreed to the travel only on terms that the stay is to be temporary and the child will be returned as agreed. So long as the travelling parent honours the temporary nature of the stay abroad, he is not infringing the left-behind parent&#8217;s rights of custody. But once he repudiates the agreement, and keeps the child without the intention to return, and denying the temporary nature of the stay, his retention is no longer on the terms agreed. It amounts to a claim to unilateral decision where the child shall live. It repudiates the rights of custody of the left-behind parent, and becomes wrongful. </p>

It is not, however, necessary in the present case to attempt to foresee such eventualities, or to consider whether fundamental failures to observe conditions as to the care or upbringing of the child might amount to such pre-emptive denial. It is enough to say that if there is a pre-emptive denial it would be inconsistent with the aim of the Abduction Convention to provide a swift, prompt and summary remedy designed to restore the status quo ante to insist that the leftbehind parent wait until the aeroplane lands on the due date, without the child disembarking, before any complaint can be made about such infringement. </p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a seesaw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.&#8221;.  </p>

This requires an analysis of the child's situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual. </p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court's analysis when deciding the critical question which is where is the child habitually resident and not, simply, when was a previous habitual residence lost.&#8221; </p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified.  It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.&#8221; </p>

The court does not simply assume, without more, the maximum level of risk contended for by the abducting parent.  Rather, the court examines the information available to it and, having considered that information, arrives at a reasoned and reasonable assumption as to the maximum level of risk having regard to the available evidence.   </p>

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.&#8221; </p>

It would be unwise of me to attempt to expand or improve upon the list in &#167;46 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> of the sort of factors that are relevant at that stage, although I would emphasise that I would not view that list as exhaustive because it is difficult to predict what will weigh in the balance in a particular case. The factors do not revolve only around the child's objections, as is apparent. The court has to have regard to other welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence that will be available as part of the summary proceedings. And importantly, it must give weight to the Hague Convention considerations. It must at all times be borne in mind that the Hague Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly. To reiterate what Baroness Hale said at &#167;42 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, "[t]he message must go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among contracting states". </p>

The exception is established if the judge concludes, simply, that the child objects to returning to the country of habitual residence. Mr Williams QC reminded us, rightly, that the Convention is applicable in a large number of countries and that &#8220;objects&#8221; has an autonomous meaning, but he did not advance a proposed definition in amplification or explanation of the words of the Convention itself. That was prudent, in my view. Whether a child objects is a question of fact, and the word &#8220;objects&#8221; is sufficient on its own to convey to a judge hearing a Hague Convention case what has to be established; further definition may be more likely to mislead or to generate debate than to assist.&#8221; </p>

She found him to be an engaging boy who spoke freely. He had been living with his mother and having little contact with his father for many months when Ms Doyle first saw him, and that remained the position when she spoke to him again more recently. Nevertheless, he appeared to her to be expressing his own, genuinely held wishes and feelings. He had a maturity that matched his age. She was clear that M is settled in the United Kingdom, sees himself as part of a family here with two step-siblings (as well as his much older half-sister who it appears spends some of her time here and some in Poland) and a second father. He is a proud member of his school, enjoys an after-school activity of fencing, and has a healthy network of friends. His school is happy with his progress and has praised the work he has done during the coronavirus lockdown period. His mother supports him and the school well. M&#8217;s clearly stated wish is to remain in England and not to return to Poland. He holds that view on the main ground that he does not want to leave his family and school here. He would be very sad were he have to return to Poland. In Ms Doyle&#8217;s opinion M is physically, psychologically, and emotionally settled in England. When asked about allegations of past domestic abuse by R against the mother, she said that she was aware of them but did not believe there were any safeguarding issues, no involvement of the local authority, and no complaints by the father to social services. Those allegations and consideration of the fact that face to face contact with the father has been non-existent for about 18 months now, did not lead her to question her conclusion that M is settled in this jurisdiction. </p>

In her oral evidence she said in terms that in her opinion return would not be intolerable for him. Primarily this was because his mother would go with him and she is very able to protect him. She too would be distressed to have to leave her life in England to return to Poland, but she has lived in Poland nearly all her life, she has family and friends there, she has experience of using the court system, and she is very capable of managing a return there in such a way as to protect M.   </p>

This led to failures to give straight answers to pertinent questions, and to inconsistency.

He was repeatedly asked about his knowledge of the mother and R having a romantic (as opposed to a platonic or business) relationship, and his awareness that the mother, R and M were living as a family unit. The father knew at the time that the mother had stayed with R on a visit to England in May 2018 and then lived with him at this flat continuously from arrival in England in July 2018. The mother disclosed further text messages from the father only on first morning of this hearing, but they show to my satisfaction that he referred to R as the mother&#8217;s &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; as early as 27 March 2018. On 27 May 2018 he wrote that M now had two little brothers, clearly referring to R&#8217;s sons. He accepted that on visiting England in October and November 2018, he spent time overnight at the two-bedroom flat occupied by the mother, R, and M. The father knew </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">that the mother, R, and M travelled together to and from Poland after Christmas 2018. He visited them again in their home in February and April 2019. It would have taken an extraordinary level of self-deception by him, or deception of him by the mother and R, for the father not to realise that R and mother were in a romantic relationship and living together with M as a family. An important part of his case is that he was deceived: that the first he knew of the engagement, if any, was in May 2019 and that even then he did not know that it had taken place in November 2018 until the mother said so in a statement in these proceedings in late 2019. And yet, at no point in his written evidence does the father say that he was astonished to find that the mother and R had become engaged, as surely he would have been had he not known they were in a relationship. When asked by Mr Devereux QC about his awareness of their relationship between March 2018 and May 2019 he repeatedly answered, &#8220;I do not recall&#8221;. That was obdurate evasion. There were many other examples throughout his oral evidence when the father purported not to be able to recall any details about important events. The father&#8217;s evasion seemed to me to be tactical.  </p>

Even making full allowance for the difficulties involved in giving evidence remotely and through an interpreter, she seemed at times determined not to answer straightforward questions. She was reluctant to acknowledge manifest inconsistencies in her evidence, such as her account of the messaging at the end of August to which I have already referred. The mother gave evidence under cross-examination that had not previously been given. For example, she volunteered that she and R had discussed as early as in September 2018 the possibility that R would come with her to Poland if she had to go back. At that time her concern was that M might not be given a place at the local school in England. Earlier Mr Devereux on her behalf had questioned Ms Doyle on the basis that a return order would lead to the separation of the mother, and M, from R. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">I have already noted the mother&#8217;s evidence in her second statement, and during parts of her oral evidence, that the father knew by the end of August that she intended to keep M permanently in England. This evidence was wholly inconsistent with what she told the court in her self-authored position statement in January 2020, and with the contemporaneous messaging. From the beginning of September, the mother chose to pay for the nursery school in Poland to keep M&#8217;s place open there. Her business in England was in its infancy and might never have become operational. I am quite satisfied that in August the mother did not know how long she would stay in England with M except that it was likely to be for at least a few months. I am sure that the mother had not decided to stay permanently or for a very long time in England by the end of August.  </p>

There is an absence of contemporaneous evidence of such an agreement. Further, when the parties, M, and R were in Poland at the end of 2018, there is no evidence from that time of any discussion about M returning to England, let alone any evidence of the father objecting to his return. Had the mother been about to breach an agreement to return at the end of 2018 I have no doubt that the father would have objected strongly and taken steps to prevent M leaving Poland, as he promptly and robustly did a few months later.  </p>

There is no evidence at all that he was unhappy about M being in England. I am quite satisfied that he knew at the time of his visit in October 2018 that the mother and R were in a relationship, were co-habiting as partners, and were forming a family unit with M in England.

This is not the behaviour of a man who was objecting to M being in England, nor of someone who was anxiously pressing for M&#8217;s imminent return to Poland. There were no signs that the mother was going to take M back to Poland in the early part of 2019.The father was in fact still living and working in Germany until April 2019, as he told me in oral evidence. The parties agreed that during the Easter holiday M would travel with his father to Poland to spend ten days there, before returning to England. The mother had no reason to believe that the father would not return M to England at the end of that visit. I am satisfied that by 7 April 2019 the father knew that the mother was in a long term relationship with R, and that M was part of a new family unit in England. I am satisfied that until M was in Poland with his father from 8 April 2019, both parties were in full agreement that M should continue to live in England after the end of his holiday in Poland on 17 or 18 April 2019.   </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s agreement to M remaining in England changed abruptly after M arrived in Poland on or about 8 April 2019. It is abundantly clear that the reason for the father&#8217;s change of view was his perception that the mother&#8217;s relationship with R was dysfunctional and that he needed to protect M from it. I have referred already to what the father says he witnessed on 7 April at the flat in England and the steps he took to gather evidence to confirm his belief that M would be harmed were he to return to live with the mother and R. This coincided with the father&#8217;s work in Germany ending, and his returning to live in Poland. I have paid careful attention to all the evidence that the father gathered at this time. It shows that the mother and R had previously exchanged frank messages, that their relationship could be fiery, and that on occasion the mother had said that she wanted to leave England and return to Poland. The father&#8217;s view that it showed a history of domestic abuse adversely affecting M is not sustainable in my judgement. As it happens, the father has not raised concerns about M&#8217;s safety or welfare with social services in England even though M has been living here with his mother and R for 18 months since he returned in May 2019. </p>

There is no evidence of an engagement on 10 November 2018 other than the mother&#8217;s say-so and one might reasonably ask why R would have posted news of the engagement on social media at the end of May 2019 if it had happened in November 2018. However, having heard her give evidence, on balance I am satisfied that she and R did become engaged on that date. She gave spontaneous evidence about the day of the engagement when she was bought flowers and a ring and was given breakfast in bed. It might have been more helpful to her case if the mother had agreed with the father that the engagement did not happen in November 2018, but she was adamant and convincing in her evidence that it did. I accept her evidence. </p>

Although this was new evidence, not alluded to in her statements, and therefore must be treated with caution, I considered it to be authentic. R is Polish. In the autumn of 2018 he was clearly in love with the mother, hence his proposal on 10 November 2018. It would be surprising if he would not at least contemplate moving to Poland, even if just for a temporary period, with the mother and M if that were necessary to keep them together.  </p>

However, I do not accept the father&#8217;s suggestion that the relationship was deeply dysfunctional. He had not noticed anything awry on his visits in October or November, he had no concerns whatsoever about M&#8217;s welfare within the family unit, as it obviously was, until April 2019. If the relationship was as unstable as he says, it would have been obvious to him on his visits and communications with M and the mother that all was not well. The very fact that R and the mother became engaged in November 2018 is good evidence that they were in love even if they did sometimes argue. The mother showed her fiery side at times when giving evidence, and it is clear from the evidence that the father gathered and presented to the court that she and R could sometimes row and use choice language when doing so, but that does not mean that they did not love one another or that their relationship was an unhappy or very unstable one. </p>

The relationship clearly developed between July and November 2018 and continued to do so thereafter. It would not have been easy for the mother to settle into a new relationship given that she was living with her son in a new country, and her relationship with R did not always run smoothly. The father&#8217;s own investigations in April 2019, as set out above, show that the mother and R had arguments, and that shortly before the engagement, at the end of October 2018, the mother was uncertain about staying in England. R&#8217;s proposal was therefore a surprise to her and although she agreed to becoming engaged, she clearly had doubts about whether the relationship would endure. Although the relationship became stronger as time went on, and the mother and R married late in 2019, she was unsure what would happen to the relationship at the time when the couple became engaged. When seen in context, the engagement was one part of a developing process with an uncertain outcome, rather than a sudden step-change and a manifestation of a decision made to stay permanently in England.  </p>

This does not cause me to doubt that the engagement had occurred: the parties had only a brief relationship and the parties generally had little interest in each other&#8217;s relationships &#8211; this is not a case in which ongoing jealousy plays a part. The father himself was in a relationship at this time. The mother told me that she felt judged by the father and she may well have withheld news of the engagement from him until she was more confident that the relationship would be long-lasting.

The father characterised that as a sarcastic remark, but even if it was, it reflected what he knew to be the truth. He knew then that the mother and R were in a long-term relationship.

However, of more importance is the fact that whether engaged or not, the father knew from the time of his visit to England in October 2018 at the latest, that the mother and R had formed a new family with M. The fact that the mother, R and M travelled to Poland together, and returned to England together after Christmas 2018 will only have confirmed the fact that they were a family unit. The mother and R were plainly cohabiting as a couple and living as a family with M in England. Until 7 April 2019 the father was content with that arrangement and his acceptance of it would have been the same whether or not he knew they were engaged.  </p>

They continued to agree to M&#8217;s continued stay even until the beginning of April 2019 when both agreed that M would continue to live in England after returning from holiday in Poland on 17 or 18 April 2019. There was no agreement that the stay in England would be permanent but both understood that the stay was for a substantial albeit undefined period. In so agreeing the father was exercising his custody rights. I can find no contemporary evidence to support the father&#8217;s suggestion that he objected to M&#8217;s continued stay in England until his significant change of mind in April 2019. Not only did he not object, but he visited M in England in October and November 2018 and again in February 2019, returning to his own home which was then in Germany, without a hint that he did not agree to leaving M behind in England on his departure. He fully accepted that M would continue to stay in England throughout that period. </p>

It is clear why this submission has been made: if wrongful retention were as early as August 2018, then the father&#8217;s application herein is more than 12 months after that retention, and the court would then have to consider whether M was settled in England at the date of issue of this application. The evidence is strongly in favour of a finding that M was then settled in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, having previously accepted that she had not decided to stay permanently as early as August 2018, the mother now says that she had. It is to her discredit that she does so. As already noted, her evidence that she had decided permanently to stay, or to stay in the long term, is wholly at odds with the contemporaneous evidence, and her own previous evidence. I reject it. She did nothing in August that would constitute a retention contrary to the agreement reached with the father. </p>

I accept that repudiation might occur in that manner (or in other ways), but I am not persuaded that the mother repudiated the father&#8217;s rights as alleged or at all.

He knew, and seemed content with, the fact that M was living with the mother and R as a family unit. He was agreeable to M starting school here. It is not surprising that the mother registered M with a general practitioner and took steps to find work for herself. She had plans for a business which got underway in August, but those plans were not particularly advanced. She obtained temporary work. Those steps were not of a kind to repudiate the temporary nature of the stay which, by the end of August, had been agreed to be for some months. The father saw for himself during his visit in October 2018 that M was living with R and the mother in a family unit and, I am sure, was fully aware that the mother and R were in a serious relationship and were co-habiting. The father agreed to M staying in England under those arrangements. They did not amount to a repudiation of his rights. </p>

They were not going to leave this jurisdiction and so, arguably, neither was R.

Firstly, although the agreement was for a temporary stay, there was no defined end date. I do not accept the father&#8217;s case that the agreement was for M to be returned to Poland at the end of 2018. Secondly, the father had already agreed to M staying in England for several months, starting school here and living in a family unit with R and the mother. The engagement did not make a material change to the arrangements, so knowledge of the engagement would not have been likely to lead the father to withdraw his consent to the agreement reached. Thirdly, it was possible that the relationship between the mother and R might not endure &#8211; I am sure that the mother realised this even on the date of the engagement. Fourthly, it was possible that the mother and M might return to Poland with R, either temporarily or on a longer-term basis. Fifthly, when the father was told of the engagement on 1 January he did not oppose M being returned from his holiday in Poland back to the family home in England, and he continued to agree to M remaining there in the following months until the events in April 2019. Finally, the engagement meant no more or less than that the parties intended to marry. Some engagements last for months, some for years, others are broken and there is never a marriage. Looked at in context, this engagement did not change the nature of M&#8217;s stay in England. It did not pre-empt the father&#8217;s custody rights. It did not make it impossible for M to return to Poland in 2019 or at all. </p>

The mother applied for M&#8217;s return under the Hague Convention but that application, in Poland, became otiose when she managed to regain care of M on 1 May 2019 during a visit by M to his grandmother, and to return to England on 30 May 2019. She did so without seeking permission of the courts in Poland, before which there were ongoing applications, and without the consent of the father.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I consider that M was habitually resident in England on 30 May 2019. Prior to the father taking M to Poland on 8 April 2019, M had lived in England since early July 2018, a period of nine months. He had lived in one place &#8211; R&#8217;s two-bedroom flat. He had started school for the first time and, by 8 April 2019 had spent two terms at school. He was registered with a general practitioner. He had a great deal of contact with R&#8217;s two sons &#8211; photographs show that he had many enjoyable times with them. He had made friends at school and had enjoyed several parties and other social occasions with those friends. His English was improving. His father had visited him in England three times, returning to the continent after each visit. He himself had visited Poland for a holiday and then returned to England in time for the new school term. From July 2018 to the beginning of April 2019 M&#8217;s father was living and working in Germany, not in Poland. M had lived all his life in Poland prior to July 2018, but he had then swiftly become part of a family unit in England, integrated into society here, and had certainly acquired habitual residence by April 2019. </p>

However, whatever his mother&#8217;s doubts about how long she would stay, there is no evidence that she shared those doubts with M. From his perspective he had a new home, new family life, new school, and new social life in England, and these were now part of his normal, daily life. His life was stable and he was deeply integrated in family and social life in England by April 2019. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">A more difficult question is whether M was habitually resident in England or Poland as of 10 November 2018. He had lived all his life in Poland until July 2018. His extended family on both the father&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s sides lived in Poland. By 10 November 2018 he had been in England for about four months but for the initial few weeks he would not have expected to have stayed beyond the end of the summer &#8211; the visit had been intended as a holiday. However, from the end of August 2018 M will have known that he was staying in England for the time being. From September 2018, he was becoming settled at his new home, with his mother&#8217;s partner, R, and R&#8217;s own children who would stay overnight on a regular basis. M would have been looking forward to starting school in England and from on or about 15 October 2018 he was at his new school. This was a very significant step for M &#8211; it was his first school. He knew other pupils there including R&#8217;s children. He appears to have settled in well at the school, but he had been there only for about four weeks by 10 November 2018. It is of some significance that his father had visited him in England in October and then returned to work in Germany. There is no evidence at all that the father talked to M about returning to Poland at the end of the year or at all. After all, the father was not even living there. To this child therefore there would have seemed to be some stability in the arrangements under which he was living. The fact that his parents may both have expected the stay in England to be temporary, for a &#8220;few months&#8221;, does not detract from the fact that, to M, his life here would have felt stable. M appears to have been picking up the English language and was able to manage at school even though his first language was Polish. He made friends there. He engaged in activities outside school. He had a new home and a new family unit. He was not as fully integrated into the social environment here as he was by April 2019 but he was, in my judgment sufficiently integrated in family and social life, and his life here had sufficient stability, for me to conclude that he was habitually resident in this jurisdiction as at 10 November 2018. He was not, by then, habitually resident in Poland. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">On visiting Poland on 8 April 2019, and by the time the mother removed him back to England on 30 May 2019, did M become habitually resident in Poland? In my judgment he did not. On arrival in Poland he was expecting to have a holiday of about 10 days before returning to England in time for the summer term at school. His father took it upon himself without the mother&#8217;s consent and with no pre-planning, not to return M to England and to his mother&#8217;s care. He spent just one week in school in Poland without his mother&#8217;s agreement. He saw a psychologist there solely at the instigation of his father who may well have made that arrangement as part of his evidence gathering exercise. By 1 May 2019 M was back in the care of his mother. M then spent one month moving around different locations whilst his mother sought documentation allowing her to take M back to England. He was, as it were, in the departure lounge for much of May 2019. Even allowing for the fact that M spoke Polish, was brought up in Poland until July 2018, and many members of his extended family lived there, he did not re-integrate into society or family life in Poland during these few weeks in April and May 2019. To him this was certainly a temporary visit, followed by an unsettling week or so when he expected to be with his mother, but instead was being kept in Poland by his father and sent to a school there. This was followed in turn by a month where he moved around Poland with his mother waiting to return to England when they were able to secure the necessary documentation. There was no stability whatsoever in Poland during that period. He was due to return to school in England which he had been attending for six months, he was registered with a GP there, his mother was receiving child benefit there, his home was there, R&#8217;s sons were there, his other friends were there. He remained integrated in the family and social environment in England throughout his time in Poland in April and May 2019. </p>

He and his mother had lived in Poland since his birth. There would be no language difficulties. He has extended family in Poland on both his mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s sides. Ms Doyle addressed the issue directly and advised that in her opinion there would not be a grave risk that return to Poland would expose M to a physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. The Court of Appeal did not include Article 13(b) in the list of issues for this court to determine on the case being remitted to it. Nevertheless, the mother does argue this defence. Mr Devereux referred the court to <span style="font-style:italic">KS v RS (Abduction: Habitual Residence) </span>[2009] EWHC 1494 (Fam), [2009] 2 FLR 1231 in which Macur J found that undue delay and settlement constituted the basis of an argument that a child would be exposed to an intolerable situation if summarily returned to their country of habitual residence prior to removal. There might be many different reasons, including uprooting a sensitive child from settled life in the new country, that might cause an intolerable situation for them on return, but I am not persuaded that the Article 13(b) exception is made out on the facts of this case. M would be very sad to have to return and I am sure that return would be detrimental to his welfare, but I see no evidence that he is a particularly sensitive or vulnerable child, he would have the full support of his mother, he would be returning to an environment where he could speak the language and adapt to a new school, and he would have wider family support. The circumstances do not demonstrate that there would be a grave risk that return would expose M to harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. </p>

He may not have a full understanding of how the decision about return is to be made, or the ramifications of stating his objections, but I am satisfied that he spoke freely, that he called on his experience of Poland and England (albeit his memories of living in Poland are not very strong), that his reasons for objecting to return were not fanciful but were grounded in reality, and that the objections he raised were his own &#8211; he was not unduly influenced by his mother. It can be said that he has been influenced by the circumstances his mother has created by wrongful removal or retention (if that were the case) but I am satisfied on all the evidence that he objects to return to Poland and I should taken into account his views. He is only eight years old but the courts have taken into account the views of children of that age or younger in other cases &#8211; for example <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Abduction: Child&#8217;s Objections)</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 520, [2010] 2 FLR 1165. </p>

In exercising the discretion I follow the guidance of Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> (above). I take into account the reasons why the discretion arises, namely the father&#8217;s acquiescence and the child&#8217;s objections, the objects of the Convention, and welfare considerations. Acquiescence to (an alleged) repudiatory retention, would be of considerable significance when exercising the discretion. M&#8217;s objections to return are clear, but they do not attract quite as much weight, in relation to the exercise of discretion, as they would were he older and able to demonstrate greater depth of understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, his objections are strong ones. The object of the Convention to effect prompt return to the country of habitual residence cannot be achieved in this case because it is already so long since M was retained in England and away from Poland. This case is far removed from one of a blatant overnight abduction followed by a &#8220;hot chase&#8221;. The welfare of the child is said to be woven into the Convention but in this case there would be a danger that over-emphasis on promoting certain objects of the Convention would cause harm to the child. It appears to me to be incontrovertible that removing M from England now, from his home, his school and his friends, and returning him to Poland against his wishes and those of his main carer, would be detrimental to his welfare. The higher threshold under Article 13(b) is not crossed, but welfare considerations point clearly against return. The father was able to travel to and from England for contact in 2018 and early 2019. Whilst damage has been done to his relationship with the mother by reason of events in April and May 2019 and these proceedings, I am confident that the mother will support contact between M and his father in the future, as being in M&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I find that the parties agreed to M travelling to England in July 2018 and then to remaining here with his mother until April 2019 when the father unilaterally decided to retain M in Poland following an agreed holiday there. On 30 May 2019 the mother removed M back to England without the father&#8217;s consent. Up to that point there had been no wrongful removal or retention of M by the mother. I find that on 30 May 2019 M was habitually resident in England and therefore the Hague Convention has no application. If I am wrong then the exception of the child&#8217;s objections under Article 13 of the Convention has been established and I would exercise my discretion to refuse the application for return. Accordingly, the father&#8217;s application is dismissed.  </p>
