I refused her application and directed that the children should live primarily with her in London but spending ample time with their father. The judgment is available in anonymised form on Bailii<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	      </authorialNote>. It sets out the history up to that point. Following the hand-down of the judgment I acceded to an application by the mother to be allowed to take the children temporarily to the Ukraine from 2 &#8211; 27 May 2018 so that from there, and in that period, she might sort out the visa situation of her newly born son, then not even two months old.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother immediately applied for permission to appeal my main decision, and the father likewise sought to appeal my secondary one. The Court of Appeal heard the applications on 8 May 2018. The mother was refused permission to appeal. The father was granted permission and his appeal was allowed. Peter Jackson LJ was of the view that notwithstanding that Ukraine was a Hague Convention country, then without safeguards and security, enforcement of the return of the children - should the mother retain them there - might prove to be protracted<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

That duly occurred on the very evening of the appeal hearing. The father says, and I accept, that MGF sought to persuade the father to agree that the children could live in the Ukraine but could give no guarantees that the children would be able to travel to England were that to be agreed. On being told by the father that, therefore, it would not be agreed MGF said that it was &#8220;not over&#8221;. This was clearly a threat.   </p>

The mother resisted this saying through her solicitors on 7 June 2018 that she &#8220;has no intention of retaining the children in Ukraine&#8221; and in any event that the process of obtaining such an order would take &#8220;several months&#8221; and was therefore likely to be redundant for the purposes of a summer holiday. </p>

She will provide a report to the court as a guardian of the children and as their advocate will advance her submission in relation to the publicity proposal.  As she has been appointed, the court will take advantage of that status to require her to travel to the Ukraine as soon as she reasonably can, and I am told it will be within seven weeks, to interview the children and to determine their wishes and feelings in the circumstances of their retention in the Ukraine.  At aged five and three, I do not suppose their wishes and feelings will be very maturely expressed, but it is important that they should be ascertained, not least because these children are and shall remain wards of court.&#8221;    </p>

So I do not want anything that I say that follows to be interpreted as any kind of watering down of my very firm condemnation of the conduct of the mother, which will, as I said during the course of the hearing, ultimately prove to be futile because I have no doubt her objective of being able to retain these children in the Ukraine throughout their minorities will fail.  It may take some time, but fail it will I am quite certain of it, because the Ukraine is a co-signatory with this country to both the 1996 and 1980 Hague Conventions.  I am sure that for the Ukraine the principle of comity is as important as it is in this country and that the judicial and administrative authorities of the Ukraine will ultimately return these children to the land of their habitual residence for them to live under the child arrangements that I decreed as being appropriate on 27 April of this year.&#8221;  </p>

She argued that the father was to be criticised for having made the &#8220;tactical&#8221; decision to proceed in the Ukraine under the 1996 Hague Convention rather than the 1980 Hague Convention. Had he proceeded under the 1980 Convention then defences would be made available to the mother under article 13 namely that a separation of the girls from their halfbrother would risk exposing them to a grave risk of psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation. Apparently, to choose a path which deprives the mother of that defence is something for which the father is to be criticised. I cannot disagree more strongly. I have stated in a number of decisions that the arrival of the reciprocal enforcement of orders regime in both the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 (&#8220;B2R&#8221;) and the 1996 Convention has the effect of rendering the 1980 Convention obsolescent (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">E v E (Secretary of State for the Home Department intervening)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] Fam 24" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] Fam 24</ref>, at [13]). Plainly, the father is not to be criticised for choosing a path under the more modern treaty to seek to enforce my substantive order. I would go so far as to say that the criticism is absurd.    </p>

Her reasoning is that any further delay in the resolution of the circumstances of the children will be highly damaging.

They do not argue that it is more likely than not that such a consequence will eventuate. Given the scale of the harm that is being suffered by the children, as explained graphically by the Guardian in her report, they argue by analogy with <span style="font-style:italic">Re SB (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2009/17" uk:canonical="[2009] UKSC 17" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKSC 17</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 AC 678" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 AC 678</ref> that even a modest likelihood of coercing compliance will suffice.

This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a lesser degree of likelihood that the child will be killed will justify immediate preventive action than the degree of likelihood that the child will not be sent to school.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Lord Pannick QC argues that publicity is completely pointless in this case and will only damage the interests of the children. There is no evidence, he says, that the mother, or MGF, will yield to the pressure of publicity. On the contrary the picture that has been painted of the mother is of a woman who is highly ruthless and manipulative and who is not going to succumb to the transient and ephemeral pressure of a few days&#8217; publicity. It was certainly a novel experience for me to have the vices of a litigant prayed in aid by her advocate. The consequence of publicity will be to create a digital footprint which will endure forever to the children&#8217;s disadvantage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms King QC supported the application for publicity on behalf of the children. I place great weight on her submissions which derive from instructions given to her by the Guardian. As explained above, she has stated that the mother and MGF should be given one last chance to comply and that the order for the lifting of publicity should therefore be deferred for a week. However, in principle she is satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood that publicity will supply a coercive element which may have the consequence of bringing the mother and MGF to heel.  </p>

She sees the mother as manipulative, conniving and a strong character evincing no sign of contrition. Not to take this course would be the counsel of despair. That she has brought a phalanx of some of the country&#8217;s most distinguished lawyers to defend her position is indicative of the concern that she is truly feeling at the prospect of publicity. If she were truly unconcerned at the prospect of publicity she would have shrugged her shoulders and said: &#8216;publish and be damned&#8217;. </p>

I have already rejected above the argument of the mother that her new husband is raising an authentic impediment to this step being taken. It is my judgment that publicity is positively in the interests of these children on the specific facts of this case.  </p>

Child abduction is a heinous practice, and there are in force, as explained above, international agreements to seek to prevent it. Yet public awareness is curiously very limited. It is strongly in the public interest that much greater awareness is generated about this dreadful phenomenon.

This is, in my judgment, a hopeless application in circumstances where I am satisfied that MGF has acted in concert with the mother in the abduction of these children. The father indicated at the hearing that he intended to seek further relief against MGF (and Slava) and duly issued an application on 21 January 2019; but that is not the reason for my refusal of the application. It is based on his deep complicity, of which I am fully satisfied.  </p>
