	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">On 16th January 2012 the final hearing of an application for financial remedy commenced before me. It was listed for 5 days. The parties to the proceedings were the Husband, Wife, and the Husband's parents. At Court and before the hearing commenced the parties managed to reach an agreement as to the Intervenors' (parents') claims as a result of which they were discharged as parties.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">At the outset of the hearing, accredited media representatives attended. Mr Robert Peel Q.C. on behalf of the Husband sought to have the media excluded from the hearing. I rejected his application but imposed a temporary reporting restriction order, which remains in place. The Wife, through her Counsel Mr Morgan Sirikanda, expressed herself as neutral on the issue of the media attendance.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">The hearing continued until 20th January 2012 and, after discussion concerning the diaries of both Counsel and Judge, the date for giving judgment was finally fixed for 15th March 2012. On that day, some 10 minutes before judgment was due to be given, the Court was informed that the parties had settled their dispute. A proposed consent order was submitted and approved by the Court and the order was made. Although brief oral submissions had been made by Counsel and also by Mr Brian Farmer of the Press Association at the conclusion of the hearing on 20th January 2012, the new situation presented by the settlement of the dispute, which avoided the necessity for the delivery of a judgment, led to a request by Mr Peel QC for a further adjournment to argue fully the issue of reporting of the proceedings by the media. Clearly both the litigants and the media were entitled to an opportunity to argue the matter fully and the issue was set down for hearing on 19th April 2012.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">On 19th April 2012, Mr Peel QC appeared again on behalf of the Husband. The Wife was represented by a solicitor Ms Moussaoui. The Husband's parents, who had given evidence during the hearing but were no longer parties, were represented by Mr Christian Kenny of Counsel. Times Newspapers Limited (`TNL") were represented by Mr Adam Wolanski of Counsel, TNL sought to introduce two statements: one from a general reporter at the Times, Fay Schlesinger, who had attended almost all of the original hearing, the other from Mr Richard Beeston, the Foreign Editor of The Times. I accepted those statements. The Wife remained neutral in her position. The parents opposed any reporting of their evidence in the proceedings and adopted the arguments put on behalf of the Husband. The Husband's father was particularly concerned about the embarrassment that disclosure of details about him and his financial affairs and those of his son would cause to him and to others and the likely impact on his own career and possible risk to his life.</p>

The Guardian has a serious journalistic purpose in seeking access to the documents.

They were both clearly anxious about the possible ramifications of the disclosure and it was only at the court's insistence that, eventually, a reasonably full explanation was given. There was clearly no desire on the Husband's part, nor on that of his father, to bring to public attention the personal, private arrangements of an unconnected individual.

I find in considering this aspect that the balance between the right of the Media to freedom of expression and the right of the Husband (and others) to respect for private and family life, weighed together with the open justice principle enshrined in Article 6 and the implied undertaking as to confidentiality falls firmly in favour of privacy being maintained.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">The Husband argues that the business is sensitive and that publicity would be damaging. Yet I recall among the documents what appears to be a press release about the business. There has been entertainment of investors or potential investors and fundraising is ongoing, though difficult in the current climate.</p>

It was information given in proceedings held in private, in accordance with the FPR 2010, which are compliant with Article 6 of the ECHR.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">It is entirely understandable that the Media are interested in this case and having heard the evidence are very keen to be able to report what they have learned. However the matters in which the Media appear to be particularly interested relate mainly to individuals who are not in any way involved in these proceedings except to the extent that the Husband has been compelled to provide confidential information about them to the Court in order to satisfy the requirement for full and frank disclosure of all matters relevant to the Court's decision in the financial remedy proceedings. He has not given the information in open court, but at a hearing held in private, and so held in compliance with Article 6 of the ECHR.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Wolanski for TNL criticised the Husband and his father for failing to comply with their duty to provide full information as to the extent to which disclosure of the proceedings should be restricted, as to their evidence in support of allegations of danger and embarrassment arising from such disclosure and &#8212; at a late stage of the hearing &#8212; for failing to comply with the President's Practice Direction 2005 and its accompanying note by applying on notice to the High Court. As Mr Peel QC subsequently pointed out succinctly, the Direction and the Note apply to proceedings involving children and patients (or adults under a disability). There is as I find no procedural point to be taken.</p>
