The mother seeks the return of N to Canada, from where it is alleged N has been wrongfully retained.  The Respondent to the application is N&#8217;s father (F); he opposes the application.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing of this application took place on 19 &amp; 20 December 2016, and on 19 January 2017.  For the purposes of determining this application, I read evidence filed by and on behalf of both parties, together with a number of exhibits.  I heard brief oral evidence from M (by video-link from Canada), from F, and from the maternal grandmother of the child. I received oral submissions from Mr. Edwards and from F in person.  I also had available to me reports from the Canadian social services in relation to N&#8217;s baby brother, E, who was born to the parents since N and F left Canada.  By the conclusion of submissions in December 2016, it was apparent that some further evidence/information was required, including:</p>

Further documentary evidence available in January 2017 provided the necessary information.  A short letter was available from M&#8217;s general practitioner, together with limited evidence about F&#8217;s visa entitlement and the parents&#8217; eligibility for state benefits in Canada.  The mother had filed a short statement setting out her offer of financial support, limited to a $500 one-off payment, and an offer to forward any child benefit payments to F; as it happens (though it is of no consequence to my decision), I concluded on the material that neither M nor F would be entitled to claim child benefit for N in Canada in the event of her return in the care of F.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is 24 years old; she has dual Canadian/British nationality.  Her own mother (Canadian) lives in England, and has done so for some time.  The father is 32, and is English.  The parties met in 2013; they never married, and it appears to me (though this is not an agreed fact) that they endured a fairly consistently volatile and unstable relationship.  The father maintains that they separated and reconciled many times.  In April 2014 their daughter N was born in England; F acquired parental responsibility for N by virtue of being registered on her birth certificate as the father.  It appears to me from what I have read that M did not take easily to parenthood, and preferred being out of the home working; she worked long hours, sometimes seven days per week, in unskilled jobs.  The parental relationship suffered.  In September 2015, the parents separated again.  In the following month, they decided to see if they could make their relationship work by moving to Canada and having a &#8216;fresh start&#8217;; they were struggling to make ends meet in England.  Issue arises as to the precise terms on which they made the move.  I return to this below.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus it was that in October 2015, they travelled to Saskatchewan, Canada, where the mother&#8217;s father and step-mother, and her grandparents, live.  F and N entered the country on six-month holiday visas.  The couple, with N, moved in initially with the mother&#8217;s grandparents.  They had not been there long before the parents&#8217; relationship ran into difficulties and they separated once again; the mother left that home in November 2015 following arguments over her fidelity (see below), and moved in with her step-mother&#8217;s cousin. The parents reconciled over Christmas, before separating again (and finally) in February 2016.  The domestic situation for the whole six months remained uncertain and unsatisfactory for all of them.  In April 2016, the father and N returned to this country.  M travelled to the airport with them to see them off.  An &#8216;agreement to travel&#8217; document was prepared and signed by the mother and her family, but not the father; it provided for F to remove N from Canada on the basis that he would return with her on or before 16 August 2016. The parents do not agree as to the circumstances/terms on which the father and N left Canada.  N has been in this country ever since.</p>

He originally submitted at the hearing in December 2016 that if N is ordered to be returned to Canada he would accompany her, but would travel to, and stay in, Ottawa (2000 miles from M) where he has an aunt.  On sight of the new material at the adjourned hearing in January 2017, he advised me that he would not be able to afford to travel to Canada, or to live there, and that his immigration status and work opportunities would on the material supplied be far too uncertain.  In the circumstances, he indicated that in the event of a return order, N would have to travel to Canada without F.  F further told me at the adjourned hearing in January 2017 that he had recently been in contact with the social services department in Alberta; they had advised him that E is still in foster care, and that if N was to return to Alberta without F, N would be the subject of safeguarding proceedings, and an application would be made for her to be removed in to state care, with her brother.  Mr. Edwards did not require this information to be tested under oath.</p>

She says that she did not consent to any longer period.  Accordingly, she maintains that the father has unlawfully retained N in this jurisdiction from 16 August 2016.  She accepts that if N returns to Canada she should remain in the actual care of F (in Ottawa) if he returns with her until the Canadian Court can make a judgment on interim arrangements.  If N returns on her own, M acknowledges that the social services may remove her into care, but &#8211; so Mr. Edwards argues &#8211; this does not create an &#8216;intolerable situation&#8217; nor would it otherwise create a grave risk that this would expose N to psychological harm.</p>

M was, I find, planning a permanent move; indeed, F told me in oral evidence that she had always wanted to live in Canada.  F was more circumspect; he embarked on the venture believing it to be exploratory, a reconnaissance to see if he and M could indeed repair their relationship in a different country, and in particular to see if M could be faithful to him.  </p>

They packed all of their clothes into suitcases which they transported with them.  M says that they gave notice on the tenancy; F says that the tenancy was coming to an end and was not renewed; either way it was relinquished.  M gave up her claims to benefits in England, and she effectively left little trace of her life in England.  Significantly, perhaps, F did not relinquish his benefits.  </p>

There is a dispute as to whether this would be a temporary or a permanent return; F believed it would be a permanent arrangement, M believed it would temporary, although she conceded that &#8220;it might sound strange&#8221; that F and N should be permitted to come back only for a short time. The fact that these discussions took place with the grandmother at all strongly implies the considerable uncertainty in both parents&#8217; minds which underlay the venture.  The maternal grandmother gave evidence on this aspect of the case, though she was vague as to the detail of the conversation. She <span style="font-style:italic">thought</span> that the parties had told her that F would return permanently but she recognised that she may not accurately have remembered precisely what was said.  She told me that she suffers from fibromyalgia, which affects her memory. In my finding, on the evidence, the period for which F and N would return was undefined.  </p>

M and N were registered with a doctor, though N did not at any time while in Canada actually receive medical treatment.  F explored what would be required for him to become a Canadian citizen.  Mr. Edwards contends that the application for citizenship for N and her registration with a doctor point towards a degree of integration of N in Canada.  I accept that contention to a degree; these formal steps do not, however, represent real social and family integration.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the factors pointing the other way, having arrived in Canada the couple did not acquire their own home, rented or otherwise.  They lived effectively out of suitcases, staying with one set of the mother&#8217;s relatives or another. The father (it is agreed between the parties) had a tense relationship with the mother&#8217;s grandparents, their first hosts; he describes the relationship with them as &#8220;intolerable&#8221;, and they soon fell out.  This undoubtedly difficult situation was compounded within a short time of their arrival in Canada (i.e. within a matter of a few weeks) when M was caught by F to be texting other men, with sexually charged messages, including the man with whom she is now in a relationship.  She left F and moved out of the grandparents&#8217; home, leaving F and N there.  After a short separation, M returned to F and they then together moved out with N, relocating to the home of M&#8217;s father and step-mother.  There they occupied a basement room, and initially were all sleeping in the same bed. The father told me that N&#8217;s relationship with her great-grandparents and with her grandfather was &#8220;iffy&#8221;, by which I infer that it was not strong. When M was caught again texting other men in February 2016, the parents separated for the final time.  M moved out, this time to stay with her step-mother&#8217;s cousin where she remained until after F and N had moved back to England.  During this period, M made several suicide attempts; on at least one of the occasions it was F who took her to hospital.  In the period from February to April 2016, M chose to see N merely once per week.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parental relationship was &#8211; as is evident from what I have said &#8211; extremely unstable in the period in which they lived in Canada; they had separated for a period of about 10 days in late-November/December and then permanently in February 2016.  M told me in evidence that she accepted that the environment was not a very suitable one for N as the parents were &#8220;constantly bickering&#8221;.  M worked long hours out of the home throughout the relevant period; there was limited family life as such.  F did not work.  There is no evidence that F integrated into Canadian life at all; he had no friends or social life.  N did not join a playgroup or nursery, though M told me that she had looked for one.  N was primarily dependent on her father.  Text messages passing between the couple in this period (which have been reproduced and filed) suggest that M was indifferent to caring for the unborn baby, and indifferent to F and N leaving Canada permanently (&#8220;she&#8217;s better off not knowing me&#8221;; &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221; what happens when the baby is born; F could raise the baby &#8220;if you really want to&#8221;; &#8220;I can&#8217;t be a mum, I can&#8217;t be a wife&#8230; I am just a huge waste of space&#8221;; &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about this unborn baby&#8221;).  These text messages, sent I accept when the mother was depressed, provide a useful insight into the climate in which N lived in Canada.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking the picture as a whole, I discern little (if anything) which demonstrates that N integrated into a social or family life in Canada in the six months in which she stayed there. The living arrangements while she was in Canada were far from stable, with no settled home, moving from guestroom to guestroom, and exposed to the &#8216;constant bickering&#8217; of her parents who were at times together and at times apart.  She remained throughout this period in the primary (indeed for extended periods the sole) care of her father; he was a foreign national in Canada, an awkward and uncomfortable guest in various homes of M&#8217;s relatives, without work, and (on my finding) only in the country on a reconnaissance.  For significant periods, N had limited contact with her own mother, and at best rather superficial relationships with the mother&#8217;s relatives.  There is no evidence whatsoever that N integrated socially or otherwise, to any degree at all, outside of the home &#8211; there was no nursery, no playgroup, indeed no evidence of any life at all.  </p>

I acknowledge that N was in Canada for six months; but the duration of the visit is less important than the quality of it.  I recognise that the parents had left none of their belongings in England when they left, but this was a pragmatic step at a time when their futures were at best uncertain.</p>

Her paternal relatives and maternal grandmother continue to live here; her enduring link with this country was preserved after October 2015 by the pre-trip parental agreement that if things did not work out in Canada, F would return to this country with N, even if for an undefined period.  N had indeed returned in April 2016, on the return ticket, and had settled back comfortably into her life here when the application under the <span style="font-style:italic">1980 Convention </span>was issued.</p>

It follows that she was not habitually resident in Canada immediately before or at the time of the alleged wrongful retention but was habitually resident in England.  In light of this finding the mother&#8217;s claim fails.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, I considered carefully all the arguments as the case unfolded, and in the period of the adjournment.  I was particularly interested in the father&#8217;s case that a return of N to Canada on her own would present a grave risk of psychological harm/intolerability (<span style="font-style:italic">article 13(b)</span>).  I was satisfied that F would not realistically have been able to accompany N on any return to Canada &#8211; financial, immigration and practical obstacles were significant (quite apart from the fact that had he travelled to Canada it would only have been practical for him to be in Ontario where he has an aunt &#8211; some 2000 miles from M).  Therefore, the consequence of M&#8217;s case would have been for me to separate N from F who has been her primary carer for much of her life, to relocate her some 4,500 miles from F, whereupon on her arrival in Alberta (a State to which she has never in fact been), she would probably (and this is not challenged by M) have been placed in foster care with her brother, whom she has never met.  The only geographically proximate parent would be M, with whom N has had, it seems to me, a rather detached relationship over the last three years, by virtue of M&#8217;s work commitments, her social priorities, her mental ill-health and the last ten months of physical separation; M would be unlikely to offer little by way of emotional support or comfort for N.  M remains of course in a relationship with a man (X) who is not known to N and whose conduct to M has been a significant factor in the institution of safeguarding proceedings in relation to E, and his removal from M&#8217;s care. </p>

I of course accept that S will be caused a degree of psychological distress and emotional upset by being separated from his mother and placed in foster care. However, having regard to the protective measures that can be put in place by the Dutch authorities, I am not satisfied that that level of distress and upset will be such as to meet the narrow exception to the obligation to return constituted by Art 13(b). In such circumstances, there being no other basis for making out a defence in this case, I am required to make a return order.&#8221;</p>

I considered that this case would be distinguishable from <span style="font-style:italic">AT v SS</span> on the facts.  That these cases are fact-specific was specifically and rightly recognised by MacDonald J [34] (ibid).  Such a conclusion on <span style="font-style:italic">article 13(b)</span> would have opened the gateway for the discretionary exercise on the issue of return.
