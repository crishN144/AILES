	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Convention operates in the premise of respect and comity between the Authorities of its Contracting States and aims to protect children from the harmful impact of wrongful removal and retention. Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained, its provisions aim for a prompt return of the child to the Contracting State that the child was removed from (see Baroness Hale at paragraph 48  <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D (a child) (abduction: rights of custody)</span>[2006] UKHL 51). The scheme of the Convention provides for a limited number of defences to an application for summary return that include consent or acquiescence by the party seeking the return of the child.</p>

It is possible to acquire a new habitual residence in a single day (A v A; Re B).  In the latter case Lord Wilson referred (para 45) to those &#8216;first roots&#8217; which represent the requisite degree of integration and which a child will &#8216;probably&#8217; put down &#8216;quite quickly&#8217; following a move;</span></p>

It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or indefinitely (Re R). </span></p>

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child&#8217;s day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child.

This requires an analysis of the child&#8217;s situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual.</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Further, the analogy needs to be used with caution because if it is applied as though it is the test for habitual residence it can, as in my view is demonstrated by the present case, result in the court's focus being disproportionately on the extent of a child's continuing roots or connections with and/or on an historical analysis of their previous roots or connections rather than focusing, as is required, on the child's&#160;current&#160;situation (at the relevant date). This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court's analysis when deciding the critical question which is&#160;where&#160;is the child habitually resident and not, simply, when was a previous habitual residence lost</span><span style="color:#000000">.&#8221;</span></p>

As to that, there are compelling reasons why the removing parent must be aware of whether or not consent exists. The first is that as a matter of ordinary language the word 'consent' denotes the giving of permission to another person to do something. For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb ("avait consenti/had consented"): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.&#8221;</span></p>

He  demanded to have control the mother&#8217;s social media accounts, restricted her contact with the children, pressured her to send him intimate images of herself and cutting off any financial support that he was giving her. The father then presented the mother with a written document that he wished for her to sign. The document was drafted in terms that gave the father &#8216;sole custody&#8217; of the children and the mother to have supervised contact with the children. Notwithstanding the pressures from the father to sign the document, she did not do so and withdrew her consent to the children remaining in the UK.

From her perspective, he had acted unilaterally by pursing and maintaining a relationship with X for years which at times meant that he was away from the family several nights each week. She believed that they had been married. The relationship appears to have ended. However, she discovered the email dated 14 February 2024 from the father to X in which he declared his everlasting love for her, his joy at being &#8216;rid&#8217; of the mother and that how X could now be a mother to his children. Until this email, the lady concerned did not know that the father had a daughter. Subsequently X rejected the father&#8217;s advances.

Within this context, I found the father&#8217;s evidence to be evasive, contradictory and unreliable. By contrast the mother, whom I found to be an intelligent and measured lady gave consistent reliable and balanced evidence. It was clear to me that she has done her utmost to meet the cultural expectations of her that included treating the father as he dominant figure of their household and respecting his decisions even where this has been unpalatable to her. She has also worked hard to near the end of her medical studies in the face of challenging circumstances.</p>

The mother&#8217;s evidence about the choice of schools for A and what was achievable was entirely consistent with the children&#8217;s lives being well established in Hungary before coming to the UK. This was clearly understood by all of the family and the paternal grandparents who were assisting with the school fees. The exhibits to the mother&#8217;s statements fully support and corroborate her oral testimony. The father&#8217;s evidence did not mount any serious challenge to the children being habitually resident in Hungary up to January 2024. Therefore, without hesitation, I find that as of January 2024, both children were habitually resident in Hungary. </p>

He was very much focused on the mother&#8217;s conduct and how he might address this. If there was any agreement that the children were permanently relocating to the UK, I would expected there to be some mention of the agreement that the father had acted upon in good faith. There is no reliable evidence that would support the father&#8217;s assertion that the move to the UK was intended to be a permanent move. The evidence clearly demonstrates the desperate and abusive attempts by the father to pressure the mother to agree to the children remining in his care. It is also clear that in the mother&#8217;s absence the day to day care of the children is undertaken by the paternal grandmother and not the father. In my judgment the children&#8217;s daily circumstances far more closely resemble a temporary arrangement that further corroborates the mother&#8217;s account. </p>

Her evidence about her prospects of working in the UK illustrated that not only this is not immediately achievable but that she has done little to investigate this or to take steps towards making the necessary applications. The contents of her text exchanges with the paternal grandmother lend further support to her assertions regarding the agreement between the parties. The mother also gave unambiguous evidence about her future work commitments in Hungary and how unlike the expectations of working within the NHS, it would allow her to care for her children. There is little evidence of the children&#8217;s integration in the UK since their arrival. Whilst I am confident that there is a degree of integration by mere fact of their presence here, I note that until May 2024 A had not attended school and has been home schooled due to the father&#8217; asserted fears of abduction. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I found the mother to be an intelligent and articulate lady. Her evidence was cogent, reliable and balanced. Her focus has steadfastly been the children notwithstanding the tremendous pressure that she has been placed under that in no small part include her separation from  her children. By contrast, I found the father&#8217;s evidence to be focused on the mother&#8217;s alleged conduct and punishing the mother for the same. He was highly evasive on the principal issues and self-serving. He has clearly mislead the court in his previous ex parte applications to his local court seeking to secure the children&#8217;s residence in the UK. His explanation by blaming his legal representatives lacked any credibility. I am entirely confident that the agreement for the children&#8217;s to come to the UK was an exceptionally difficult one for the mother and that the parties were clear that this was only a temporary solution to allow her to complete her studies by May 2024 at which time the children would return to Hungary. I am also entirely confident that in the face of the father&#8217;s behaviour and the limitations on the time that she could spend with her children, on 31 March 2024 she  withdrew her consent to the children remaining in the UK. Therefore it follows that since that date the children have been wrongfully retained in the UK.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Given my finding, in my judgment the children&#8217;s interests demands that they are returned to Hungary where they are habitually resident. Such an order would be entirely consistent with the exercise of any discretion about the children&#8217;s welfare. Therefore, it is not necessary for me to consider if the mother gave informed consent or whether it is invalidated in the circumstances that I have set out earlier. Accordingly I order that the children are returned to Hungary forthwith. </p>
