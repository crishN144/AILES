	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two main applications before the court.&#160; Both were issued by Y ("the Mother"), and both were issued when the Mother was acting as a litigant in person.&#160; The first application was issued on 31st October 2007 and the relief sought is defined in the Form C1A as "...an order to enforce the telephone contact and as much contact as possible".&#160; The second was issued on 15th April 2008 and the Mother sought to "enforce and vary" contact together with an assessment to be undertaking with the hope of moving to unsupervised contact.&#160; Mention is also made of the possibility of residence.&#160; The Respondent to both applications is I ("the Father"), and the child at the centre of these proceedings is Q I ("Q") who was born on 27th July 2000 and who is rapidly approaching his 9th birthday. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The issues with which I am concerned are, firstly, whether the court has any jurisdiction to entertain the Mother's applications, and secondly, if I were to find such jurisdiction, whether I should decline to exercise it and stay the present proceedings on the basis that this Court is a forum non conveniens.&#160; The Mother asserts that there is jurisdiction, the Father and Q's Guardian ad litem assert there is not.&#160; If the court were to find it had jurisdiction, the Father submits that the Court should decline to exercise it as the courts in Pakistan are the appropriate forum.&#160; On the other hand the Mother and Guardian maintain that the jurisdiction should be exercised as this Court is the appropriate and convenient forum. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in">"I find, therefore, that, whilst the father himself inflicted the injuries and has failed to further protect his child by making sure that he was brought to the attention of medical authorities in time, sadly the mother, quite out of character, has also failed to protect her child by seeking medical advice, and she did this in order to protect her own interests, and in this instance she has put her own interests before those of her child in a very serious way.&#160; She has sought to protect herself, possibly her marriage, possibly her job and possibly her position as mother of the child who she does not want to lose.&#160; All of those are understandable motives, but in covering up and, frankly, lying in order to protect herself, she has not helped her child from whom she has been separated for many months."</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22nd May 2003 final orders were made in the care proceedings.&#160; A residence order was made in favour of the Father.&#160; A regime of supervised contact with the Mother was defined and a 12 months Supervision Order to the Local Authority was made.&#160; Annexed to the Order were (a) a "Contact Agreement" between the Local Authority and the Mother, designed to help implement and regulate the contact arrangements between Q and the Mother; and (b) an "Agreement" between the Local Authority and the Father.&#160; I need not consider the terms of that Agreement in any detail, it is sufficient to record that paragraph 13 provided: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The Order of 22nd May 2003 effectively concluded the public law proceedings.&#160; It is right to observe that the Mother felt aggrieved and has never accepted the findings made against her.&#160; In May 2003 she sought to persuade DJ Brasse to reopen the issue of causation.&#160; That failed.&#160; The Mother launched an appeal which was eventually dismissed by Hogg J on 15th June 2004.&#160; An appeal to the Court of Appeal failed at the permission stage. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The Father applied for leave to remove Q permanently from the jurisdiction, namely, to Pakistan.&#160; The Mother applied for increased contact.&#160; Pursuant to Rule 9.5 of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 Q was joined as a party to both applications and a Guardian ad litem appointed for him.&#160; Those applications came on for hearing before Hedley J on 16th September 2004.&#160; Leave was granted to the Father to remove Q permanently from the jurisdiction and an undertaking by the Father to return Q when ordered to do so was given and recorded.&#160; In addition a contact order was made.&#160; The order provided for supervised visiting contact and weekly telephone contact, with "the matter", by which I assume, is meant the issue of contact, to be listed before DJ Brasse in January 2005, unless by then and pursuant to the leave given, Q had left the jurisdiction.&#160; Although Mr Devereux argued strongly to the contrary, in my judgment, and read as a whole, the contact provisions were designed to regulate contact up until Q left the country.&#160; Mr Devereux submitted it would be extraordinary for there to have been no order dealing with contact post relocation.&#160; As a matter of practice I disagree.&#160; If there is no dispute about contact there may be no need to attempt to define it.&#160; In this case the Father has never sought to say there should not be contact between Q and the Mother, albeit that he has been concerned that it should be properly supervised given the findings against the Mother.&#160; At the end of the day the simple but clear conclusion I have come to is that the order of 16th September 2004 did not purport to define or regulate contact after Q had relocated to Pakistan.&#160; In December 2004 the Father and Q moved to Pakistan and hence there was no need for a further hearing before DJ Brasse. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Devereux submitted that the residence order of 22nd May 2003 remained a "subsisting" order, and (i) that the Mother's application of 14th April 2008 should be understood as an application to vary that order by seeking to attach conditions to it, or (ii) the mother should be given permission to formally amend that application to attach conditions to the residence order requiring Q to be brought back to this country and thereafter for an assessment to be carried out to determine how contact could progress.&#160; Although there is an oblique reference in the Mother's second application to "possible residency for Q's long term future via unsupervised contact assessment", neither application seeks a variation of the residence order made on 22nd May 2004.&#160; Both are concerned with contact.&#160; Further, to speak of the residence order of May 2003 as a "subsisting" order when thereafter the Father was given leave permanently to remove Q from the jurisdiction and in fact did so would be wholly artificial.&#160; In the vast majority of relocation cases the party obtaining leave has, either when the leave was granted or at a prior date, obtained a residence order.&#160; In my judgment it would be wrong to consider residence orders in such cases as continuing to subsist after settled relocation has taken place, or as in some way "surviving" the relocation in order for the courts of this country to retain some form of residual jurisdiction.&#160; That is particularly so in the circumstances of this case where the reality is that Q has been settled in Pakistan for over four years and does not reside with either parent.&#160; For the same reason it would, in my judgment, be wholly inappropriate to grant the Mother permission to amend her application so as to seek to attach conditions to the original order.</p>
