I heard this case over 10 days and considered both findings of fact and welfare. The background to this case is that the parents&#8217; first child, ST, died at the age of 12 weeks, from what all parties accept were non- accidental injuries. The Father was charged with manslaughter, and acquitted at the Old Bailey in November 2018. </p>

He was represented by Powell and Co solicitors, who attended earlier interlocutory hearings at which the Father was represented by leading counsel. The Father has attended none of the hearings in this matter. He has failed to comply with directions to file a response to the LA&#8217;s Schedule of Findings and to file a statement. It was not possible to effect personal service on the Father, but I directed that he should be served via a pharmacy where he was known to attend each week. I also directed that a letter be written to him explaining that if he did not attend then the hearing could go ahead without him, and that the court may make adverse findings in his absence. The Father signed for the letter and contacted his solicitor on 3 June 2019 saying that he would not be engaging in the proceedings.  </p>

ST was born in August 2016 at 37 weeks gestation. She had a normal birth with no history of birth related injury and no neonatal concerns. She was discharged from hospital into the care of the Mother. </p>

HT&#8217;s mother, JS, gave statements to the police, which I have read. I attempted to have JS arrested in order that she be brought to this court to give evidence, but the police failed to arrest her, and I discharged the warrant on the last day of the hearing. As will become apparent JS had important information about events around the time of ST&#8217;s death. At the time of ST&#8217;s death JS was living very close to the Mother, and the Father was also spending a considerable amount of time with her and HT. He spent the night before the death with JS.  </p>

There were a series of text messages and phone calls from the Mother to the Father asking him to come and help with ST. At appendix one I have set out an agreed detailed chronology of events on 3 and 4 November 2018. I will summarise in the judgment only the key events. At 22:18pm the Mother sent the Father a message saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;TG Baby pls don&#8217;t fall asleep there I&#8217;m so tired plz baby??xxx&#8221; </span></p>

It is apparent from the content of the messages that she was becoming increasingly desperate for the Father to come to her address and assist her in caring for ST. the Mother&#8217;s oral evidence was that she only sent these messages to &#8220;guilt trip&#8221; the Father into coming round, and that ST was a baby who rarely cried, and had not been awake during the night of 3/4 November.  </p>

We should no more expect every case which a local authority brings to court to result in an order than we should expect every prosecution brought by the CPS to result in a conviction. The standard of proof may be different, but the roles of the social workers and the prosecutors are similar. They bring to court those cases where there is a good case to answer. It is for the court to decide whether the case is made out. If every child protection case were to result in an order, it would mean either that local authorities were not bringing enough cases to court or that the courts were not subjecting those cases to a sufficiently rigorous scrutiny.&#8221; </span></p>

If the harm has been caused by someone outside the home or family, for example at school or in hospital or by a stranger, then it is not attributable to the parental care unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it.  Sometimes it will be desirable for the same reasons as those given above.  It will help to identify the real risks to the child and the steps needed to protect him.  It will help the professionals in working with the family.  And it will be of value to the child in the long run. </span></p>

This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar too high.  It suggested that parents or other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt.  If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved.  When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.&#8221; </span></p>

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only &#8216;unknown&#8217; is which of a number of persons is responsible.  So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way.  Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible.  In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not.  There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of &#8216;real possibility&#8217;, still less on the basis of suspicion.  There is no such thing as a pool of one.&#8221; </span></p>

Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof.  Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did.  No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown.  This is why it is always misleading to refer to &#8216;exclusion from the pool&#8217;:  see Re S-B at [43].

The latter is concerned with the culpability and, if guilty, punishment for a specific criminal offence, whereas the former involves the determination facts, across a wide canvas, relating to past events in order to evaluate which of a range of options for the future care of a child best meets the requirements of his or her welfare. Similarly, where facts fall to be determined in the course of ordinary civil litigation, the purpose of the exercise, which is to establish liability, operates in a wholly different context to a fact-finding process in family proceedings. Reduced to simple basics, in both criminal and civil proceedings the ultimate outcome of the litigation will be binary, either 'guilty' or 'not guilty', or 'liable' or 'not liable'. In family proceedings, the outcome of a fact-finding hearing will normally be a narrative account of what the court has determined (on the balance of probabilities) has happened in the lives of a number of people and, often, over a significant period of time. The primary purpose of the family process is to determine, as best that may be done, what has gone on in the past, so that that knowledge may inform the ultimate welfare evaluation where the court will choose which option is best for a child with the court's eyes open to such risks as the factual determination may have established.&#8221; </span></p>

Parents can be compelled to give evidence in care proceedings; they have no right to refuse to do so; they cannot even refuse to answer questions which might incriminate them. The position is no different in a split hearing from that in any other hearing in care proceedings. If the parents themselves do not wish to give evidence on their own behalf there is, of course, no property in a witness. They can nevertheless be called by another party if it is thought fit to do so.&#8221; </span></p>

The changes are typical of those due to impact or movement trauma (shaking) or a combination of the two.  There were also a number of posterior rib fractures typical of squeezing of the chest. He said that overall this is the sort of pattern of injuries seen when an infant is forcibly shaken, squeezed and thrown onto soft furnishings.  He said in oral evidence that these were towards the higher end of a spectrum of this type of injury. He said that the severity of the findings would have led to an immediate and noticeable change in condition following this with unconsciousness being likely immediately or very shortly thereafter.  </p>

This is because the sucking and swallowing that is needed to feed would not have been possible for ST after the injuries had occurred. The evidence was that ST had had a recent milk feed, because once she got to hospital they had to aspirate milk from her stomach. This is important because it very strongly indicates that she was fed before she incurred the fatal injuries.  </p>

The known chronology is that when ST got to the Hospital her heart was still capable of being restarted by CPR. This is an indication that the cardiac arrest did not happen more than 30 minutes to one hour earlier.  Dr Cary&#8217;s evidence slightly varied between the criminal trial and before me, because before the criminal court he suggested that the maximum time period between cardiac arrest and the heart restarting would be 30 minutes, whereas before me he said 45-60 minutes. This points to one hour being close to 15.06 being approximately the latest time that the cardiac arrest occurred (being one hour before 16.06 when her heart was restarted).  </p>

The older fractures were exclusively on the left and had occurred several weeks prior to her death. The evidence was that it was not certain whether the earlier fractures had all occurred at one time.  There was extensive soft tissue haemorrhage including to nerves and nerve ganglia, indicating traumatic injury to the neck, i.e. by shaking with whiplash injury.  </p>

This was evidence of a traumatic injury shortly before her death. However, there was also evidence iron pigment deposition in her eyes which indicated an earlier traumatic event. It was not possible to identify when this occurred. Dr McCarthy said that there could be pigmentation from trauma at birth, but the fact that the pigmentation was only found in the left eye would make it most unusual that this had been a birth injury. The birth notes show that ST&#8217;s birth had involved vacuum extraction, but Dr McCarthy was clear that he thought it was very unlikely that the earlier pigmentation was as a result of birth trauma.  </p>

He said she did not wake up, but she did take some milk. He had said in his police interview that the baby was sucking and had taken about five ounces of milk.

He accepted in cross examination that he did not hear any shouting from the Mother. The implication of this piece of evidence is that there was at least an implicit suggestion that the Mother might have harmed ST at this point.  Shortly after that the Mother went out.  </p>

Although she did not expressly say that she thought the girl had injured ST, this appeared to be the implication of what she was saying.  But there is not the slightest suggestion that ST was injured at this time.

He remained in hospital for 9 days and has been living in foster care since. Happily, he now seems content and well settled and is thriving. Whatever the future may hold, at the moment he shows no health concerns. The Mother only attended for ante-natal care in the third trimester.

Despite everything that has happened she remained loyal to the Father, and I do not think that she was telling me the truth on matters relating to him, such as the frequency with which he shouted at her, or the consequences of his drug use. She was in my view still seeking to minimise anything which indicated that he had harmed ST. Her acceptance that he killed ST was more on the basis that if she did not harm ST he must have done so, than any emotional acceptance of the gravity of what had happened.  It was also notable that there were some parts of her evidence, such as reference to the story of the friend&#8217;s daughter touching ST, or her anger at the social worker not returning her calls, when she seemed to have clear recall and focus, whereas there were other parts where she was notably vague. Two examples of the latter, are when she last saw the Father, and her drug taking.  </p>

I fully take into account the fact that he was acquitted of manslaughter after a criminal trial and cross examination, and that I have not heard oral evidence. However, the standard of proof required to be met by the LA is different from that in the criminal trial; I have read the transcript of his evidence; and I have also had the advantage of hearing the Mother&#8217;s evidence, and it is therefore easier for me to determine the likely sequence of events.  I take into account the approach in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (Children)</span> that my task is to reach a narrative account of what happened, rather than ascribe criminal responsibility. I am also conscious that for whatever reasons the evidence as to the Father asking the Mother to buy heroin for him when ST was in hospital was not before the jury.

Dr Cary explained that with injuries of this severity there would have been a limited time, up to perhaps an hour, when ST&#8217;s heart could be restarted. This occurred at 16.06 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Therefore, although not necessarily impossible, the medical evidence points to the injuries occurring after 14.29. The timing also fits with the phone call to JS, which was at 15.09. If, as I consider likely, the Father injured the baby a bit before 15.06, and it was then obvious that she was badly hurt, the timing suggests that the Father called JS to seek help/work out what to do.  </p>

Ms H was a wholly believable witness, albeit she was timing her actions by her normal routine so she might have been out by a few minutes. She had no interest or axe to grind in relation to either parent. She gave her statement to police before she knew about ST&#8217;s death, or any allegations against the Father. She has stuck to that story through two sets of cross examination. She was careful in her evidence, explaining why she was so clear and when she wasn&#8217;t sure of an answer being careful to say that she did not know. I fully accept her evidence. I have taken account of the police evidence that when they conducted the test in the two flats, the officer in Ms H&#8217;s flat could only hear the music when it was turned up so loud as to be painful in the Mother&#8217;s flat. However, Ms H said she could hear shouting on more than one occasion from the adjoining flat.

One possibility, though it is not possible to be sure, is that he did not have a fix on the morning of 4 November perhaps because he was rushing to get to the Mother&#8217;s house, and that is why he was so desperate for the Mother to get him heroin in the texts from 16.30 onwards. But in any event, it is quite apparent from the text at 12.54 that he had woken late and was very stressed when he went to see the Mother and ST.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0in">The fact that the Father was stressed is further shown by the text of 14.57 complaining that the Mother was still in Woolwich, when she had only been gone for 27 minutes. It may be that the Father felt he was being placed under pressure by the two mothers of his very young babies, and the &#8220;juggling&#8221; between the two was too much for him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0in">Finally, there is the issue of the missing 10-12 minutes. The Father left the flat at 15.10, as shown by the CCTV. At 15.12 he spoke to GW with no mention of an unwell baby. At 15.14 he left the block, but only arrived at the surgery at 15.29. If he genuinely suddenly found that the baby had become seriously unwell then the obvious thing to do was simply take it quickly round the corner to the surgery. The failure to do this requires some explanation. The only explanation given was that JS had gone home to get money for petrol, but (a) the surgery was only 400m away so petrol would have been unnecessary; and (b) there was no evidence they did buy petrol. It seems more likely that they spent 10 minutes deciding what to say or do in the light of ST&#8217;s condition.  </p>

It is not clear whether these injuries all occurred on one occasion, or more than one.  There is no evidence that this could have been done by anyone other than one of the parents. Both deny it, but both plainly had the opportunity.  </p>

However, there is no evidence that she has ever been violent to anyone. Of course, many people can crack with the strain of a very young baby who is crying, particularly with sleep deprivation. But I believed her oral evidence that she would never have harmed ST, and also the degree to which she loved both babies. Applying the approach of Peter Jackson LJ, on the balance of probabilities I find the Father inflicted the earlier injuries, and it would be straining the evidence to place the Mother in the pool of perpetrators for these injuries. </p>

I can place no reliance on her ability to protect DAS from the Father, or that she will not continue to have contact with him. She seemed completely unrealistic either about her ability to look after a small baby, or the risk that the Father posed to such a baby.  In those circumstances it is very strongly not in DAS&#8217;s best interests to be returned to his mother&#8217;s care. </p>

He needs a stable and loving long-term home, that can provide him with a high quality of care. It is not merely that the Mother cannot do this at the moment, but also there are no indicators that she is on the road to being able to do so in the foreseeable future.
