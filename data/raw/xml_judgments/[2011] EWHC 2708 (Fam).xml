A spouse who is a beneficiary may have an indefeasible life interest, a fixed interest in remainder or he may be a discretionary object of capital and/or income.  In the former instance, the spouse has identifiable property which belongs to him, is capable of being valued and included in the pool of assets to be divided, without further consideration of the position of the trustees. In the latter instance the spouse has no more than the right to be considered by the trustees in the exercise of their discretion.</p>

The Court of Appeal varied the settlement by extinguishing the husband&#8217;s interest in the house as if he were then dead and the wife had survived him, but ordered that she should forego any claim to future maintenance, lump sum, or secured provision.

If the trust is a nuptial settlement then notwithstanding that the assets are legally held by third parties as trustees, and that yet further third parties may be beneficiaries along with the husband, the trust assets fall within the court&#8217;s dispositive powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s24(1)</ref>(c) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

The trustees are entitled to be heard (FPR 2010 r9.13(1) and (4)) and any children beneficiaries must be represented (r9.11). The variation powers extend to making outright provision to the applicant, and may even be exercised where the trust is offshore, although, following well-established principle, the court will be unlikely to make a variation order where both the trust and its assets are overseas unless it is satisfied that the order would be implemented by the court exercising effective control over the trust (<span style="font-style:italic">Goff v Goff </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1934] P 107" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1934">[1934] P 107</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlin v Hamlin</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] Fam 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] Fam 11</ref>).

As Miss&#160;Parker put it, no limit on the extent of the power to vary or on the form any variation can take is specified, so it is within the court&#8217;s powers to vary (at one end of the scale) by wholly excluding a beneficiary from a settlement, to (at the other end) transferring some asset or other to a non-beneficiary free from all trusts.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Charman</span> the Dragon Trust&#8217;s beneficiaries from its inception in 1987 were the spouses, their now adult children, the future children of the husband, his remoter issue, such charitable objects or purposes as the Trustee may determine from time to time, and, finally, such other person(s) or class of persons added under the relevant power to the class of beneficiaries.  Accordingly, the class of beneficiaries was not closed. The Trust Period lasted until 2067. There was no protector of the Trust, albeit Mr Charman retained a fiduciary power (subject to the usual strict duties) to remove and appoint new or additional trustees. In 2004 the trustee resolved to appoint the income of the trust for life to Mr Charman. His wife was &#8220;relatively fortunate&#8221; in that she could make her claim against the non-trust assets (see the discussion about off-setting below). It was argued on behalf of Mr Charman that had she in fact been forced to apply for a variation of settlement she would not have been awarded more than a life interest in part of Dragon, so as not to disturb the rights of other beneficiaries, and that therefore her sharing right to the assets of the trust should be limited to the capitalised value of such a life interest.

As we have seen, the enforcement of a foreign judgment is based upon the foreign court having had jurisdiction (for the purposes of enforcement of that judgment overseas) over the person against whom enforcement is now sought in Jersey. The position in relation to an order varying a trust is somewhat more complicated than a conventional civil action between A and B. In the latter case, it is merely a question of whether A and/or B has submitted to the jurisdiction of the English court. In the case of the variation or alteration of a trust, those affected are likely to include all the beneficiaries as well as the trustee. The effect of any variation order is not usually confined to the husband and wife. Other beneficiaries may be affected. Furthermore the trustee has legal title to the trust fund and is responsible for holding the trust assets in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. Quite apart from other beneficiaries, a trustee is clearly someone who will be substantially affected by an order of an English court altering a trust. Accordingly, unless a trustee of a Jersey trust has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Family Division, it is very hard to see how any judgment of the Family Division varying or altering a Jersey trust can be enforced in Jersey under the ordinary rules of private international law because the Family Division will not have had jurisdiction over the trustee for the purposes of the enforcement of foreign judgments in accordance with r&#160;36 of Dicey.</p>

In this way the majority, sometimes the overwhelming majority, of the non-trust assets go to the claimant, leaving the respondent to collect the benefit from the trustees which the court has judged he is likely to receive. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Charman </span>87%<span style="font-style:italic"/>of the non-trust assets were awarded to the wife (&#163;48m). In <span style="font-style:italic">SR v CR</span> 80% of the non-trust assets were awarded (&#163;6.25m). In <span style="font-style:italic">Whaley </span>the court awarded 94% of the non-trust assets to the wife (&#163;3m). In this scenario the court is not judiciously encouraging the trustees to make money available to the claimant; rather, it is by its award indirectly encouraging it to provide for its own beneficiary. But it can make an effective award.</p>

In anticipation of the floatation H and his two fellow shareholders made arrangements to mitigate tax on future capital gains which may accrue to their respective shares of the proceeds. In H&#8217;s case, being non-domiciled, the arrangements were perhaps less necessary than for his partners, as (subject to any change in the law) he would have been able to have put his money offshore and suffer no tax on the gains save insofar as they were remitted onshore. The arrangement involved the creation on 27 February 1994 of two Jersey trusts (No.1 and No.2) and a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands &#8211; Giloch Investments Ltd, later renamed Giloch Ltd (Giloch).

DEF&#8217;s shares were then floated in about 1996 on the Stock Exchange with a placing of 25% of its share capital. Giloch provided about 3.2m shares towards that 25% placement; H did not provide any personally. The placed shares sold well and large sums, around &#163;3m, flowed into Giloch.  The shares in DEF of which H was a direct owner outside the trusts were subsequently lost when DEF later went into insolvent liquidation.</p>

I knew that by settling the assets on trust I could not direct how the trustees operated the trusts and that I was only able to make requests for financial benefit but that such requests could be refused by the trustees. Ultimately it was their decision as to how to manage the trusts. I was aware that assets were split between the Trusts. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 June 2009 H&#8217;s financial adviser Mr M wrote to W setting out H&#8217;s then proposal that W should receive a home costing &#163;400,000 and an annual income of &#163;36,000. In that letter Mr M wrote:</p>

		<p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">What I am quite certain of is that if your demands substantially exceeded what he is prepared to provide you with, in order to obtain those demands you will almost certainly have to file for a divorce. In the event of such course of action, it would become very protracted, taking maybe several years and very costly for both of you, with no guarantee as to the outcome. I am aware that according to the Norwich Union the average cost of divorce is in the region of &#163;28,000. As the Trust would be involved the costs would probably be greater than this. I also understand that the Trust is governed by Jersey Law not English Law which further complicates the issue. In the event of filing for a divorce, [H] would do all in his power to draw the proceedings out for the longest period of time.  </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his evidence H asserted that he knew nothing of this; it was Mr M acting off his own bat. I reject that evidence entirely. Even allowing for a fierce determination to win this sort of threatening behaviour is unacceptable. The fact is that this case has been drawn out at significant costs to final trial. H&#8217;s costs are &#163;184,231; W&#8217;s &#163;123,614. Although costs will be dealt with separately it is distinctly possible that H&#8217;s conduct will have adverse costs consequences for him.</p>

If the Trustees of the No.1 Trust cause a directors&#8217; meeting of Giloch to be held which then votes all the assets of Giloch as a dividend in specie then all the value goes to No.1. If the trustees of No.2 Trust (who are the same as for No.1) cause a general meeting to be held and vote to wind up Giloch then all the value goes to No.2.

Nor does it include, contrary to Mr Castle&#8217;s arguments, the tax that H would pay were he to receive all the assets and remit them here. This is completely unreal. The whole point of the structure is to avoid paying tax, and H has never remitted any offshore income. Mr Castle argues that not to include it would result in an unfair imbalance as W would be able to remit onshore and would therefore have more freedom with, or at least fewer strings attached to, her money. But in order to have the benefit of the money here H does not need to remit income. Consider Green Farm. This was acquired by the No.1 Trust borrowing from Giloch and then buying the property here. The same issue arose in an unreported case in which I appeared in 2005. There Baron J stated:</p>

		<p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">In this case the Husband told me that he intended to repatriate funds to the UK and is already considering the winding up of the Jersey trust. Mr Mostyn QC was sceptical and pointed out that this had not been suggested prior to this trial. I do not regard this issue as important to my decision. I remind myself that, although the efficacy of the Jersey trust is much less than it was in 1986, whilst the funds are offshore investment income can be obtained on the gross sum. The Husband has been able remit funds through the mechanism of a loan at a small annual cost in tax terms. This will continue to be an option until the tax law changes and I am bound to apply the law as it is at present. I take into account that the Inland Revenue are clearly concerned to ensure that as much tax as possible is collected. Thus, whilst loans are currently efficacious, this mechanism may not always be available. I consider it unlikely that the Husband will pay &#163;1.6 million in tax if it can be avoided  legitimately. Accordingly, I regard the assets (per the schedule) as some &#163;10.7 million but I emphasise that the award which I make in this case would be unchanged if the assets were reduced by a further &#163;1.6 million.</p>

Rather, they would likely drawdown on the pension within the prescribed GAD limits.
