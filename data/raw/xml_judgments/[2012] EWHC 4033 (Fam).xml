The father&#8217;s case is that he was not consenting to this removal and had expected AK to remain in Latvia, possibly with a cousin of the mother&#8217;s in Riga.  He says he was tricked into handing over the passport by the mother saying that he should trust her.  In any event, it is a fact that he did not take any action following the removal of AK to England.  The father also returned to England and continued working in Wisbech.

Her case is that she had been told that she was entitled to do so at any stage and that, if she did so, she was entitled to take over the care of the children from the aunt, notwithstanding the October 2011 court order.  It appears that she is right in this regard as she enlisted the help of the S Orphans&#8217; Court and the police.  They attended at the aunt&#8217;s address and the mother removed SK the same day.  Before doing so, the aunt telephoned the father in England.  He told her he did not agree to the mother taking the children.  This was conveyed by the aunt to the manager of the Orphans&#8217; Court, but the manager of the Orphans&#8217; Court allowed the mother to take SK.  The aunt said that she did not hand over SK&#8217;s passport.  She said the mother did not ask for it, but she would not have handed it over in any event.  She says the mother told her that she would return SK the following day after they had been to see the maternal grandmother.  The mother did not do so.  </span></p>

This cannot be right.  Moreover, there is a simple solution.  If a parent withdraws consent capriciously the court in the country of habitual residence can give the other parent permission to leave.  I do, however, accept that it can become too late to withdraw consent as was suggested by Wilson LJ in paragraph 56 of his judgment.  My conclusion is that it is too late once the parent who was given permission has begun to depart - in other words, the consent must be withdrawn prior to the other parent leaving. </span></p>

From that point, I am satisfied that the children&#8217;s habitual residence moved from Latvia to England, even though I am equally satisfied that the intention was not for the children to remain here forever.  I have formed the clear conclusion that the parents intended to educate the children in Latvia.  They thus bought a flat in K for the family to live in and they registered the children in the local kindergarten.  I cannot see any other reason why they would register the children there rather than in S or even Riga.  I accept that the mother was not happy about the flat they purchased or the area in which it was situated, but, in March 2011, she was prepared to go along with the plan even though her dissatisfaction may have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship.  </span></p>

By September the relationship was in its death throes. The parents realised that they could not remain as a family unit in this country.  The father wanted a reconciliation.

The mother may, by then, have decided that she wanted to remain here, but I am satisfied that she did not communicate that to the father at that stage.  The children were coming up to the time when they had to go to school. The parents recognised that they were going to have to separate, if only on a trial basis.  They had to come to arrangements as to what would happen to their children.  They decided to return them to Latvia initially to live with the aunt.  I entirely recognise the distinction between residence and habitual residence.

This can only have been habitual residence there.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I now turn to the issue of consent.  In this regard it is possible for me to come to very clear conclusions.  The manuscript agreement was a clear and unequivocal agreement, albeit that it was not written in legal language.  The father suggested that it was obtained by improper pressure exerted by the mother upon him, but I reject that.  It may be that the mother was emotional at the time, but the father knew what he was agreeing to.  He perceived the arrangement to have some advantages for him.  He agreed freely and stuck to his agreement for six months.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">He next says that he thought the agreement had no legal force.  Such an argument is never attractive.  He has not produced any evidence to the effect that it had no legal force in Latvia.  He took advantage of the part that suited him, namely SK remaining in Latvia.  Indeed, he permitted AK to leave pursuant to the agreement, thereby recognising it had force.  I accept that the agreement would not have been attractive to a family lawyer, at least in this jurisdiction.  It split the girls.  It does appear as though they were used as something of bargaining chips rather than by considering their best interests.  Looking at it rationally, I cannot see that either party would think that it was in their best interests to split these girls up but that is what they agreed.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I reject as absurd the father&#8217;s suggestion that the agreement provided only for the mother to keep AK in Latvia, either with her cousin in Riga or with the mother there herself.  The father knew the mother was coming back to England.  Indeed, if she had not been returning, there would have been no reason why she could not have residence of both children in Latvia.  Equally, if AK was not going with her, there was no reason to move AK from the aunt&#8217;s.  The father gave the mother AK&#8217;s passport and her belongings.  I find he gave her the passport as he knew it was needed for her to return here.  Moreover, there would be absolutely no reason why the agreement would say that, if he failed to purchase the accommodation in Latvia within six months, he would let SK go to live in England, if the mother was living in Latvia with AK.  Finally, the father took no action when the mother did indeed bring AK here.  It follows that I am quite satisfied that the mother has made out her defence of consent so far as it relates to AK.  </span></p>

It is right that the father had not complied with the terms of the agreement.  I find, however, that the mother knew very well that the father had withdrawn his consent by the time of the actual removal.  The mother&#8217;s behaviour was, I find, clandestine.  For example, she did not tell the father she was travelling to Latvia.  She heard the aunt telling the court official that the father did not consent to the removal.  I also find that she spoke to the father on the telephone and he made it quite clear that she did not have his consent to leave.  Unlike with AK, she did not get SK&#8217;s passport.  Indeed, she did not even ask as she was well aware that it would not be given to her.  She knew the father immediately travelled to Latvia.  The only possible reason for this was because he objected to the removal.  When he arrived he asked to see the children.  She denies this, but I find that this would be only natural.  I find that she agreed to meet him at the Clock Tower.  Not only did she not go to the meeting, she used that opportunity to leave the country knowing that he would not be at the airport to stop her.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I do accept that the Orphans&#8217; Court official and the police were present when she removed SK from the aunt&#8217;s property.  It seems clear from this that this official took the view that the mother could withdraw the Power of Attorney at any time, but that does not mean that she had permission from the court to take SK out of the country.  She had been told by the court in January that she needed the father&#8217;s agreement or a court order.  It is accepted that the father has rights of custody and, therefore, either he had to provide his consent or she had to get a court order.  She did not get a court order.  Her only argument is to say that the father&#8217;s consent remained in place, but I have found that it did not and that she knew that.  Moreover, the father applied for custody while she was still in Latvia and he applied to the Central Authority pursuant to the Convention immediately after she had gone.  It follows the removal of SK was a wrongful removal.</span></p>

Second, the father asked me to exercise my discretion to return AK relying both on the spirit of the Convention and the undesirability of splitting the children.  Finally, the mother asks me to stay my return of them for her to apply, in Latvia, for interim permission to remain in this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I can deal with all three issues very briefly.  First, I am satisfied that there is no merit in the mother&#8217;s very late Article 13(b) defence.  Mr. Khan (for the father) says that it is entirely wrong for me even to consider it at such a late stage without pleadings, evidence or consideration of the issue during the trial.  He may well be right, but I can deal with the matter simply by saying that a defence cannot be made out in a case where the mother herself agreed to the children being split.  She did this when she signed the agreement which might have led to SK remaining apart from AK permanently, if the father had purchased a property and relocated in time.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Equally, I am satisfied that I should not accede to the father&#8217;s discretion argument either.  I have carefully considered paragraph 45 of the judgment of Baroness Hale in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2007/55" uk:canonical="[2007] UKHL 55" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKHL 55</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 251" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 251</ref>, but I take the view that it is not right to exercise my discretion in a case where the father clearly consented and did nothing for six months until after his other child was wrongfully removed.  The fact that the parents agreed to separate the children is equally relevant here, on this occasion against the father rather than in his favour.  I take into account the fact that the mother made it very clear that, if I order the return of SK, she would return to Latvia and take AK with her.  If she was to renege on that open concession, it is no doubt something that the Latvian Court will take into account in the proceedings for custody that are properly constituted in that jurisdiction.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Finally, the mother asks me to stay my order relating to SK so that she can apply in Latvia.  I was referred to the decision of Ryder J in R v. K [2009] EWHC 132, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1456" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1456</ref>.  The Judge in that case gave a limited amount of time for the mother to settle her affairs in this jurisdiction prior to the return, but he said that the circumstances of the case did not make it appropriate for the court to consider an &#8220;exceptional&#8221; course of delaying the execution of the order and return to abide the decision of the foreign court.  He said that to do so would be to &#8220;open the floodgates to applications for delayed return orders in almost every primary carer case&#8221;.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I agree.  For the mother, Mr. Hames&#8217; only real point in this regard is to suggest that the presence of the officials of the Orphans&#8217; Court when the mother removed SK from the aunt&#8217;s home indicates that the court may be sympathetic to an application that she may make to remove SK from Latvia permanently.  I do not know whether that is a justified assumption or not.  I am not completely clear that the Orphans&#8217; Court is the correct court to deal with such an application, in any event.  I will, however, give the mother some time to organise her return.  If, during that period, she is able to get interim permission to remain here from the court in Latvia then my order will not be executed.  But this is matter for her and her legal advisors.  </span></p>
