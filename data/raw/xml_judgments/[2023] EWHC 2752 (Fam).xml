	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In this case the Father seeks an order pursuant to the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">the 1985 Act</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;), which brought the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction which was signed at The Hague on 25th October 1980 (&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">the Convention</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;) into effect as part of UK domestic law, that his daughter, A should return to Spain.  Unusually, and for reasons I will explain below, the Respondent to the application is not A&#8217;s mother but her grandmother, G, defends the case on the basis that (a) A is habitually resident in the UK and thus there is no power to make a return order under the Convention and/or (b) if A is habitually resident in Spain then A objects to the court making a return order and submits the court should give effect to those objections.  G&#8217;s primary case is that A&#8217;s future place of residence should be determined in Family Court proceedings that she has commenced in the UK and that the Court should make an order in those proceedings that A should live with her in London.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Lying behind these legal issues is a very sad set of facts arising out of the death of A&#8217;s Mother from cancer in February 2023.  Whatever I say in this judgment, I cannot begin to imagine the stresses and pressures that all family members must have endured.  Although there is a child at the heart of this case, the evidence shows that every member of A&#8217;s extended family has been deeply affected by the death of A&#8217;s Mother and all are still grieving for a young woman who was taken from them far too early in her life.  Different people process and respond to grief in different ways, and I hope that, in making findings in this case, I have been sufficiently sensitive to the raw feelings of everyone in this family arising from the Mother&#8217;s sad death.  Nonetheless, amidst their grief, there is a dispute as to whether A should live with her Father or her grandmother and a decision on that matter has to be made by either by this court or by the Family Court. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I am confident that A is in the fortunate position where both G and the Father love A and are devoted to her, and both have the capacity to provide her with a loving and nurturing environment in which to develop into her teenage years.  However, A can only be primarily based in one country and, family mediation having failed, a decision has to be made by this court, if it is permitted to do so, or by the Family Court.  For the reasons set out below I have concluded that a decision can be made by this court and that A should live with her Father in Spain.  I will therefore make a return order that A should return to live in Spain.  I will invite the parties to agree the terms of such an order which provides a timetable for an orderly return for A to move back to Spain as soon as reasonably practicable and to agree undertakings which can then become enforceable in Spain so as to ensure that A will be able to spend extended periods of time in England with her grandmother and the wider members of her maternal family during the school holidays.</span></p>

CS&#8217;s Mother, who is the Respondent to these proceedings, is G. The Mother and Father both worked for the Spanish navy, and they met in about 2008.  They have never married and A is their only child.  The Mother and Father ceased to be a couple in about 2012 but the Father says in his witness statement that they &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">maintained a very positive friendship following our separation</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;.  I have had regard to a considerable amount of documentary material as part of this case and have heard the Father giving evidence.  I am satisfied that this is an accurate statement of the position and that, although they ceased to be a couple, the Mother and the Father appear to have remained on excellent terms throughout and worked co-operatively together to co-parent A.</span></p>

G explains that the Mother came to live with G in City A for the last couple of months of her pregnancy and that A was born on 10 March 2011 in City A. She says that the Father stayed with them for a few weeks after A was born but shortly returned to City B for work. G looked after the Mother and A, as she explained that it is a tradition from their  country of origin, for the grandmother to care for her daughter and the newborn baby for the first 45 days to allow the new Mother to recover after giving birth.  G continued to care for A for the first year as the Mother juggled her work and family responsibilities but then A moved to live with the Mother on a full-time basis.  </span></p>

In 2012, G and her husband decided to move to the UK with her two younger daughters because the UK presented better opportunities for G&#8217;s husband to be able to work. G has lived in the UK since 2012 but, as was clear when she gave evidence, continues to speak exclusively in Spanish despite having lived in the UK for the past 11 years.</span></p>

There is no evidence of any tension between the Father and the Mother arising out of these new relationships and, on the contrary, everyone appears to have worked hard to make these relationships work for everyone concerned and in particular for A.  There is ample evidence which I accept that that D is an important person in A&#8217;s life.  Whilst no one can take the place of her Mother, I accept that D has developed an important relationship with A and combined with G, is able to provide strong and loving support to A.</span></p>

The Father gave his consent for A to start school in England in September 2020, and the Mother was able to move to join A in about October 2020.  The agreement was that A should stay in England for one year. At this time, A was 9 years old.  G claimed in her witness statement that the arrangement was for A to spend 2 years in England, but she accepted when giving evidence that this was not correct and that the original agreement was for A to spend a single year in England.</span></p>

Unfortunately, the Mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer on 28 February 2021.  The Mother was told that she had developed a rare type of ovarian cancer and there were limited treatments. Initially, the doctors did not recommend surgery due to the risk posed given the advanced stage of the cancer and the Mother began treatment with Chemotherapy in April 2021. After some months of Chemotherapy, there seemed to be some progress and surgery was recommended which took place on 6 October 2021. The surgery involved removing the Mother&#8217;s uterus and part of her intestines. The operation appeared initially to be a success but unfortunately about 6 months later the Mother found out the cancer had come back and was more aggressive.  Thus, by the spring of 2022 the Mother knew that she was only getting palliative care.</span></p>

G explained that she left her job in August 2022 so that she could provide care for her daughter and A.  The Mother had extended stays in hospital and sadly died on 6 February 2023.  </span></p>

The Mother was in receipt of care and support from the NHS, and it was agreed that she should stay in England to access treatment and that A should stay with her.  Thus, even though A only came to England to attend school for a single year, she was still attending an English school when the Mother died in February 2023, albeit by this time she had finished primary school and started secondary school.  Throughout that time A was living in G&#8217;s house with G, her Mother, and her two aunts who, I understand, are nearer to her in age and thus must have been more akin to older sisters.</span></p>

However, it had been arranged that she would visit the United States of America with her two aunts for a holiday and A was very excited about this holiday.  The two aunts were flying to the USA from London and so A travelled back to London on 13 July 2023 and, after she had had a farewell party with her London friends on 15 July, she left London to go to the USA.  Although the Father pressed for her to be booked on a return back directly from the USA to Spain, G told him that the prices of flights were much higher to travel to Spain than to England, and so A was booked on a flight to London from the USA on 25 August and the Father booked her a flight to return to Spain on 26 August 2023.  </span></p>

The Father&#8217;s case, in summary, is that A was habitually resident in the UK until July 2023 when she ceased to be habitually resident in London because she moved to Spain.  He thus asserts that, as G does not have parental responsibility for A, it is wrongful for G to seek to retain A here.  He does not accept that there is evidence which amounts to objections by A to returning to Spain or, if the evidence demonstrates that A is objecting, he invites me to exercise my discretion to override those objections and make a return order.</span></p>

The Mother recorded a short video on her mobile phone to set out her views and sent this video to the Father.  It is a remarkable 3-minute video because it shows the Mother carefully, softly and lovingly explaining the family dynamics and why she wants A to be brought up by her Father after her death.

I don't know, our relationship is like this, like....surprising, isn't it? It's wonderful because in such a short time we have established ties but I have to recognise that this has been because you (plural) have insisted, because you (plural) have not left me on my own, you (plural) have not let me crumble at any time and that, darn it, believe me, no matter how cold or no matter how, you know, I don&#180;t know, you are, you have it in here (speaker is pointing to her heart) and, come on, it is the real truth, because it is not a question of moments but life has put us in this path and it has delivered it to us like this and we have faced it in this wonderful way and I am really happy to be able to count on you (plural), on your energy because you (plural) always transmit it to me and that for me is amazing and believe me, even if sometimes I may say "sugar, everyone is a pain" but no, it is really useful for me. Today I spoke with a doctor about those feelings I had but obviously, right now I cannot see a future because I need and want to live this present and live it to the most and do as much as I can because you never know, we don&#180;t know and I don&#180;t know anything. Every time I speak to medical doctors, the hope is less and less, but I don&#180;t feel like that, you know? I feel that if I fight with all my strength and pray to God with all my heart, with all the hope I have in him to allow to live long enough to do all the wonderful things I wish to do, then my life will be prolonged and if not... One day we asked: "If we leave at this time, if we leave in peace", and I think that after all I have achieved and after feeling that love and that affection, I think that I would leave really in peace because I know A is going to be in amazing hands.  Well, mum still doesn&#180;t trust B very much, to be honest, because she thinks he is a bit crazy, that he has changed a lot but obviously mum is saying all of that based on her lack of knowledge and she is saying that based on a different point of view. She has always believed that A must be brought by me, I mean, by her Mother because obviously they, your Mother and mine had to experience different things, then she thinks like that but I am really sure that A, apart from already being a great woman, she is going to continue being that with your guidance, that&#180;s is really clear&#8221;</span></p>

He was content to concede matters that were not to his advantage and struck me as honest and I am sure he is doing his best to assist the court.  In contrast, I have to say that G was a much less impressive witness.   She seemed to go out of her way to try to say negative things about the Father although there was precious little, if any, supporting evidence to back up her concerns about the Father&#8217;s conduct.  There were many times when she was asked a question and failed to answer it, instead making a statement in response which did not directly engage with the question.  Even giving full consideration for the fact that she was giving her evidence through translation and that she has recently gone through the death of her daughter, I did not get the impression that she was a witness on whom I could rely unless her evidence was backed up by other material.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">An example is that G accused the Father of putting the Mother under pressure to make videos at a time when she was vulnerable so that these could later be used in evidence.  I have watched the videos and from the Mother&#8217;s tone in the videos, it seems to me that this is plainly wrong. I accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that he was not even in the UK when that video I have set out above was made.  G also criticised the Father for discussing the arrangements for A with the Mother for the period after the Mother died and she claimed that this discussion made the Mother&#8217;s illness worse.  I do not accept that criticism.  On the contrary it seems to me far more likely that G was refusing to accept that her daughter was dying and thus did not want to hear any discussion about what would happen after the Mother&#8217;s death as this discussion upset her.  Whilst I can understand G&#8217;s reaction in a tragically difficult situation, it seems to me that the evidence shows the Mother and the Father were both sensitively and honestly facing up to the inevitability of the Mother&#8217;s death and were acting in an entirely responsible way in discussing the arrangements for their child after the Mother had died.  I am confident that the allegation that this discussion aggravated the Mother&#8217;s illness is no more than a manifestation of G&#8217;s entirely understandable difficulties in confronting the fact her daughter had a terminal illness and her hostility to the Father.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There is limited evidence that G sought to characterise the Father as absent or unreliable parent but plenty of evidence of her underlying hostility to the Father.  An example is that, in closing, Ms Gasparro for G sought to criticise the Father for going to sea during this period as opposed to asking for compassionate leave and being available to support his daughter.  The problem with that submission is that the suggestion that the Father should have sought compassionate leave was not explored in evidence and thus I have no idea whether it would have been practical or not.  It is clear from his evidence that the Father very much regretted that this mission occurred so soon after the Mother&#8217;s death, but he was not challenged on the fact that he had not had any real choice but to fulfil his naval duties and thus, in effect, was only able to speak to his daughter on the phone during the period when he was at sea.  That meant that the practical arrangements for A to move to Spain were largely left to D to organise.  I therefore do not accept G&#8217;s criticism of the Father in failing to be in London for his daughter following the death of her Mother.  However, I do accept that the burden of dealing with a grief-stricken child fell mainly on G who was, of course, also having to deal with her own grief at the death of her daughter.</span></p>

It was put to the Father in cross-examination that this was a major move for A because she was moving to a house she had never visited in a city where she had no friends.  However, on closer examination this did not prove to be wholly correct.  The Father explained, and I accept, that A spent each summer with him and D, and that she had developed a friendship group in City C  and had members of her paternal extended family in the city.  She was, of course, fluent in Spanish and had lived in Spain for the first 10 years of her life.  Whilst I accept that her friendship group in City C was not as extensive or solid as the friends she developed in London, it is not correct that she was moving to an entirely new city or a new environment.  The Father also explained that he needed to take considerable efforts to persuade A that she should return to London at the end of each holiday she spent in City C.   I accept that, whilst A may not be a child who welcomes change, this is strong evidence that A felt at home living with the Father and D.</span></p>

On the first day of the trial I gave leave to the Father to admit translations of text messages between him, D and G into evidence.  Far from showing that G was not involved in these plans, the text messages show that G was being asked to provide the family book and other details in connection with a school application.

There is a considerable dispute between the parties as to the nature of A&#8217;s stay in Spain between 8 and 13 July 2023.  G&#8217;s case is that this was a short trip to Spain without any particular significance, just as A had taken many previous trips to Spain.  In contrast, the Father&#8217;s case is that this was A moving her base from London to City C on a permanent basis and that she only left Spain a few days later for the specific purpose of going on holiday to the USA, and that she was expected to return to City C once that holiday was over.  There is a wealth of evidence in this case, some of which I have referred to above, which shows that the Father&#8217;s case on the facts is correct.

Drawing the threads of the evidence together, whilst I can understand that A may have had her own concerns about moving away from London, leaving the city where she had lived for the last 3 years and coming under direct supervision from her Father on a continuous basis for the first time, in my judgment a greater factor was that A was influenced by the fact that she was living in a house where she was aware that G did not approve of her Father, disapproved of the plan for her to move back to Spain and where G considered it would be far better if A were to continue to live and be cared for by Gin London.  A was an emotionally vulnerable girl who had recently lost her Mother and had and continues to have a deep bond with her grandmother.  In those circumstances it seems to me to be inevitable that A would have picked up on G&#8217;s disapproval of her Father becoming A&#8217;s primary carer and G&#8217;s disapproval of the plan for A to move to Spain.  Given the bonds of love and respect A feels for her grandmother, as she was living in that atmosphere, she would be bound to start asking herself if moving to Spain was what she really wanted.  The fact that A started out supporting the idea of going to live with her Father in Spain but then began to question whether this is what she wanted confirmed by the CAFCASS report.</span></p>

It does not seem necessary for me to go as far as saying that G deliberately set out to undermine the plan agreed by the Mother and the Father for A to move to Spain, but the evidence clearly shows that G deeply disapproved of A moving to Spain and I cannot believe that she wholly hid her disapproval or that she actively encouraged A to work to make the plan a success.  I thus consider that, instead of providing support to a vulnerable girl who was dealing with the death of her Mother and supporting her to move back to her home country, G&#8217;s disapproval of this plan is likely to have created a climate in which A was encouraged to doubt whether this would be best for her.  </span></p>

Secondly, he has produced a video which shows that A was overjoyed at arriving in Spain at the airport on 8 July and he says that and her approach during the days she was in Spain is completely inconsistent with her having hidden hostility to a return to Spain.  Thirdly, he says that he did not have her passport in any event.

Having heard live evidence in this case it seems to me that the truth about A&#8217;s state of mind in July 2023 is much more likely to be that her mind was wavering about where she wanted to live but that, as a 12-year-old child, she accepted that she was not in a position to make decisions for herself.  I accept that A said to her Father than she supported a move to Spain in late June and early July 2023 when she was in Spain and I accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that this reflected her state of mind at that point, because he had largely assuaged her concerns.  However, A was vulnerable child who had divided loyalties between her Father and her grandmother.  She had been living in a household since February 2023 where it must have been clear to her that there was a deep undercurrent of disapproval of the plan that she should move to Spain.  It seems far more likely to me that her divided loyalties meant that she believed different things at different times.  I think it is more likely that she did not want to disappoint or upset either her Father or her grandmother and thus said things to them which partially reflected her own views at that point but may also have partly reflected what she felt the adult wanted to hear.  Such an approach would be entirely understandable for a vulnerable child who was torn between competing adults.  </span></p>

Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am confident that this did not happen and that A&#8217;s concerns about the move arose mainly out of the atmosphere of opposition to the plan in which she was living in G&#8217;s house.</span></p>

It seems to me far more likely that, when she moved to Spain on 8 July 2023, she realised that she was not the ultimate decision maker about where she would live and, maybe with some measure of trepidation because of the new environment in which she would be living, accepted that City Cwas where she would be living going forward.  That decision had been taken by her Father and Mother and it seems to me much more likely that, in July 2023, she had accepted that decision and expected to start school in Spain in September after her return from her USA holiday.  Looking at the evidence as a whole, I do not accept that this vulnerable 12-year-old girl was being duplicitous in pretending she was agreeing with this plan but was hiding her real opposition to living in Spain or that she was hiding a determination that she would stay in London as soon as she was able to do so.</span></p>

However, it seems to me that all of G&#8217;s opinions in this matter are driven by her belief as to what would be in A&#8217;s best interests and that, rather than deliberate dishonesty, she was trying to interpret the words and actions of others to fit with her own views and that the firmness of her convictions about what would be best for A.  </span></p>

In my judgment, all that changed in A&#8217;s mind as a result of what happened on her USA holiday.  I know nothing of the conversations that took place with her aunts and how she was persuaded to change her mind and to transfer her loyalties from her Father to her grandmother, or what caused her to take the position that she wanted to stay living in London.  I do however find that this was a change of heart and that, when she was in Spain in early July, she was not actively opposing the plan to move to Spain and expected to return to Spain after her holiday and to start school in City C.</span></p>

By that stage legal proceedings had been commenced in the court in London and it may have occurred to adults that a recording of this call might be useful evidence, but it seems highly unlikely that that would occur to a child.  It is significant that A did not tell her Father that she was recording the call.  The failure to tell the Father than the call was being recorded seems to me to imply a degree of preparation and sophistication which is hard to attribute to a 12-year-old child alone.  G said in her evidence that A was recording conversations from March onwards.  However no other recordings have been disclosed and, if there were other recordings, it seems strange they have not been disclosed.  That part of G&#8217;s evidence is not supported by other evidence, and it seems to me to be highly unlikely to be correct.</span></p>

This complaint seems to me to reveal something about G&#8217;s attitude.  It seems to me that it suggests that, following the death of the Mother, G saw herself as A&#8217;s primary carer and wanted to exert a measure of control over the Father&#8217;s influence on A.  I can entirely understand why the Father did not want to have G listening in and commenting on every aspect of his calls with his daughter, particularly when G was so opposed to the plan for A to go to live with the Father.  The fact that G complained that the Father was having &#8220;secret&#8221; calls with his daughter suggests to me that G may well have been behind the plan to record the calls and not to tell the Father that the calls were being recorded.

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child. The approach must always be child driven. I emphasise this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties. It is all too common for the Court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine. This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements. I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident. I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these enquiries in the courtroom. Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties&#8221;</span></p>

The findings about the circumstances in which A moved to Spain I have made above mean that I accept that her stay in Spain from 8 July was intended to be the start of a permanent change in her home, and thus, if things had worked out as her one surviving parent had intended, there could have been no dispute that A had become habitually resident in Spain.  It seems to me that the important question is whether A had sufficient stability in her new life in City C that she had either lost her habitual residence in England and whether she had become habitually resident in Spain at the date when she left Spain to go on holiday to the United States on 13 July 2023.  If she had either lost her habitual residence in England, whether or not she had become habitually resident in Spain by that date, Ms Gasparro on behalf of G accepts that, if the Court were to find that A became habitually resident in Spain in July 2023, then there is jurisdiction for this court to make a return order because, on that assumed basis, A has been wrongfully retained in England after 26 August 2023.</span></p>

I have found that, in as much as it is possible to discern A&#8217;s state of mind during her time in Spain in July 2023, she had accepted that this was her new home and that she would be going to school in City C in September.  I therefore do not consider that A&#8217;s state of mind during that week (as opposed to how she later described her state of mind) meant there was a conflict between her thoughts and her actions.  In those circumstances I do not consider that her state of mind in July 2023 meant that she did not quickly acquire her new place of habitual residence, or prevented her from doing so within a very short period of time.</span></p>

A is and has always been a Spanish national, speaks fluent Spanish and I have no doubt is entirely at home in Spanish culture.  Given those facts, in my judgment, this is a paradigm example of a case where Lord Wilson&#8217;s see-saw will very quickly operate to change a child&#8217;s place of habitual residence.  Ultimately, as both Counsel accepted, habitual residence is a question of fact and I find as a fact that, by 13 July 2023 when A left to travel to the United States via London, she had (a) lost her habitual residence in England and (b) had become habitually resident in Spain.</span></p>

She was not just objecting to going to live with her Father but objecting to living in Spain because she said she wanted to remain living in London.

Although I have accepted that she presently objects to returning to Spain, I note from the Cafcass report that those objections do not appear to me to be deep rooted and she initially was in favour of the move to Spain.  Her objections appear to be primarily based on a concern that a move to Spain may lead to her not regularly seeing her grandmother.  I am confident that that concern can be met by undertakings being offered by the Father, as he has offered.  It thus seems to me that the primary concern that A has expressed about returning to Spain can be met by appropriate undertakings and therefore need not stand in the way of her return.</span></p>

I read that observation as meaning that she is mainly concerned that the outcome should be fair to her Father and to G as opposed to being fair for her.  In my judgment, it is most unfortunate that a vulnerable child in A&#8217;s position has been placed in a situation where she has been faced with divided loyalties.  I have to conclude that primary responsibility for the turmoil that A finds herself in lies with G&#8217;s determination that A should not return to live with her Father, as her Father and Mother had agreed, but should stay living with her in London.  Even if, which I accept, G came to that view because she feels that this outcome would be best for A, G is not A&#8217;s parent and her views are, in my judgment, not based on a fair or informed assessment of the benefits to A of living with her Father and D.  It therefore seems to me that, in these unfortunate circumstances which have arisen mainly due to the misperceptions of G, the fairest outcome for A and one which most meets her best interests would be for her to live primarily with her Father and D and to spend time during the holidays with G and her relatives based in the UK.</span></p>

However, I hope that arrangements can be agreed which ensure that she can maintain strong contacts with G and her family, with whom she has lived for the last 3 years, and that the decision I have made in these proceedings will be accepted by all parties and they will focus hereafter in making the new arrangements work for A.</span></p>
