The document submitted by the LA on that day analysed why the LA had reached that conclusion. That has been supported by a detailed chronology submitted by the LA with their written closing submissions as to how the evidence developed during this hearing.  The LA position was not opposed by any of the other parties. Although I approved that application I considered it important to set out how this position came about and consider the circumstances surrounding the way E had been removed from her parents&#8217; care on 28 February 2013.</span></p>

What is criticised is the way the information has been presented, both before and after the issue of proceedings, and the process that was used by the LA. It has graphically illustrated the dangers of not rigorously analysing the evidential foundation for and against any allegations made and not exercising a balanced judgment. Due to the complexities of the case it required strong, experienced leadership from the LA who hold primary responsibility for safeguarding issues. Put simply, that was not provided and there was no check on the structures that failed to provide what was required in this case.</span></p>

The logistics have been herculean. This substantive hearing has taken place only 14 weeks after proceedings were issued. The court bundle runs to 19 lever arch files. The legal teams have collaborated constructively to produce chronologies dealing with the various issues in this case, which have been invaluable in ensuring this hearing was not only effective but, importantly, also manageable. Behind each of those documents will have been hours of painstaking analysis and cross referencing of the original records from a number of different sources. All of the advocates have conducted this hearing to the highest standard; in particular, Mr Howe, on behalf of the LA, for the seamless way he lead his witnesses through their evidence in chief to bring the case to life through the contemporaneous case recordings, and Ms Crowley Q. C., on behalf of the mother, for her detailed, well targeted and extremely effective cross examination which turned the case round from what it first appeared to be on paper.  This case has illustrated the vital importance of advocates who are experienced in undertaking this work and the value of the forensic process. Without that expertise and this process the outcome in this case could have been very different, which would have been detrimental to E&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

The events of the last two years must have been extremely difficult. They have had to cope with being told soon after E&#8217;s birth that she had only a 5% chance of survival, endure the enormous uncertainty of E having many medical operations and procedures whilst she was in hospital for nearly a year, coped with the detailed training they needed to undertake before E could come home and manage E&#8217;s care at home with a complex care package, involving around 30 people who spend significant periods of time in their home assisting them in caring for E.  Many parents would have buckled under any one of those factors, let alone the combination of them all. During this hearing they have quietly and attentively sat through the evidence, whilst each part of theirs and E&#8217;s life has been picked over. It is perhaps an understatement to say that cannot have been easy. It is clear to me they have only been able to do so through their devotion to E, which in my judgment is without question. That is the golden thread that has guided and sustained them through all that they have endured.</span></p>

The parents&#8217; training continued until they were considered proficient in all the necessary competencies, which included such matters as being able to undertake a tracheostomy change, changing the tracheostomy tapes that secure the tracheostomy tube on E&#8217;s neck, and inflating the cuff (a small balloon that when inflated internally supports E&#8217;s breathing). To their very great credit the parents were able to complete training and become competent in carrying out these complex tasks. There was some suggestion the parents, particularly the mother, took more time than was usual to achieve all the relevant competencies, but as the evidence developed in the hearing it was clear this had to be looked at in the context of the complexity of E&#8217;s health needs and the de-skilling of the parents as a result of E&#8217;s extended stay in hospital. In fact the evidence revealed that in many respects the parents became very skilled in E&#8217;s care and their expertise was relied upon when she was admitted to the local community hospital. </span></p>

Although this was completed in October it was not finalised until early December as Ms Cook said the parents requested some corrections were made to the draft. It is a comprehensive and detailed assessment, Ms Cook had initially been visiting weekly, which then moved on to fortnightly and then reduced to about monthly. The assessment provides a positive account of E&#8217;s situation in the care of her parents, it acknowledges that E&#8217;s health needs continue to be complex and stressful for the parents to manage and the parents continue to need extra support to enable them to spend time together and relax.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The issue regarding ventilation was interpreted by those at the meeting as demonstrating a lack of understanding by the parents as to E&#8217;s ventilation needs, with the suggestion they might keep her unnecessarily off her ventilator. What in fact had happened is the parents had received advice from Dr Rosenthal (the consultant with overall charge of E&#8217;s ventilator care at RBH), as part of the assessment as to whether she could safely be discharged into the community, that there was up to a 5 minute window. In his oral evidence he described this as the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;wriggle room&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> which could be utilised in the event of an emergency (such as failure of ventilator equipment, decannulation, emergency situation such as power failure/fire etc). The parents had fully understood this as they accurately described it to RB on 6 November 2012, when they discussed with her E&#8217;s emergency care plan in the event of her staying at the Chase. As RB recorded in the care plan </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;In the event of decannulation E can breathe for 2 &#8211; 5 minutes. However she may not breathe sufficiently. She will look pale, then cyanosed &#8211; losing consciousness and finally having a cardiac arrest&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> This is consistent with what the parents are recorded in the CCHT notes as telling Ms King on 14 December 2012. There is no evidence the parents ever experimented taking E off the ventilator (despite the implication in Ms Smith&#8217;s oral evidence when she said the parents were not supervised 24 hours a day). In fact all the evidence points the other way. Whenever there have been incidents when E has come off the ventilator both parents have reacted promptly and effectively to restore E&#8217;s ventilation. It is difficult to see how this position became so misinterpreted, but it appears to be due to a combination of RB failing to explain the context in which this information had been given, Mr Winch being unaware of this advice from Dr Rosenthal and the discharge plan for E not clearly stating this. As a consequence of this lack of communication this became a serious concern that seemed, like many others, to gain authority by repetition, without a proper analysis or understanding of the underlying factual foundation. It also became fuelled as a concern with the misinterpretation of what the parents said about weaning off the ventilator as evidence of the parents lack of understanding of E&#8217;s ventilation needs. Unfortunately, this was to become a recurring feature in this case. </span></p>

Again this appears to have its foundation in a misunderstanding of E&#8217;s position (for example that she was immune suppressed as Dr Rosenthal confirmed in his oral evidence) and the complexity of E&#8217;s needs ( for example the limited experience of the community health team in dealing cuffed tracheostomy tubes, particularly in a community setting). The evidence also clearly demonstrated that there was limited recognition, from the community heath team in particular, of the de-skilling of the parents as parents. They had simply not had the experience most parents had of discharge home soon after birth and gaining experience in the care of their child. They had not been able to provide any day to day care for E in the first year of her life. A vignette of this is well illustrated after E is discharged to the Tadworth by the mother asking if she can pick E up.  </span></p>

SB, from the Portage team, gave fulsome evidence about E&#8217;s progress. In particular, describing the care with which E handled books, unlike many children her age, which demonstrated the time the parents had taken with her.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The third issue raised at the TAC meeting was what was repeatedly described in the oral evidence as the escalation of E&#8217;s clinical presentation. Some matters relied upon at the start of this hearing were soon withdrawn. For example, the suggestion that the mother had reported E&#8217;s skin had broken down in the area of her tracheostomy dressing and had healed a few days later. The undertone of this allegation was that the speed of healing was suspicious, and supported the suggestion that the mother fabricated a medical concern to gain attention. In fact Ms King accepted there was no mention of skin being broken in the original recording of her discussion with Mr Winch. All the mother was reported to have said to one of Mr Winch&#8217;s colleagues was it was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">rubbing on E&#8217;s neck&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> One of the main concerns under this heading was the reporting of the mother of blood in E&#8217;s faeces. The CCHT reported to the TAC meeting that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;the parents  were stating there was blood in faeces or other issues so staff go out, is constant huge escalation around clinical presentation. RB stated that when at Chase they did observe E to have blood in her stools. It was discussed that the issue was how the presenting problem escalated into parents shouting at staff down the phone&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">   However, the oral evidence soon established that this somewhat confusingly articulated concern lacked foundation. There were in fact several instances between October and December where blood was observed in E&#8217;s nappy by her mother, nursing and other carers. The idea of an anal tear or fissure had in fact originated from one of the carers prior to the mother going to the GP. Once re-assured by the GP the mother accepted the position. The later observations of blood appeared to be related to a small broken area of skin, and the mother accepted the advice regarding treatment of that. The failure to properly analyse the history to this, in particular by Ms Smith who was responsible for raising this first at the TAC, meant it was repeated at subsequent meetings suggesting the mother had been unreasonable in what she was saying and ignoring the advice of the doctor that it was likely to be food traces. It was deeply concerning that neither Ms Smith or Ms King had looked at the contemporaneous records and had instead relied on unstructured verbal reporting. It was clear Ms King was unaware that the records demonstrated reports of blood from a variety of sources, not just the mother.</span></p>

The oral evidence demonstrated the opposite. Apart from Ms Smith (who had only met the parents on three occasions) and Ms King most other witnesses who were going into the home regularly confirmed they had been welcomed into the family home and considered the parents had worked co-operatively with them. A striking example of how dangerous misreporting can be was the strong reliance in the statements of the mother&#8217;s somewhat high handed attitude in dismissing members of staff. At the strategy meeting on 28 February 2013 it is recorded as follows: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;M is extremely difficult to work with. She constantly changes support staff hours and asks for staff to be removed/changed due to minor incidences or a disliking of the personnel. She dismissed an excellent agency nurse after 30 minutes because she answered a telephone and another because she put on her coat 10 minutes before departure time&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Unfortunately this was wholly misleading and was not given the correct context. The evidence showed the dismissal was on the second night after E returned home, some 5 months before the strategy meeting. An important context is there had been a failure to provide a carer for E&#8217;s first night home, so the mother had missed a night&#8217;s sleep. The objection to the noise was not thought to be unreasonable by the carer who gave evidence in this hearing (she had used the telephone). Apologies were exchanged the next day and the carer was restored and continues to provide care for E and is still regarded by the parents as a trusted member of the team. None of that made it into the notes of the meetings or written statements. Unfortunately this lack of balance was not an isolated incident and became a recurring feature of the reporting of this family by the community nursing teams, in particular by Ms Smith.</span></p>

There was no evidence the parents were ignoring medical advice concerning E&#8217;s care. In fact the evidence established that once the position was properly explained to the parents they accepted it and followed it. This applied to all areas that formed part of the facts relied upon by the LA concerning feeding ; the shortening of the gastrostomy tube (a criticism but in fact it had been part of their training, they were just doing it incorrectly) with a suggestion that it was being done to bring forward surgery (whereas in fact the RBH said it was going to make enquiries about bringing it forward); nebulizer advice was accepted as was the single use syringes (even though it was contrary to the expressed preference of the lead cardiac consultant).</span></p>

This was not established on the evidence. The RBH, through Dr Rosenthal, was alive to the issues arising from information to the parents from so many different sources. He saw the value in having clarity and developed a communication system whereby clarity was ensured. Unfortunately that was not communicated to either the Tadworth or the community health teams. Notwithstanding the repeated concerns about mother having some learning disability (together with a suggestion of high functioning autism) no adjustments were made to improve the channels of communication until 7 February 2013 when the mother was given a contact sheet setting out the correct routes for issues to be raised. The confusion during the early days of this hearing as to precisely who had responsibility for what were perhaps illustrative of the difficulties the mother must have had.</span></p>

It appears E&#8217;s tape change had been done by the parents at about 17.30 in the presence of one of the staff, a student nurse who observed with the specific purpose of learning how to undertake this procedure. The notes show E was given her nebulizer at about 19.15, but the damaged inflation cuff was not noticed until over 2 hours later. Dr Rosenthal conducted the investigation and came to the conclusion that the parents had cut the tube accidentally whilst undertaking the tape change and had concealed it under the soft toy. He did not attribute any blame to the parents for cutting it but said it was a training issue regarding concealing it as everyone can make mistakes. Somewhat surprisingly he appeared to have reached his conclusion without knowing that in fact the tape change undertaken by the parents had been witnessed by the student nurse, who was paying particular attention as it was a competency she was seeking experience in undertaking. The manufacturer&#8217;s report stated that the tube appears to have been cut, but it was not retained and could not be subject to any further investigation.</span></p>

Mr Baldwin&#8217;s report concludes the tube was not cut but was pulled. Due to the manufacturing fault neither Dr Evans nor Mr Baldwin were able to say what pulling force was required. Bearing in mind the evidence about E pulling her tubes it is not impossible that the damage was caused this way. There is no evidence the parents deliberately damaged it.</span></p>

He said the damage was more likely to have been caused deliberately as it was only partly cut through, which would be difficult to do accidentally. However, in his view it would take some care to do this deliberately. Dr Evans&#8217; team had not come across a tube cut in this way. She only knew of reports from incidents where inflation cuff tubes had been cut in the intensive care unit, but did not have first-hand knowledge. Like many witnesses she had no experience of the cuff tracheostomy tubes out of a clinical (usually intensive care) setting. </span></p>

Given Mr Baldwin&#8217;s evidence of the care that was required if this was a deliberate cut, it is inherently improbable the parents would have been able to do this without CK noticing.

Mr Baldwin&#8217;s evidence was the damage on 11 February and 9 June were indistinguishable and would have been caused in the same way, namely by a single bladed sharp instrument such as a scalpel. It is accepted the parents had no opportunity to do this on 9 June 2013 and the evidence from the Chase Hospice was that it was a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;sharps free&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> environment. There is no suggestion any person present on 9 June was also present on 11 February.

But because there wasn&#8217;t any wetness, we were told the cuff must have been deflated prior to it being cut. I think that the purpose of that experiment was to show that it must have been done deliberately as E must have been left without the cuff inflated, as otherwise it would have been very obvious when it was cut.

I understood that she had a letter so she would go straight into hospital if anything went wrong.

It appears there was no effective challenge or testing by those from the LA of the information that was being provided by the health professionals, or any request that it should be put into context or balanced by any other factors. At the strategy meeting on 28 February 2013 Ms Smith and Mr Winch appear to have given information to that meeting that was not given before. Ms Cook described reference to an experiment undertaken by either Ms Smith or Mr Winch which suggested the mother must have deflated the cuff before cutting the tube, reinforcing the idea that it may have been done deliberately. Mr Winch and Ms Smith were not asked about this in their oral evidence as Ms Cook&#8217;s account came afterwards and it is not recorded in the minutes. Also that the ventilator records suggested the parents had deliberately silenced the alarm. This does not appear to have been considered with the evidence from CK who confirmed the parents were not left alone for any significant period of time on 11 February 2013.  There was inaccurate reporting of events (such as CK being told to go out of the room instead of being asked to stand at the end of the bed on 11 February). After the incident at the RBH it was reported the parents had not visited for 3 days, implying some kind of culpability. In fact the records show they were only away for a day, the father was working and he rang to enquire about E. The discussion about the incident at the RBH in the meeting was not in the context that the RBH considered it was an accident or that the parents had been observed throughout the tape change procedure. There were prejudicial descriptions recorded of the parents, describing them </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;extremely demanding, manipulative, controlling fabricate the situation with different stories to different personnel/services&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> No examples were recorded or asked for.

In fact a number of people who gave evidence during this hearing were unclear about what the routine then was with regard to the cuff and what it was for. Since E has been at home it was only inflated at night time when she is asleep and during any sleeps in the day. On both the 9 and 11 February the parents performed an immediate tracheostomy change, she came to no harm. It appears that on the night of the referral by Ms Smith to the LA the community health team were unable to provide any night cover for E and there was a suggestion that between the referral and the strategy meeting there were other occasions when no cover was available. On the ground the parents, together with the carers, had continued to provide the high standard of care for E for the 17 days between the last &#8216;incident&#8217; and the strategy meeting, with no suggestion of any further incidents or any increase in visits by professionals to the family home to monitor or further assess the situation. That important fact appears to have played no part in the discussion at the strategy meeting.</span></p>

There was no suggestion that this was other than a trip that was known about by the professionals involved in E&#8217;s care. However, no consideration was given to asking the parents to delay that trip and/or put in a package of enhanced care at home for a short period prior to the matter being put before a court. There was no consideration given to the fact that the parents had continued to care for E since 15 February with no concerns and in fact had done so with inadequate cover for night time care being provided by the community health team. The decision to remove was made without a proper analysis of the relevant information and was heavily influenced by the recycling of inaccurate information. This was not a situation that came within the &#8216;exceptional&#8217; category within the Working Together framework that justified the action that was taken. Whilst the community health team have to take some responsibility for this situation, as they were the source of much of the information, together with those present from the RBH, if there had been better continuity and effective management of the relevant LA personnel this situation may have been avoided.</span></p>

To use the section 20 procedure in circumstances where there was the overt threat of a police protection order if they did not agree, re-enforced by the physical presence of uniformed police officers, was wholly inappropriate. By adopting this procedure the LA sought to circumvent the test any court would have required them to meet if they sought to secure an order, either by way of an EPO or interim care order. The parents were asked to agree and sign a contract of expectations (parts of which were incorrect) and the bulk of which was a summary of local authority concerns. Although the LA had for some time held the view that both mother and father were suffering from learning disabilities, no special measures were taken, the parents were not referred to lawyers, and it is not clear to what extent they understood the implications of the agreement they signed.</span></p>

However, as the evidence unfolded it became very clear that due to the speed of the decision to remove E inadequate preparation had been made to ensure there was a clear care package to guide those caring for her (as described in the case recording on 5 March 2013). There was also a lack of clarity for the parents about what they could, or could not do, particularly in terms of their contact with the Chase. GS said she and her team had inconsistent information from the health professionals about what should be done, in particular as between the community health team records and the information from the GP. They resolved this by taking advice from the RBH. The consequences for E is that there was a disruption in her care which resulted in her not being given tasters of food, as the mother had been doing, and there was inconsistency in understanding as to when her cuff should be inflated.</span></p>

It referred to them having contact twice per week, rather than twice per day. As a result of the failure by the LA to properly manage what the contact should be between the parents and E and the parents and the carers, the parents concerns about the care E was receiving (some of which turned out to be justified) resulted in their contact being curtailed and matters that were happening with E were not shared with the parents (such as the nick to the neck), when they should have been.</span></p>

Her statement filed when proceedings were issued, nearly 6 weeks after E had been removed, contained numerous mistakes and misrepresentations. The amended statement filed 4 weeks later did not correct all the errors. There were repeated assertions about the father&#8217;s violence or aggression with no balancing of the context (for example his behaviour when E was being removed from the parents care, although the father helped load E&#8217;s equipment onto the ambulance; the meeting on 19 March when the LA announced they were issuing proceedings nearly three weeks after E had been removed). Ms Dickson referred to the mother having </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;high functioning autism&#8217;;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> there was no evidential basis for this assertion, as was confirmed by Ms Alam (Chartered Psychologist) in her report in these proceedings.</span></p>

This was attended by DR, the newly allocated SW from the Child Protection Team, whose team took over when proceedings are issued. She had only been allocated the day before and this was her first meeting. It appears Ms Smith was allowed to chair this meeting and the notes record an alarming level of misinformation. Rumours were recorded, with no analysis of their base and what steps were going to be taken about that information. Ms Smith is recorded as saying that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;it was always necessary to have two people to see the couple&#8217;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> which the oral evidence subsequently demonstrated was not the experience of all those who dealt with the family.

For example when an incident leads to a death it is considered very differently from an incident that leads to no harm, even when the type of incident is exactly the same. If people are judged one way when the outcome is poor and another way when the outcome is good, accountability becomes inconsistent and unfair.&#8217; </span></p>

The fact that a piece of information has been repeated many times does not enhance its reliability. In my judgment, if time allows, information to be given to a meeting by key participants, where important decisions are going to be made (such as a strategy meeting) should be reduced to writing, giving those attending the opportunity to be able to read and consider information in advance, particularly if they are new to the situation. This particularly applies where there is a gap between the request for a meeting and the meeting taking place and where the circumstances are complex, as this case was. This would allow for a process to check information, assess its reliability and strength and ensure more balanced and robust decisions are made.</span></p>

This is planned to include the training of the maternal grandparents to support the parents with E&#8217;s care. The restoration of a constructive relationship may require the use of an outside independent resource to assist in facilitating this, even if only in the early stages. No doubt I will be updated on developments when this judgment is given.</span></p>
