This is because she has a job there with an international humanitarian organisation as a Regional Programme Adviser, which is scheduled to start on 6 November 2019. Her application is opposed by the father as he considers such a move is not in the children&#8217;s interest due to the security risks out there, the uncertainty around the arrangements, whether the mother will return to the jurisdiction and the impact on the children&#8217;s relationship with him due to the change in the time he will have with the children. I shall refer to the parents in this judgment as the mother and father.</span></p>

Both parties filed two detailed statements and Ms Trevelyan two reports; her main report and the addendum. In her first report she recommended, on balance, the refusal of the mother&#8217;s application. In her addendum, having seen the second statements filed by the parties, her recommendation changed and, on balance, she supported the mother&#8217;s application.</span></p>

He has provided two reports. The net effect of his written evidence is that there is no structure of mirror orders that could be put in place in Jordan. There is a process whereby an agreement reached between the parties could be registered but there is considerable uncertainty about how long such a process could take and, even if it could be achieved, how it could be enforced. Even if such registration was possible it is agreed that it can&#8217;t be done in the timescales of this case.</span></p>

They gave powerful and moving oral evidence, each strongly advocating the reasons that underpin their respective positions. By definition one of them will be disappointed with the court&#8217;s decision. What I hope is they will each find the necessary strength to ensure their respective relationships with each other and the children will not be affected and that they will each support their respective roles as parents for their children whatever the court&#8217;s decision, such steps can only be in the children&#8217;s interests.</span></p>

Whatever the differences there have been between the parents the fact that the children have been able to have these relationships with both parents is very much to the parents&#8217; credit. The description by Ms Trevelyan of her visits to each of their homes demonstrate the ease and strength of these relationships.</span></p>

In relation to the trip abroad in December 2018 the father accepts she approached him in the summer 2018 asking him when he would like to see the children over Christmas, he responded he was unable to commit to when with the result the mother, in turn, booked a holiday. In relation to the question of schooling the father states the first he knew of any change in school was when he was told about this by G, during a contact visit in December 2018. It looks like there was communication between the parties about this issue prior to the email on 10 January although neither parent can remember when the earlier email was sent. The mother said she did not make the change of school or complete the form for any new school until the father&#8217;s views had been sought. It is unfortunate that the adults could not communicate this issue first between themselves, rather than information being conveyed by the children. The strident language used in some of the solicitor&#8217;s letters was not helpful. Matters such as schooling are decisions for the adults to make jointly, in the exercise of their parental responsibility.</span></p>

She noted there still remained some uncertainty about the details, such as the child-care. She considered the mother&#8217;s second statement provided more concrete detail about the contact proposals, the security the mother was offering in relation to the home, gave more explanation about the background in the relationship and in Ms Trevelyan&#8217;s view the impact on the mother and children of refusal of the application. She agreed with Mr Butterfield that the mother had fought hard within the financial proceedings for her interest in the family home, so the fact she was willing to offer it as security was a significant matter. When asked whether with all the safeguards in place the mother&#8217;s proposals to take the children to Jordan for two years were in their best interests she responded </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;what is in the children&#8217;s best interests is the way parents most likely to move on.

If they go to Jordan there will be an impact on the father. They both need to begin to behave as co-operative parents. On balance most likely if this application is allowed, that is what is the children&#8217;s best interests if the parents are able to co-operate without huge loss, the loss is more to the mother than the father.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Ms Trevelyan agreed she found her conclusion in this case difficult and the matter remained finely balanced. She agreed the ad hoc arrangements prior to June 2019 had impacted on the children&#8217;s relationship with the father, and since the more settled arrangements have been in place the children&#8217;s relationship with the father is improving. In her view, in the same way as the mother made the effort when the father was abroad, now the situation was reversed, and it was incumbent on both parties to do that. There is a need to balance risks of not having such frequent contact with the negative impact as a result of the application being refused. She agreed the children have limited sense of time and may feel loss at not seeing their father so frequently, although she considered if they were living in Jordan they would realise they would not see their father as frequently. It would be a change in the children&#8217;s relationship with their father. She agreed there could be an emotional distance. It was suggested that what the mother proposed was a return to the position prior to June, she didn&#8217;t agree with that as one of the features of the previous ad hoc arrangements was the uncertainty that accompanied them, which was not a feature on the mother&#8217;s proposals as there was a clear plan. In Ms Trevelyan&#8217;s view there needed to be an attitude change by both parents, for the mother to treat the father as a parent and for the father to take the initiative and rise to the occasion, be more proactive and take responsibility. She agreed there was currently a lack of trust on both sides and that communication was poor, citing the example of the mother taking initial steps about the change of school without consulting the father. She was asked about the risks of contact breaking down if the children went to Jordan; she considered that unlikely. As she said the mother is going to Jordan for her career, not to prevent contact with the father and her behaviour in the past does not suggest she would do that, although she acknowledged the mother had prioritised other matters in the past and there was a risk of it happening again. If it resulted in less contact between the father and the children that was not in the children&#8217;s interests. She agreed the way the matter had been presented to the children, particularly N, there is likely to be more disappointment if the application is refused. Whilst she agreed if the application was refused the children would continue with their settled lives here there was a danger the refusal would have a knock-on effect in the children&#8217;s relationship with their father. Whilst she accepted the theory that it was the responsibility of the mother to manage her disappointment if her application was refused, she considered the reality may be very different as the mother has committed herself to this job. She agreed the mother could access support to assist her managing her disappointment but she considered this would be difficult when the mother was being asked to do it again (having had such help to manage the breakdown of the marriage) and it may take some considerable time. She accepted the arrangements in Jordan presented risks for the children, for example by the mother&#8217;s work related travel,  but it was her view that there was nothing to suggest from the mother&#8217;s past parenting to suggest the live in carer would not be a success, the mother has always taken child focussed decisions.</span></p>

It is her view that, based on her parenting to date, it is not something the mother would suggest should happen if she did not feel the children could manage.

His C100 application in April 2019 and his statement in these proceedings make assertions about how the mother has obstructed contact that have not been balanced or given the complete picture. By way of example, to suggest as he does, that he has not seen the children at Christmas since 2013 is simply wrong. He saw them in December 2014 and they spent a week together in December 2015. The mother offered for him to have Christmas 2018 but he was unable to commit himself to that at the time. Also to suggest, as he does, that there were wider difficulties about contact did not give an entirely balanced picture. As the mother has demonstrated with the messages attached to her statement there were amicable exchanges making arrangements for contact in 2016 and 2017. It is very unlikely those were in total isolation of other arrangements that were taking place. Whilst it may be said there could have been more contact offered the father was abroad for significant periods and the mother took the initiative to take the children to go and see him. </span></p>

Whilst there may be some force in the submission that she could have done more to support contact with the father the evidence demonstrates that she did considerably more than the father gives her credit for in the context of him spending significant periods working abroad. This resonates with the observation made by Ms Trevelyan that whilst the mother was able to give a balanced view about the father, that was not the position given by the father. The criticisms of the mother in delaying to respond to the father&#8217;s contact proposals in December 2018 have to be considered in the light of what was going on at the time; the parties were undergoing mediation and the overnight contact that was actually taking place during that time, albeit at monthly intervals, as set out in the schedule produced by the father. It can&#8217;t be ignored either that this was at a time when the parties were also managing the tensions inherent in the financial application.</span></p>

Whilst there is some force to Mr Butterfield&#8217;s analysis in his closing submissions of the chronology relating to consulting the father about the change of school, it still should have been a matter that was dealt with more effectively between the adults first. The father acknowledged in his oral evidence he can sometimes take his time to consider matters, whereas the mother is perhaps more focussed. These are the respective dynamics of their personalities that each needs to acknowledge going forward in terms of their parental roles. They have both been under the shadow of contested litigation for over a year, which is unlikely to have helped. It was a sad vignette of the father&#8217;s evidence that he seemed unable to consider the impact of not responding to communications from the mother. For her part, the mother demonstrated a lack of respect for the father&#8217;s position when leaving the question of consultation about a proposed trip to Madrid until so late.</span></p>

Both girls have a good and secure relationship with each parent, they see their mother as their primary carer for the reasons set out in Ms Trevelyan&#8217;s report and enjoy their time spent with their father. They are said to be enthusiastic about the prospect of going to Jordan although as Ms Trevelyan observes they lack the maturity to properly comprehend the changes such a move will bring about. It is unfortunate that they have not been given a more nuanced view about whether they are going or not, as if the application is refused the disappointment, they may feel is likely to be enhanced. Having said that due to their young ages it may have been difficult, as Ms Trevelyan observed, to convey such a message to them. Their enthusiasm for spending time with the father and the respective wider families means that it is in their best interests for that to continue. It is important for them to continue to develop a better relationship with their father but also important for them to feel that their mother, as their main carer, is happy.</span></p>

If the application is granted their relationship with their father will change by virtue of the change in the contact arrangements. The children are better equipped to manage that change due to the stability of the more recent contact arrangements. The emotional disruption will be less if the mother&#8217;s proposed contact arrangements for the father and the children are not disrupted. If the mother&#8217;s application is refused there will be a risk to the children as a result of the mother&#8217;s disappointment, although they would have the benefit of the continuity of their lives and seeing their father here. Whilst it is incumbent on the mother to shield the children from that, like Ms Trevelyan I consider it very likely the children will become aware of the position. </span></p>

Whilst I of course acknowledge those matters in my judgment they should be viewed in the context of the mother having worked for this organisation before, having lived in Amman before and undertaken similar work.

There are two aspects to this. First, the change in the contact frequency and the impact on the loss of the more regular contact. It will be a change, but I am satisfied that it will not impact on the relationship to the extent that it should tip the balance in favour of the mother&#8217;s application being refused. The children have a good relationship with the father and the wider paternal family. That relationship has been supported by the mother, although she acknowledges in the early period after the separation her own feelings sometimes impacted on what she did. The recent past has demonstrated she works within a structure and there is no evidence she has sought to undermine the children&#8217;s relationship with their father. This important relationship will be maintained through the longer periods of contact, the opportunity of the father visiting Jordan in the intervening period and the regular skype contact supported by the mother&#8217;s weekly updates with photos and videos as suggested by her. That package of contact will assist in ameliorating the change in the arrangements. I am satisfied the mother will comply with the order she puts forward. Second, the need for her to respect his role as a parent, to understand the need to consult him in relation to decisions regarding the children. That is recognised in the draft order I have seen, where it is recorded the need to consult with him in relation to schooling.</span></p>

In the circumstances of this case I regard the risks as relatively low for the following reasons. The mother accepts in her first statement she left open the option of staying longer, however since then she has reflected and considered the evidence as it has come in and changed her position which I accept. There is much to anchor the mother back here. All her immediate family are here, it is of note that G described to Ms Trevelyan her close relationship with her maternal aunts. The only asset the mother has is here. The evidence suggests she held out for that interest and the security it gives her, and, in my judgment, she is very unlikely to put that at risk. There is no evidence to suggest this is part of any concerted plan to distance herself from this jurisdiction. Finally, although not mentioned by the mother, if she didn&#8217;t return, she may risk the children&#8217;s entitlement under the paternal family trusts. </span></p>

In his closing submissions Mr Butterfield confirmed the mother would agree to this. In my judgment the children should return by the middle of August 2021, at the latest, as this will enable them to settle back here prior to starting back at school in September 2021. For G, in particular, that will give her the necessary stability prior to her move to secondary school in 2022 and enable the parents to make the necessary enquires about suitable schools.
