Z&#8217;s parents accepted that the threshold criteria set by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> were met. The local authority sought a final care order based on a care plan of long-term foster care. Z&#8217;s parents accepted that that plan was both proportionate and in Z&#8217;s best welfare interests. A final care order was made. </p>

That case raised similar issues of law to those raised in this case though it related to facts which were materially different. In that case, in addition to hearing submissions from advocates on behalf of all parties I also had the benefit of submissions by an advocate to the court provided by the Attorney General. My decision was not appealed. So far as I am aware it has not been the subject of criticism in any subsequent case or any academic criticism. In those circumstances I propose to proceed on the basis that the law is as set out in that case. </p>

By 2016 the local authority had become concerned that Z was at risk of child sexual exploitation. Those concerns persisted. Following a referral from the police a strategy meeting was held. The strategy meeting concluded that Z was at particular risk from T. Z&#8217;s parents were aware of the relationship between Z and T. It is known that on occasion they allowed T to visit their home and to stay overnight. Z&#8217;s parents ought to have understood that T&#8217;s relationship with Z was an inappropriate and abusive relationship and taken steps to protect Z. They did not do so. </p>

If, contrary to that belief, he is aware of these proceedings he has made no contact with the local authority and has not made an application for party status.

The right to receive a copy of Form C6A exists for the benefit of every father whom a local authority &#8216;believes to be a parent without parental responsibility for the child&#8217; irrespective of whether or not that parent has de facto family ties. The difference between a father who is able to establish de facto family ties and a father who is not able to do so is that the former is entitled to the protection of Article 8 and Article 6 whereas the latter is not. The practical consequence of that distinction, in my judgment, is that the threshold for determining that it is not appropriate for such a father to receive Form C6A is lower for a parent who does not have the protection of Article 8 and Article 6 than it is for a parent who has that protection.</p>

Risk and welfare will be important factors in considering whether to give permission to a local authority not to serve a birth father with Form C6A&#8217;.  </p>

In so far as it is not inconsistent with the principles set out in the Children Act, that guidance is likely to reflect both the results of current academic research from a number of relevant disciplines and, in so far as they can be reliably discerned, the changing views of society. </p>

Cases in Rotherham, Rochdale, Derby, Oxford and other towns and cities have uncovered not only the previously hidden scale of the problem but also a particular pattern of abuse involving predominantly White British girls as victims and gangs of predominantly Asian heritage men as perpetrators.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.72in;margin-right:0in">As Professor Jay made clear, faced with this type of offending pattern, senior leaders must show political and moral courage. They must never allow misguided fears about offending cultural sensitivities to get in the way of confronting child sexual exploitation wherever it occurs. However, child sexual exploitation takes on many forms. It is not just confined to particular ethnic groups or parts of the country. It is inherently dangerous for any child protection agency to assume that they need not worry about this type of child abuse because the stereotypical offender or victim profile does not match their own local demographics. As others have pointed out, the sexual exploitation of children can take place anywhere.  </p>

We&#8217;re campaigning for a change to the Children Act to stop the courts being used to re-traumatise victims and remove the rights of men who&#8217;ve fathered children through rape.&#8221; However, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said local authorities could apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings&#8230;An MoJ spokesman said the right of councils not to tell a parent about care proceedings had been established in case law. Last year a family case known as &#8220;CD (Notice of care proceedings to father without parental responsibility) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/34" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 34</ref>&#8221; found that a local authority was right not to tell a father that his child was subject to care proceedings.

In such cases, is there a requirement, or at least an expectation, that the local authority should apply to the court for permission not to serve Form C6A on the person believed to be the birth father? Or, to put that another way, is it open to a local authority unilaterally to take the decision to serve Form C6A on a person believed to be the father of a baby born as a result of child sexual exploitation where that person does not have parental responsibility and is believed to be unaware of the care proceedings? </p>
