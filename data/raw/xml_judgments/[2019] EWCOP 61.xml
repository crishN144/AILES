Eventually, her IMCA (&#8220;Mr. R&#8221;) agreed to act as her litigation friend and instruct solicitors to make an application to the court on her behalf. In due course, the Official Solicitor took over the role of litigation friend. By the time the matter got to final hearing, AJ&#8217;s condition had deteriorated to the point where it was conceded that the substantive application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/50/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s21</ref>A of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/50" uk:canonical="1997 c. 50" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> could not be pursued, so the principal issue before the court was the claim for damages under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. The second limb of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s claim on behalf of AJ was that the local authority as supervisory body ought not to have appointed Mr. C as RPR at all, or should have replaced him when it became apparent that he was not going to facilitate speedy review of her detention. </p>

The wording of paragraph 139(1) of the Schedule envisages a fresh appointment with each granting of a standard authorisation, and regulation 12 provides that appointment &#8220;must be for the period of the standard authorisation.&#8221;  The explanation of the RPR role set out at paragraph 7.2 of the Code<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span> seems to follow this approach, and so too did the Applicant Local Authority and the Second and Third Respondents in the series of three selections of RPR for JV whilst she was living at Care Home R.  </p>

RV had previously been appointed as RPR, but in respect of a completely different placement. Whilst JV was in the Travelodge, her living arrangements were not susceptible to authorisation under the Deprivation of Liberty safeguards. JV&#8217;s subsequent placement at Care Home A required a new authorisation and, pursuant to paragraph 139(1), a new appointment of an RPR. So, it is the regulations which provide for selection which the court must now consider, not the regulations which provide for termination. To that extent, I agree with Mr. Boden. </p>

If regulation 8(5) encompassed the situation where a BIA makes a selection when not entitled to do so, regulation 7(3)(b) would be circumvented. Looking at regulations 7 and 8 together, and in the context of the overall hierarchy of selectors, I conclude that regulation 8(5) is properly limited to circumstances where the BIA is permitted to make the selection but does not do so. </p>

The former seems unlikely to meet the attorneys&#8217; apparent objective in raising this issue (namely restoration to them of an entitlement to public funding).

	      <p style="margin-left:0.73in;margin-right:0.08in">Support for this conclusion can also be drawn from regulation 6, which explicitly provides that a deputy may select the representative where the scope of the deputy&#8217;s authority permits. The scope of the deputy&#8217;s authority is of course determined by the court; and the appointment of the deputy is the court&#8217;s alternative option under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>(b). It cannot be right &#8211; as Mr. Boden&#8217;s position implies - that the court could grant a deputy sufficient powers to select an RPR but not be able to make the selection itself. </p>

Regard must be had to the fact that the standard authorisation process, including the selection of an RPR, is intended to be an administrative exercise. Regulations provide for a selection procedure, and that procedure has not yet been followed properly. The BIA and/or the supervisory body having concluded that RV is not eligible to be appointed, as attorney pursuant to regulation 7(3), RV should be invited to make a further selection.  </p>

Alternatively, if RB declines to make a selection, regulations 8, 9 and 11 take effect: either the BIA makes a selection, or notifies the supervisory body that she is not making a selection, whereupon the supervisory body may appoint a paid RPR.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.08in">RV may suggest that this approach effectively hands to the BIA a veto over his selection of the RPR on the basis of the BIA&#8217;s own view of JV&#8217;s best interests. After careful consideration, I am satisfied that such an interpretation would be to overstate the position. In the first place, regulation 7(2) gives the attorney an opportunity for further selection. Furthermore, it must be remembered that the BIA&#8217;s assessment is of the selected person&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">eligibility</span>, where eligibility includes being satisfied that the selected person would represent and support the relevant person [JV] in connection with the deprivation of liberty authorisation.

The London Borough of Hillingdon has done that, making this application to court even before the standard authorisation was granted; and the court (not the supervisory body/local authority) has appointed the Official Solicitor as JV&#8217;s litigation friend. I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the local authority/supervisory body has not effectively operated a veto but has properly ensured that the primary function of the RPR has been achieved.  </p>

However, it seems to me that he or she would need to demonstrate that he or she can, as P's litigation friend, take a balanced and even-handed approach to the relevant issues.  That is a difficult task for a member of the family who is emotionally involved in the issues that are disputed within the family and it seems to me an impossible task for AF to carry out in this case.  One only has to look at her statements to see that she is clearly wedded to a particular answer.  You do not see within her statements a balanced approach or anything approaching it, such as:  "This is the problem.  These are the relevant factors for and against"&#8230;.   </p>

None of the parties before me has made any detailed submissions as to whether this suggestion is in fact the correct interpretation of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations. I make no assumptions on that point. Mr. Boden asserts simply that funding issues are irrelevant to the approach to be taken to the selection of the RPR.  </p>

RV was previously appointed as RPR in respect of the third standard authorisation of deprivation of liberty in JV&#8217;s living arrangements at Care Home R. He was not selected as RPR in respect of a new standard authorisation of deprivation of liberty in JV&#8217;s living arrangements at Care Home A.

That did not happen. It was not open to the BIA either to choose the RPR, or to notify the supervisory body that she had made no selection. Therefore the circumstances of regulation 8(5) have not arisen, and it was not open to the supervisory body to select for appointment a paid RPR.  </p>
