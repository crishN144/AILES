	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern S, a child born in Antigua in November 2020 and therefore now aged just over 18 months. Both of S&#8217; parents have dual British and Antiguan citizenship. They have lived together in Antigua since 2014 and were married there in October 2019. Save for 10 days in December 2021, during which S was in England following her covert removal from Antigua by her father, S has never left the island of Antigua. Since December 2021 matters concerning S&#8217; welfare have been before the High Court of Justice (Antigua and Barbuda) of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 December 2021, immediately following discovery that her husband had secretly removed her daughter from Antigua to England, the mother commenced proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in England and Wales seeking an order for S&#8217; immediate return home. On 16 December 2021, Sir Jonathan Cohen made a location order and directed that the proceedings be listed for further hearing on 23 December. In the event a collection order was made and executed on 22 December, following identification of the location at which the father and child were staying.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a hearing before Ms Justice Russell the following day the court granted permission to the mother to return S immediately to Antigua on the basis that the mother undertook that she would return the child to the jurisdiction of England Wales if ordered to do so. The proceedings were adjourned until 21 January 2022 for a hearing at which the court planned to consider the question of its jurisdiction and whether the court should, at that stage, order the return of the mother and child to the jurisdiction of England and Wales. In the event, that hearing was postponed pending determination of an application made by the father for permission to appeal against the orders made by Russell J on 23 December. Permission to appeal was subsequently refused by Lord Justice Moylan. The matter therefore has returned to court primarily to consider what, if any, continuing jurisdiction the court in England and Wales may have with respect to this young child. Although the proceedings have thus far been conducted under the inherent jurisdiction, S is not a ward of court.</p>

The mother&#8217;s application, which embodies the principal issue now before the court, is contested vigorously by the father who has had the benefit of being represented by counsel, Mr Ben Boucher-Giles, to whose submissions on jurisdiction I now turn.</p>

In a case where, as here, it is accepted that the child concerned is and has always been habitually resident in another jurisdiction and where the courts in that jurisdiction are fully engaged in substantive proceedings regarding the child&#8217;s future welfare, the court in England and Wales will need to identify a clear and substantial basis upon which to found a decision that it continues to have some continuing ancillary jurisdiction with regard to that child&#8217;s welfare. In the present case, the factual and legal bases upon which the father puts his claim that this court does, and should, retain jurisdiction are the very opposite of clear and substantial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Firstly, on the material before the court, I am not satisfied that what was said about &#8216;contact&#8217; in December 2021, while S was still in England, amounted to an oral application for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8</ref>. The only reference in the father&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s Position Statement is merely an expression of hope that he can re-establish contact in due course. There is no mention of a court order or any particulars of the &#8216;contact&#8217; that he hopes to achieve. The transcript of the oral hearing shows that no oral application for contact was in fact made. The judge raised the immediate issue of contact in the 24 hours prior to departure and this was discussed. Other than counsel submitting that the child should remain in the jurisdiction and contact be considered at a later hearing, nothing else was said. Further, if a formal, albeit oral, application for contact had been made and was to be pursued at a later date, one would have anticipated that his counsel (a senior junior barrister who specialises in Family law) and/or the judge would have ensured that that would have been recorded in the court order. The profound weakness in the father&#8217;s case on this key factual issue is further demonstrated by Mr Boucher-Giles only being able to rely, in response, on paragraphs 9 and 10 of the order. Paragraph 9 is clearly irrelevant and relates to what contact the father planned to afford to the mother if he had been able to retain S with him in England. Paragraph 10 was expressed to run only until the next hearing in Antigua on 29 December 2021 and is wholly at odds with the court understanding that it was now seized of an ongoing application for contact that had been made by the father and was to be determined at a later date by the English court.</p>

In the event, subject to modest and limited provision covering the immediate 24 hour period, the court did not accede the request. In those circumstances it is not possible to say that the oral request, once made, has a procedural life of its own and remains live, as an undetermined formal application would. Such an oral request is, in contrast, a live matter during the hearing in which it is made, but unless some further provision is made to carry it forward, it will cease to be of relevance after the close of that hearing.</p>

Mr Boucher-Giles did not expand on this proposition and he was right not to do so. If this court had been required to consider S&#8217; welfare, either in terms of imposing a contact order upon the mother or requiring her to return with S to England, I would unhesitatingly have declined to do either. In this regard, the father&#8217;s case is wholly devoid of any merit. The only connection that S has with this jurisdiction is that she was unilaterally brought here by her father and kept here for 10 days, some six months ago, when she was but a year old. Whilst there has not been any investigation of the underlying facts within the court process, it is difficult to see the father&#8217;s actions by bring S here in anything other than a negative light. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, S is habitually resident in Antigua, the island that has been her home since birth. She is living with her mother there. Any issues between her parents concerning her future welfare are before the High Court of Justice (Antigua and Barbuda) of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. Other than the fact that her father is in England and that he, understandably, wishes to see her and to be with her, it is not possible to identify any factor concerning S&#8217; welfare which might justify requiring her to be returned here or entitle the English court to impose a contact order on her mother and, indeed, counsel did not seek to identify any such factors.</p>
