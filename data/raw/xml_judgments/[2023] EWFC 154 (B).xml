The magistrates dismissed the application by order of 9 August 2023 on the basis that such an assessment was not necessary to enable them to deal with the proceedings justly.

I note the Local Authority&#8217;s evidence and accept that F and G have been given ample opportunity to challenge their assessment before these proceedings were issued and during these proceedings, however, having met with F and G on 18 July 2023, they outlined to me that up until recently, they were under the impression that the plan for C would be for him to be rehabilitated to his parent&#8217;s care.  F and G&#8217;s application stems from being informed that the local authority seek to pursue a plan of adoption for C.  I found F and G to have good understanding of the risks posed to C by his parents and what a kinship placement would mean for C, mostly with regard to this being in place throughout the rest of his minority.  I outlined to the grandparents that any placement of C with them, would not be a bridging placement, as there is no guarantee that C&#8217;s parents will make the necessary changes in the future, should the Court deem it not safe for him to be placed in their care.  F and G appeared to understand this and informed me they continue to seek to be assessed as kinship carers for C.  Of course, the grandparents are protective of their son and D, they did advocate for them throughout my meeting with them, which would be something that needs further exploration via a full fostering, special guardianship assessment, in my view.  The Local Authority&#8217;s viability assessment outlines concerns in relation to the paternal grandparents and why the assessment concludes negatively.  If the Court is minded to endorse my recommendation of further assessment of them, then the local authority should consider what intervention can be done with F and G to assist them in bridging these gaps during their assessment.&#8221;</span></p>

They did so on the basis of the grandparents&#8217; ages .  In addition, during the viability assessment, they confirmed that they felt unable to be considered for full-time, long-term care due to their ages.  That would not provide stability for a baby.  In addition, the grandparents were aware of the gravity of the risks identified in respect of the parents to C.  Their assessment confirmed that they had sight of relevant paperwork and attended meetings with Children&#8217;s Social Care and had been willing to engage in the process.  They had sought their own independent advice.  Nevertheless, they presented as extremely defensive of the parents at times, minimising the concerns of the Local Authority.  Throughout the viability assessment, home visits and during previous conversations with the grandparents, their loyalty towards the parents had been evident and there have been concerns that they have been unable to separate and prioritise the needs of the then unborn baby away from the needs of his parents.  This resulted in concerns about their insight and capacity to safeguard.</span></p>

However, despite this, during later discussions, the grandmother commented that they could perhaps care for him for five years until H could care for him.  It was discussed again how each child needs a plan of permanence as soon as possible and this would not be within his timescales.</span></p>

That was not suggested as a criticism of them, however, they were tasked with considering the merits of any full assessment and the motivation for the grandparents to change their mind completely, despite being repeatedly being made aware of the possibility of adoption.  The change in position led by their understandable emotion, did not provide the necessary justification required to delay for future assessment.  The local authority argue that a viability assessment is a means by which practitioners for or on behalf of the local authority can determine whether family and friends are potentially a realistic option to care for the child until they reach adulthood.  Its purpose is to recommend to the Court which members of the child&#8217;s family and kinship network should be further assessed as potential carers for the child.  However, information gathered during the viability assessment, might contribute to permanency planning for the child and reference made to Initial Family and Friends Care Assessment, A Good Practice Guide, Family Rights Group, 2022.</span></p>

Case management decisions of this sort are particularly hard to appeal, and, in this case, it cannot be said that the judge overlooked any considerations which were material.  An assessment such as Local Authority's parenting assessment of the father can be challenged in ways other than obtaining a competing assessment.  If the facts upon which the assessment has proceeded are wrong, they can be disputed.  If the opinions are flawed, that can be explored in cross examination, the author of the report being taken to the material which undermines or contradicts the conclusions he or she has drawn.  Or, as the guardian contemplated here, a party can take steps to address the problems that have been identified and/or that he or she acknowledges.&#8221;</span></p>

Hardly anyone thought they themselves should do less.  The reality, of course, is that time and money spent on one child means less time and money available to help another.  Dedication to achieving the best possible result for one child comes at the hidden expense of another whose case is delayed or whose social worker has come to court again, when they might have been working to help another child to remain safely within the birth family.&#8221;</span></p>

He identified how the understandable consequence of the Covid pandemic had been that section 32 of the Children Act had fallen out of sharp focus.  It was necessary, for the Family Justice System to succeed in its objective of providing timeous outcomes for children, to bring Section 32 and the Public Law Outline back into sharp focus.  That drive came on the back of the final recommendations made by the Public Law Working Group, fully endorsed by the President.  These identified the need to exert control over the number of experts that were being used by Family Courts and in particular identified independent social workers and psychologists as two disciplines where there was an overuse of experts.  The Court already had the expert input from social worker and children&#8217;s guardian and therefore such applications should be scrutinised to ensure that they met the statutory tests.</span></p>

It is the professional judgment of the social worker that there is no necessity to proceed to a full assessment.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian does not share that opinion and suggests that there is such a need.  There is, therefore, an issue between the two experts in the case.</span></p>

In other words, the Court should not be satisfied with the viability assessment of the local authority and should  start the assessment process again with another expert.  The local authority object to that course.</span></p>

Alternatively, is driven by some other extraneous factors such as third-party pressure or guilt, or a combination of factors. </span></p>

It cannot be said to have been a decision that was outside the generous ambit for their discretion.  Having provided a correct analysis of the law, they identified that the grandparents had been subject to an initial viability assessment.  It was clear they chose not to challenge the assessment timeously.  They had considered the assessment to be fair and comprehensive.  Only at week 19 did they seek to challenge this, despite many opportunities for the grandparents and the Guardian to respond earlier.  They were made aware that adoption was a realistic option at the time.  The application could significantly delay the final outcome.  The social worker is an expert in her own right and gave full reasons as to why the viability assessment concluded negatively.  This covered the potential conflict with regard to contact, which was accepted by the grandmother.  She also acknowledged concerns around the impact of their age.  H has been approached on four separate occasions, but was not in a position, or was unwilling to become a full-time carer.  They were mindful that the case centres around permanent planning and one which could lead to adoption.</span></p>

It is open to the grandparents to challenge the Local Authority&#8217;s assessment, indeed it is open to each of the other parties to challenge the Local Authority&#8217;s assessment of the grandparents, but the correct forum for that is the final hearing and not at an interlocutory hearing.</span></p>
