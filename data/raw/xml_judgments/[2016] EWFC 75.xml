Ms&#160;S adopted X in India in&#160;March&#160;2012 when she was then aged about 6, they lived together in India from about&#160;March&#160;2012 to&#160;October&#160;2012, and since then have had their home in the United Kingdom.</p>

X was found abandoned outside a&#160;temple in Delhi in&#160;June&#160;2008 with some signs of injury and hearing loss attributable to early untreated ear infections.  She was placed in the care of the Delhi Council for Child Welfare and was housed in the Z orphanage.</p>

Those inquiries were made in a&#160;number of ways, which included circulating posters, a&#160;social worker who was attached to the orphanage making inquiries in the area, placing a&#160;notice in relation to X seeking a&#160;family in the local newspaper, and also inquiries with the local police station as to whether any attempts had been made to find her. </p>

She was formally assessed there as set out in a&#160;report prepared by Ms&#160;C, a&#160;social worker from the Delhi Department of Social Welfare.  Her report is very positive and states as follows in relation to the applicant.  She found her: </p>

She loves and desires children and since she is single and has no plans to marry, she has decided to adopt and fulfil her maternal instincts.  She does not have any ulterior motive for adoption, she is socially, emotionally and psychologically prepared.  Her financial position is very sound.  Her standard of living maintained by her is that of an upper middle class family.  She possesses all the necessities and luxuries of life.  She has highly educated and enjoys a&#160;secure and happy life.  She belongs to a&#160;very close knit and loving family who fully support her in her decision to adopt.  The entire environment both within and outside her house is highly conducive and congenial for the healthy growth and development of a&#160;child.  The social worker highly recommends Ms S for adoption.  Any child by her is bound to receive a&#160;great deal of love, care and all opportunities to grow and develop into a&#160;fine, loving and secure human being."</span></p>

Under such procedures, the consulate and the Department for Education issued a&#160;no objections certificate dated 3&#160;March 2011, which served to permit Ms&#160;S to adopt under Indian local adoption legislation without further reference to the requirements of the British adoption legislation.</p>

The court documents made clear the Delhi District Court gave permission to the Z orphanage to give X to the applicant and for the adoption. The agreement between the orphanage and the applicant was evidenced in an adoption deed in the court's grant of permission to the gifting of X, which had the effect in law that X became the applicant's legitimate daughter. Her family identity was changed by this adoption, as set out in the documents, confirming that the placement took place with X and Ms&#160;S on 10&#160;March&#160;2012 and the order was sealed on 12&#160;March&#160;2012. The parties entered into a&#160;deed in accordance with the procedures there on 30&#160;March&#160;2012.</p>

At the time of the adoption order being made in&#160;March&#160;2012, Ms&#160;S intended spending further time living with X in India.  Her plans changed due to her father's illness and her fixed term employment contract coming to an end.  She and X came to the United Kingdom in&#160;October&#160;2012 when X was given 12 months' limited leave to enter outside of the immigration rules, which has been subsequently renewed.</p>

That bond can only be released once X obtains citizenship of her country of residence.  That bond, as Ms&#160;Cronin sets out, is evidence of the importance that all parties associated with this placement by X with Ms&#160;S on her obtaining secure residence with the applicant.</p>

It is an extremely positive report, attesting to the love and care X has received from the applicant and her extended family.  One of the most engaging parts of the report is the description in relation to X's arrival in this country in&#160;October&#160;2012 when she visited her new home for the first time, gathered all Ms&#160;S's family together and made them join hands and dance together in the home. </p>

He has seen X alone on three occasions in&#160;March,&#160;June and&#160;September of this year to be able to discuss matters with her.  He has also visited the family on five occasions since&#160;June&#160;2015 and had detailed discussions with the three referees as set out in the report.

X has been attending a Primary School. It is quite clear from the reports from the school that she is doing extremely well there.  The positive social work report gives a&#160;glowing account in relation to the progress X has made at the school, the way she has participated in wider aspects of the school curriculum and is obviously a&#160;very valued member of the class.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The final hurdle and important matter is X's lifelong welfare needs.  The court needs to consider the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>.  The making of an adoption order will undoubtedly bring lifelong benefits for X.  She is happily integrated into Ms&#160;S's family, with strong attachments to Ms&#160;S and her extended family.  The likely effect on her of an adoption order being made, ceasing to be a&#160;member of the original family is in the circumstances of this case a&#160;positive factor, because her remaining as a&#160;matter of English law a&#160;member of her birth family brings no benefit to her in her particular circumstances.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The adoption order will secure her position in a lifelong stable and loving family, will cement her relationship with the applicant and the wider family, in particular SS and MS, and SY and HI, who are clearly very important aspects of X's current family life.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Her national cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious background is also protected by this order being made.  Ms&#160;S is of Indian ethnicity and X's right of residency in India is preserved via this adoption.  Her ethnic and linguistic background is maintained by the family, which promotes her Christian religion which she found through her time in the orphanage, but also allows her to understand Hinduism as well.</p>

It is quite clear from the detailed social work report that he recommends that an adoption order is made, concluding as follows.  </p>
