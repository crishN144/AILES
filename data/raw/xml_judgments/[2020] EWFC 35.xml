		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The situation in this case is not the same as that in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>. I do not, therefore, consider that a "particularly compelling reason" would be required before it would be appropriate for a court to make a return order summarily at the outset of proceedings. However, having regard to the matters set out above, I consider that, absent a good reason to the contrary, the better course is for the court to defer making a return order until an application under the 1980 Convention has been determined in the other Member State. As Black LJ said this is how the return of a child is "expected to be dealt with". Once such a determination has been made the court can then decide what order to make pursuant to Article 11(8) of BIIa. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from this being the "expected" route, it has certain real advantages. First, a higher degree of direct assistance is likely to be provided by the authorities in the requested state to a party bringing an application under the 1980 Convention than in respect of an application for the enforcement of an order. Secondly, there is a specific obligation on states to determine applications under the 1980 Convention within 6 weeks. There is no such specific requirement in respect of the enforcement of parental responsibility orders. Thirdly, Article 11 provides what is to happen if a non-return order is made. There is, therefore, a tailor-made procedure through which the courts of the respective Member States engage with the case and engage with each other. Additionally, any subsequent return order has an expedited enforcement procedure under Chapter III, Section 4 and, to repeat, "without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with" Article 42(2). The making of a summary return order does not necessarily lead to the expeditious return of a child. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The advantages of an application being made under the 1980 Convention as against making a summary return order are evident from the circumstances of this case. Having obtained a summary return order, the mother found herself unable effectively to apply for its enforcement. It is not, therefore, known whether she might have encountered other difficulties under Article 23, for example on the issue of whether the voice of the child had been heard. Although there were some delays in the mother's application under the 1980 Convention being progressed, once she engaged with the process required in the Netherlands to progress an application under the 1980 Convention, the court there dealt with the application with expedition. That such applications are dealt with expeditiously can be seen from the information provided in its Annual Report for 2017 by the Dutch Office of the Liaison Judge for International Child Protection (BLIK). This is not to say that a return order would be made but that the process was more likely to be expedited by making an application under the 1980 Convention than seeking to enforce a summary return order by means of BIIa.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.03in">It is noteworthy that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Abduction: Hague Convention or BIIa) </span>the applicant mother commenced her 1980 Hague Convention application in the Netherlands four months <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> she had applied in England for a summary inward return order. Nonetheless, the inward return order that she had obtained was discharged, leaving her application in the Netherlands to take its course. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.03in">In addition to the practical reasons identified by Moylan LJ there are, in my judgment powerful reasons of principle why the left-behind parent should be expected to make an election as to which form of relief, and in which forum, he or she wishes to litigate. It cannot be right for such a parent to be free to litigate in multiple forums seeking different forms of specific relief. The parent surely must choose. An unfettered freedom to litigate gives rise to the risk of tensions between, and inconsistent judgments from, the two jurisdictions. Under the 1980 Hague Convention the best interests of the child are not the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, although they are highly relevant. If the removal or retention has been wrongful there will be an order for return unless the guilty parent can establish one of the specified defences. In contrast, an application for a summary return order will be judged from first to last by reference to the paramount consideration of the best interests of the child. It is a markedly different forensic process. </p>

It is hard to conceive of circumstances where this would be justified. The matters referred to by Lord Wilson, namely urgency, complexity or judicial expertise can be fully accommodated by allocating the matter upwards within the Family Court, if necessary to High Court judge level.

This provides that the application will be first considered substantively at a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment (FHDRA) about five weeks after issue of the application. The respondent should normally be given 14 days&#8217; notice of the hearing. At that hearing the court will have the applicant&#8217;s application, the respondent&#8217;s response, and, importantly, a safeguarding document from Cafcass or Cafcass Cymru. At the hearing the parties will be spoken to by the Cafcass officer. They will be guided by the Cafcass officer and the court to see they can reach an agreement.

The parties&#8217; relationship broke down 2017. Divorce proceedings were commenced but were never completed. Within those uncompleted proceedings it was agreed that N would live with his mother. The father came to London in 2017. The mother and N followed in January 2018. Although the mother and father lived under the same roof, they did not resume their emotional relationship. N became fully integrated into London life, attending school here and otherwise becoming fully socially assimilated. Plainly, by 20 March 2020 N had established his habitual residence here in London. </p>

On that day, which was three days before the Prime Minister announced the national lockdown, the mother unilaterally removed N to her mother&#8217;s home on the island of Paros. She did so in the belief that she and N would be much safer from the virus there. That may well have been a valid view, it being common knowledge that by virtue of preemptive action Greece has a much lower rate of infection and mortality than this country. However, that does not justify, in the slightest, what was a wrongful removal of N from the place of his habitual residence and, more importantly, from his father. </p>
