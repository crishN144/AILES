	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by the ICB to extend an injunction made and extended on a number of occasions by this court against the Second Respondent.  This judgment is intended to be free-standing so far as possible but it is impossible for me to separate the issues the application raises from decisions which have been made in a succession of judgments since 2016 and a full understanding of the case can only be gleaned by reference to that history.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By way of very brief background, MK is the subject of the proceedings (and therefore &#8220;P&#8221; for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>).  She is an 81-year old Muslim lady originally from Pakistan. She has seven children including the Second Respondent AK and his sister J.  There are five other brothers.  All of the siblings other than AK have a current role in MK&#8217;s care arrangements. AK&#8217;s ability to contribute to those arrangements has been curtailed and controlled by the court since the outset of proceedings in October 2014 in circumstances in which a dispute had arisen as to MK&#8217;s medication regime and conflict within MK&#8217;s home, where she lives with a 24 hour care package, had caused upset to the family and carers.  The full background is contained in a substantive judgment I gave on 7 December 2015 the written version of which is contained in the bundle for this hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I was unable to conclude proceedings on that occasion because there was a need for MK&#8217;s medication regime to be reviewed.  I had cause in those circumstances to consider the interim injunction which was then in place.  The Local Authority (whose application it was before the ICB took over funding responsibilities) sought supervised contact arranged in advance.  The OS sought a relaxation of arrangements so that unsupervised contact could take place on say two occasions per week.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his skeleton argument for this hearing AK has chosen to extract an exchange in submissions relating to those contrary arguments in which I challenged the LA&#8217;s basis for saying contact should be supervised in that they were saying there was a danger that unsupervised AK would interfere with MK&#8217;s medication as he had previously (as I had determined he had in that hearing).  This was a bad point taken by the LA because along the line arrangements had been made for MK&#8217;s medication to be administered by District Nurses not just because of risks from AK but in the light of other siblings giving MK incorrect medication as I had found occurred in the period July-August 2014.  AK&#8217;s intention is to remind me and the other parties that the case was not as straightforward as appears from a bare recital of the findings which I undoubtedly made against AK on that occasion and anyone reading that judgment would be aware that this is true.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, I was satisfied in 2015 that an injunction remained necessary (in the somewhat more relaxed form it has taken since then) to protect MK from being directly exposed to conflict between AK and the siblings or carers, to protect MK&#8217;s care arrangements and carers from stress and breakdown and to protect MK from unnecessary medical or other assessment prompted by AK alone.  My reasons are fully set out in that judgment and are not repeated here.  </p>

Attend at the home of MK [spelled out in full] other than on Tuesdays and Thursdays for periods of up to 1 hour on each occasion between the hours of 1pm and 2pm (or such other time as may be agreed in advance by the Applicant); and b. Instruct any person (including medical professionals) to carry out any form of assessment of MK without the prior authority of the court&#8221;.  The injunction has both been extended from time to time and has once been enforced by an application for AK&#8217;s  committal in the intervening years.</p>

The Applicant at that stage advocated for an indefinite injunction but I was persuaded by MK&#8217;s litigation friend, the Official Solicitor, to make the extension for a three-year period.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The application was made late in my judgment and, as a result it was not possible for proper directions to follow and a hearing to be listed within the lifetime of the existing injunction.  This meant that on 9 January 2024 when I gave directions for the filing of evidence from AK and a hearing of the opposed application I also felt it necessary to extend the injunction to cover the period until this hearing.  I criticised the ICB for this late application for which I can see no reason.  Nevertheless in the light of the decision I will make later in this judgment to extend the injunction no prejudice has in fact been caused to AK.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As a result of AK&#8217;s presentation of his case it was not possible to give a judgment during the two hour time estimate I had considered would have been more than enough to conclude all matters.  As it was, AK failed to heed my warnings about the time he had to make his points throughout the hearing.  He insisted on asking repetitive questions of the witness Edward Kirby, even where he had elicited the answers he was looking for long before.  He also insisted in his submissions on following through points in his skeleton argument which were totally without merit (to which I will turn in due course and which I endeavoured to explain to AK during the hearing to no avail) and ultimately simply reading from that document in the misconceived belief that unless he did so the document would not be &#8220;on the record&#8221;.   As a result, and after what I consider to be fair warning I adjourned without hearing him to the conclusion of his submissions, extending the injunction for a further period so as to cover the time that would elapse before this judgment could be handed down.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having reflected on whether the better course would have been to adjourn to another date to enable AK to conclude his submissions I remain satisfied that such a course would have been both unnecessary &#8211; as I had the document from which he was reading and he made no new or expanded points from it &#8211; and disproportionate &#8211; as the only reason he was cut short was his failure to follow my instructions.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have read a statement in support of the application from Edward Kirby who is MK&#8217;s Health Case Manager dated 12  December 2023.   It is a short statement, most of which summarises the background to the various proceedings relating to MK.  Mr Kirby states his support for the further extension of the injunction.   He concedes there have been no breaches to the injunction during the course of the latest, three-year extension, but states his belief that it is the injunction being in place that prevents this.  </p>

He has not  taken the opportunity to visit her during the times permitted in the Order but attended Court in July this year in order to oppose the application [for further authorisation of a deprivation of liberty in the community] and he continues to challenge the recorded professional view of MK&#8217;s capacity and care needs.  I am therefore of the view that if the injunction was lifted, AK would arrange for MK to be assessed by medical professionals in line with his own beliefs surrounding MK&#8217;s condition and further examination would not be in her best interests.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He states that the other members of MK&#8217;s family support the continuation of the injunction against him visiting and causing re-assessment of MK because of their fear that &#8220;conflict within the family would [l]ead to a rapid breakdown of MK&#8217;s care package and this would clearly not be in her best interests&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Under questioning from AK Mr Kirby conceded that he had not sought MK&#8217;s views on the application whether before it was issued or afterwards.  He also conceded that he had not met AK before the first court hearing and had not sought his views on the application or on MK&#8217;s care package generally.  AK claims that both these features represent failures or breaches of the Code of Practice to the Mental Capacity Act.  Under cross-examination he confirmed that he had recently sought the views of A but not MK on the application and that she, on behalf of the other siblings, continued to view the injunction as necessary to the care arrangements. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">AK&#8217;s skeleton argument makes clear that he considers it a significant if not fatal procedural failure that MK&#8217;s wishes and feelings have not been elicited.  Moreover, he complains that he has not been consulted on the application.  In respect of both these points he is adamant that there has been a breach of the Code of Practice.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I made the following observations on the evidence of Mr Kirby.  The first is that it is clear that the account of the siblings&#8217; views is a hearsay account rather than being contained within a statement of their views first hand.  It is clear that the weight to be given to hearsay evidence is less than that of first hand evidence and eliciting evidence in this form deprives the respondent of the chance to cross-examine.  Nevertheless I do not doubt the evidence of Mr Kirby of their views.  The views have remained consistent over the last eight or so years.  Given that the views of AK do not appear to have changed &#8211; of which more later in this judgment &#8211; it seems unlikely that the views of the siblings would change.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Secondly I note that Mr Kirby is relatively new to this role at just over a year.  I do not believe he has a depth of knowledge of the background to this case which AK has or which I have as the Judge who has maintained continuity since 2015.  I would not expect him to.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that he has a sufficient understanding to be able to make sound judgments on the current position having had the chance to see MK first-hand, conduct at least one review of her care arrangements and consult with her carers and with other professionals.    He has given credible evidence of his first hand experience of MK&#8217;s presentation and I have no hesitation in finding him to be a honest witness.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is acknowledged that there was a lack of consultation with AK.  It is a somewhat strange concept to talk about consultation in circumstances in which an injunction is sought but in this case there has been no direct conversation between AK and Mr Kirby in the last year about the restrictions which exist and which the ICB say are needed into the indefinite future.  At the outset of the hearing I was concerned that this could be a significant gap in the evidence but having heard AK and read his skeleton argument I am now satisfied that such a discussion would have been futile in any event. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I say this because throughout these many years of litigation it has been acknowledged that MK loves her son and would like to see him.  Despite this, and despite having been free to visit his mother unsupervised twice a week for the last 8 years he has not visited her at all, apparently on the basis of his opposition to the restrictions put upon him.  He has made no other &#8211; more convenient - arrangement with the Local Authority or the ICB.  He has no first hand up to date knowledge of his mother&#8217;s condition.   In these circumstances it is difficult to see what contribution he could make to a best interests discussion and it is not clear what the ICB could do to encourage him to take a different position on seeing his mother without disrupting her care package.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Kirby also knew that as recently as the summer of 2023 his colleague had concluded proceedings relating to the deprivation of liberty in the community and he was able to consult with her.  During those proceedings, as he was informed, AK&#8217;s position was exactly as it has been all along both in relation to the lack of acceptance of MK&#8217;s diagnosis and the finding that she lacked mental capacity.  He continued (and continues) to dispute the same on the basis that he contends she is sedated by her medication.  In August 2023 I declined to set up a substantive hearing on the issue because the matter has been previously litigated and there was no purpose to hearing the same arguments again.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not necessarily conclude from this that Mr Kirby was right not to initiate any discussion of the need for the injunctive order with AK but this hearing has, in my judgment amply demonstrated that had he done so he would have been met with an unyielding position from AK which is well-documented in a number of judgments and other records of the last few years.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Regarding the consultation with MK it is argued on her behalf by the OS that an application to extend an injunction is not a best interests decision in itself but is an application for an ancillary order to protect those declarations and orders as to her care arrangements which have been made on a best interests basis.  I am not sure if this is right but it is not necessary for me to determine the point, let alone adjourn to fill a gap in the evidence because sadly, and understandably in the light of a now 13-year old diagnosis of the progressive disease of vascular dementia, MK is not in a position to express meaningful wishes and feelings on the issue in any event.</p>

I would emphasise the word voluntary here as in the case of EG there was no jurisdiction to impose injunctive relief.  In his oral submissions AK was critical of a lack of exploration of this issue.  I believe that the question of undertakings was explored in the early days although AK says not.  At that time, I believe I have read,  AK was not willing to give them.  There would be no difference in the way in which undertakings would be enforced compared with the orders which have been in place.  Both would be enforced by an application to commit if breached.  I do not consider it convenient to adjourn for further exploration of this issue as there is no suggestion in his detailed skeleton argument that AK in fact offers such undertakings and he remains in opposition, it appears, to the restrictions which would otherwise be subject of the solemn promise. Indeed, he explicitly says that the giving of undertakings would not be &#8220;justifiable&#8221;.</p>

I found that it was in MK&#8217;s best interests to have the medication prescribed by her treating physicians, which included Mirtazapine.  That decision has been renewed over time as I was satisfied that MK was being given the reviews to which she was entitled of her medication.  Nevertheless, AK continues to challenge this decision and even in his skeleton argument for this hearing he asserts that &#8220;the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47</ref> [sic] ought to have allowed me to obtain a professional opinion about the impact of Mirtazapine and Pregabalin&#8221;.

More than that, he continues to assert that MK has capacity notwithstanding her long-standing diagnosis of vascular dementia and findings over many years that she does not have capacity in respect of the decisions which have been made for her from time to time.  These issues are inextricably entwined for AK who believes that MK is sedated to the point of incapacity despite any findings to the contrary I may have made in the past.  In his skeleton for this hearing he states that he now accepts &#8220;the sad realisation that MK has become a &#8220;legal junkie&#8221; and withdrawing from ANY of the medication would be highly detrimental&#8221; but other sections of his documentation and his questioning puts this acceptance in doubt as I explain above.</p>

The reality here is that there is an extensive team around MK who are far better acquainted than AK is about her current progression and presentation.  Her medication is subject to regular review.  Pregabalin is now controlled by a stricter regime than previously with the advantage of more regular review.  If there was a consensus, or even a minority view held by more than one person that her regime needs to be considered again or subject to a second opinion the injunction would not stop there being a discussion or agreement to seek that second opinion.  There is no such consensus or minority opinion, however.  AK stands alone as he has done for so many years and in those circumstances it is na&#239;ve in my view to consider even a paper-based assessment to be harmless.  </p>

The problem is that a best interests decision does not just depend on MK&#8217;s wishes and feelings and her values when she had capacity although these are powerful features.  In this case those powerful factors have been outweighed by the primary need to ensure that her care arrangements remain stable.  Those arrangements, supported by the injunction have been remarkably successful and have been sustained over many years.  This has enabled MK to enjoy other things she would likely have chosen for herself such as continued residence in her own home, relatively stable physical health including in relation to the management of her diabetes and contact with her six other children and other family members.</p>

In my judgment AK&#8217;s continued isolation from his siblings suggests that it remains necessary that his freedom to attend at MK&#8217;s home does need to be controlled.  This has the benefit originally identified of allowing other siblings to refrain from attending the home when AK might be visiting his mother to avoid conflict and ensures that her routines are not unduly disrupted.  </p>
