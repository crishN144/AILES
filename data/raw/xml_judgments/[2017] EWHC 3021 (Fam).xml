Beyond this, little is clearly understood about her functioning and her wider needs.  Self evidently, like any other teenager M needs a secure and stable home in which she can realise her potential.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M and her family have been known to the social services for the whole of her life.  The first record of social services involvement was now as long ago as 2000.  The family were the subject of three child protection interventions predicated on the risk to the children of physical and emotional harm. Eventually, the children were received into Local Authority care.  It is right to say that in the case of M, the child with whom I am concerned, the Local Authority has struggled to provide a level of care which truly meets M&#8217;s needs.  Given the limited appreciation of what M&#8217;s needs are, this is unsurprising.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since her reception into care has it become clear just how bleak and desperate M&#8217;s early childhood was.  It is apparent that by M&#8217;s eighth birthday, she and her siblings had each witnessed verbal, emotional and physical abuse which on my evaluation of the evidence is at the highest end of the index of gravity.  What is also clear is that M (as a very young child) was, for protracted periods, locked into her bedroom, sometimes by using a system of wires to secure the door.  She was kept in confinement for such lengthy periods that her parents thought it necessary, despite her age, to put her in nappies.  She was denied access to the lavatory. One of M&#8217;s brothers became inveigled into her abuse, effectively appointed her gaoler by the parents When M was received into care it became clear that in addition to the profound physical and emotional harm which had been inflicted upon her, she was probably sexually abused also. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though she had experienced little by way of positive parenting herself, M was expected to care for her younger siblings.   Ms Heaton QC who appears on behalf of the Local Authority today, along with her junior Mr Matthew Entwistle, has prepared a helpful and detailed chronology.  Ms Grocott QC who appears on behalf of M, with her junior Ms Rebecca Gregg, agrees that the chronology is an accurate and succinct summary of the background.  I propose therefore to incorporate the following extracts into this judgment. (<span style="font-style:italic">the emphasis below is mine).</span></p>

She struggles, for a variety of reasons, to express this rage in any safe or constructive way.  It seems clear that she has difficulty in articulating concepts generally.  Her powers of expression appear to be quite limited and, unsurprisingly, she has no template on which to model self control or regulate her distress. Again, predictably to my mind, M&#8217;s frustration and obvious sense of impotence in communicating anger and frustration has caused her to behave in a manner which is extremely aggressive and violent.  I consider it to be important to record that I do not regard M&#8217;s limited verbal skills as reflective of any intellectual deficit </p>

It is, I consider, indicative of the extent of M&#8217;s behavioural difficulties that the Local Authority regards the last seven days or so as having been both relatively calm and reasonably positive. However, when this period is scrutinised, it emerges that on the 17th November, i.e. only five days ago, there was an incident which was really very alarming.   It involved the kidnapping of a care worker, locking her into the bathroom, punching her to the chest, and threatening her with a shard of glass.  This incident took place over a period of hours whilst a male colleague was unable to gain access.  I am frequently humbled by the commitment of those who work with vulnerable youngsters such as this and, indeed, a range of adults with challenging behaviours.  </p>

Bloodied and bruised they have simply got back into the ring.  This is not merely indicative of their professionalism. As I have heard submissions and read the papers I have grown to recognise that there is some element to M&#8217;s distress that ignites the professionals&#8217; determination to help.  Despite the fear, general anxiety and actual physical pain that M causes, her own obvious psychological distress triggers the compassion of those who have tried to contain and help her.  Social workers often attract criticism and public disapproval; here the balance must be redressed.   The professionalism and dedication that I have read about in this case shown by care workers on modest salaries and with limited support, requires to be acknowledged and paid tribute to.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important, as the guardian has emphasised, to highlight the fact that M was prescribed a low dose of Risperidone, an anti-psychotic medication.  This was at some point during her stay within a Residential Unit. As yet, there is not sufficient information within the court papers to identify quite where this occurred.  I anticipate that the matter will be clarified quickly.  However, it seems most likely that this was commenced, in or around October 2015.  It must be stressed that M has never, at any point, been diagnosed with a psychotic illness.   She may have a disorder of personality which in itself may be linked to earlier traumatic experiences but there is no suggestion that she has ever experienced any psychotic episodes. It seems that this very young child was prescribed the medicine as an &#8216;arousal dampener&#8217;.  Behind this seemingly innocuous phase, lies a disturbing truth.  M was given this medication in order to subdue and suppress her.  The guardian, Mr Bernard Toland, is right to highlight this as part of the relevant background informing his own recommendations on this application.  </p>

It is for this reason that the process is tightly regulated by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in the way I have set out, but also in the Children (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 1991 and the Children (Secure Accommodation No.2) Regulations 1991 . The use of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> will very rarely be appropriate and it must always remain a measure of last resort. By this I mean not merely that the conventional options for a child in care must have been exhausted but so too must the &#8216;unconventional&#8217;, i.e. the creative alternative packages of support that resourceful social workers can devise when given time, space and, of course, finances to do so. Nor should the fact that a particular type of placement may not have worked well for the child in the past mean that it should not be tried again. Locking a child up (I make no apology for the bluntness of the language, for that is how these young people see it and, ultimately, that is what is involved) is corrosive of a young persons spirit. It sends a subliminal and unintended message that the child has done wrong which all too often will compound his problems rather than form part of a solution</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Avenir Book'">&#8217;. &#8221;</span></p>

Additionally, in making the order (pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref>), in the context of a Care Plan, the focus remains on M&#8217;s welfare.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is profoundly depressing that having analysed the case in the way I have, the Local Authority has not ultimately been able to find a unit that is prepared to accommodate M.  Thus I find myself, once again, in a position of considering the needs of a vulnerable young person in the care of the State where the State itself is unable to meet the needs of a child which they themselves purport to parent.  It requires to be stated unambiguously that M, in her present circumstances, remains a risk to herself, her carers, other young people and to the public generally.  Not only that, but from the one incident I have set out in this ex tempore account, it must be acknowledged that she is at risk of really serious injury to herself and others.  For these reasons, I grant the Local Authority&#8217;s application for a Secure Accommodation Order.  At present, that is limited to 3 months.   </p>

I find it necessary to do the same in this case.  It is impossible not to confront the depressing reality that current secure accommodation resources in England and Wales are inadequate.

This is a child who is subject to a care order and who is accordingly owed support by the local authority pursuant to its duties to her as a looked after child. This is also a child who has significant mental health and emotional issues, which make her behaviours both dangerous and uncontrollable. More than this, she is highly vulnerable. Despite all of these factors, she has been placed in a situation where weeks and months have gone by with there being no placement available for her countrywide &#8230; The provisions for placement of children and adolescents requiring assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive, clinical environment is worryingly inadequate.  One has to question what would have happened in this case had [X] not received a criminal sentence? Given the level of her behaviours, where would she have been placed? What provider would have accepted her given that secure units were unwilling to do so prior to her receiving a custodial sentence?"  This child has fallen into a "gap" in the system. Her behaviours are so extreme that no residential or supported living placement sourced by children's services can meet her needs, whilst there is clearly inadequate provision from the NHS and health services of placements, which can manage her mental health needs. Her time at [ZX] has amply demonstrated that placement in secure accommodation cannot meet her needs and is inappropriate.  "&#8230; This case has demonstrated the inadequacy of the current secure accommodation resources in England and Wales (leading to this local authority having to place in Scotland) and has now gone on to demonstrate the inadequacy of suitable provisions for children with high level of mental health issues, which necessitate assessment and treatment in a secure setting. Placements for vulnerable children and adolescents, be it within secure accommodation of mental health provisions, are a scarce resource.""</span></p>
