		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not.  When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability.  Fraud is usually less likely than negligence.  Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury.  A stepfather is usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his under age stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her.  Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher.  It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred.  The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.  Ungoed-Thomas J. expressed this neatly in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Dellow&#8217;s Will Trusts</span> (1964) 1 W.L.R. 451, 455:  &#8220;The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.&#8221;</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This substantially accords with the approach adopted in authorities such as the well known judgment of Morris L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Hornal v. Neuberger Products Ltd.</span> (1957) 1 Q.B. 247, 266:  This approach also provides a means by which the balance of probability standard can accommodate one&#8217;s instinctive feeling that even in civil proceedings a court should be more sure before finding serious allegations proved than when deciding less serious or trivial matters.&#8221;</p>

In this complex case the father has chosen to represent himself, having previously dismissed two sets of solicitors.  He is, as described elsewhere, a high functioning autistic.  He has comported himself throughout with dignity, and has thought carefully about the questions he wishes to ask.  Nevertheless, as many of the experts have noted, he has not found the exercise of shaping his questions and marshalling the extensive material an easy one.  Dr. S., with Dr. O agreeing, (see below), described him as a &#8220;querulous litigant&#8221; (see paragraph 47 below).  I bore in mind this characteristic, displayed in full in the run-up to this hearing when the father deluged all parties with hundreds of pages of documentation, many in his own handwriting.  It thus became necessary, on occasions in the course of his questioning, to intervene in order to avoid unnecessary repetitions. </p>

Hale LJ cites a passage (at <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 499" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 499</ref>) from the Law Commission&#8217;s Report (Law Com No 172 published in 1988) on which the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is based, and which bears repetition.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">Apart from the effect on the other parent, which has already been mentioned, the main difference between a residence order and a custody order is that the new order should be flexible enough to accommodate a much wider range of situations.  In some cases, the child may live with both parents even though they do not share the same household.  It was never our intention to suggest that children should share their time more or less equally between their parents.  Such arrangements will rarely be practicable, let alone for the children&#8217;s benefit.  However, the evidence from the United States is that where they are practicable they can work well and we see no reason why they should be actively discouraged.  None of our respondents shared the view expressed in a recent case [<span style="font-style:italic">Riley</span>&#8217;s case] that such an arrangement, which had been working well for some years, should never have been made.  More commonly, however, the child will live with both parents but spend more time with one than the other.  Examples might be where he spends term time with one and holidays with the other, or two out of three holidays from boarding school with one and the third with the other.  It is a far more realistic description of the responsibilities involved in that sort of arrangement to make a residence order covering both parents rather than a residence order for one and a contact order for the other.  Hence we recommend that where the child is to live with two (or more) people who do not live together, the order may specify the periods during which the child is to live in each household.  The specification may be general rather than detailed and in some cases may not be necessary at all.</p>

However, a shared care order has the advantage of being more realistic in those cases where the child is to spend considerable amount of time with both parents, brings with it certain other benefits (including the right to remove the child from accommodation provided by a local authority under s.20), and removes any impression that one parent is good and responsible whereas the other parent is not.&#8217;</p>

It is a basic principle that, post separation, each parent with parental responsibility retains an equal and independent right and responsibility to be informed and make appropriate decisions about their children. However, where children are being looked after by one parent, that parent needs to be in a position to take the day-to-day decisions that have to be taken while that parent is caring for the children. Parents should not be seeking to interfere with one another in matters, which are taking place while they do not have the care of their children. Subject to any questions which are regulated by court order, the object of the exercise should be to maintain flexible and practical arrangements whenever<span style="font-weight:bold"/>possible.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, there were three children, a boy and two girls. The girls lived with their mother and the boy lived with his father. The boy was unwilling to see his mother, and was not doing so.  A Recorder made a shared residence order. The father applied for permission to appeal.  Granting permission to appeal and allowing the appeal in part, the Court of Appeal set aside the shared residence orders. In so doing, Hale LJ said (at [2002] 1 FCR 177 at 181: -</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;17] I completely appreciate why the recorder wished to make a shared residence order in this case.  He wanted to recognise the equal status of each parent in relation to all three of these children.  He may, although he does not say so, have been afraid that the father would not recognise this if he did not make a shared residence order in relation to all three children.  But the law is that the parents already have shared parental responsibility for their children.  They have equal and independent power to exercise that parental responsibility.  A residence order is about where a child is to live.  It is very difficult to make such an order about a child who is not only not living with one of the parents but is, for the foreseeable future, unlikely even to visit with that parent.  Notwithstanding, therefore, that that parent does not wish there to be any distinction between the children, because she does not wish M to feel rejected by her, the court&#8217;s order has to be designed to reflect the real position<span style="font-weight:bold"/>on the ground.  That being the case, in my view the shared residence order in relation to M was inappropriate.  For that order there should be substituted an order that M is to live with his father and to have contact with his mother in the same terms as the order laid down by the learned recorder.&#8217;</p>

The Court of Appeal, upholding her decision, said that such a distance did not preclude the possibility that the children&#8217;s year could be divided between the homes of two separated parents in such a way as to validate the making of a shared residence order. A shared residence order had to reflect the underlying reality of where the children lived their lives, and was not made to deal with parental status. Any lingering idea that a shared residence order was apt only where the children alternated between the two homes evenly was erroneous. If the home offered by each parent was of equal status and importance to the children an order for shared residence would be valuable.&#8221;</p>

Once a care order has been made on the basis of an approved care plan the duties of enacting that care plan fall solely upon the local authority.

He asserts that if this is the correct diagnosis, it has radical implications for the diagnosis for each of his children, and thus the needs of, and care package for, each child.  It is his belief, given his family history (see below) and given his wide-ranging reading on the subject of autism, bi-polar disorders, and other psychiatric text books, that the children (although not yet formally so diagnosed) are, or may be, suffering from a bi-polar disorder with associated ADHD.  </p>

Although, in principle, the opinion of Dr. O. (it being his specialism) on the subject of the father&#8217;s insight might be said to carry more weight than that of Dr. L., the latter had the opportunity of considering this issue in the course of her very extensive enquiries into this case, and in the light of a number of meetings with the father at which she had lengthy discussions on the subject of his beliefs as to his children&#8217;s condition, appropriate management techniques, etc.  I am thus, in the light of her evidence, less inclined to pessimism than Dr. O. on the subject of the father&#8217;s potential for cooperation with clinical psychologists, and/or the slightly remoter possibility of him accessing individual therapy for himself.</p>

Although I have considered this issue earlier, it is worth repeating that their relationship is clearly not over, for they have not, in truth, emotionally separated from each other.  A perfect example of this was provided in the course of the consultation between the father and Dr. O. when the mother rang to speak with the father.  She has, furthermore, agreed with him at times to go outwith the contact ordered by me in April 2006, and arranged with the father to have longer periods with his sons.  Dr. L., when considering the parents, thought it unlikely that either of them would change their styles with each other radically, but that in helping to erect a structure to provide greater levels of support to the mother it might give her other conduits to discharge her anxieties, and other people to turn to rather than the father, thus bringing about some essential distancing between them, and, it is hoped, reducing the conflict between them.</p>

The nature of the mother&#8217;s loss of confidence in the psychiatrist is difficult to establish.  It appears that the doctor dealt with the mother mostly by telephone at the mother&#8217;s request, she finding it difficult to keep appointments face-to-face.  The doctor diagnosed, on the basis of description provided both by the mother and, on one occasion, by E&#8217;s class teacher medication in the form of risperidone.  She periodically altered the level of medication in response to reports of deteriorating behaviour on the part of E. provided by the mother.  She furthermore persuaded the mother to administer risperidone to O., but bearing in mind the mother&#8217;s reluctance to have him medicated, she only agreed to a one week period at the conclusion of which O&#8217;s medication was reviewed, and in the light of the mother&#8217;s reports about O&#8217;s behaviour the medication ceased at that time.  A further aspect of her report, which may have caused the mother to depart from the doctor&#8217;s advice, was in connection with whether or not one or both children should attend a specialist boarding school, even though the mother had begun to consider this option.  I suspect that the mother&#8217;s disenchantment with this witness was part and parcel with her disenchantment with the local authority generally, and the health service professionals in addition, exacerbated in the case of Dr. A. by that professional&#8217;s prescribing medication for O. even though she had not met the boy, albeit, paradoxically, the doctor was trying to assist because of the mother&#8217;s inability to attend appointments.</p>

Yet Ms. R. suggests that O&#8217;s &#8220;overall level of personal and social skill is very low&#8221;, with his socialisation at an overall age equivalent of 3 years 10 months.

There is accordingly, no urgent need to look for an alternative provision, Ms. R. considering that the W. school provides appropriately for his existing needs.  However, as with all such children, he will require regular re-assessment so that his programme can be adapted to his specific needs (resources permitting).  The W. school is specifically for those suffering ASD, and has a special unit for those with learning difficulties.  It is the view of Ms. R (one not shared by the father) that it is unlikely that O. will be able to live, even semi-independently, and might not be able to hold down a job.  As she reports, and as she repeated in evidence, the greatest barrier to him achieving a degree of independence is his &#8220;impulsive, non-cooperative behaviour&#8221;.  Much of his behaviour is currently impulse driven, and the differential management techniques adopted by each of his parents do not assist him in learning boundaries.  The father, in particular, has been invited not only by Ms. R. but by other witnesses to consider the techniques he uses to manage O&#8217;s behaviour.  Dr. L., after extended observations of father and son was particularly concerned at the father&#8217;s inability to establish boundaries, and at his tendency to reward poor behaviour by failing to establish and enforce appropriate rules and boundaries.  I have no reason to doubt their comments having heard the father&#8217;s evidence on this subject, he not denying the truth of their observations, but seeking only to justify his approach.  I regret to say that I find he does indeed have limited insight into the effect of his approach, and a rigidity of thinking which may make it difficult to advise him as to any necessary changes (see below).  In so finding, I should emphasis that I do not find a shred of mischief in his approach, but, to the contrary, that he genuinely believes in the correctness of it.  He is acknowledged by all to be a deeply loving father, of enormous commitment.</p>

By definition, provision of education falls within the domain of the educational authority; the provision of medical services falls within the domain of the health authority; the provision of psychological and psychiatric assistance falls likewise to CAMHS (operating under the aegis of the health authority).  Mrs. H. (see below) did inform me, however, that this local authority has the enormous advantage of having a Children and Young People&#8217;s Directorate, upon which sit representatives of social services, the education authority and the CAMHS.  Once the directorate has approved a plan for the children then each of the constituent authorities will do their part in achieving it.  It is nevertheless considered essential by Professor B and others that the burden of attempting to co-ordinate the provision of services for O. (and E.) should fall upon the local authority.  The job was described by Dr. L. as being that of &#8220;case manager&#8221;, and is not an easy one to fill.  Apart from all the other qualifications, it will require the mother and the father to have confidence in the relevant social worker.  Currently these children are lucky to have Mrs. H. as that social worker.  I hope that as a result of the change in the legal structure surrounding the affairs of these children following on from this Judgment (the case reverting to private law proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>) there will be no change on that front for the foreseeable future, and I was happily given an assurance by Mrs. H. that whilst she is unlikely to see these children through to their respective minorities, she is more likely than not to remain in post on this case for a considerable period.</p>

Both regarded the provision of this service as fundamental.  What does the role entail in relation to this boy (and E.)?  The psychologist would be required to visit in particular, the mother&#8217;s home for significant periods both during the day time and night time to observe the boys, their behaviours and routines, and the management strategies currently adopted by the mother (and also the father when they are with him).  After this prolonged observation and analysis of the findings, it is the role of the clinical psychologist to help each parent create child-specific techniques of boundary setting and managing the relevant behaviours.  An added complication is said to be the father&#8217;s own autism for he is said not to take advice readily, and clearly has entrenched ways of dealing with the boys, as well as, in the eyes of all of the experts, false expectations of their ability to achieve and/or adapt.  Dr. L. took the pragmatic approach that it may not be possible to change the father&#8217;s way of dealing with each of these boys, but as long as there is a sufficiently solid structure of behavioural management provided by the school and the mother, whilst change on the part of the father would be highly desirable, it may not be achievable, and may be in itself managed in the way described above. </p>

Even where funds exist, there is not necessarily the right candidate to fill the post.  This is particularly true of clinical and educational psychologists.  In the course of her oral evidence, Ms. R. suggested, contrary to the provisional views of Professor B. and Dr. L., that the need for psychological intervention in this case would be satisfactorily met by the instruction of an educational psychologist rather than a clinical psychologist.  The advantages would be perhaps all too obvious, for the continuing need to examine the appropriate educational programme (IEP) for each of these children could be carried out by such a professional, the necessary expertise to advise on behavioural management outwith the school and in the home would also be part and parcel of that professional&#8217;s armoury.  The local authority have in mind an approach to Ms. A (an educational psychologist) currently working on a short-term contract with the local education authority, and potentially available and open to negotiation to carry out a specific contract in relation to each of these two boys.  It is not possible to guarantee that she would accept such a role at this stage, and in any event although Mrs. H. is very optimistic, I must bear in mind the Complex Cases Panel does not meet to consider this case until 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2007.  I hope that Mrs. H&#8217;s optimism is not misplaced as to funding, and have no doubt that once funding is in place she will, on behalf of the children, seek out an expert of the appropriate qualification and experience.</p>

His socialisation (his next best area) places him in an overall age equivalent of 1 year 9 months.  Finally, his communication skills place him in the age level of 1 year.  He has little or no awareness of danger, and is very vulnerable, needing constant supervision.  Whilst his current school meets his educational needs, Ms R. considers that speech and language therapy would be appropriate (assisting the teachers in understanding and therefore meeting his needs).  Unhappily, his current school has no speech therapist, and is, on the current assessment, most unlikely to be able to engage one.  It therefore is my hope that the local authority will seek such a provision independent of the school, with the necessary negotiations as to funding between themselves/education/health services.  Ms. R. considers it extremely unlikely that E. will be able to live and work with any recognisable degree of independence, and it is more likely than not that he will need life-time care and occupation, although, once again, the father finds this very difficult to accept.</p>

As Dr. L. told me it is perfectly possible for E. to have two quite different rhythms of sleep depending upon the routines and behavioural management techniques adopted by each parent.

As a matter of urgency, appointments should be made for each of the boys to have a full and thorough review of what is required.  This would include a review of his Resperidone.  Whilst it is clear pharmacologically that those to whom Resperidone is administered require repeated and regular dosage (with no gaps), it was the view of Professor B. that it is possible to administer chloral hydrate in one home, and not in the other.  However, when the mother gave her evidence, she told me that Dr. S. (of B Cams, and not Dr. S. the psychiatrist who reported on the father as earlier referred to) indicated that it must be administered on a daily basis with no gaps.  It thus becomes very important to establish the view of the treating child and adolescent psychiatrist on this issue.  It may be that what has been a serious problem in the course of negotiations between the parents may prove to have comparatively little significance in the light of that expert opinion.

I express the hope that these parents will be able to resolve this issue swiftly.  It is a continuing worry and irritant to them both, and for my part I would consider it catastrophic if the family home had to be sold (with or without direct action by the mortgagees) for it is a refuge for these children.

Transportation between the two homes was by taxi, and was paid for by the good grace of the local authority.  This means of conveying the children was designed to reduce the opportunities for the parents to meet and engage in verbal if not physical conflict, many scenes of such conflict having, over a long period, marred handovers to the detriment of the boys.  In addition, this programme was designed so that each child would receive the full attention of the father, and one would not be prioritised over the other.

He does not, essentially, seek to overturn the heart of the agreement, but does seek an adjustment of the times.  He has carried out a mathematical analysis of the number of hours O. currently spends with him, and the hours O. would spend with him under the order, and finds there to be a diminution in the total.  He is unhappy about this.  Whilst he notes that E. will be a net gainer, he observes that E. has different needs which will be well-met by the extension of his contact.  Furthermore, the father wishes each overnight contact to end at 6.00pm on the Sunday and not 3.00pm, and asks whether or not each contact can begin on Friday night, as opposed on Saturday morning.  I have considered these requests very carefully, but cannot approve them.  The agreement reached last week was given a great deal of thought, and has the full approval of Mrs. H. and the guardian.

Indeed, I make specific provision for the mother and the father to extend the contact periods by agreement with each other, but that agreement must be made in advance, and in consultation with Mrs. H.

Mrs. H. can give no promises, but I have the distinct impression that she would be a strong advocate of the local authority continuing to pay for this taxi service for at least a year (sharing as she did Dr. L&#8217;s view that it is unlikely that these parents could successfully have handovers face-to-face without tension for an appreciable period). </p>

The existence of this attachment is part of the foundation of the father&#8217;s request that I go further than the agreement and either immediately order some joint contact between himself and both boys, or give a strong indication that I feel it should commence in the reasonably foreseeable future.  The other plank of his request is that he has successfully managed both boys when together despite the guardian&#8217;s evidence that when she observes such contact in the past she was concerned at the father&#8217;s ability to manage both children.</p>

The last piece of evidence which I put into this part of the jigsaw is the mother&#8217;s when she told me that all she can say (by definition not having observed the contact) is that when the children went to see him together they both left her home to begin the visit happily, and returned happy from it.</p>

I decline his invitation for two reasons: the first is that each of the children have enjoyed in their different ways their individual time with him.  The second is that until there is some measure of agreement as to appropriate ways of managing each of these children, and the successful implementation of such an agreement, I would, on the current evidence, regard it as more likely than not to subvert the measure of agreement so hard achieved as incorporated into my order and the agreement which underpins it.</p>

Both of these features are, in my judgment, more likely than not to distort the behaviour of the children who would have been excited to see him, and would have found themselves in a comparatively strange place with two comparative strangers.  I nevertheless hold to my views for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs.</p>

For the reasons given above, I decline his invitation to enter into predictions at this stage, and I do not find it possible for those same reasons to order further contact in the holiday.  It is by far and away in the interests of each of these children for there to be a period in which the new arrangements, in themselves being a significant extension of the current contact regime, become entrenched.</p>

Professor Z was consulted privately by the parents on two or three occasions in 2005/6 (the dates are not clear from the evidence).  I have seen nothing in writing from him, but did not get the impression from either parent that he had done anything other than confirm pre-existing diagnoses of each child, and prescribed medication for a limited period.  I have the greatest respect for the expertise of Professor Z. having many years of experience of his approach in these courts.  I do not, however, with the greatest of respect to that expertise, believe that he would have added anything to the existing galaxy of expertise available to me.  To single out but one of those experts (I hope not invidiously, for each of them brought their own highly honed skills with them, and each provided a major contribution to the successful outcome of this case), Professor B. is a world-renowned expert in her field, and I have no doubt, having read her report and seen her in the witness box, that she, like other experts in the future, will exercise their vigilance upon the subject of co-morbid conditions which has so concerned the father, and in respect of which he thought Professor Z. might add something (see above for my findings on this vexed issue of diagnosis).</p>
