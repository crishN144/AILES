It was done without an understanding of what an English Court expects of an expert.  Miss Martel-Emmerich was clearly unaccustomed to the role she had been asked to play.  She was sent the usual information about her role but was overtaken by her lawyer&#8217;s instincts.  She was in essence a Monegasque lawyer who had been asked by the husband&#8217;s lawyer for her advice.  </span></p>

The significance of any marital contract, if there was one, and the way the pot was to be divided up was a matter for the Court in Monaco but nothing I had read or heard lead me to consider that the wife would not be fairly treated in that jurisdiction.  </span></p>
