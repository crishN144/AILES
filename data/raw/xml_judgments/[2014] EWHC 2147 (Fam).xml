Z, a boy, was born in September 2000 and 2 months later, in December of that year, his parents married.  The parents are from very different backgrounds.  The father is of European origin ; the mother is from the Caribbean.  The father is a man of very considerable wealth and is a number of years older than the mother.  Their relationship broke down in 2002 and there has been litigation between the parties for most of the subsequent twelve years. </span></p>

First, the police were involved; the mother was arrested and remanded in custody for several weeks, although in the event no criminal charges were pursued.  Secondly, of far greater long-term importance, Z was transferred to the sole residence of the father.  Orders were made prohibiting the mother from coming within one mile of the father's house and other specified locations and, initially, an order was made for no contact between mother and son.  In October 2009 the mother was allowed indirect contact with Z.  Reports were commissioned from Dr. Berelowitz and also from an adult psychiatrist, Dr. Boast, who was instructed to assess the mother.</span></p>

In May 2010, direct contact was suspended pending a further review by Dr. Berelowitz.  As is made clear in the judgment of HH Judge Atkins of that date, Z was saying clearly at that stage that he did not wish to see his mother.  The judge expressed the view that it was very desirable for contact to be resumed in due course provided conditions were right, but she was satisfied that it was not at that stage in Z's best interests.</span></p>

The principal reason for the father's application was, as he described in his notice of application, his constant state of fear that, given her close proximity, the mother would again seek to harm him and consequently Z.  It seems that this application was prompted in part by a supplemental report from Dr. Berelowitz who identified a high level of anxiety in Z about the mother and recommended that the only realistic solution for Z was to move away to a secret and secure destination where he would be able to move around freely in the knowledge that his mother could not possibly be in the vicinity.   Z was made a party to the proceedings and a CAFCASS officer, Ms. Jordan, appointed his Children's Guardian.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"&#8230;in my view, a cool rather unbending character who was very much accustomed to having what he wanted, and it was easy to see why the mother felt unloved, inferior, outgunned, and essentially unimportant, and in relation to the father no doubt much of that was true.  But I am satisfied that he has a genuine commitment to Z's welfare as he understands it, and, moreover, that he is open to advice about Z's welfare.  I am satisfied that he is genuinely fearful for his and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Z's safety, and I am satisfied that he is genuinely committed, albeit on his own terms, to Z having a relationship with the mother.  I can understand why the mother feels that the father will never give up what he has got, but, in my view, that is too harsh a judgment.</span></p>

I do not think in the course of my time as a judge I have ever encountered such a stark difference between a witness's statement, in this case comprising some 88 typed pages, and the witness's oral evidence.  The more remarkable it was because I am satisfied that both were essentially honestly given, in that they represented her views at different times and in different ways, and yet each was dramatically different to the other.  The statement comprises an eruption of bile, anger, resentment, fury, hatred, and utter intransigence, to an extent that I rarely encountered in a sane witness, which this lady undoubtedly is.   Her oral evidence, on the other hand, had many attractive features, amongst them being sincerity, empathy for the father, and an unmistakable devotion to Z and his needs".</span></p>

He noted, relying on a psychological assessment carried out for the proceedings, that he had a fear for his safety that was genuine, real and proportionate.  Turning to Z's fear of his own mother, the judge considered whether the cause of that fear was (1) the events of 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2009; (2) ideas suggested to him, directly or indirectly, by the father, or (3) his own previous life experiences.  Whilst accepting that the events of 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2009 were a factor, and also that he had picked up from the father's fear, the judge accepted the opinion of Dr. Berelowitz that the essence of Z's fears derive from his experience of being at home with the mother.  He noted that Dr. Berelowitz had gone so far as to describe Z as "paralysed with fear of the mother".  This led Hedley J, having read the expert opinion of Dr. Berelowitz and the Guardian, and considered the evidence of the parties, to observe, at para.23:</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">" What, in my judgment, Z could not handle was the smoking volcano, the unpredictability, the never knowing what was coming next, and the consequent fear of an unpredictable eruption.  In my view, that situation is really beyond any child to handle.  I am quite clear that Z was frightened of his mother before 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June, but the source of fear was her unpredictability.  Any picture that he was regularly abused or cruelly treated would be quite wrong.  What terrified him, and I choose my words with care, was the combination of knowing that the mother could erupt but never knowing when or why it might happen.  It follows that I find Z has a genuinely and rationally based fear of his mother entirely independent of the events of 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June."</span></p>

He was clear that at that stage Z could not handle direct contact.  He was equally clear that Z required therapy support but was content to leave the choice of type of therapy to the father's discretion.  He did, however, conclude that there should be indirect contact by exchange of letters and cards once a month, with conditions under s.11(7) of the Children Act requiring the father to pass on such communications and to encourage or facilitate a reply, including a photograph.  As to the future, the learned judge described long-term contact as "the golden prize to which all should aspire".  He added, however, that this was linked to the mother's need for psychotherapy as identified by Dr. Boast.  He stressed that he had no powers to compel the mother to undertake such therapy but said that unless it occurred it was hard to see that Z's cooperation for the reintroduction of contact could be enlisted.</span></p>

Upon their arrival in Switzerland, the Swiss lawyer prepared an application pursuant to the European 1980 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children (the 1996 Hague Convention having not at that stage been ratified by the United Kingdom).  Upon receipt of that application, the judge at the Swiss court wrote to ask for the mother's address in order that the proceedings could be served on her. This gave rise to concern on behalf of the father that the revelation of the details of the local court would narrow down very substantially the geographical area in which he and Z were living.  The court was invited to adopt a procedure that did not reveal the locality of the court, but the Swiss judge subsequently rejected that approach, stating that it was "out of the question for the details of the court to be hidden from the responding party".  As a result, the proceedings for recognition in the Swiss court were withdrawn.</span></p>

In her oral evidence, however, the mother came across as emotional, self-centred and wholly lacking in insight.

The father's legal researchers and Dr. Spycher also make clear that for that to happen it would be unavoidable that the district court for the canton in Switzerland where the father and Z live would be identified to the mother.  The legal advice is clear.  Although the Swiss court has power to withhold the father's address from the mother, it cannot keep the court's location secret from the parties.  Mr. Geekie submits that this is a powerful incentive on the father to continue to comply with the order.  I agree.  I note in passing that in submissions before Hedley J, counsel then instructed by the father (Mr. Stephen Cobb QC, as he then was) made precisely this point.  Although he put the option of a mirror order before the court, he added that such a clause was unnecessary because the English order could be enforced and recognised under international law in the destination country, and that such a process could involve the discharge of the embargo on revealing that country.  Mr. Bishop has now accepted that the redacted version of that submission was disclosed to the mother.</span></p>

Article 12.3 is a complex provision.  Its complexities were considered by the Supreme Court in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re I</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2009/10" uk:canonical="[2009] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKSC 10</ref>.  From that authority, I draw the following propositions of relevance to this case.  First, Article 12 applies irrespective of the habitual residence of the child.  As explained by Baroness Hale of Richmond in paras.17-20 of the judgment, there is nothing in either Article 12.1 or Article 12.3 to limit jurisdiction to children who are resident within the EU.  At the time of the hearing before Hedley J in February and March 2012, Z was habitually resident in England and Wales.  The fact that he is now habitually resident in Switzerland does not preclude the jurisdiction from being further prorogued.  </span></p>

Although it is not spelt out in the judgment or the order, it is clear that the three criteria in Article 12.3 were satisfied.  The first criterion was satisfied because Z manifestly had a substantial connection with this country.  The third criterion was satisfied because, as I infer, Hedley J concluded that prorogation was in the best interests of Z.  The second criterion was satisfied, not because of any agreement given by the parties at the time of the order, but rather by their unequivocal acceptance of the jurisdiction at the outset of the proceedings.  The mistaken assumption concerning mirror orders was therefore irrelevant to the question whether there had been unequivocal acceptance of the jurisdiction at the time the court was seised.  The only question is whether it undermined Hedley J's implied conclusion that prorogation was in the best interests of the child.  In my view, it did not.  The purpose of the mirror order was to assist both parties in the enforcement of the order.  As Mr. Geekie has demonstrated, the order can be enforced by other means, and the availability of those means, involving as they do the disclosure of the location of the district court where the father and Z are living, is a cogent factor in ensuring that the father complies with the order.</span></p>

It is axiomatic that jurisdiction, in respect of matters concerning the exercise of parental responsibility, should normally lie with the country of the child's habitual residence.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The effect of Hedley J's order is that this court now retains jurisdiction.  Mr. Bishop recognises this when he concedes that it is not disputed that the court has what he calls </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de facto</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> jurisdiction.  The question, Mr. Bishop submits, is whether it should exercise that jurisdiction.  Mr. Bishop submits that the court should adopt what he describes as a purposive interpretation of the provisions in Brussels II Revised.  He submits that the decision whether to retain jurisdiction or to release it should be welfare-driven.  Through him, the mother submits that this court should now transfer the jurisdiction to Switzerland for the following reasons.  First, the child is habitually resident in Switzerland and is increasingly absorbed in Swiss life.  Mr. Bishop submits that it is therefore surely right that any dispute that may affect his interests should be decided by the courts immersed in that culture.  Secondly, the Swiss courts are governed by the principle of the paramountcy of the child's welfare just as much as these courts.  He points out that the report of Dr. Spycher demonstrates a sophisticated child-centred approach which is in no way inferior to our own.  Thirdly, Mr. Bishop argues that the arguments put forward against pursuing proceedings in Switzerland, namely that they would reveal the child's residence and harm his security, is "fundamentally flawed".  Mr. Bishop submits that a contact application by the mother in Switzerland could be conducted without disclosing the precise location of the child.  Fourthly, he submits that all that is needed for either party to launch proceeding is for the father to disclose the court district in which he is living and for directions to be sought from that court restricting details of precise residence, etc.  Fifthly, Mr. Bishop submits that the ongoing refusal to disclose the general area where the father and Z are living is disproportionate.  He points out that there is no suggestion, and certainly no clear evidence, that the mother has broken the embargo imposed on her so far.  Finally, Mr. Bishop submits that the mother is what he describes as "a perfectly respectable and responsible mother who in a moment of despair lost control and went to the child's school with the intention of stabbing the father but who, before she came into contact with the father, came to her sense in the head teacher's study and gave up the knife she had intended to use".  Mr. Bishop says that the mother accepts that what she did was wrong but adds "if ever a mother has paid a bitter price for a momentary loss of control it is the mother in this case".</span></p>

That decision demonstrates that, where the terms of a final Children Act order under s.8 make it clear that one party may subsequently invoke the jurisdiction of the court in this country in relation to residence and relocation, and the jurisdiction of the courts of this country has been established in earlier proceedings, it is not open to the other parent to withdraw their unequivocal and express acceptance that English court would continue to have jurisdiction in any subsequent proceedings.  In that case a final order made in England allowed the children to take up habitual residence in Canada.  The terms of the order specifically recorded that "any future disputes about contact shall be resolved in the UK, the mother agreeing to return to the jurisdiction for hearings".  Parker J held that neither subsequent orders obtained by the mother in courts in Canada, nor a subsequent denial of jurisdiction by the mother, could defeat the jurisdiction that had been retained in the original order.  The English court retained jurisdiction to determine the welfare issues.</span></p>

Taking into account the points made by the parties, both in evidence and in submissions, I have reached the conclusion that letters should continue to be exchanged four times a year, including on Z's birthday and at Christmas.  I was minded to urge the mother to reflect about what she says in her letters and the need to respond to information given by Z, so that the correspondence should deal with the present and future and not the past.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At this point I should record that, when the court reassembled for judgment, Mr. Bishop informed me that the mother had reflected on her position, and the evidence, and had concluded that she did not wish to pursue the question of contact and would propose to write only one further letter.  He added that she intended to return to Grenada and would seek a readjustment of the financial settlement between the parties.  The mother confirmed to me in court that she had given instructions in those terms.  Accordingly, I have concluded that the order should record what the mother's change of instructions have been and, further, that this court is of the view that it is in Z's best interest to continue to have indirect contact with his mother by exchange of letters four times a year, but that the mother has indicated that she proposes to write only one further letter.  It seems to me that in those circumstances the order should provide that the mother is at liberty to write four times a year and that, upon receipt of a letter from the mother, the father shall encourage and facilitate Z to reply.</span></p>

The application for contact considered at this hearing was anticipated by Hedley J's order.  Indeed, it was one of the main purposes of the review which he ordered.  On behalf of the Guardian, Ms. Fottrell acknowledges that an order under s.91(14) is, as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re P</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> makes clear, a last resort.  In evidence, the Guardian said that she only made such a recommendation rarely.  Ms. Fottrell submits that it is justified here by the long and difficult history of the case and, in particular, Z's unequivocal desire for proceedings to end.  She submits that, in the absence of such an order, the court can have no confidence that the mother would not apply.  Given the application of the paramountcy principle, Ms. Fottrell, supported by Mr. Geekie on this point, submits that a s.91(14) order should be made.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I have given careful consideration to these points put forward by the Guardian and supported by the father, but in the end I have concluded that it would not be right to impose a s.91(14) order at this stage.  The principal reason is my concern for Z's welfare.  I accept that the prospect of continued proceedings is unsettling for him.  What concerns me is that if the door is closed here the mother may try to open the door in Switzerland.  The prospect of proceedings in Switzerland is patently much more damaging to Z's welfare for the reasons explained above.  It must be clear, and made clear to everyone who reads this judgment and the order to be made hereafter, that this court retains unfettered jurisdiction to deal with all matters concerning Z's upbringing.  Instead I shall direct that in the event that either party files any application in respect of Z, that application shall be transferred to me and listed immediately for a case management hearing.  This court has wide powers of case management and, in the exercise of those powers, the court would aim to address all concerns about the impact of the application on the child's welfare.  I reached this conclusion before the last minute change in the mother's position.  I do not consider that change necessitates any amendment to my decision on the s.91(14) issue.</span></p>
