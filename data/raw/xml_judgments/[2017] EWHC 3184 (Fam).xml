He had been given advance notice of the fact that if this case was not to be adjourned, I might decide that an appropriate time had been reached to conclude it, having regard to the fact that the mother&#8217;s application dates from October last year, that his own application for an order for the peremptory return of the now 2.5 year old child A dates from December last year, that I heard five days of evidence in April this year, and that we are now in July.</span></p>

There were a number of specific incidents, as well as some very general allegations, into which enquiry was made.  </span></p>

I am not going to do so at this stage but will make some general observations about my conclusions, and I will explain why.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As I said in my 28 May judgment, the only really encouraging thing that has occurred is that, after a relatively short period &#8211; I think it may have been two months &#8211; when father and child had no relationship because of the mother&#8217;s anxieties flowing from her unannounced removal of the child from Iran, perhaps surprisingly, the mother has, so far as I am aware, always supported the proposition that the father should maintain contact with their child and, even more importantly, the other way around, that their child should maintain a&#160;relationship with the father.  To that effect, more or less without problem, as far as I am aware, relatively frequent contact has taken place, I think as often as two or three times a week, between father and child via Skype, on those occasions when he has not been in England.  On those occasions when he was in England, subject to suitable safeguards, he and the child were able to spend time together, including, I think on at least one occasion, time overnight together.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That is laudable.  It is excellent that the parents have been able to see through their own problems to the need for them to maintain, for their child, her consistent acquaintance, knowledge and love with and for both her parents.  I do not think that that frame of mind and facility, which is so important to her welfare, should be jeopardised by me making decisions about who was telling the truth on this occasion or that occasion, about this event or that event, when, as I am only too well aware, a judge can get these things wrong.  When a judge does get these things wrong, it angers the party who has been unjustly found to have been responsible, and it may or may not make the other party feel a bit guilty.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In relation to the unhappy breakdown of their marriage, I choose to say only a very few things because there is, to my mind, a much better and sounder basis for deciding whether or not the child should return to Iran, whether to the care of her father or in the company of her mother.  Those other reasons, to my mind, determine the outcome.  </span></p>

He is moreover manipulative.  </span></p>

I am referring to the allegation, which the mother accepts, that there were, on her evidence, three occasions when she indulged in lesbian activity with at least two women.  She says that the father encouraged her to that.  She does not say she particularly disapproved, but if she is right, then she acted under a degree of control and pressure.  </span></p>

Photographs or video were taken.  They were taken, it would seem, by the father.  He himself said that his participation in whatever was happening was apparent from the face of the photographs or the video.  Therefore, on the one hand, we have him accepting he participated in such activity and, on the other hand, we have her accepting that she engaged in it.  Honours, if that is the right word, are therefore even on each side.</span></p>

I pass no comment on that way of expressing it.  What is clear to me is that these facts and these acts, and this participation and these photos or that video, if they still exist, could be used by either party against the&#160;other, if they continue their battle, as they might, in other courts and in other proceedings and in particular in Iran.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I described the father in a number of phrases, before lunch, as manipulative, as I find him to be.  I should just explain why, in particular.  Having regard to those photographs or video, he says that she very well knows that he deleted them.  She says, &#8216;How do I know he deleted them?&#8217;  He says &#8216;You saw me delete them&#8217;.  However, later he told her &#8216;Ah, I have found them again, by the grace of God&#8217;.  Clearly, that was to put pressure on her.  He more or less agreed that that was so; why else would he have said it?  Whether or not they remain available to him, his intention clearly was to leave her in doubt whether it might be true that he had found them again or, indeed, that he had never deleted them, and thereby, to maintain some sort of hold over her, for instance with the threat that it would be revealed to her parents.  I call that manipulative.  </span></p>

He sent it to the email account that he had opened for the child when she was days old.  He is, if anything, obsessively over-concerned about this child.  I described him earlier as a&#160;hypochondriac; that may have relevance to his present and recent protestations of inability, supposedly for medical reasons, to deal with the issues so urgently needing to be dealt with in these proceedings, but it is also apparent in relation to his behaviour with his daughter. </span></p>

He agreed, in his evidence, that when he thought about it, which clearly he had not, what he wrote in that email was entirely inappropriate and he agreed, in effect, that he had sent it to the mother so that she might know what he was minded to tell their daughter.  Again, evidence of control, manipulation, pressure, in short a form of domestic violence, whether or not it was accompanied by threats of, or actual, physical violence on one or more occasions.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Back to the hypochondria.  A caught a cold, or she caught a virus; it may, indeed, have been one followed by the other.  The father&#8217;s attitude, he in Iran, the child and the mother in England, was extraordinary.  It got to the point that he insisted that the mother every half hour send him photographs of the thermometer to show the child&#8217;s temperature.  I regard it as an absurd suggestion that his anxieties about the child&#8217;s welfare could possibly justify ringing the family doctor in Iran, although it was then midnight.  I do not doubt that he has affection for the child and, as I have said, that it is returned, but his over-absorption in her, as expressed so often and to such strong effect, is, in my judgment, unhealthy, as a situation to which the child should be subjected full time, as would be the case were she to return to Iran and the mother to remain in England.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The reason why detailed findings in relation to their relationship are unnecessary, in essence, lies in the following.  I take it, on the expert evidence, to be more likely, as Dr&#160;A suggests, that if the mother were to return to Iran with the child and remain married, both she and the child would be subject to significant influence, coercion and control by the&#160;father, which would be entirely in accordance with their traditions and beliefs, and which would be supported by the Iranian courts in case of conflict.  It is, to my mind, inherently, virtually impossible to imagine that the Iranian court would allow the mother to take the child abroad against the father&#8217;s wishes, if he objected, even if he had previously agreed that she should be able to do so.  </span></p>

Further consequences impacting directly upon the welfare of the child could ensue, were the mother to remarry, always assuming he had agreed to divorce her.</span></p>

It seems to me inherently likely that an Iranian court might be encouraged to reconsider the decisions taken, either by the parents or by the English court, if either party (and, in particular for this purpose, the father) took the view that he no longer wished to abide by that or, that there was some good reason why the agreement should no longer prevail.  That is my view on the expert evidence, as it stands, bearing in mind that it has not yet been fully, nor will now need to be fully, investigated.  </span></p>

That no court could order him or make him comply with them.  That, as far as he was concerned, they only stood in the event that the mother, or rather that the child is returned to Iran.  That he would not divorce her (as he had clearly agreed he would, in court before me) unless the child is returned to Iran and that, as far as he was concerned, it was only when he signs, as it were, on the dotted line, that he binds himself to anything which, in the course of these proceedings, had been advanced as undertakings to which he was prepared to subscribe. </span></p>

That is sufficient for me to dispose of his application because there is plain expert evidence, quite apart from common knowledge and common sense, to support the proposition that, without sound safeguards, this child should not be returned to Iran, whether with or without her mother.  There is no prospect of such safeguards being agreed; there appears to be no prospect of even the beginnings of those safeguards, namely the divorce, being implemented; there is no safeguard that anything this court imposed would, in fact, carry weight; and there is, in my view, a significant and real prospect that the father, once he had achieved his objective of the return of the child to Iran, would set about frustrating the safeguards which had been put in place to achieve that end.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I repeat: I do not doubt the father&#8217;s affection for the child.  I do not doubt the strength of his desire to see her back in the country, if not of her birth, then of her ethnicity and her tradition.  I do not doubt his desire to see her physically close to him and to his relatives.  I do doubt the extent to which he would be as enthusiastic, as he says he would be, in encouraging and maintaining contact between her and the mother and, in Iran, between the&#160;child and her grandparents, for whom he has, over the years, manifested both hostility and distrust.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Therefore, I shall reject and dismiss the father&#8217;s application for A to be returned to Iran.  It follows from that, that she will remain here.  There is, as I have said, no immigration problem about that, she was born here, her mother is entitled to live here, she is entitled to live here.  I will confirm and, I hope, stabilise that situation by orders designed to make it clear that A's residence is with her mother, but that that should be subject to appropriate contact between father and child, not only by Skype when they are continents apart, but also in person, subject to safeguards, when he is in England.  He is not to remove the child from the care of the mother or from the jurisdiction of this court without either the mother&#8217;s written permission in advance or prior permission from this court, until further order. </span></p>

The devil of this may be in the detail, Mr Samuel will draft an order and submit it to the father for, hopefully, agreement and, if not agreed, I will determine the detail by email on representations from both sides, as to what I should do in case of conflict.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Meanwhile and, it seems to me entirely reasonably, if the mother is able, in current or future circumstances, to obtain a visiting visa to America to enable her to spend time with her parents who do, apparently, have such a visa and her sister, who lives there, then that seems to me to be a reasonable aspiration.  It will be permitted upon the mother&#8217;s express undertaking to return the child to this jurisdiction within 28 days of her departure (the consequences of an undertaking having been explained to her, to include, if necessary, in case of breach, imprisonment)..  This, therefore, is for a holiday and not for an emigration.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I shall also make an order, as it seems to me just and fair to do, for the father to pay half costs of instructing Dr A, both in relation to her original report and to her efforts in translation.  Whether or not the mother receives that money remains to be seen.  It is, however, an order which, it seems to me, reasonable and appropriate to make.  That apart and, subject to any observations you may make, Mr Samuel, I would propose to make no order as to costs in this difficult and delicate children&#8217;s case which has, sadly, taken so long and cost so much to bring to fruition, neither party being legally aided.</span></p>

I have read what they say in support of that application.  It is a matter between them and the court, which I do not propose, nor think necessary, to disclose, other than to say that I agree to them being removed from the record.  Therefore, the solicitors acting for him, Messrs Nelsons, come off the record.</span></p>
