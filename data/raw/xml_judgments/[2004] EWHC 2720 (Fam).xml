Neither parent accepts responsibility for those injuries.  Neither parent provides an account of how any of those injuries were sustained.  The mother does not seek to blame a third party.

On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2003 by police surveillance the father was observed entering the mother&#8217;s then home in breach of the bail conditions.  He was found hiding in a cupboard in the home where the mother was also present.  He was arrested and remanded in custody, where he remained until his release following his acquittal.  Notwithstanding his absence from the home and BL&#8217;s life while in prison, the father and BL have established a relationship which is enjoyable and beneficial to the child.  It is proposed by the Local Authority that this contact should be continued.  However, as to the details of it and the management of it for the future, much will depend upon my findings of fact.</p>

She has colluded with the father in his breach of bail conditions:  to what extent is not known precisely.  She has not kept the Local Authority fully informed of her own activities or whereabouts.  She has not attended meetings or appointments.  She has been awkward, rude and abusive to social services, and reluctant to let the Local Authority or Guardian meet with or be involved with S, and she has refused to discuss S&#8217;s upbringing with them. Contact between BL and the father has proved difficult, as on occasions she has disrupted it by her presence.  </p>

The principal purpose of this hearing is that of a fact-finding exercise to provide as much clarity about these matters as is possible.

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.52in">&#8220;The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not.  When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability&#8230; Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury&#8230;..  Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a serious degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.</p>

It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred.  The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability.</p>

He said that in his experience bruising such as this are not uncommon in babies who die following a period in Intensive Care and could be caused by a shearing force of a firm grip in the context of medical procedures and handling within the unit, and not one of negligence or inappropriate force.  Alternatively the bruising could be a result of pressure on the back of the head in an immobile infant.  However, he could not exclude impact by trauma.</p>

The mechanism being that to defend the lungs from unwanted fluids.  Apnoea, or breathing would stop, the heart rate slows down but the blood pressure increases to protect the brain and nervous system.

GER was considered but not investigated.  It is now known that for some or even all of that period C could have been suffering from the ill effects of fractured ribs causing her pain and distress on being picked up,  or cuddled.

He denies that he ever harmed C.  He covered up and lied about his part in C&#8217;s death.  I have to look at that with great caution.  In my view he has shown he has the propensity to lie and seek to deceive and deflect blame from himself about very serious matters.  At times he is very plausible. He has failed to tell the truth about what happened to C on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December when he lost control and inflicted a grievous injury on a defenceless child.  He has failed to acknowledge responsibility or acceptance of his actions on that occasion.</p>

The doctor&#8217;s evidence was that a carer who was not present when the injury was inflicted and did not know there was an injury would nonetheless know the child was in distress and something was wrong, but would put the problem down to an innocent cause such as colic.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The mother here was aware at times that there was something wrong.  On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October she took C to the Health Visitor and GP showing them the bruises.  She took the child to hospital on occasions pressing her view that something serious was wrong with C.  At one moment she feared the child had something fearfully wrong with her, fearing she would be told C had leukaemia.  She blames herself for allowing herself to be pacified by the GP and hospital doctors.  In her words &#8220;had she jumped up and down&#8221; and insisted more perhaps the doctors would have investigated further, perhaps there would have been x-rays and the truth discovered earlier and perhaps C would not have died.  Hindsight and self blame in these circumstances are easily understood, but these are not the actions, thoughts or words of a guilty parent, more of one who blames herself for not doing something more.</p>

They have not suffered physical harm at the hands of the mother despite the appalling stress and anxieties with which she has been beset.  She has not lost control.  BL has not suffered an inflicted injury.  This, of course, is not conclusive of her innocence, but is an indicator and factor in the assessment of who inflicted the earlier injuries.</p>

A child has to be gripped hard to be vigorously shaken.  C suffered from fractured ribs caused by extreme squeezing force to her rib cage on at least three different episodes.  There is evidence of at least one previous shaking injury.  There is a consistency of methodology.  Unfortunately there is no precise or detailed evidence as to when the previous injuries were inflicted.  The mother&#8217;s own evidence as to the onset of each period of illness after the immunisation, and return from hospital on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November is not precise.</p>

No doubt he was at risk and he has also suffered emotional harm as a consequence of her death.</p>

The Local Authority will have access to BL, and the household including S through their Care Order in respect of BL.  They will be able to support and advise the mother with regard of S.  He does need help at school that is clear, but it does not justify a Care Order.</p>

In particular the work proposed between the parents and Mr Gumbleton is very important.  It needs to be funded.  I share the Guardian&#8217;s view that it would be undesirable for the parents to either fund or part fund it.  </p>
