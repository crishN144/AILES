	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal relates to a small girl, K, who was born on 20 February 2003 and who has therefore just passed her fourth birthday. K has two older half-sisters, A, born in 1986, who is twenty years old, and N, born in 1988, who is 18 years old. With the consent of her mother (her father does not have parental responsibility and has played no part in her life) K was placed with a foster carer on 24 December 2004. She remains in her care, latterly in the joint care of the original foster carer and her partner. So K has spent well over half her short life with her foster carer. Care proceedings were commenced on 15 February 2006. (Both K&#8217;s children&#8217;s guardian and the Justices were properly critical of the local authority&#8217;s delay in commencing the proceedings.) On 27 March 2006 A was joined as a party. On 4 August 2006 the local authority applied for a placement order. The matter came on for final hearing in the family proceedings court on 14 November 2006. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Consistently with a recommendation of the Permanency Panel (see below) the local authority&#8217;s care plan dated 21 September 2006 was for permanency through adoption. K&#8217;s contact with her mother and her siblings was to be terminated after placement. There was to be only indirect contact thereafter. The mother opposed the care plan, seeking K&#8217;s rehabilitation to her care. A was no longer putting herself forward as a carer, save as someone who could support and assist the mother. The children&#8217;s guardian supported the local authority&#8217;s plan for adoption and in her report dated 27 October 2006 prepared for the purpose of the care proceedings recommended that a care order be made. In her report, also dated 27 October 2006, prepared for the purpose of the placement application she recommended that a placement order be made but observed that &#8220;the issue of direct contact is a difficult one and I think it does merit further exploration beyond the remit of these proceedings&#8221;. </p>

The children&#8217;s guardian was the final witness. At the very end of her evidence the Justices raised with her the question of what the Chairman referred to as open adoption. Her response was &#8220;I think I indicate in my placement report that I don&#8217;t close the door on that idea absolutely. I think it&#8217;s worth visiting outside of the remit of these proceedings.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Both the local authority and the guardian believe that the psychological evidence means that mother presents an unacceptable risk to [K] and that she cannot safely return to mother&#8217;s full time care even on a trial basis. Sadly, we too believe that the potential risk to [K], if she were to be returned to her mother&#8217;s full time care is not acceptable even for a trial period &#8230; We recognise the risks posed by [mother] if [K] were to return to her full time care even on a trial basis &#8230; The evidence is very strong that those risks are too great.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Justices approved in principle the local authority&#8217;s plan for adoption and made an interim care order to last until 16 January 2007. But they were concerned about the local authority&#8217;s plan that there should be no direct contact post-adoption:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;we are not convinced that the local authority have really explored the issue of direct contact &#8230; we are of the opinion that sufficient attention or focus has not been given to the potential for an open adoption. It is simply not good enough to say, leave it up to the Adoption Panel or it is for another day. We have to scrutinise the care plan and approve of everything in it if we are to make a final care order. It must be very clear in our reasons by now that we are not satisfied that it is in this little girl&#8217;s best interests to terminate direct contact post adoption to her mother and half sisters.</p>

The guardian filed a further report dated 11 January 2007 dealing with the issue of direct contact in more detail. She concluded:</p>

The Justices heard further evidence, including evidence from SS and from the guardian.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Justices decided to dismiss the local authority&#8217;s application for a care order. The essential part of their reasoning was as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Having considered all of this fresh evidence together with our previous reasons, we continue to place [K]&#8217;s welfare as our paramount consideration. Her longer term emotional development is crucial and this is why we have spent so much time looking at the issue of direct contact. We continue to state that this is an unusual case and that we are aware of the theory of adoption as presented to us. However we have weighed up all of the evidence and we are not prepared to approve the final care plan. We know that it is exceptional for a Court to go against a Guardian&#8217;s recommendations but we have given our reasons for so doing and given our reasons why we cannot place great weight on [SS]&#8217;s evidence. We realise the implications of us not approving the care plan because it means we must dismiss the case. This would mean that the only person with parental responsibility is mother and we have given full reasons as to our concerns about mother&#8217;s capabilities in caring for [K]. However we are not prepared to approve a care plan which we do not think promotes [K]&#8217;s longer term emotional development. We have given an opportunity for everyone to readdress the issue of direct contact and we are not satisfied with the evidence given to us about direct contact. We do not think that people have applied adoption theory to [K]&#8217;s individual circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The notice of appeal asserts that the Justices were plainly wrong in refusing to make a care order. No fewer than sixteen discrete grounds are identified in support of this assertion. I need not go through them all in turn. The central core of the local authority&#8217;s appeal, which is supported by the guardian, is that the Justices, having found that K cannot return to the care of her mother, made an order permitting this; failed to address at all how K could be kept safe if the local authority did not share parental responsibility; failed to consider that there is no realistic alternative to a care order; placed too much weight on the issue of direct contact post adoption; failed to consider that a care order would not in itself permit the termination of contact; failed to consider that contact can be considered at later stages; and failed to consider all the options available to them.</p>

That is not abdication of responsibility by the court; it is acting in accordance with the intention of the legislation. The Children Act provides for many of the most important decisions, including whether to place a child for adoption, to be made by the local authority and therefore there is nothing untoward in the judge leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of the local authority with whom the child is placed.&#8221;</p>

All they have achieved is massive uncertainty for K, who finds herself in a legal and emotional limbo. There is no realistic expectation that K can be rehabilitated to her mother, either now or within any realistic timescale. So K must, therefore, remain in care.

As Miss Lugg put it in her skeleton argument, pointing to <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/318" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 318" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 318</ref> (the latest authority on a point which goes back at least as far as <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 FLR 116" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 FLR 116</ref>), the Justices should have made a final order but refused the local authority permission under section 34(4) to terminate contact. Alternatively the Justices could have made a contact order. In any event, whilst the Justices might have been approving the care plan, any contact order would have superseded any stated intention by the local authority in the care plan. This, she submits, would have been far and away the lesser of two evils. She suggests that the Justices might then have adjourned the placement application to a hearing after the position of the foster carers had been resolved.</p>

They frankly acknowledge the Justices&#8217; inconsistency, having ruled out rehabilitation to the mother, in then dismissing the application for a care order, leaving the mother as the only person with parental responsibility. They accept that in the circumstances K has been left in limbo. Miss Giovannini also properly accepts that the Justices could have made both a care order and a contact order. But they submit that the Justices were nonetheless entitled to make the order they did. The Justices, they submit, were frustrated in their attempt to secure a care plan reflecting what they considered to be in K&#8217;s best interests. It would, they contend, have been equally inconsistent for the Justices to have approved a care plan providing only for indirect contact when they were so strongly of the view that to terminate direct contact was not, or was not necessarily, in K&#8217;s best interests.</p>

The mother also has a right to seek defined contact which we were informed she is likely to do at the January 1998 hearing. Unlike the judge I do rather wonder whether with the adoption of a very young child there is much prospect of successful long-term direct contact with the mother.

I am certainly not saying it is, but I cannot be satisfied that if the point is reached &#8211; of course it may never be &#8211; when the court is faced with the stark choice it will necessarily approve a plan for adoption by someone else.</p>

For the reasons I have already explained this part of its plan is one which at present I can neither endorse nor reject. But I welcome the local authority&#8217;s recognition that, whatever its own views, these are matters to be determined by the court at a future hearing. In these circumstances, and given that very clear caveat, I am entirely content to approve the care plan. Not merely can I approve the care plan. I think I ought to. Not merely is it an appropriate plan deserving endorsement. In the circumstances K desperately needs finality, or at the very least as much finality as is currently possible. I therefore approve the amended care plan.</p>

The mother will suffer no prejudice if I make a final care order because it will not preclude her pursuing in a judicial forum those matters which remain of concern to her.</p>

Those matters which require further consideration by the court can appropriately be dealt with at the further hearing which I now turn to consider. Nor will any arguments that either the mother or the foster carers might wish to put forward be precluded or prejudiced by the fact that there will now be a care order in place.</p>

I would certainly have continued the existing interim care order. But in the circumstances as they presented themselves to me on 13 February 2007, and consistently with the principles set out above, I would probably have refused to approve the local authority&#8217;s previous care plan and adjourned the matter to give the local authority an opportunity for further reflection. The local authority&#8217;s wise and responsible decision has happily avoided all need for that further delay.</p>

Moreover, and recognising that the issue of placement has a potential bearing on the question of continuing direct contact with the birth family, she proposed that the question of contact should be fully investigated and determined at a further hearing, preferably at the same hearing as the court considers the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order. The guardian supports these proposals. Not surprisingly, none of this is opposed by the mother. </p>

Miss Hudson submits that of all the experts who have previously assisted the court EL is the best placed to deal with this issue. She is also, as Miss Hudson points out, open-minded about the question of post-adoption contact (see below). Mother&#8217;s reservations, understandable in human terms, derive from EL&#8217;s failure to support the mother&#8217;s case on rehabilitation. But that is now all in the past and, importantly from mother&#8217;s perspective, EL is open-minded on the question of contact. In all the circumstances I agree that EL should be invited to do this further work. She has now, as I understand it, indicated that she is willing and able to do it and, moreover, within a time-scale which is acceptable to the court.</p>

Hitherto, contact has been taking place weekly, having been reduced from the twice-weekly contact that had been taking place prior to the hearing before the Justices. The local authority proposes that contact should be further reduced over the forthcoming weeks to fortnightly and then monthly. Miss Hudson makes the important point that this will not merely prepare K for the future, it will also give an opportunity to assess the response of the birth family to the plan of permanency actually being put into effect. The mother, bravely and wisely, recognises the wisdom of this and does not oppose the planned reduction in contact. I agree with the local authority&#8217;s proposals.</p>

I do not know how these errors have crept in. It is, I suppose, possible that the Panel was given the wrong information by the local authority, or that Panel misunderstood what it was being told, or that the minute-taker misunderstood matters. It does not really matter. The simple fact is that the minutes mis-record vital information. So long as they stand uncorrected, the minutes are a seemingly definitive source of potentially serious misunderstanding and confusion.</p>

First, it is obviously vital that the Panel&#8217;s seeming misunderstanding is corrected at the earliest opportunity. Otherwise there is real risk of a serious injustice being done to both K and her mother. It is properly accepted by the local authority that appropriate corrections should be spelt out in my order, a copy of which should be supplied to the Panel. I am minded to think, in the circumstances, that the Panel should also be supplied not merely with a copy of this judgment (something to which, as I understand it, no-one has any objection) but also with copies of the Justices&#8217; reasons (something which the mother would want but which the local authority does not favour). This latter point can be considered further, if need be, once everyone has had an opportunity to consider this judgment.

I appreciate that the Panel is independent of the local authority and that I have had only limited explanations of how the mistake seems to have been made, but it would seem that the fundamental cause of the problem is that Panel &#8211; I can only assume in accordance with its usual practice &#8211; obtained this information from what it was told by the local authority representative(s) and without the Panel itself being shown and looking at the relevant documents. (I note in passing that neither of these mistakes would probably have occurred if the Panel had been able to read the Justices&#8217; reasons. The Justices were critical of the local authority for having required all contact to be supervised, commenting that &#8220;As time progressed there was no evidence of this mother presenting a high level of risk to her daughter in the short time of an unsupervised contact visit&#8221;. And the Justices&#8217; reasons also recorded, accurately, that EL&#8217;s report had &#8220;contemplated [direct contact] as a possibility&#8221;.)</p>
