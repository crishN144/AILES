	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns the future of a baby girl CA who was born on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2012; the local authority contends that her future must be secured by adoption whereas the mother seeks her immediate return.  Within that a further issue has been raised as a result of the removal of CA from the mother on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February pursuant to the mother&#8217;s agreement having been obtained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  That has given rise to a claim by the mother and child against the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and to a detailed examination of the proper province of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> agreements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact the Court&#8217;s decision on the welfare issues was briefly communicated orally to the parties during the hearing, and the mother and the local authority resolved the issues under the Human Rights Act.  The only requirement to reserve judgment was the need to set out the Court&#8217;s views about the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> agreements and also for those to be seen by the President of the Family Division before judgment was handed down.  It follows that the drawing and implementation of the Order of the Court has not needed to await this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts in this case are not significantly in dispute between the mother and the local authority.  Thus it is possible to set out the background comparatively briefly although it will be necessary to deal in more detail with the events of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2012.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother was born on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1985 and is thus nearly 27.  Her family were known to social services and it is enough simply to say that she endured a disruptive childhood and adolescence which has left her not only vulnerable but devoid of parenting instinct or intuition.  That is to say that whilst she clearly loves her children and is committed to the concept of caring for them, and whilst she can often manage well in the context of supervised contact, she has no instinctive or intuitive feel for parenting nor any capacity for consistency.  If all that were not enough, she also has significant learning difficulties so that she struggles to learn what for most is intuitive.  It is important to stress that she has never harmed a child, has always tried to work co-operatively with others and has been entirely straight with the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a case which provides a vivid reminder that the joys and benefits of adoption felt on one side are acquired at a bitter price paid by another.  It is the more vivid where, as here, the one thing that everyone can agree on is that the mother fully feels the bitterness of that price and has never done or said anything deserving of it, however right such a decision may be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She has three previous children:  L (aged 3&#189;), CH (aged 2&#189;) and B (aged 18 months).  All those children are the subject of placement orders and have been placed for adoption.  L and CH have been placed together whilst CA has been placed with B&#8217;s prospective adopters and the local authority&#8217;s plan is that she should remain there permanently.  If CA cannot return to her, then the mother accepts that that is the best plan for her.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has had previous unhappy relationships with men though her present relationship (with a man P not the father of any of these children) promises better things.  It is, however, far too early to reach any conclusion:  he has family responsibilities of his own and an issue with substance abuse which is not yet resolved.  She has been the subject of psychological assessments, parenting assessments and (with CA&#8217;s father) a residential assessment at the Cassell Hospital with B.  The reports of each have been uniformly negative.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, although the reports have been negative, they have not been negative to the mother as a person.  In my judgment the mood of the assessments and the professional evidence is well caught by Mr. Nigel Sharratt, an independent social worker, who, in his conclusion to his report in this case, writes as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I have found this a very difficult report to write because I do like C and believe that I have a good working relationship with her.  P also has presented as being very amiable and co-operative but I have to put this aside and consider what is best for CA and I cannot recommend that she be placed in their care for all of the reasons outlined in this report.  What concerns me greatly however is how will C ever be allowed to parent a child unless she receives the input that is so desperately required?  Is this young woman effectively being written off as a parent for now and for evermore because if so she and P need to know.  C has obviously given thought to having a child with P but would this mean that proceedings commence again?  I understand a considerable amount of money has already been invested into C (and CA&#8217;s father) and in times when budgets are very tight decisions are made on the projected outcomes.  What I would like to see is some very practical input made into C with P, and utilise his strengths and experience to support her before the inevitable happens and she becomes pregnant again.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event the mother gave evidence which I much appreciated and my positive impression of her will, I hope, be apparent from the terms of this judgment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is now necessary to look at the events of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February.  Since the local authority and the mother have resolved the claim under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>, the parties took the view (which I accept) that no benefit would inure by a detailed investigation into the evidence of that day.  However, the evidence did not speak with one voice even within the local authority.  Accordingly what follows is a picture which, if not wholly accurate, is sufficient for the purposes of the case.  It does not contain any finding on any disputed matter within the authority.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There had of course been much pre-planning as the mother has never sought to conceal any pregnancy.  It had been decided by the local authority that the child would be removed before the mother was discharged from hospital.  The mother knew of that plan and had at the least demonstrated submission but not consent to it.  Accordingly, when she was admitted to hospital as an emergency, the local authority were duly notified.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That day this mother was confronted with three key decisions:  first, whether she would consent to life sustaining surgery; secondly, whether she would accept pain relief which included morphine (to which she thought she was allergic); and thirdly, whether she would consent to the accommodation of her child under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  She consented to the first, and the child was duly delivered during it, but initially refused the second; later in the day, no doubt because of pain levels, she consented to morphine.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That then provides the factual matrix within which this woman&#8217;s consent to accommodation was to be sought.  It should be said that the field social worker assumed that the child could stay in hospital for a day or two with the mother as indicated in the pre-birth plan.  She (who knew the mother well) obviously saw no harm in that and saw the obvious benefit to the mother.  That view, however, does not appear to have been shared by the senior management.  Their view (and it is a conventional view) was that the child should be accommodated as soon as the child was fit for discharge. As the child was born entirely healthy, she would have been fit for discharge later in the day, though of course the mother was not.  Hence, no doubt, the difference of view.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Hospital staff were clearly very concerned, given the mother&#8217;s condition, about the local authority&#8217;s plan to secure <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> agreement and voiced these concerns to the social worker.  It seems that she acknowledged those but believed herself instructed to try again later in the day.  Initially the mother, who had had significant surgical intervention, was unable to see the social worker.  When later she did, she refused consent.  Later still, and after finally accepting morphine, she was approached again.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On this occasion she was calmer and more comfortable and it appears that both hospital staff and social worker took the view she could deal with the matter.  There is no doubt that the social worker was encouraging her to agree;  when the mother phoned P and a friend, they too encouraged her to agree &#8211; so as to appear co-operative &#8211; and she did so and the child was removed.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What part, if any, did lawyers play in all this?  It is important to note that the solicitors both to the local authority and the mother were experienced and proficient in this area of law.  It appears that the local authority had sought legal advice earlier in the day but not after the mother had first been seen.  The mother&#8217;s solicitor, who of course knew of the plans, had been told of the mother&#8217;s admission to hospital.  She had repeatedly tried to contact the mother but was unable to do.  Entirely reasonably she concluded that the mother was not well enough to speak to her.  The mother certainly knew (as did the local authority) how to contact her.  She was not in fact contacted until after the actual accommodation.</p>

I am bound to say, however, that on the evidence I have set out, I would be surprised were she found to have been capacitous.  Let me say at once that I entirely accept that the social worker believed she had capacity, it is just that I seriously doubt the correctness of that judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Any consent must be properly informed.  In my view there were two aspects here which may have resulted in the consent not being properly informed.  The first is that the mother was never told that a continued refusal of consent would result in the child staying in hospital with her for another day or two.  Secondly, the mother was told that this was only a temporary arrangement; that was true as far as it went, though everyone else involved knew that it was highly unlikely to be anything of the sort.  In my view she should at least have been told that the local authority would oppose a return.  It is not material that either of these matters would in fact have almost certainly fortified her refusal: they were essential for the consent to be fully informed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not sure that the court can say much about fairness on the facts of this case in the light of the local authority&#8217;s concessions.  Clearly a social worker must have regard to the vulnerability of the parent, her previously expressed willingness or otherwise to consent, the magnitude of the decision and its consequences for the mother and the actual circumstances of the mother as and when consent is sought.  In this case the failure to encourage the mother to speak to her solicitor may also have affected fairness.  It is important to emphasise that whilst the mother should know the plan of the local authority, willingness to consent cannot be inferred from silence, submission or even acquiescence.   It is a positive stance.</p>
