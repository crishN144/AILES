	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30 May 2013, I determined an urgent application brought by way of Originating Summons under the inherent jurisdiction.  The application was made without formal notice having been given to the First and Second Respondents although, as will be apparent from the judgment below, the Second Respondent had informal notice of the application.  At that hearing, I made Declarations sought by the Applicant, CM.  The application had been supported by a statement from CM, and from her solicitor Mr Stewart Duffy; I also had available medical expert reports from Dr. S (Consultant Clinical Virologist) and Dr. K (Consultant Histopathologist).  I heard submissions from Mr James Berry, on behalf of CM.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the early evening of 25 May 2013, CM, a medical doctor, a consultant and professor at one of London&#8217;s principal teaching hospitals, was driving home, off duty, in South East London, when she saw a body lying motionless on the pavement.  Passers-by had stopped by the body.  CM parked her car, and attended the scene.  The body was of a woman (now known to be &#8220;EJ&#8221;); she had, it appears, fallen from a building nearby to where she lay.  It was obvious that EJ was seriously injured, and she had bled profusely.  CM performed emergency first aid on EJ, seeking to facilitate the possibility of her breathing by stabilising and clearing the neck and airways.  Paramedics were called.  Despite the efforts of CM and the paramedics, EJ died at the scene.  In the course of the resuscitative efforts, CM&#8217;s hands became covered with EJ&#8217;s blood.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When home, about an hour after first attending to the body, CM washed EJ&#8217;s blood from her hands; she then noticed that she had a number of abrasions on her hands (probably caused by the alcohol hand wash which she uses in her work).  Understandably anxious about the risk of being infected with a blood-borne disease from the deceased, CM sought, obtained, and commenced a course of prophylactic antiretroviral medication.  These drugs have significant and unpleasant short-term side-effects which, I am told, have left CM feeling extremely unwell (including myalgia, nausea, diarrhoea, and fever); these powerful drugs have the potential to cause long-term harm (including renal, liver and pancreatic dysfunction).</p>

This can be done by testing EJ&#8217;s blood or human tissue in an Enzyme Immuno Assay machine.  Were CM to contract any one of the named diseases it would inevitably have devastating implications for her life, quite apart from the impact on her eminent career in the medical profession.</p>

At present these relatives are (certainly at the time of the hearing on 30 May 2013, they were) unaware of EJ&#8217;s death, and for the reasons outlined in &#167;9 above, time is of the essence.  There is no indication on the papers before me that EJ has other relatives in the list of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;qualifying</span>&#8221; persons available from whom consent could be taken.  </p>

I am conscious of the need to be vigilant to the ethical considerations relevant to permitting the removal of body tissue for the purposes of testing for disease, particularly on behalf (and for the benefit) of a third party who was not known to the deceased.

While conscious that EJ herself has not been able to express a view about the issue before me, I bear in mind OP&#8217;s obviously sincere appreciation of CM for taking steps to attempt to save the life of EJ, and his wholehearted consent to this course.  I am conscious that if this testing were not to be undertaken, CM would live for the foreseeable future in a state of profoundly anxious uncertainty as whether she had contracted a serious, life-threatening illness.  This would doubtless affect not only her personal well-being, but also her ability to treat other patients in the context of her highly skilled profession.  I also bear in mind that CM herself is suffering the harmful side-effects of the antiretroviral medication.</p>
