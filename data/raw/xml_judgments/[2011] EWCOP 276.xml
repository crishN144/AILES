More recently, this initiative has been reflected in government publications emphasising the personalisation of care: see the White Papers <span style="font-style:italic">Valuing People</span> (2001), <span style="font-style:italic">Our Health, Our Care, Our Say </span>(2006) and <span style="font-style:italic">Valuing People Now </span>(2009), and the cross-governmental protocol <span style="font-style:italic">Putting People First </span>(2007).  </p>

In particular, there is unease at the presence on &#8216;health land&#8217; of those who are not receiving the active medical treatment which those who are compulsorily detained are presumed to be receiving.  Substantial funds have been given to health and local authorities to create local facilities to replace campuses.  A specific goal has been the closing of NHS campuses and the ending of &#8216;institutional care&#8217; by 2011.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While care in the community may not be without its problems, it is clear that many, perhaps most, of those resettled after lifetimes in long-stay hospitals have benefited.  However, it is not an absolute policy, still less is there anything unlawful about &#8216;campus living&#8217;.  See, for example the statement by the then Minister of State John Denham on 24 October 2000 (Hansard, HoC 24 October 2000: Column 199-200), which emphasised the importance of ensuring that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;any decisions are based on the overall best interest of the individual&#8217;, </span>and continued:</p>

We also acknowledge that small-scale domestic accommodation can often provide a high quality of care. Such accommodation can offer more potential for social inclusion and enhanced rights. However, as in any society, some people choose - for a variety of reasons - to live in alternative communities ...

In the light of individual assessments of each of the residents of the old hospital, the commissioning bodies concluded that a small group of residents (initially 25, but later increased to 33 as a result of failed moves into the community for some other residents) needed long term specialist care and had such complex behavioural problems and severe learning disabilities that a specialist service was required for them.

In May 1995, on the closure of Leavesden, he moved to Harperbury Hospital.  When that closed, he moved on to SRS in 2001.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A major limiting feature arises from Alan's Pica behaviour (the word derives from &#8216;magpie&#8217; and refers to eating inedible objects).  He is obsessed with cigarette butts, which he will seek out and eat.  This places him in situations of danger, for example by his dashing into the road to pick up butts or snatching a cigarette from someone's mouth or hand to place in his mouth. This is relatively easily managed at SRS, as there is a controlled environment where smoking is not allowed within the grounds.  However, whenever Alan is in a situation where cigarette butts may be found, he becomes highly aroused.  A habit that might be viewed with levity is in fact a major obstacle to his being able to go into the community, as cigarette butts are to be found everywhere on roads and pavements and Alan is expert at finding them.  The staff at SRS have succeeded in weaning other residents from obsessions of this kind, but Alan has been resistant and the only remedy is to keep him away from places where cigarettes are to be found.</p>

Alan's would have his own bedroom, wet bathroom, kitchen, living room and patio and personal access to a 150 foot garden.  She explained that the front of the building would be secured, probably with a wall.  Sensors would be in place so that individuals can have their own space but staff would be aware of their moving around.  She described the staffing arrangements, which would involve one-to-one attention to Alan and the opportunity to personalise his space and his routine.

It is understandable that Ealing should be upbeat about the prospects of a move for Alan.  Inevitably, the foundation of a service such as 376 Uxbridge Road requires energy, enthusiasm and proper professional optimism.  However, these issues have to be looked at realistically.  In considering whether increased opportunities would benefit Alan one has to consider a number of questions.  What is his capacity for greater achievement?  Can it be met where he is?  What would the significance of greater achievement be for Alan?  Would it make him happier and more fulfilled?  What are the risks involved?</p>

His obsession is such that he would snatch them from people&#8217;s mouths and put them in his own mouth, burning himself.  He has no traffic sense and would be at serious risk.  A vehicle would be needed at the front door as he could not walk about in the local area.

She pointed out that he cannot manage his own toileting needs and that the opportunity of more complicated tasks, for example in the kitchen, was problematic.  The idea that he could have free access to drinks was not realistic because he was never satisfied and endangers himself with hot liquids.  Greater community involvement was a noble ambition and she thought that Alan, who already has outings almost every day, might benefit from more outings.  He has absolutely no idea of having his own front door, nor does the concept of living on &#8216;health land&#8217; or &#8216;in the community&#8217; have any meaning for him.  </p>

An increase in spontaneity in daily activities is absolutely not in his interests.  Alan benefits from predictability, not spontaneity.  The minimising of change is the gold standard with people in Alan's position.  Change has in the past caused challenging behaviour and anxiety.  It could cause mental health problems, such as depression, which would be hard to detect, and might lead to Alan withdrawing.

She personally subscribed to the community care philosophy but felt that Alan&#8217;s needs were being met in a tried and tested way.  She thought that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we have to have very good reasons for bringing any anxiety to a service user&#8217;</span>.  She worried that a move to Uxbridge would in effect be taking him backwards as he would have to get into the bus at the doorstep, rather than be able to go for a walk as he currently can.</p>

She confessed that in comparison to others, Alan's rate of progress has been quite discouraging.  They had struggled to achieve more community involvement for him.  Greater attempts have been made in this direction since October 2010 against the background of this case, both to prepare Alan and others for a possible move and also because of the intrinsic benefits.  Ms O'Connor explained the way in which Alan is able to benefit from communal events.  She said that he prefers large spaces to small ones, large rooms to small rooms, and that he enjoys parks.</p>

He observed that Alan is very used to rural living and that the concept of moving into the city was not particularly appropriate for him.  Alan is settled and flourishing.  Contact with the &#8216;normal community&#8217; is not a particularly meaningful aspiration because of Alan's extensive childhood autism on top of his very severe learning difficulties.

Actually, SRS was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">more</span> suited to Alan than central London.  The plans and expectations were unrealistic and were setting Alan and his carers up to fail.  The ambition of Alan walking on local roads and visiting caf&#233;s was not realistic: he would be at risk on the road and in danger of assault by members of the public who objected to his behaviour.  Dr Thomas said that Alan is as well settled now as he has been at any time in his life, and with this plan <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we are not doing him any favours&#8217;.</span></p>

He has worked in the field of learning disability in hospital and community settings for over 30 years.  In his reports he firmly advises against moving Alan from SRS.  He described SRS as a unique facility, offering more than the sum of its parts.  It represented a synthesis of everything that has been learned about supporting people with incredibly complex needs who have lived in institutional care all their lives.  It has a stable staff group.  It feels like a private estate and not an institution or a hospital.  He supports Dr Thomas&#8217;s views.  </p>

He was particularly concerned about the loss of the current stable staff group, which in a sense is Alan&#8217;s surrogate family.  He was not confident that continuity of staff would be maintained, even with high-quality agency providers.  He also had significant concerns about the one-to-one model of care.  Looking after people like Alan is relentlessly challenging and you need relentless vigilance.  There is a risk of burnout.  Because of the lack of emotional feedback, the rewards of looking after those with childhood autism are different to those gained from looking after those with severe learning difficulties.  He also considered that Alan would be more vulnerable to influences from and changes in the other occupants of Uxbridge Road, and that this represented another large variable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the ambition to maximise Alan&#8217;s opportunities is laudable, it has not been possible to identify a single dependable benefit arising from the proposed move.  The thesis is that it would provide him with a greater experience of ordinary life in a local community, and that this would improve his quality of life.  Each element of this proposition is incongruous with the realities of Alan&#8217;s life.  His experience is so far from being ordinary that it is not useful to use ordinariness as a yardstick.  Ealing is not local for Alan and there is no community there which would be meaningful for him.  I also accept the evidence of the clinicians, the experts, and not least of Alan&#8217;s committed parents, that the prospect of him living a more expansive and fulfilled life following a move is a chimera.  It is more likely that it would lead to a deterioration from which he might &#8211; or might not &#8211; recover.  It is not enough to say that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the benefits of community living may matter to Alan&#8217;</span> if one cannot show that they will.  Facing up to these realities does not in any way diminish or demean Alan, but values and respects him for who he is.</p>

The very existence of SRS, after most of the institutional population had been resettled in the community, is perhaps the exception that proves this rule.  These residents are not an anomaly simply because they are among the few remaining recipients of this style of social care.  They might better be seen as a good example of the kind of personal planning that lies at the heart of the philosophy of care in the community.  Otherwise, an unintended consequence of national policy may be to sacrifice the interests of vulnerable and unusual people like Alan.</p>
